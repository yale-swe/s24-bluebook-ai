This course reconsiders the complex arguments and activities that have characterized the civil rights movement, thinking beyond the master narrative of Montgomery to Memphis, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. to understand Black agency, actions, and politics through historiography, documentary film, and art. Students read primary sources alongside secondary scholarship, focusing each week on an individual case study.\u00a0 Each week builds upon the past week to understand the civil rights movements in the United States, including in the urban North, the Midwest, and elsewhere. This course will answer the questions: did the Civil Rights Movement really just happen in the South? What was happening in other parts of the country? What made local movements similar or different? How can we use these movement histories to understand how we got to where we are today?\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

This course offers an introduction to the transnational history of education in relation to the development of U.S. empire both at home and abroad. By bringing together topics often approached separately -- immigration, education, race, colonialism, and the history of U.S. empire -- we will interrogate the ways that education has been mobilized to deploy power: controlling knowledge, categorizing and policing difference, administering unequal paths to citizenship/belonging, forcing assimilation, promoting socio-economic divides, and asserting discipline and control. Topics to be covered include American Indian education and self-determination, African American education in slavery and freedom, U.S. colonial education in the Philippines/Cuba/Puerto Rico, immigration and forced Americanization schooling, Latinx fights for educational access and autonomy, State Department experiments in educational diplomacy and child socialization, educational missions abroad, and national security and the war on terror. Throughout, we will draw links between the past and the present and ask what it might mean to \"decolonize\" education today.\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

How do they operate individually or collectively to shape contemporary inequities? This course investigates these questions and the diverse methodological and theoretical approaches that scholars have taken to highlight matters affecting Black people and racially-minoritized populations in the United States. Likewise, it examines how persisting inequities are observed and experienced in the domains of education, employment, population health, food access, housing, incarceration, and policing, among others.

This course reconsiders the complex arguments and activities that have characterized the civil rights movement, thinking beyond the master narrative of Montgomery to Memphis, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. to understand Black agency, actions, and politics through historiography, documentary film, and art. Students read primary sources alongside secondary scholarship, focusing each week on an individual case study.\u00a0 Each week builds upon the past week to understand the civil rights movements in the United States, including in the urban North, the Midwest, and elsewhere. This course will answer the questions: did the Civil Rights Movement really just happen in the South? What was happening in other parts of the country? What made local movements similar or different? How can we use these movement histories to understand how we got to where we are today?\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

        "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This course offers an introduction to the transnational history of education in relation to the development of U.S. empire both at home and abroad. By bringing together topics often approached separately -- immigration, education, race, colonialism, and the history of U.S. empire -- we will interrogate the ways that education has been mobilized to deploy power: controlling knowledge, categorizing and policing difference, administering unequal paths to citizenship/belonging, forcing assimilation, promoting socio-economic divides, and asserting discipline and control. Topics to be covered include American Indian education and self-determination, African American education in slavery and freedom, U.S. colonial education in the Philippines/Cuba/Puerto Rico, immigration and forced Americanization schooling, Latinx fights for educational access and autonomy, State Department experiments in educational diplomacy and child socialization, educational missions abroad, and national security and the war on terror. Throughout, we will draw links between the past and the present and ask what it might mean to \"decolonize\" education today.\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

In-person Course.\u00a0This course will take a hard, imaginative, speculative, and poetic look at U.S. history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries through the lens of film and video. In a time where we are awash with moving images in our environments on a daily, if not minute-by-minute basis, this course will be a space to meditate upon the sights, sounds, and texts around us.\u00a0 We will interrogate how we have been trained to read a moving image. We will place the image historically, aesthetically, politically. We will learn how to see history as a series of discontinuities, yet with unconscious repetitions, thematic overlaps, and eternal returns \u2014 not simply as a single thread of greatest hits and milestones moments. Topics will include: Empire, Language, Love (viz. the Screwball Comedy), Class, War and Empire, Politics, Communism, Ideology, Youth, Revolt, Postmodernity, the Network, and Memory. Periods and events covered include: The Black Freedom Struggle, The Jazz Age, the Great Depression, World War II, the Long 1960s, the U.S. failure in Vietnam, the Dot Com Boom and Silicon Valley, and contemporary activist/revolutionary movements. We will not consider the U.S. in isolation: films and discussions will inevitably take us to Latin America, to France, to Senegal, to Iran, and to the Soviet Union. We will have mandatory Monday night screenings as well; these will include moving-image work by Julie Dash, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Tashlin, Douglas Sirk, Barbara Loden, Jane Schoenbrun, Anthony Banua-Simon, Kevin Jerome Everson, Don Hertzfeldt, Vincente Minnelli, Chuck Jones, Michelangelo Antonioni, Abbas Kiarostami, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Da, Spike Lee, Walt Disney, Warren Beatty, Brian De Palma, Richard Lester, and Eric Andr\u00e9, among a host of others. This course seeks to expand students' knowledge of the history of film, of U.S. culture, and the society in which they exist. 1 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

In-person Course.\u00a0This course focuses on the nature of possible worlds: literary worlds (Narnia), ideological worlds (the world according to a particular political stance), psychological worlds (what someone remembers to be the case, wishes to be the case, or believes to be the case), environmental worlds (possible environmental futures), virtual worlds (the World of Warcraft), and\u2014most of all\u2014ethnographic works in which the actual and possible worlds of others are represented (the world according to the ancient Maya). We don\u2019t focus on the contents of such worlds per se, but rather on the range of resources people have for representing, regimenting, and residing in such worlds; and the roles such resources play in mediating social relations and cultural values. 1 Credit.

This summer course is an intensive, five-week immersion into the language of architectural representation and visualization, offering a shared inventory and basic framework upon which to build subsequent studies. Students are introduced to techniques and conventions for describing the space and substance of buildings and urban environments, including orthographic drawing, axonometric projection, perspective, architectural diagramming, vignette sketching, and physical modeling. Students work in freehand, hard-line, and digital formats. In parallel to the visualization portion of this course, an introduction to architectural history and theory focuses on principal turning points of thought and practice through to the eighteenth century.",

Enrollment subject to the permission of the instructors and satisfactory completion of all required preparatory course work.) This intensive five-week summer workshop takes place in Rome and is designed to provide a broad overview of that city\u2019s major architectural sites, topography, and systems of urban organization. Examples from antiquity to the present day are studied as part of the context of an ever-changing city with its sequence of layered accretions. The seminar examines historical continuity and change as well as the ways in which and the reasons why some elements and approaches were maintained over time and others abandoned. Hand drawing is used as a primary tool of discovery during explorations of buildings, landscapes, and gardens, both within and outside the city. Students devote the final week to an intensive independent analysis of a building or place. M.Arch. I students are eligible to enroll in this course after completing at least three terms. This course does not fulfill either the History and Theory or the Urbanism and Landscape elective requirements. All program travel plans will be made in accordance with University and national travel policies. Limited enrollment.",

        "description": "(Required of first-year M.Arch. I students, early summer.) This course examines the materialization of a building, whereby students are required to physically participate in the construction of a structure that they have designed. By engaging in the act of making, students are exposed to the material, procedural, and technical demands that shape architecture. Construction documents are generated and subsequently put to the test in the field. Students engage in collaboration with each other, and with a client, as they reconcile budgetary, scheduling, and labor constraints, and negotiate myriad regulatory, political, and community agencies. The course seeks to demonstrate the multiplicity of forces that come to influence the execution of an architectural intention, all the while fostering an architecture of social responsibility, providing structures for an underserved and marginalized segment of the community. For more information, see the section on the Building Project online at http://architecture.yale.edu/academics/building-project. Prerequisites: ARCH 1011, ARCH 1012.",

During an intensive monthlong residency in Gothenburg, Yale students learn and practice methods and techniques of urban analysis, including graphic and modeling approaches to understanding the interface between building form and typology and larger patterns of urban use and movement. Students live, travel, and work together as an integrated research team, contributing to a new Urban Atlas of North European cities. All program travel plans will be made in accordance with University and national travel policies. Limited enrollment.",

Using the rich collections held in London and beyond, students explore different approaches to collecting and display, shifting patterns of meaning, taste and value, and individual as well as institutional methods and motivations. Each week we discuss a different theme, introducing a wide range of primary sources, secondary literature, historical contexts, and geographical locations. Studying the history of collecting and display provides rich opportunities to deepen our understanding of both the British colonial period and the objects that are still in our care today. The course considers the many ways in which power was exerted, shaped, and contested through collecting and displaying non-European material culture. We also interrogate how well colonial collections actually represent the regions from which they were taken, and question how these collections, many of which have extremely sensitive biographies, should be used today. Guided collection visits in the world-class collections of the V&A, the British Museum reveal how modes of collecting, displaying, and knowing were deeply intertwined with British colonial power.",

From 1945 to the turn of the century, London has morphed from being the capital of an imperial superpower, to the heart of a fragile postwar social democracy, to its current position as the international headquarters of global finance. With these three epochs came new migrant populations, the rise and fall of state institutions, and a shifting urban landscape where the maligned urban planning of the welfare state was superseded by the luxury architecture of the free market. With a number of thematic seminars and London\u2019s unparalleled archives and galleries to search for evidence, Collecting Postwar London attempts to look for the people, places, and practices that define half a century of national history by looking at the specific and the marginal. The course also has a secondary focus on the relationships between collections and cultural institutions. Students visit several galleries and meet the curators working with collections bringing these stories to life for the public, which shape the mode of assessment for the course.",

If so, in different works, what kind of character is London (hero, lover, villain, annoying relative)? As writers, how can we create atmosphere? How can multisensory description bring the reader into our experience? Why do certain places stay with us? What does our relationship with a place say about us?\u00a0Students write three short personal essays on their own experiences of London (Food, Walk, and Night). Then they devote their time to profiling a Londoner found in the online Yellow Pages (Yell.com)\u2014for instance, the owner of a kebab shop, a seller of secondhand books, a hydrographic surveyor of the River Thames. Students critique and support each other\u2019s writing in a weekly workshop devoted to two essays.",

        "description": "Online Course. Mathematical modeling is not a scripted procedure. Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.\u00a0 The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life. Students from all majors are encouraged to take this course. 1 Credit. Session A: May 29 \u2013 June 30. Tuition: $4850. Technology Fee: $85.",

Rather than proceeding each week by covering a specific medium (music, movies, games), we proceed with specific themes/questions. Throughout the course, we learn a variety of critical tools for understanding Hallyu from a variety of perspectives\u2014aesthetics, historical, sociological, and anthropological. In tandem with our theoretical discussion, we closely look at various cultural instantiations in cinema, TV shows, music, games, and literature. Familiarity or fluency in an East Asian language is not required. As part of the course, we will also hear from guest lecturers including film directors and critics. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nProspective students should email the instructor (eugene.kwon@yale.edu) with basic background information that includes the following: (1) institutional affiliation, (2) reason for taking the course and main interests, (3) familiarity with academic reading and writing, (4) familiarity with Korean culture and history/language background, and (5) goals for the course. 1 Credit.

        "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. This course offers an introduction to the transnational history of education in relation to the development of U.S. empire both at home and abroad. By bringing together topics often approached separately -- immigration, education, race, colonialism, and the history of U.S. empire -- we will interrogate the ways that education has been mobilized to deploy power: controlling knowledge, categorizing and policing difference, administering unequal paths to citizenship/belonging, forcing assimilation, promoting socio-economic divides, and asserting discipline and control. Topics to be covered include American Indian education and self-determination, African American education in slavery and freedom, U.S. colonial education in the Philippines/Cuba/Puerto Rico, immigration and forced Americanization schooling, Latinx fights for educational access and autonomy, State Department experiments in educational diplomacy and child socialization, educational missions abroad, and national security and the war on terror. Throughout, we will draw links between the past and the present and ask what it might mean to \"decolonize\" education today.\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

        "description": "Online Course. This course serves as both an introduction to as well as an exploration of American literature from the nineteenth century to the present. We will ask many questions of these texts, not the least of which is \"what do we mean when we say \u2018American?\u2019\" Given the wide range of the body of work that comprises American literature, however, we will also periodically ask in passing what we mean by \"literature,\" so as to consider what roles the literary plays in creating and shaping the possibilities of social imagination, private and public discourse, as well as one\u2019s own identity. Emphasis on analytical reading, critical writing, and class discussions. Authors include Melville, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Dickinson, Barnes, Toomer, H. Crane, W. C. Williams, L. Hughes, and M. Robinson.\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850. Technology Fee: $85.",

The course poses these questions from diverse angles and emphasizes watching films from many traditions, places, and periods, in order to become articulate, reflexive, and voracious cinephiles well beyond the context of this class. Students study the history of filmmaking across the globe, with a heavy focus on films made beyond the global North-West, considering how films are made and distributed, who pays for them, and how they find local as well as global audiences. Course examines film history within the larger context of colonialism and globalization, thinking about what it means to watch world cinema from the specific vantage point of a Western, American university.\u00a01 Credit.

This course examines constitutional principles of due process and fair trial, and how bias influences the criminal justice system, focusing on wrongful convictions and the death penalty. Ethical considerations are a key component of the course. Iconic films demonstrate the issues presented. Topics include the efficacy of the death penalty, the causes of wrongful convictions, actual innocence, gender/race/economic bias and its effect on the justice system, and best practices for improving our sense of justice in the United States. This course explores the varying roles of the court, the prosecution and the defense in criminal cases, including analysis of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Students develop an understanding of conflicting views on the legitimacy of the death penalty and the systemic problems with instituting capital punishment, as well as best practices to prevent wrongful convictions.\u00a0For college students and beyond.\u00a0Enrollment limited to 20 students.\u00a01 Credit.

This course examines the influence of Eugenics research, logics, and ideas across nearly every academic discipline in the 20th century, and the particular masks, tropes, and concepts that have been used to occlude attentions to these legacies today. Students make special use of the large collection of archives held within Yale Special Collections of key figures in the American Eugenics Society. Students work collaboratively to identify alternative research practices and approaches deployed in scholarly and creative works that make racial power visible and enable the production of knowledge unburdened by the legacies of Eugenics and racial science. 1 Credit.

The course poses these questions from diverse angles and emphasizes watching films from many traditions, places, and periods, in order to become articulate, reflexive, and voracious cinephiles well beyond the context of this class. Students study the history of filmmaking across the globe, with a heavy focus on films made beyond the global North-West, considering how films are made and distributed, who pays for them, and how they find local as well as global audiences. Course examines film history within the larger context of colonialism and globalization, thinking about what it means to watch world cinema from the specific vantage point of a Western, American university.\u00a01 Credit.

        "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course.\u00a0This course will take a hard, imaginative, speculative, and poetic look at U.S. history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries through the lens of film and video. In a time where we are awash with moving images in our environments on a daily, if not minute-by-minute basis, this course will be a space to meditate upon the sights, sounds, and texts around us.\u00a0 We will interrogate how we have been trained to read a moving image. We will place the image historically, aesthetically, politically. We will learn how to see history as a series of discontinuities, yet with unconscious repetitions, thematic overlaps, and eternal returns \u2014 not simply as a single thread of greatest hits and milestones moments. Topics will include: Empire, Language, Love (viz. the Screwball Comedy), Class, War and Empire, Politics, Communism, Ideology, Youth, Revolt, Postmodernity, the Network, and Memory. Periods and events covered include: The Black Freedom Struggle, The Jazz Age, the Great Depression, World War II, the Long 1960s, the U.S. failure in Vietnam, the Dot Com Boom and Silicon Valley, and contemporary activist/revolutionary movements. We will not consider the U.S. in isolation: films and discussions will inevitably take us to Latin America, to France, to Senegal, to Iran, and to the Soviet Union. We will have mandatory Monday night screenings as well; these will include moving-image work by Julie Dash, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Tashlin, Douglas Sirk, Barbara Loden, Jane Schoenbrun, Anthony Banua-Simon, Kevin Jerome Everson, Don Hertzfeldt, Vincente Minnelli, Chuck Jones, Michelangelo Antonioni, Abbas Kiarostami, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Da, Spike Lee, Walt Disney, Warren Beatty, Brian De Palma, Richard Lester, and Eric Andr\u00e9, among a host of others. This course seeks to expand students' knowledge of the history of film, of U.S. culture, and the society in which they exist. 1 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

Rather than proceeding each week by covering a specific medium (music, movies, games), we proceed with specific themes/questions. Throughout the course, we learn a variety of critical tools for understanding Hallyu from a variety of perspectives\u2014aesthetics, historical, sociological, and anthropological. In tandem with our theoretical discussion, we closely look at various cultural instantiations in cinema, TV shows, music, games, and literature. Familiarity or fluency in an East Asian language is not required. As part of the course, we will also hear from guest lecturers including film directors and critics. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nProspective students should email the instructor (eugene.kwon@yale.edu) with basic background information that includes the following: (1) institutional affiliation, (2) reason for taking the course and main interests, (3) familiarity with academic reading and writing, (4) familiarity with Korean culture and history/language background, and (5) goals for the course. 1 Credit.

Beginning with the KGB\u2019s use of \"active measures\" during the Cold War, the course looks at how propaganda and disinformation campaigns became central to the Putin regime and how social media has facilitated their expansion and impact. Using Russia\u2019s efforts in the 2016 election as an example, students will examine how the First Amendment places limitations on the U.S.\u2019s ability to counter such operations in the United States and explore how strengthening critical thinking and American social capital might be effective prophylactics against these efforts.

This course reconsiders the complex arguments and activities that have characterized the civil rights movement, thinking beyond the master narrative of Montgomery to Memphis, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. to understand Black agency, actions, and politics through historiography, documentary film, and art. Students read primary sources alongside secondary scholarship, focusing each week on an individual case study.\u00a0 Each week builds upon the past week to understand the civil rights movements in the United States, including in the urban North, the Midwest, and elsewhere. This course will answer the questions: did the Civil Rights Movement really just happen in the South? What was happening in other parts of the country? What made local movements similar or different? How can we use these movement histories to understand how we got to where we are today?\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

        "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course.\u00a0This course will take a hard, imaginative, speculative, and poetic look at U.S. history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries through the lens of film and video. In a time where we are awash with moving images in our environments on a daily, if not minute-by-minute basis, this course will be a space to meditate upon the sights, sounds, and texts around us.\u00a0 We will interrogate how we have been trained to read a moving image. We will place the image historically, aesthetically, politically. We will learn how to see history as a series of discontinuities, yet with unconscious repetitions, thematic overlaps, and eternal returns \u2014 not simply as a single thread of greatest hits and milestones moments. Topics will include: Empire, Language, Love (viz. the Screwball Comedy), Class, War and Empire, Politics, Communism, Ideology, Youth, Revolt, Postmodernity, the Network, and Memory. Periods and events covered include: The Black Freedom Struggle, The Jazz Age, the Great Depression, World War II, the Long 1960s, the U.S. failure in Vietnam, the Dot Com Boom and Silicon Valley, and contemporary activist/revolutionary movements. We will not consider the U.S. in isolation: films and discussions will inevitably take us to Latin America, to France, to Senegal, to Iran, and to the Soviet Union. We will have mandatory Monday night screenings as well; these will include moving-image work by Julie Dash, Charlie Chaplin, Frank Tashlin, Douglas Sirk, Barbara Loden, Jane Schoenbrun, Anthony Banua-Simon, Kevin Jerome Everson, Don Hertzfeldt, Vincente Minnelli, Chuck Jones, Michelangelo Antonioni, Abbas Kiarostami, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Da, Spike Lee, Walt Disney, Warren Beatty, Brian De Palma, Richard Lester, and Eric Andr\u00e9, among a host of others. This course seeks to expand students' knowledge of the history of film, of U.S. culture, and the society in which they exist. 1 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

        "description": "Online Course. The peculiar nature of Portugal as a colonial power produced a very distinct history in the five Portuguese-speaking African countries, namely Angola, Guin\u00e9-Bissau (Guinea-Bissau), Mo\u00e7ambique (Mozambique), and the Atlantic islands of Cabo-Verde (Cape Verde) and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe. After a brief examination of Portuguese colonialism in the context of European expansion, the course explores the distinct history of Lusophone Africa in the long twentieth-century through the lens of culture and politics. Students consider Lusophone Africa as a study unit, dissecting its disparate societies, cultures, and political trajectories within the general context of Africa. Core themes include military conquest, colonial rule, race/lusotropicalism, culture and identity politics, nationalism, and liberation struggle. Course explores the multiple ways (cultural and political) that Africans responded to Portugal\u2019s encroachment, how they navigated the color bar that came to dictate their social mobility under colonial rule, and the multifaceted longings for self-determination that led to the longest and bloodiest liberation wars in Africa. Readings include scholarly essays, primary sources, literary works (poetry and short stories), photographs, music, and films.\u00a01 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.

These questions animate the human sciences. This seminar traces the arc of the human sciences since 1945, when tracing the scientific contours of the human became politically urgent. Each session in the course traces a different object of the human sciences\u2014e.g. sex, race, primates, blood, brains\u2014as they became salient for researchers seeking to get at the root of the human species. The course draws together developments in fields like primatology, cognitive science, genomics, human biology, demography, psychiatry, and neuroscience to understand the stakes behind claims to human nature and dreams of reengineering or liberation. Both of these impulses\u2014to understand and to transform\u2014are still with us. Technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, transcranial magnetic stimulation, hormone therapy, and nanomedicine today promise to remake our biology in the direction of our choosing. \u00a0The course draws on a range of material, including primary sources, historiography, and current events to develop a critical and informed view of the various scientific messages about human beings that surround us today. \u00a01 Credit.

These questions animate the human sciences. This seminar traces the arc of the human sciences since 1945, when tracing the scientific contours of the human became politically urgent. Each session in the course traces a different object of the human sciences\u2014e.g. sex, race, primates, blood, brains\u2014as they became salient for researchers seeking to get at the root of the human species. The course draws together developments in fields like primatology, cognitive science, genomics, human biology, demography, psychiatry, and neuroscience to understand the stakes behind claims to human nature and dreams of reengineering or liberation. Both of these impulses\u2014to understand and to transform\u2014are still with us. Technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, transcranial magnetic stimulation, hormone therapy, and nanomedicine today promise to remake our biology in the direction of our choosing. \u00a0The course draws on a range of material, including primary sources, historiography, and current events to develop a critical and informed view of the various scientific messages about human beings that surround us today. \u00a01 Credit.

This course examines the influence of Eugenics research, logics, and ideas across nearly every academic discipline in the 20th century, and the particular masks, tropes, and concepts that have been used to occlude attentions to these legacies today. Students make special use of the large collection of archives held within Yale Special Collections of key figures in the American Eugenics Society. Students work collaboratively to identify alternative research practices and approaches deployed in scholarly and creative works that make racial power visible and enable the production of knowledge unburdened by the legacies of Eugenics and racial science. 1 Credit.

How do we use these materials to reconstruct untold histories, to resurrect lost lives and their stories, and to study the making of cultural artefacts? This course offers a hands-on introduction to Yale\u2019s Special Collections through an investigation of personal archives (including letters, photographs, drawings, audio recordings, etc.), rare books (broadly defined\u2014including manuscripts, atlases, scrolls), and other ephemera that constitute the human record (clothes, playing cards, teeth, ceramics, among others). Students read foundational texts in critical archival studies and the history of the book, taking a wide-ranging, inclusive, and global approach-and put them in dialogue with materials from Yale\u2019s Special Collections. All classes meet at the Beinecke library. Students work with rare materials in each session while also developing a final project based on these materials. Enrollment limited to 10 students. 1 Credit. Session A: May 29-June 30. Tuition: $4850.",

We will focus our efforts on major authors and texts that define the modern medical humanities, with primary readings by Mikhail Bulgakov, Henry Marsh, Atul Gawande, and Lisa Sanders. Other topics will include the philosophy of science (with a focus on Karl Popper), rationalism and romanticism (William James), and epistemology and scientism (Wittgenstein).\u00a01 Credit.

        "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Trust involves a tension. On the one hand, we must build trust on the basis of its absence. On the other hand, trust is best built when a measure of it already exists between those who are trying to strengthen it. What is trust, such that violations of it yield a sense of betrayal rather than mere disappointment? What is the relation between epistemic and practical trust? When, if ever, is it rational to place one's trust in someone, some group or some thing \u2013 or to mistrust them? Can philosophers be proponents of the value of trust without ceding our role as critical, skeptical, even mistrustful thinkers? The topic has timely social and political implications. Liberal democracy depends upon citizens trusting that they share a common world and set of institutions enabling them to negotiate differences fairly. The aim of enemies of democracy is to sow doubts in the public so as to undermine trust in democratic institutions. This invites a consideration of phenomena such as polarization, epistemic bubbles, echo chambers, populism, conspiracy theories, \"truth decay,\" and even the idea of \"a post-truth culture.\" In the face of these challenges, how can we hope to rebuild trust in one another and democratic institutions? 1 Credit. Session B: July 3 \u2013 August 4. Tuition: $4850.",

Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must supply a 1- to 2- paragraph project description of the research to be undertaken, written in collaboration with the faculty advisor, including the proposed starting and ending dates. The student must also submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor must submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it.\u00a0 The report must include the grade (P/F).

How do we use these materials to reconstruct untold histories, to resurrect lost lives and their stories, and to study the making of cultural artefacts? This course offers a hands-on introduction to Yale\u2019s Special Collections through an investigation of personal archives (including letters, photographs, drawings, audio recordings, etc.), rare books (broadly defined\u2014including manuscripts, atlases, scrolls), and other ephemera that constitute the human record (clothes, playing cards, teeth, ceramics, among others). Students read foundational texts in critical archival studies and the history of the book, taking a wide-ranging, inclusive, and global approach-and put them in dialogue with materials from Yale\u2019s Special Collections. All classes meet at the Beinecke library. Students work with rare materials in each session while also developing a final project based on these materials.

Selected health and health disparities population-based data are examined as a foundation for explicating how subpopulations experience disparate health across the lifespan. Students examine how past and current policies (state, federal, tribal), politics, population-based data findings, and selected frameworks enhance or act as barriers to achieving health equity with diverse populations, systems, and/or communities.

        "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Trust involves a tension. On the one hand, we must build trust on the basis of its absence. On the other hand, trust is best built when a measure of it already exists between those who are trying to strengthen it. What is trust, such that violations of it yield a sense of betrayal rather than mere disappointment? What is the relation between epistemic and practical trust? When, if ever, is it rational to place one's trust in someone, some group or some thing \u2013 or to mistrust them? Can philosophers be proponents of the value of trust without ceding our role as critical, skeptical, even mistrustful thinkers? The topic has timely social and political implications. Liberal democracy depends upon citizens trusting that they share a common world and set of institutions enabling them to negotiate differences fairly. The aim of enemies of democracy is to sow doubts in the public so as to undermine trust in democratic institutions. This invites a consideration of phenomena such as polarization, epistemic bubbles, echo chambers, populism, conspiracy theories, \"truth decay,\" and even the idea of \"a post-truth culture.\" In the face of these challenges, how can we hope to rebuild trust in one another and democratic institutions? 1 Credit.

Where do/should constituents fit in in all this? How does Congress interact with the President and the bureaucracy? How does one run for office? Why is Congress\u2019s approval rating lower than any other institution in the country? The course is divided into two parts. In Part I, we discuss the theoretical and historical foundations of legislative government the United States.

Using Russia\u2019s efforts in the 2016 election as an example, students will examine how the First Amendment places limitations on the U.S.\u2019s ability to counter such operations in the United States and explore how strengthening critical thinking and American social capital might be effective prophylactics against these efforts.

        "description": "Course closed to further enrollment. In-person Course. Trust involves a tension. On the one hand, we must build trust on the basis of its absence. On the other hand, trust is best built when a measure of it already exists between those who are trying to strengthen it. What is trust, such that violations of it yield a sense of betrayal rather than mere disappointment? What is the relation between epistemic and practical trust? When, if ever, is it rational to place one's trust in someone, some group or some thing \u2013 or to mistrust them? Can philosophers be proponents of the value of trust without ceding our role as critical, skeptical, even mistrustful thinkers? The topic has timely social and political implications. Liberal democracy depends upon citizens trusting that they share a common world and set of institutions enabling them to negotiate differences fairly. The aim of enemies of democracy is to sow doubts in the public so as to undermine trust in democratic institutions. This invites a consideration of phenomena such as polarization, epistemic bubbles, echo chambers, populism, conspiracy theories, \"truth decay,\" and even the idea of \"a post-truth culture.\" In the face of these challenges, how can we hope to rebuild trust in one another and democratic institutions? 1 Credit.

The internship is guided by a learning covenant developed by the student in collaboration with the supervisor. In addition to performing typical internship responsibilities, each intern creates a unique major project that involves substantive research and is presented to other students in the advanced practicum.

        "description": "This program is open to students who have successfully completed a first internship either in ministry or nonprofit settings. The internship can be arranged as a second year at the same site or at a different site to provide another type of contextual experience. Like the first internship, the second, under the mentorship of a trained supervisor, is combined with a peer reflection group (practicum) facilitated by a practitioner, for a total of three hundred hours over the two terms. The internship is guided by a learning covenant developed by the student in collaboration with the supervisor. In addition to performing typical internship responsibilities, each intern creates a unique major project that involves substantive research and is presented to other students in the advanced practicum. The Part-time Internship with Advanced Practicum carries three credits for the summer and offers a student stipend.",

        "description": "In-person Course. Mixed/multi-identities have been part of U.S. history since the nation\u2019s birth, but the year 2020 marked only the third time in U.S. history that Americans were able to check more than one racial/ethnic category in the census. Today multiracial people in the US and other nations are gaining more visibility and recognition. With this visibility, however, comes inevitable scrutiny and ambivalence as evidenced by debates over the identity choices of high-profile multiracial people and the broader social and political implications of a growing social group. This course introduces students to contemporary discussions, debates and narratives surrounding multiracial people. By reading and discussing scholarly, literary, editorial, and visual texts, students critically examine the spaces multiracial people occupy in the U.S. and in other global contexts and explore the identity politics and perspectives that mark these experiences. Students also explore the growing narratives and spaces being created to build communities and express multi-subjectivities. Through class discussions, writing reflections, and a final project, students are encouraged to explore their own identities and subjectivities as they relate to larger discourses, current events, and narratives around race and intersecting identities.\u00a01 Credit.

Acting: Constructing A Character is a studio-based exploration of the internal and external preparation an actor must undergo in order to effectively render the moment-to-moment life of a given character. This course promotes a rigorous investigation of how the actor uses the self as the foundation for transformation. While rehearsing both monologues and scenes, the class employs a series of questions based on the work of Konstantin Stanislavsky to examine the technique of developing a character while addressing issues of social and historical context as well as physicality, rhythm, language, and inner emotional life. The class consists of close reading, research presentations, rehearsals, and the occasional performance of characters drawn from a selection of classic American plays. It may also include interviews with living people in an attempt to embody the physicality, rhythms, and interior emotional life of subjects the student identifies as worthy of investigation.\u00a0Enrollment limited to 8 students.\u00a01 Credit.

In 1970, Yale professors and sex therapists Linda and Philip Sarrel introduced what came to be their wildly popular lecture, \"Topics in Human Sexuality.\" The course, offered at the height of the sexual revolution and shortly after Yale University admitted women undergraduates, was multipurpose: to teach students about pressing, contemporary social problems around sex, gender, and sexuality; to help students learn about their bodies, sexualities, and relationships; to direct students to resources and information about their sexual and reproductive health; and to advance the mission of a liberal arts education, namely, the cultivation of well-rounded, critically engaged, curious, participatory young citizens.\u00a0\u00a0This iteration of the course is inspired by the Sarrels\u2019 ambitions and is offered in the spirit of a\u00a0critical sexuality education, critical as in 1) theory- rather than practicum-driven, but nonetheless 2) urgent.\u00a0\u00a0As political movements that endanger transgender children, suppress sexual expression, and rescind reproductive rights gain traction, the course offers candid, careful focus on abortion, sexual education, queer and trans kids, pornography, university sexual politics, hooking up, and breaking up.\u00a0\u00a0Course texts include the first season of\u00a0Netflix\u2019s \"Sex Education.\"\u00a01 Credit.
