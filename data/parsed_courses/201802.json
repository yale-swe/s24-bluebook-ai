        "description": "Since its invention in the 1890s, cinema has been closely linked to American history through its ability to reflect on and shape the course of current events. Films, as forms of mass entertainment, encapsulate the beliefs, values, struggles, and anxieties of both their audiences and creators. This course explores the ways in which films have critically engaged with the various cultural, social, technological, and economic issues that have defined the periods in history at which they were made. Students will learn to closely read a film while being attentive to the cultural implications surrounding its production and reception. The readings, screenings, and assignments will not only train students to learn how to deconstruct the artistic aspects of a film, but also broaden their understanding of American history. Historical periods and events to be discussed in class are Progressive Era politics, the Jazz Age, the Great Depression, the Second World War, Civil Rights, the Cold War, Vietnam, Reaganism, 9\/11, and the 2008 financial crisis. 1 Credit.

        "description": "This course is part of the IARU Global Summer Program. This course is open to Yale students and other IARU members only. The challenges of the 21st century in protecting the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage of the world are global in character and need to be also addressed on a global level. Cultural and natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions. For example, in the last years we have seen the phenomena of cultural cleansing rising in the Middle East and Africa, while natural disasters have taken a toll and underlined the need to develop sustainable and global strategies for preservation. This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex factors that challenge the preservation of cultural heritage. Guest speakers with relevant expertise will be invited to participate in many of the class sessions. In addition, the course will draw on the collections of the Yale University Museums for discussion and as the basis of student assignments. 1 Credit. Tuition $4,050. Session B: July 2 - August 3..",

        "description": "London is a city remade by its immigrants in the aftermath of British colonialism and World War II. This seminar surveys the changing London found in influential works of British fiction since 1945, with an emphasis on this immigrant energy, though students also consider contemporary imaginings of the iconic city of the past. Starting with the Trinidadian author Samuel Selvon\u2019s 1956 novel, The Lonely Londoners, stopping in 1970\u2019s London in Hanif Kureishi\u2019s The Buddha of Suburbia, detouring through the reimagined Tudor city of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall (we\u2019ll visit Hampton Court), and ending with Zadie Smith\u2019s NW, students discover how class, language, and ethnicity interact with London\u2019s longer political and social past. Students discover the multicultural city in real time, as well, with visits to a variety of neighborhoods and landmarks related to the novels. Field trips are framed by short readings about observing urban life and a portfolio of classic London scenes from across two centuries of literature. In-class instruction on writing builds technical skills and inspires students to rethink how to experience the city.",

In so doing, they created some of the highest achievements of English art. This broad survey course looks at ways of remembering, from the emergence of modern modes of public honour in the 17th century, to the assertive memorials of the Empire at its zenith under Queen Victoria. We go back to prehistory, look at the medieval cult of death, and bring the story up to date with the issues of memorials to women. And we consider how modern values are starting to question the monuments of yesteryear, and ask questions of how we engage with the tributes of distant generations.",

It is also an agent of cultural definition and change and the site of ongoing explorations of personal and social identities. The public nature of theatrical performance, and its history of engagement with the city and its shifting populations, makes theatre a unique site and subject of study. Taking advantage of plays and performances in London in a variety of venues and formats, this course examines theatre and drama as aesthetic objects, social events, and cultural practices. It introduces methods for reading plays and reading performances, and investigates the various uses and functions that theatre serves within the contemporary cultural scene. As an introduction to the study of drama in performance this course presents key methodological questions and approaches for interrogating dramatic and theatrical performances, and encourages personal exploration of how theater functions and how meaning is created.",

The curriculum develops through a substantive theoretical component and a practical component, with on-site modules at the International Court of Commercial Arbitration in Paris. This course takes the existing institutions of trade and contract law seriously - students will, for instance, develop familiarity with everyday trading practices and basic legal rules of exchange - and then asks whether and how they facilitate efficient trade. A principal topic of the course will be contractual solutions to the hold-up problem. Starting from seminal articles in the bilateral trade literature and the literature on breach remedies, the course will introduce students to the most recent developments of the field. Prerequisite: ECON 121 (Intermediate Microeconomics), MATH 112 (Calculus of Functions of One Variable I), or permission of instructor. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application Deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Paris and all other expenses beyond tuition. For further details visit the program page on the Study Abroad website. Credits: 2. Tuition: $7,900. Course Dates: June 25 - July 27.",

Emphasis on analytical reading, critical writing, and class discussions. Authors include Melville, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Dickinson, Barnes, Toomer, H. Crane, W. C. Williams, L. Hughes, and M.

How might a regionalist sensibility manifest itself in narrative? In what ways do varying geographies \u2013 of New England, the South, the West \u2013 register in cultural texts, and in what ways do their respective literatures differ from one another? What exactly is \"local color,\" and how is it presented \u2013 and preserved \u2013 textually? We will study the emergence of \"regionalism\" through texts from the height of the regionalist movement and will also consider whether regionalism can be considered a contemporary (or continuous) American literary phenomenon. Authors include Robert Frost, Mark Twain, William Faulkner, and Willa Cather. Enrollment limited to 15 students. Credit: 1. Tuition: $4050. Session B: July 2 - August 3.",

        "description": "Offered in Auvillar, France. There are only two plots in all of literature, claimed the late John Gardner: the story of a journey, and of a stranger coming to town. Most travel literature is both: the story of a journey as well as a tale of a stranger, stepping into an alien land. This course examines a wide range of place-based literature, from long-form city portraits to travel memoir excerpts. Readings by writers such as Ryszard Kapuscinski, Jan Morris, Leslie Jamison, and Pico Iyer will acquaint students with the techniques by which journalists and writers capture the essential qualities of a place. All instruction is in English. Enrollment limited. Application Deadline: February 15. Students are responsible for arranging travel to and from Auvillar and any other expenses beyond tuition. For further details visit the program page on the Study Abroad website. Credits: 2 . Tuition: $7,900. Course Dates: May 28 - June 29.",

        "description": "Since its invention in the 1890s, cinema has been closely linked to American history through its ability to reflect on and shape the course of current events. Films, as forms of mass entertainment, encapsulate the beliefs, values, struggles, and anxieties of both their audiences and creators. This course explores the ways in which films have critically engaged with the various cultural, social, technological, and economic issues that have defined the periods in history at which they were made. Students will learn to closely read a film while being attentive to the cultural implications surrounding its production and reception. The readings, screenings, and assignments will not only train students to learn how to deconstruct the artistic aspects of a film, but also broaden their understanding of American history. Historical periods and events to be discussed in class are Progressive Era politics, the Jazz Age, the Great Depression, the Second World War, Civil Rights, the Cold War, Vietnam, Reaganism, 9\/11, and the 2008 financial crisis. 1 Credit.

The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, who should also supply a 1- or 2-paragraph description of the research to be undertaken including the proposed starting and ending dates, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor should submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it. These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based, and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,200. Session A: May 27 - June 28 \/ Session B: July 1 - August 2",

This interdisciplinary course considers the major trends, influential artists, and disparate influences affecting American expressive culture through time. More broadly, vernacular music is used as a vehicle for understanding the intersections of tradition, ethnicity, technology, geography, culture and politics in the United States. In addition to highlighting musicians, the seminar contextualizes vernacular genres by mapping the cradles of American music\u2014New Orleans, the Mississippi Delta, Memphis, the American Piedmont, etc\u2014in addition to commercial hubs including New York, Detroit, Nashville, and Chicago.

What exactly is \"local color,\" and how is it presented \u2013 and preserved \u2013 textually?
