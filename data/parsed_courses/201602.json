The course is open to Yale students and other IARU members only. Memory powerfully shapes our understanding of our lives. In this course, we will examine how photographic images equally powerfully shape our memory. We will read some of the key concepts of several thinkers who have taken individual and collective memory as their subject, such as Jacques Derrida, Benedict Anderson, Maurice Halbwachs and Marianne Hirsch. Additionally, we will study some of the great writers on photography, such as Susan Sontag, John Berger, Walter Benjamin, Allan Sekula and Roland Barthes. At the same time we will also explore what we can learn about memory from photographs, digital photographs, and photographic memorials, from the 1830s to the present. These photographs can be anonymous or famous, historical or recent. Our interest will not be simply in what makes them great images, but also in what makes them greatly influential in our lives. We will have class discussions as well as lectures, and students will be expected to bring photographs to share with the class. There will also be two field trips to photographic galleries in Beijing. For further information visit the Study Abroad program page. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,750. Course dates: July 4 - July 29.",

The challenges of the 21st century in protecting the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage of the world are global in character and need to be also addressed on a global level. Cultural and natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions. For example, in the last years we have seen the phenomena of cultural cleansing rising in the Middle East and Africa, while natural disasters have taken a toll and underlined the need to develop sustainable and global strategies for preservation. This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex factors that challenge the preservation of cultural heritage. Guest speakers with relevant expertise will be invited to participate in many of the class sessions. In addition, the course will draw on the collections of the Yale University Museums for discussion and as the basis of student assignments. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,750. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

        "description": "This course explores historical and contemporary movements of people, goods, money, and imaginaries that have shaped the region of Asia. Based on central concerns of anthropology with culture, history, and power, we will approach \"markets\" and \"capital\" as meaningful processes of identity and place making. From early trading empires to present-day cosmopolitan hubs, we will examine commodity and financial flows, urbanization and globalization, consumer desires and popular cultures, with as much appreciation for difference as similarity across the Asian region and beyond. Case studies include the stock exchange in Shanghai, the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, clothing marketplace in Ho Chi Minh City, sexual commerce in Mumbai, and city branding of Dubai. 1 Credit.

Southeast Asia in Context is a five-week thematically based exploration of Southeast Asia's geographical and cultural diversity, which takes advantage of Singapore's position and character as a microcosm of this diversity. Blending classroom instruction on NUS Kent Ridge campus with hands-on fieldwork in Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand, SEA in Context offers modules on Southeast Asia with anthropological, historical and archaeological concentrations. The core module, \"SE2222: Southeast Asia In Context\" provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia from a historical, sociological and anthropological perspective. Its partner module, \"SE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic\", will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture, and features a 10-day field trip to various religious, cultural and archaeological sites in Cambodia and Thailand. Both modules deploy 'context-based' learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited.

        "description": "This course will focus on the history of gardens, landscape parks, and the architecture of country houses in Great Britain from 1500 to 1750. During this period Britain experienced significant political, economic, and social change. Absolutist monarchical rule gave way after the English Civil War ( 1642-1651 ) and the Glorious Revolution,\n\u00a0( 1668 ), to a constitutional monarchy subordinate to parliamentary government controlled in large part by the landed gentry. Centuries-old customs of landowners sharing common ground for grazing rights with local farmers, known as the open-field system, and respecting the boundaries of contiguous small farms gave way with the implementation of the Enclosure Acts, which allowed the landed gentry and landed aristocracy to remove villages, buy out contiguous farms, and annex commons to empark their estates. And the landed aristocracy in their country estates established seats of power which they made manifest in the design, scale, and expense of their gardens and the architecture of their houses.\nAfter nearly two centuries (1500 to 1700) of adopting Italian, French, and Dutch principles of landscape design in garden design, Britain, emerging in the late seventeenth century as the leading imperial power in Europe, gradually developed its own ideas of what a garden or park could be, how it should be laid out architecturally, and what its relationship to the country house would be. In the process Britain transformed landscape and country house architectural history and established itself as the preeminent force of design in Western Europe by the middle of the eighteenth century.",

The focus will be on elements common to all storytelling, among them, character, narrative development, voice, and clarity of language and thought. Students may concentrate on a single genre, or, if they wish, experiment with both. Readings will include selections from contemporary American fiction and creative nonfiction. A brief writing sample in the course subject area is required and should be submitted with the online application. Enrollment limited to 15. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,750. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

(The Signet edition, ordered through The Yale Bookstore, is preferred, but the Norton genre volumes are especially handsome substitutions; the Arden single play editions are more than acceptable if their price is not intimidating.)

The social, cultural, and technological aspects of book publishing, production, and distribution from the fifteenth century to the present. Emphasis on three critical eras and technologies: the Renaissance and the hand-press book, the nineteenth century and the rise of mechanized printing and mass distribution, and the current digital age, when long-held assumptions about books, publishing, and reading will be examined and far-reaching questions about literacy, distribution, global access and equity, and even cognitive science discussed. The course is taught as a seminar through a series of firsthand encounters with manuscripts, rare books, prints, and other primary sources, from the medieval period through the present day. In addition, several class meetings will take place in other Yale collections that contain objects related to our study of the book as an instrument and agent of social change. 1 Credit.

What has been the impact of increasing social diversity on forms of social control, crime, and criminal justice policy? This seminar explores these questions by examining the intersection of multiculturalism, crime, and the criminal justice system. Students will be introduced to major, relevant criminological and sociological concepts, theories, and debates. Class discussions will address contemporary social problems such as racial profiling, disproportionate punishment, mass incarceration, and unequal justice. Examples draw principally from the American but also from the British context, providing a comparative perspective. 1 Credit. Tuition: $3,750. Session A: May 30 - July 1.",
