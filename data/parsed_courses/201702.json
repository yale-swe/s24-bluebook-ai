The challenges of the 21st century in protecting the tangible and intangible, cultural and natural heritage of the world are global in character and need to be also addressed on a global level. Cultural and natural heritage are increasingly threatened with destruction not only by the traditional causes of decay, but also by changing social and economic conditions. For example, in the last years we have seen the phenomena of cultural cleansing rising in the Middle East and Africa, while natural disasters have taken a toll and underlined the need to develop sustainable and global strategies for preservation. This course offers an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the complex factors that challenge the preservation of cultural heritage. Guest speakers with relevant expertise will be invited to participate in many of the class sessions. In addition, the course will draw on the collections of the Yale University Museums for discussion and as the basis of student assignments. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,900. Session B: July 3 - August 4.",

        "description": "Offered in Singapore. This course is part of the International Alliance of Research Universities' Global Summer Program. Southeast Asia in Context is a five-week exploration of Southeast Asia\u2019s geographical, historical and cultural diversity. This course takes advantage of Singapore\u2019s strategic position in offering a unique blend of classroom instruction at the NUS campus with hands-on fieldwork in other SE Asian countries. The lecturers are experienced teachers and researchers of Southeast Asia, who will explore themes such as Southeast Asian religion, archaeology, rural development, politics and regional integration. The field trip includes visits to magnificent ancient temples, rural agricultural communities, war memorials and a fair sampling of local village life that is well off the usual tourist track. Participants study two modules (choose 2 out of 3 elective modules) on Southeast Asian Studies with an anthropological and historical concentration. The first elective module, \"SE2222: Southeast Asia In Context\" provides a broad overview of Southeast Asia. The other two elective modules, \"SE2880A: Southeast Asia's Cultural Mosaic\" and \"SE3214: Marketing Southeast Asia\u2019s Heritage\", will equip students with the analytical tools for the comparative study of society and culture. SE2880A features a 7 to 9-day field trip to various religious and cultural sites in Indonesia while SE3214 will bring students to various field trips in Singapore. All three modules deploy 'context-based' learning by combining in-class instruction at NUS campus with local and regional hands-on experience of Southeast Asian life. Students are responsible for all travel expenses to and from Singapore, costs of room and board, and all other expenses beyond tuition. Application deadline: February 15. Enrollment limited. For further information visit the Study Abroad program page. 1 Yale Credit and 1 NUS Credit. Tuition: $4,810. Course dates: June 17 - July 22.",

We will ask many questions of these texts, not the least of which is \"what do we mean when we say \u2018American?\u2019\" Given the wide range of the body of work that comprises American literature, however, we will also periodically ask in passing what we mean by \"literature,\" so as to consider what roles the literary plays in creating and shaping the possibilities of social imagination, private and public discourse, as well as one\u2019s own identity. Emphasis on analytical reading, critical writing, and class discussions. Authors include Melville, Poe, Hawthorne, Whitman, Dickinson, Barnes, Toomer, H. Crane, W. C. Williams, L. Hughes, and M.

The internship experience sometimes serves as a basis for the M.P.H. thesis. The internship is displayed on the transcript with a grade of \"S\" (Satisfactory) upon completion. A course unit is not given for the summer internship. All students, with the exception of those in the Advanced Professional M.P.H. Program and the Accelerated M.B.A.\/M.P.H.

This clinical course builds upon the experiences gained in 556b and provides students further opportunity to develop advanced nursing skills, clinical judgment, and evidence-based patient management strategies necessary to manage common acute and chronic health care conditions. Students participate in designated weekly primary care clinical experiences arranged by faculty. In addition, students meet weekly for a one-and-one-half-hour clinical conference that is held concurrently with clinical practice. Clinical seminar discussions for family nurse practitioner students focus on family-centered care and providing care for patients across the life span. Clinical seminar discussions for all other students focus on providing patient-centered care for patients from adolescence to senescence. Clinical conference serves as a forum for students to present and discuss cases and explore issues encountered in clinical practice. Required of adult\/gerontology primary care and family nurse practitioner students in the final year. Taken concurrently with 757a\/b and, for family nurse practitioners, with 833a\/b. Eight to sixteen hours of clinical practice per week (fifteen weeks), and one and one-half hours of clinical conference per week (each term).",

Explores the cultural history of the imperial Russian capital, founded by Peter the Great in the early eighteenth century as a window on Europe.

This seminar will trace the advent of dramatic naturalism and realism, the contrary movement toward expressionist urgency and symbolist subtlety, the efforts of socially-engaged playwrights to respond to history and contemporary politics, and the opening of drama to the ambiguities of religion and philosophy. Plays and other writings by Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Anton Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw, Bertolt Brecht, and Samuel Beckett. 1 Credit. Tuition $3,900. Session B: July 3 - August 4.",
