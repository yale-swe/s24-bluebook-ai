Students are introduced to techniques and conventions for describing the space and substance of buildings and urban environments, including orthographic drawing, axonometric projection, perspective, architectural diagramming, vignette sketching, and physical modeling. Students work in freehand, hard-line, and digital formats. In parallel to the visualization portion of this course, an introduction to architectural history and theory focuses on principal turning points of thought and practice through to the eighteenth century.",

This course examines the materialization of a building, whereby students are required to physically participate in the construction of a structure that they have designed. By engaging in the act of making, students are exposed to the material, procedural, and technical demands that shape architecture. Construction documents are generated and subsequently put to the test in the field. Students engage in collaboration with each other, and with a client, as they reconcile budgetary, scheduling, and labor constraints, and negotiate myriad regulatory, political, and community agencies. The course seeks to demonstrate the multiplicity of forces that come to influence the execution of an architectural intention, all the while fostering an architecture of social responsibility, providing structures for an underserved and marginalized segment of the community.

During an intensive monthlong residency in Gothenburg, Yale students learn and practice methods and techniques of urban analysis, including graphic and modeling approaches to understanding the interface between building form and typology and larger patterns of urban use and movement.

Students are given instruction in the Yale School of Art\u2019s Print Shop on various printing and binding methods leading to the production of their own publications both individually and in collaboration. Attention is paid to ways artists\u2019 publishing has been used to bypass traditional cultural and institutional gatekeepers, to foster community and activism, to increase visibility and representation, and to distribute independent ideas and narratives. Students explore the codex as it relates to contemporary concepts of labor, economics, archives, media forms, information technologies, as well as interdisciplinary and social art practices. Supplemental readings and visits to the Haas Arts Library, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, YUAG\u2019s prints and drawings study room, and the Odds and Ends Art Book Fair provide case studies and key examples for consideration.\u00a0 Tuition: $4,650.

        "description": "Focussing on the representation of the sea, this course considers the complex relationship between art and the British Empire over a broad chronological period. Examining a wide range of artistic genres and media, including marine painting, portraiture, monumental sculpture, architecture, and the decorative arts, we see how maritime imagery was appropriated in Britain to symbolise royal power, individual prestige, and national identity. We also explore the ways in which artists such as Joshua Reynolds and J.M.W. Turner exploited Britain\u2019s maritime interests to develop new creative possibilities. The cultural geography of London lies at the heart of the course. By visiting key sites such as Greenwich and Trafalgar Square, we see first-hand how maritime iconography was woven into the physical and ceremonial fabric of Britain\u2019s capital.\u00a0The course begins with Britain\u2019s emergence as a maritime power in the late Tudor era and traces the development of naval supremacy, transatlantic slavery, and colonialism across the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Throughout the course, we consider twenty-first-century responses to the nation\u2019s maritime heritage at a time when protesters are challenging the presence of imperialist artworks in today\u2019s urban landscapes.",

In this course, students read and discuss writing on music by British and Commonwealth scholars and critics (e.g., Simon Frith and Dick Hebdige), journalists (Julie Burchill and Caitlin Moran), and even a novelist or two (Nick Hornby and Zadie Smith)\u2013as well as a few Americans. They also attend multiple musical performances, including some musical theater; visit London exhibits, neighborhoods, and sites important in the history of British pop, rock, and reggae; and travel by train to Liverpool. The focus is on Anglo-American popular music of the past half-century-plus, and among the concepts to be investigated are style and taste. Written assignments include a critical review of a performance, a feature article, a literary essay on a musical topic, and an academic paper. The goal of the course is for students to improve their skills at observation, description, and analysis of culture.",

Models are constrained by physical principles, including conservation laws and experimental observations but this does not provide a closed description. There is a lot more art in mathematical modeling than is commonly acknowledged and improvisation plays a significant role.\u00a0 The artistic aspects are important and intellectually engaging because they often lead to a deeper understanding. This course provides a general introduction to engineering analysis and to chemical engineering principles. Material includes the derivation of governing equations from first principles and the analysis of these equations, including underlying assumptions, degrees of freedom, dimensional analysis, scaling arguments, and approximation techniques. The goal of this course is to obtain the necessary skills for improvising mathematical models for a broad range of problems that arise in engineering, science and everyday life.

Conscious experience is at once both completely familiar and utterly mysterious: how is it that electrical activity in a lump of grey matter \u2013 the brain \u2013 gives rise to the Technicolor phenomenology of our conscious experience? If human beings are just biological machines, then how is it possible that we have a subjective point of view on the world? Why are we not just mindless robots, that produce behavior in light of stimulations from the environment, but lack any inner awareness or consciousness? In this class we will read, and bring together in conversation, cutting edge work from philosophy, psychology, and the neurosciences on the nature of consciousness. No background in philosophy or cognitive science is expected. 1 Credit. Technology Fee: $85. Tuition: $4,650. Session B: July 4 - August 5.",

        "description": "Course cancelled.\u00a0In-person Course. This reading-intensive course takes on a comparative and global perspective in approaching the phenomenon of Hallyu, or the Korean Cultural Wave. Rather than proceeding each week by covering a specific medium (music, movies, games), we proceed with specific themes tied to questions. In approaching Hallyu, we first interrogate some of the most basic concepts related to it. What is culture, and what is media? What does it mean to study \u2018East Asia\u2019 or \u2018Hallyu\u2019 at from afar? Rather than \u2018studying\u2019 either of these constructs (\u2018East Asia,\u2019 \u2018Hallyu\u2019) as a cluster of nation-states or a reified cultural terrain to be mastered\u2014both of which reflect a Cold War legacy that has become problematized\u2014we will approach them as nodes through which we interrogate urgent problems of representation, globalization, capitalism, and nationalism. Throughout the course, we learn a variety of critical tools for understanding Hallyu from a variety of perspectives\u2014aesthetics, historical, sociological, and anthropological. In tandem with our theoretical discussion, we closely look at various cultural instantiations in cinema, TV shows, music, games, and literature. Familiarity or fluency in an East Asian language is not required. Students who are fluent in Korean are encouraged to read in the original language, especially the two novels included in the course.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProspective students should email the instructor (eugene.kwon@yale.edu) as soon as possible\u2014by no later than June 9\u2014with basic background information that includes the following: (1) institutional affiliation, (2) reason for taking the course and main interests, (3) familiarity with academic reading and writing, (4) familiarity with Korean culture and history\/language background, and (5) goals for the course. 1 Credit.

Themes discussed during this course will include actual innocence, gender\/race\/economic bias and its effects on criminal justice, and best practices for improving our system of criminal justice.

Beginning with the ruptures of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and European colonialism in Africa, this course traces major intellectual currents and liberation movements in the history of Black radicalism in Africa and the African diaspora. It proceeds by foregrounding the multiplicities of Blackness as a lived experience and political identity. Moving between local, hemispheric, and global perspectives, the course will explore the social and political contexts in which African and Afro-diasporic movements developed, and the ways in which they negotiated structures of racial\/colonial power. By means of readings and discussion, we will consider a range of movements and ideas, including African anti-colonialism, slave revolts in the Americas, Black Reconstruction, the U.S. Black Freedom Movement, Black feminism, and Third Worldism, among others.\u00a01 Credit.

        "description": "Course cancelled.\u00a0In-person Course. This reading-intensive course takes on a comparative and global perspective in approaching the phenomenon of Hallyu, or the Korean Cultural Wave. Rather than proceeding each week by covering a specific medium (music, movies, games), we proceed with specific themes tied to questions. In approaching Hallyu, we first interrogate some of the most basic concepts related to it. What is culture, and what is media? What does it mean to study \u2018East Asia\u2019 or \u2018Hallyu\u2019 at from afar? Rather than \u2018studying\u2019 either of these constructs (\u2018East Asia,\u2019 \u2018Hallyu\u2019) as a cluster of nation-states or a reified cultural terrain to be mastered\u2014both of which reflect a Cold War legacy that has become problematized\u2014we will approach them as nodes through which we interrogate urgent problems of representation, globalization, capitalism, and nationalism. Throughout the course, we learn a variety of critical tools for understanding Hallyu from a variety of perspectives\u2014aesthetics, historical, sociological, and anthropological. In tandem with our theoretical discussion, we closely look at various cultural instantiations in cinema, TV shows, music, games, and literature. Familiarity or fluency in an East Asian language is not required. Students who are fluent in Korean are encouraged to read in the original language, especially the two novels included in the course.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProspective students should email the instructor (eugene.kwon@yale.edu) as soon as possible\u2014by no later than June 9\u2014with basic background information that includes the following: (1) institutional affiliation, (2) reason for taking the course and main interests, (3) familiarity with academic reading and writing, (4) familiarity with Korean culture and history\/language background, and (5) goals for the course. 1 Credit.

Digital media has absorbed television into a broader category of serialized content that is now intermediated by all manners of consumptive platforms and delivery systems.

This course explores the evolution of information warfare as a national security threat to the United States. Beginning with the KGB\u2019s use of \"active measures\" during the Cold War, the course looks at how propaganda and disinformation campaigns became central to the Putin regime and how social media has facilitated their expansion and impact. Using Russia\u2019s efforts in the 2016 election as an example, students will examine how the First Amendment places limitations on the U.S.\u2019s ability to counter such operations in the United States and explore how strengthening critical thinking and American social capital might be effective prophylactics against these efforts. Enrollment limited to 20 students. 1 Credit. Technology fee: $85. Tuition: $4,650. Session A: May 30 - July 1.",

        "description": "Course cancelled. This course will explore the world of William Blake\u2019s poetry, with an emphasis on the longer prophetic poems, in conversation with his artistic output. We will locate Blake in his historical moment, responding in his poetry and art to a variety of political, philosophical, and aesthetic movements in England and elsewhere. We will also see Blake as part of an evolving literary tradition, paying particular attention to his relationship with his poetic precursor John Milton, and to Romantic contemporaries such as William Wordsworth. Trips to the Beinecke Library and the Yale Center for British Art will allow us to see firsthand and to think deeply about the materiality of Blake\u2019s works, as well as the complex relationships in them between text and image. Finally, we will consider Blake as a radical religious thinker and innovator by analyzing his poetry\u2019s connections to modes of Biblical vision, prophecy, and apocalypse.\u00a01 Credit.

May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must supply a 1- to 2- paragraph project description of the research to be undertaken, written in collaboration with the faculty advisor, including the proposed starting and ending dates. The student must also submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor must submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it.\u00a0 The report must include the grade (P\/F). These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. Deadlines for submitting all materials:\u00a0 Session A by April 26 and Session B by May 31. YSS applications are due: Session A by May 4 and Session B by June 8. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,650. Offered in Session A: May 30 - July 1 (CRN 30096) and Session B: July 4 - August 5 (CRN 30097).",

        "description": "In-person or remote course. May be arranged for currently enrolled Yale students only. Must be taken pass\/fail. May not be taken as part of a senior project or be deemed to be constituent of the senior requirement. Independent Research in the Summer consists of special projects set up by the student in an area of particular interest with the help of a faculty adviser and the director of undergraduate studies, intended to enable the student to cover material not otherwise offered by the department. The course may be used for research, design projects, or for directed reading, but in all cases a term paper, written report on the research project, or its equivalent is normally required as determined by the faculty advisor and DUS. The student must meet regularly with the faculty adviser. Students wishing to enroll must complete the regular application for Yale Summer Session. In addition, students must supply a 1- to 2- paragraph project description of the research to be undertaken, written in collaboration with the faculty advisor, including the proposed starting and ending dates. The student must also submit written permission of (1) the faculty advisor, (2) the Director of Summer Sciences for students in STEM, or the Dean of Summer Session for students in the Humanities or Social Sciences, and (3) the director of undergraduate studies of the applicant's major department. All approvals may be submitted via email to summer.session@yale.edu with IDRS S300 and the student\u2019s name in the subject line. Students taking Independent Research in the Summer for 1 credit should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for five weeks (either Session A or B); for 2 credits students should expect to spend approximately 35 hours a week on their research for ten weeks (both Session A and B). Students may receive academic credit only if they are not being paid for doing research, but they may work for credit in one 5-week period and for pay in the other. Upon completion of the course, the faculty advisor must submit a substantive report that both describes the nature of the independent research and evaluates the student\u2019s performance in it.\u00a0 The report must include the grade (P\/F). These reports should be shared with the student and the director of undergraduate studies in the department or program in which the research is based and kept in the office of the student\u2019s residential college dean. Deadlines for submitting all materials:\u00a0 Session A by April 26 and Session B by May 31. YSS applications are due: Session A by May 4 and Session B by June 8. 1 Credit. Tuition: $4,650. Offered in Session A: May 30 - July 1 (CRN 30096) and Session B: July 4 - August 5 (CRN 30097).",

The differential diagnosis and treatment of complex health problems commonly seen in acutely ill adult\/gerontology patients are stressed, with special emphasis on conditions presented in NURS 7830 and NURS 7850. The focus is on those acute illnesses with a predictable course and established treatment approaches. Students have the opportunity to manage a caseload of patients from admission through discharge, as well as follow patients on an outpatient basis. A two-hour weekly clinical conference addresses acute care clinical issues and includes simulation activities. Required of all adult\/gerontology acute care nurse practitioner students in the final year. Preceptors are APRNs, PAs, and physicians.

Why are we not just mindless robots, that produce behavior in light of stimulations from the environment, but lack any inner awareness or consciousness?
