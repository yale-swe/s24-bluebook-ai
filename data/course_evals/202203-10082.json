                "a stronger and broader foundation in social theory",
                "Professor Lynch enriched my learning by introducing to me for the first time the breadth and depth of anthropological theory from the mid 19th century until the present day. Abstract concepts like \"power,\" \"gender,\" or even the author's voice became more concrete weirdly enough by discussing the theoretical readings in class. I've also come to understand the historical role that anthropology has played in hegemonic structures while also having hope for this current generation of scholars who is critically reengaging with and reinvigorating the field.",
                "The theoretical big picture of the discipline",
                "The prominent ideas in anthropology and social theory, such as those by Marx, Weber, Hurston, Foucault, Durkheim among others. One of the biggest topic takeaway for me was Stocking's historicism which enables me to approach this course more intentionally in application to this idea. Moreover, focusing on post-colonial thinkers and topics helps to situate the canonical anthropological theory in a context that is more nuanced.",
                "My biggest takeaway from this course was the ability to use theory both as the tool of analysis but also the object of inquiry. I've learned about some of the key theories that have formed the foundations of modern anthropology and also understood the ways that anthropology as a practice has to reckon with its use in colonial exploitation. While anthropology as a practice continues to grapple with its colonial framings and roots it also provides us with the ways of expanding the practice to open up the field to new imaginative possibilities."

                "I think it tried to cover too many areas and it might be difficult to connect the dots, which I find to be the more valuable part of the experience",
                "A major strength was the seminar format. Even though Professor Lynch mentioned that any one of our topics could be a whole semester-long course, I felt that the long class time allowed us to work our way through the texts sufficiently. Another strength would be the choice of readings. I could see the evolution of theory from historically white men to the voices of women and marginalized populations coming to the fore in the 20th century. A third strength of the course would be the strong writing component. We would write a short reflection each week to collect our thoughts on the readings. The two short papers also helped to consolidate our thoughts into a cohesive argument. A final strength would be the student-led discussion. Professor Lynch would dedicate a large portion of the class time for groups to present on that week's topic. I learned a lot from my peers' interpretations of the readings. \r\n\r\nIf I'm being honest, I can't think of any areas of improvement other than wishing that our discussions could have gone on for longer.",
                "I found the presentations engaging but I wish there was more lecturing",
                "The strength is its breadth, which unfortunately compromise the ability for us to engage each theory deeper. However, I don't see this weakness to be an impediment due to the nature of the class that is meant to introduce different theories relevant to the anthropological world.",
                "Strengths include:\r\n- clear setup of learning expectations, we stuck well to the themes we were tasked to explore \r\n- good variety of readings to explore \r\n- key themes and ideas reiterated across classes \r\n- class discussions were well facilitated and summarised by the instructor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses include: \r\n- student facilitation could be better articulated wrt to expectations of what to include in the presentation"

                "yes! there's work to do for sure, so don't sleep on it. but there's so much to learn and be excited about in this course, and it will firm up one's foundation.",
                "As someone who had never formally studied anthropological theory before, at first I was quite intimidated by the task of familiarizing myself with nearly 200 years of theory. It's not that intimidating. Professor Lynch organizes the content into three distinct sections with multiple modules, so it's much more manageable if you think about tackling one module at a time. I will say though that the reading load is substantial with at least three academic articles or the equivalent assigned each week. I'm so glad that Professor Lynch did not focus on whether each student had meticulously done all of the readings. I'd suggest to pick the reading that speaks to you and read it well. Finally, I'd add that you will get so much more out of the class by participating, even if you feel like your point isn't \"academic\" or \"sound\" enough. All of my peers benefitted from hearing from one another.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, the theories that are discussed are highly relevant and I can foresee them being transferable to fields beyond anthropology.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anthropology students. The class discussions and themes really focus on grappling with the field of anthropology and its complications really well while leaving room to explore what you want in the class as well. I can see it as potentially useful for students from other majors as well when grappling with the complications of theory and thinker but I do see this as most useful for anthropology students."
