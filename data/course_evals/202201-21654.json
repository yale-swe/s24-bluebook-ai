This class equips you with some quite powerful tools to reason about these spaces, including the concepts of a quotient space, a covering space, and cell complexes.",
                "In this class you learn the basic tools used in topology to categorize and understand spaces. You also develop skills in proof-based math because proofs are the main part of lecture, homework, and exams. The class also uses some algebra techniques during the second half, but these aren't as prevalent as other topological ideas."

                "I think the course has very interesting content and its strengths flow from that. It only becomes dry when we get bogged down in a highly technical proof for the day.",
                "The class followed Hatchers book, which is quite advanced. Thus when we needed to diverge from Hatcher at some points, there was confusion and slowing down of the lectures. In terms of what was covered about the first fundamental group, very helpful!",
                "Professor Kenyon cares a lot about math and his students--he was my only professor this semester to learn my name and use it in class. The topics of the course are generally interesting and it is pretty laid back. Grades were a little bit frustrating and I didn't really have any idea of what my final grade was going to be.",
                "Professor Kenyon is a great strength of this class. His lectures feel more like conversations than the notes-based recitations that sound like you are being read to from the textbook. Professor Kenyon clearly thought carefully about what parts of the text merited highlighting, and took special care to find and spend time on intuition building examples. He invited students to help in fill in the logic in proofs, which made them much more engaging and understandable.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint about the course is that we spent quite a bit of time with basic concepts like open balls and compact sets, of the sort that those who have taken 230 or 305 are very familiar with. I wish we had moved through this material more quickly, to spend more time on the juicier topological ideas.",
                "There are many difficult concepts in this course, and it can be very difficult to wrap your head around them. The homework gives you an opportunity to better understand them, but even that isn't quite enough. The textbook is also not very helpful. On the other hand, the material is very interesting, and the problem sets are not that intensive."

                "I would certainly recommend this course. I learned a lot without the usual baggage that comes with upper level math courses with the insane workload. It seemed Kenyon was committed to interesting problem sets that did not take an absurd amount of time. Further, the lectures were engaging and interesting.",
                "Probably only to math majors.",
