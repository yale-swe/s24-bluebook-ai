The focus of the course is definitely on democratic innovations, ways to revitalize or revise the traditional electoral model of democracy (for example, through the use of citizens' assemblies, crowdsourcing, or other ideas), but along the way you definitely learn a lot about democratic theory (why we believe democracy is good in the first place, what does democratic really mean, and when is it desirable). Additionally, we also discussed economic democracy a bit, which was very interesting. Lastly, you do learn how to edit Wikipedia in this class, and one of the projects involves you directly editing and adding to a Wikipedia page.",

The course introduces problems with democracy and the potential for a deliberative democratic alternative that makes use of sortition, rather than elections, for the creation of legislative assemblies.

                "The strengths of this course are 1) it has a great professor who is really good at running seminar and engaging meaningfully with students in the class while also being brilliant and incredibly knowledgeable, 2) the readings are generally quite interesting (some are fantastic), and 3) the assignments are not too difficult and quite interesting/different. Its main weaknesses are 1) there are a lot of assignments, and it was sometimes unclear how much time we should spend on some of them and 2) I think that too much time in the course was spent on mini-publics, and not enough on some other topics discussed in the class (general democratic theory, electoral reform, and other possible democratic innovations/theories of how to improve democracy). I really enjoyed the discussion of mini-publics, but I felt that I would have appreciated more discussion of other ideas (liquid democracy, crowdsourcing, etc.), more discussion of the fundamentals of democratic theory, and whether electoral reform is possible.",
                "Strengths: great professor, interesting readings, assignments that require more than just abstract engagement with the topic from a distance \r\nWeaknesses: not a light workload class-- though all components are meaningful, to get the most out of the course it require significant devotion; some more background on philosophy would be helpful, especially near the end of the course",
                "Discussions could have been more regulated + breakout rooms.",
                "No weaknesses. This was my favorite course this semester with perhaps my favorite professor at Yale. It was, however, a large amount of reading/work.",
                "The content is fantastic  if you get in and actually do the readings, it will totally change your perspective on government and what you want to do with your life (at least for me). The discussions can be dominated by certain students, and sometimes the professor does not try to get everyone involved.",
                "The class is very informative and covers a wide aspect of different topics. A large factor is the Wikipedia assignment which can become a bit technical, and students end up spending a decent amount of time simply figuring out how to work the website.",
                "One very strong point was the material itself. I enjoyed the reading selections and the way the course was organized such that we first learned about the historic origins of democracy and then moved to modern ideas and then to case studies. I thought all our discussions were enriching and engaging. I also particularly enjoyed when Professor Landemore brought in guest speakers who were actual participants in the French Climate Convention. One minor weakness is that some of the assignments seemed a little unclear, but students brought up questions about them, it got better.",
                "strengths: very passionate professor who found ways to orient her students towards action, not just idle thought; enjoyable readings and topic; very engaged class; unique projects that have impacts beyond the classroom.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: It was very unclear what some of the assignments were which was sometimes confusing and stressful and some things were never graded"

If you are, then absolutely take it, you will read and discuss tons of interesting stuff about them, as well as some super interesting readings about the history of democracy and economic democracy. If you read the wikipedia for Citizens' Assembly and they doesn't interest you, then this class may not be for you.",

I came into this class as a technocrat but found myself leaving as a full-fledged epistemic democrat who is excited to work on the implementation of the system proposed by Professor Landemore. The readings are interesting and, in stark contrast to some other courses, the assignments are incredibly meaningful. More specifically, we are assigned to edit a Wikipedia article at the beginning of the semester and eventually publish them to contribute to collective knowledge. We also wrote a constitution as a class at the end of the semester which served as a true testament to the strength of deliberative democracy.",
                "Yes, only if this is something you're passionate about. It's a great course!",
                "Absolutely. If you are at all interested in democratic theory, you would be lucky to learn from Professor Landemore.",
                "Like I mentioned above, this course changed my life. If you really engage with it, you will find yourself questioning the fundamentals of modern democracies, and have a much deeper understanding of why there is such a gap between politicians and the public. Prof Landemore is very kind and clearly cares a lot, but sometimes slow to give feedback. I am completely changing my course of study at yale after this  and I'm a junior so I just wish I took this earlier. seriously, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!",

                "I would recommend this to anyone who is willing to put in the work and engage with the material. People should know it is a political philosophy class, which means that there isn't as much empirical analysis compared to other social science classes, but the philosophy is a little more practical than other political philosophy classes. The class centers on a very revolutionary political philosophy so I would recommend that everyone who takes the class comes with an open mind."
