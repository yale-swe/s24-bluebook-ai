   "comments": [
    "Even though this course is listed as a seminar, it's more of a lecture with powerpoints. The presentations are well-prepared and thought-provoking, although I do feel like I'd enjoy the course more if it was conducted in a discussion-based format.",
    "More opportunities for student participation, especially because many students tend to monopolize the time.",
    "I was expecting the class to be a seminar but he just lectured the whole time and didn't ask us any discussion questions.  He only asked us questions with one response that he already had in mind.  The material was not very exciting and was not delivered in a way that made it interesting.  I would have liked a discussion of the readings and more of a discussion of the art that we saw in a way that made it clear why we were discussing it.",
    "The weaknesses of this course is that it is a seminar where no one discusses the readings.",
    "The biggest strength is the readings, they ranged across subject areas but were all a pleasure to read because they're some of the most important pieces in each area. Everything we covered in class was intellectually stimulating. \r\nAs a seminar that brings together students of many different majors and previous experiences, I think it would be much stronger if there were more discussion time. As it is, the class is like a lecture - which is great because the professor knows so much about the areas, but a balance between lecture and discussion would be more engaging. \r\nI also wish that we could've had more guidance on the papers - handing in an outline or draft first would be tremendously helpful in guiding the direction of our  paper."

   "comments": [
    "No, I would not recommend it.  The class itself was not exciting at all and we would sit there while he read text from the screen and talked about some images.  The assignments were unclear and not very helpful for understanding any of the material.  They seemed unrelated and they appeared to be simple and could be taken in whatever way but then he wanted something very specific which was hard to guess.  I was upset by that.",
    "Yes, art majors or non art majors will both find the material interesting, I think!"
