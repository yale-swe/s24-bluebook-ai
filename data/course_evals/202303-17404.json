                "Strengths: provides structure to the thesis process, and the small group format creates a sense of community among students and professor.\r\nWeaknesses: 4pm deadlines were very inconvenient as they were kind of in the middle of my day, while I was just getting out of another class (other people in my group also expressed frustration with this timing, so it wasn't just me); would much rather have had a 11:59pm deadline. Some of the assignments also felt like they overlapped\/asked us to turn in very similar products. For me, it would have been most helpful to have to turn in a certain number of pages each week."
