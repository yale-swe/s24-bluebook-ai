                "Strengths: I was by far the most engaged with Spanish this semester, compared to my other class (humanities lectures and seminars). The classes and homework were always engaging. Craig was also a fantastic instructor, and I truly appreciated his encouragement and thoughtfulness in class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I know this is a 1.5-credit class, but at times the workload verged on being unmanageable for me. Perhaps instructors could consider making daily homework due the day that class meets (although I know there are downsides to this too). One other stressful thing for me was having no Spanish background at all, so I often felt behind other students that had that Spanish background.",
                "The professor and the course structure is a strength. It's difficult to compare this to an in person class, but I feel it was more challenging to apply the spanish in class.",
                "Prof. Osterbrock is a great teacher. I appreciated that he gave us opportunities to speak without breaking the class into breakout rooms. He was incredibly helpful at office hours, and very understanding of students' circumstances."
