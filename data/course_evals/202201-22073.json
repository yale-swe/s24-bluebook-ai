                "Conducted new lab techniques that I had not covered in other courses nor come across in lab setting during student employment. Great attention to details of lab reagents and experimental design. Specifically focused on oral presentation skills which will be helpful for anyone down the line.",
                "I learned more lab techniques, but more advanced stuff like mammalian cell culture, mammalian cell transfections, CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing, gel electrophoresis, western blotting, PCR, etc.",
                "This course was a continuation from 344L. I leaned important techniques on how to study cell biology and how to become a better scientist. I also learned how to present science and answer people questions effectively.",
                "I learned many skills that are used in the laboratory. Through this introduction, I feel more comfortable with the lab and my decision making for what should be done. I also learned how to do important relatively newer techniques like CRISPR, making this class feel significant.",
                "I gained skills in different cell bio skills, such as cell culturing, microscopy, and CRISPR. By going through different modules and learning by doing, I was able to get a better understanding of the techniques used in biology.",
                "See 344 comments. Another awesome course. You apply what you learn from the first half into a cool project based on the TAs research. It really helped put the techniques into context.",
                "This class was a fantastic introduction to basic techniques in cell biology. It was a great hands-on learning experience applicable to wet lab research. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about research techniques.",
                "Learned a ton - CRISPR, antibody staining, cell culture work, most importantly how to present research",
                "This second part of the course  was a bit less useful in hard lab skills as the 344 part, but the job talks and professor made up for that. The few skills we did learn were very fun and useful, but took a while to do. The job talks however, taught me how to read and analyze a scientific paper and how to truly understand it, which is something I will always carry with me.",
                "I learned about completing CRISPR\/Cas9 genetic editing in a laboratory setting and how to give effective job talks about scientific research to a group of peers. In addition to the lab techniques I learned in MCDB 344L."

            "comments": [
                "Long hours but not stressful. Sometimes this was a test of stamina, and the class could have been more efficient, however students learned about the details of lab practices which was very useful and the first time I had taken attention to some of these parts of the lab. Fantastic class.",
                "Wolenski is the reason why this class works. he's heavily invested in the students learning and growing without stressing us out with tests. Even though class was 5 hours a day, twice a day, I truly enjoyed coming to class every time.",
                "Strengths: Prof Wolenski is extremely enthusiastic, and creates a great learning environment. The labs are very practical and helpful for anyone doing basic biology research, and we covered a lot of different techniques in detail. Since there was a wide variety of labs and everyone had different background research experiences, everyone had at least one lab where they got to demonstrate their skills and lead their tablemates, and at least one lab where they had no experience and had to learn from their tablemates instead. It's a very fun and useful class! Weaknesses: This course takes up a lot of time in your schedule, and really should be a full credit. Sometimes experiments were not designed as efficiently as they could have been, so we had a lot of down time and spent more time in class than we needed to.",
                "Strengths: The student centered approach and the job talks were a nice way to practice speaking about science in a large group setting. \r\nWeakness: None really. The class felt a little stagnant at times, but that is being picky. GREAT COURSE.",
                "I think that this course has a strong team building atmosphere where everyone in the class gets involved.",
                "Prof Wolenski and his commitment to the class was by far the biggest strength of the class. In addition, the effort of the TA, Yi-chun, was also essential in making sure that we were able to complete all the experiments.",
                "See 344. Nothing to improve tbh. It's a gem!",
                "This class fostered class collaboration with a highly involved professor. Learning was much more effective than in other labs because students could discuss with their classmates and work together towards reaching an answer. I think that the labs could be a bit more organized so that things happen in a more timely manner. Providing protocols for the lab 24 hours prior may make class time run more smoothly.",
                "Strengths - awesome, fun way to learn a lot of science\r\n\r\nweaknesses- not a lot, you spend a lot of time in lab but it is worth it",
                "This class was fantastic in its ability to keep us engaged and learning interesting laboratory techniques, all while learning from an amazing professor. Most of the weakness of this course was from the CRISPR module, which was extremely time consuming and much less hands on than other techniques we explored. This module seemed a bit detached from the theory, which we didn't how much time to cover, and mainly consisted of pipetting, thermocycling, and centrifuging. The final weakness of this course was the job talks. These were extremely useful and interesting, so they should not be removed so much as reworked. The issue was that sometimes, we would have 3 job talks in one day that would last a cumulative hour and a half or more, which would make it difficult to sit through. The only thing I would change is to shorten these talks or spread them out a little better.",
                "I think a strength of the course was the clear objective to teach you how to go on and be an effective scientist and scientific communicator, so you not only understood what you were doing in the lab but also knew how to apply such concepts to places outside of the laboratory. While it can be a bit nerve-wracking at first, it is clearly such a collaborative and welcoming environment that you simply need to try your best and make yourself proud to do a good job."

                "Yes. Just like 344, it's one of the best bio classes at Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in doing wet lab research. This is a great learning environment and Professor Wolenski is a passionate and involved teacher.",
                "Yes, definitely take this class you will learn a lot of useful things and have a great time while doing it",
                "Absolutely, definitely take the sequence as you will fall in love again with science and you will truly embrace the scientist life.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, specifically an MCDB student, to learn how to work in a lab effectively and give good scientific presentations. If you plan to engage with science post-college, the lessons learned in this class are invaluable."
