                "I improved my Italian language skills and learned a lot about the fascinating history and artistic traditions of Naples.",
                "Learn to synthesize information and focus on historical trends and legacies rather than specific details as it is a broad survey course.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: there were clear expectations for every single class, interesting readings and material, ability to share about what interested us most about a certain topic, great class field trips and good diversity of assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think participation could have been better (I noticed the native speakers often dominated the conversation and it felt daunting at times to contribute), and I think less reflection assignments per week would be good or more notice of how many are due and when",
                "Strengths: Anna is awesome and makes the class very fun and informative while also relaxed and easy-going. Weaknesses: the confusion and redundancy of Neapolitan history.",
                "Strengths - Anna, she is Napolitan herself and therefore very excited to share her culture with us. Weaknesses - sometimes very advanced readings which take a lot of time - but Anna is very understanding and doesnt expect us to understand everything",
                "Strengths: I think a major strength of this course is Anna! She is always so approaching and very kind to her students. I think that the workload is not overwhelming at all, and it's a relaxing class to learn more about Italian history.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class was a bit too big, and it discouraged more in-depth conversations about the subject at hand. I also think a bit too much time was spent on ancient history, and more could be spent on modern-day culture.",
                "Strength: great and passionate professor. \r\nWeakness: sometimes the lessons felt a bit unstructured and we did not get to spend that much time on the later part of the syllabus, the contemporary history of Naples.",
                "The main structure of this course was the diversity of material through which we learned about Naples. There was a great emphasis on film, music, and literature that really enriched the course and our knowledge of the subject. However, the course could benefit from more structure and organization, as well as a weeding out of some of the material. The dense amount of history to read through was overwhelming and often proved to be unnecessary since the goal was to delineate the history of Naples, not its specifics. Reading through accounts of different monarchs and detailed accounts of events often distracted from fitting them within the broader Neapolitan history, and took time away at the end of the course. The course ended right at Italian Unification, and by narrowing down the content prior to it, it will allow for more exploration into modern Naples and its relationship now with Italy and with the world.",
                "One strength is that the class is very discussion oriented which helped me unpacked the many readings that we did especially since they were in very advanced Italian. However it could be better organized in terms of focusing on key events over the course of the class and the figures relevant to them because sometimes we covered a lot in a week and for me certain things got conflated.",

                "Absolutely. Fun Italian class with lots of class excurzions",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I would recommend any class with Anna, to be honest. She is very kind and down-to-Earth with her students, and makes sure that they all feel welcome. The workload is not very high at all, and the classes are always a very relaxed way to engage with the material at hand.",
                "Yes, if the student wanted an interesting class and warm environment to practice their language skills.",
                "Definitely- really interesting, not a heavy workload, and Professor Iacovella is amazing.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students learning Italian because not only is the content interesting, but there is no expectation to be perfectly fluent yet. Mistakes are allowed and kindly corrected, and the overall environment feels less academic and more conversational that helps learn Italian better.",
                "I would recommend it if youre really into history. We covered a lot of material and events in relatively short periods and the readings were often dense but still interesting.",
                "Yes! This course has really deepened my love for Italian and the nuances of the language and the regionality of its history. It is such a linguistically and culturally diverse nation, and I believe this course really helped me gain a better sense of this. Professor Iacovella is incredibly kinda and passionate about the topic, which always made class particularly lively."
