Regarding content, I feel like it was scattered around the globe, and even though the connections between those different moments\/places were explored to a certain extent, it sometimes just felt like I was watching History Channel and learning random things about places I didn't know before.

            "comments": [
                "The recorded lectures were a lot at times on top of the readings and I tended to not listen to them if short on time. I would suggest doing more during the nonrecorded live lectures to promote engagement and participation.",
                "Strengths: The pre-recorded lectures and readings were helpful and interesting. I especially enjoyed the lectures on ecology, India, Japan, the Comanche, and the material world. The readings were also helpful, such as the the Pomerance reading and the Naoroji one. Weakness: I would appreciate it if the class was structured a little better. Having a set schedule of when we actually met in class and when we had the day off would make it easier to plan ahead. Also, the breakout rooms in class time were sometimes quite awkward because no one would say anything and we would just be staring at blank space. I think class time could have been better if Professor Semmel did a little lecturing and we could ask him questions and have some back-and-forth.",
                "STRENGTH: Prof Semmel cares a lot about his students, lighter workload, goes beyond Euro-centric POV (even at times actively criticizes it) despite that being Prof Semmel's field, TAs are quite helpful, readings were not overwhelming, genuinely enjoyable subject matter.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: Assignment dates got pushed back a lot which is normally fine but I picked the class because I thought I'd have the final paper done and turned in before reading period and instead it was due right at the start of reading period. Lectures felt a bit unorganized at times. I do not know if we made it to the end of the century. I think we only went from around like 1790-1860  with most content being from the early 1800s but it was hard to tell because the class was organized mores based on theme than chronology. I think just making it a bit more clear where we are situated would be nice.",
                "I enjoyed the recorded lectures so I could speed up\/go back to things I wanted to review. I also liked having the class time for group discussions to supplement the learning every week.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, professor was very knowledgeable, readings were varied in terms of region, format, and topic. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes had a hard time following along with the material, feedback on assignments was not always timely.",
                "The strengths would be the discussion format and closeness with the TA\/ULA. They are always there to help.",
                "class gave a great survey of the world circa 1800, lecture format could be more organized, discussion sections were great",
                "The strength of this course is that the workload is fairly light and the TFs are extremely helpful in providing feedbacks. The weakness of this class is that because the main focuses of the course were largely thematic, some of the pre-record lectures don't seem to relevant to the course which leaves students wondering what should be emphasized.",
                "I really enjoyed the recorded lectures and how section discussion was structured. I feel like I got a much better wholistic view of the subject of history.",
                "Do not think these issues will carry over in a post-COVID world, but: there should be no \"recorded lectures\" prior to our mandatory twice a week lecture. They would literally post anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half of recorded lectures prior to our twice a week lectures and section. Absolutely crazy.",
                "Strengths: Great TF (Emmanuel), low workload, and (most likely) easy A. Some of the primary sources were interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Content was scattered and superficial. Prof. would randomly cancel class (although he would post recorded lectures).",
                "The way discussion was set up made it easy to talk freely. Sometimes not all the readings were covered so they seemed irrelevant.",
                "I think the Professor is really sweet but he seemed disorganized at times. Synchronous sessions were often canceled the day before, and he sent out email blasts with essay prompts instead of just using Canvas to have everything in one place",
                "Strength: all history backgrounds were able to do well\r\nWeakness: engagement in material was low",
                "I think some strengths of the course were that you were given a fair workload each week. There was a nice mix of primary and secondary sources. For me, this was by far the most I had ever looked at primary sources and analyzed their significance. Another strength was the helping attitude of the professor and TA. My TA met with me one-on-one to improve all of my drafts before I submitted a final copy on each essay. The course material itself was very diverse and interesting, covering events from all corners of the globe. I do not think there were any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly nice + caring professor & great TAs. Interesting content. Good primary sources. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found the secondary sources to be a little out of place on occasion. Also, generally, organization was not a strong point. It wasn't a total mess, just not super well organized.",

                "Though sometimes the course was a bit disorganized, I dont feel I suffered from that at all. On the contrary, I think Professor Semmel agonized about how to best present the class to us in a Zoom format and he did a great job, along with the TAs. I dont have anything negative to say at all.",
                "Could be more asynchronous",
                "Great class",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were a huge plus in the course, probably my favorite part, as they got us the information without being too burdensome. One weakness was probably that readings and even the lectures were not integral to do well on papers.The TF-led sections are very important and enjoyable in learning the content.",
                "It was a fun course! It was difficult for me to focus on lectures without pictures, but that will probably change during regular times.",
                "This course was really chaotic and needed to be organized further in advance.",
                "Strength - I definitely liked how Professor Semmel structured the class. The prerecorded lecture along with the weekly in-class discussions allowed me to process the material on my own time. \r\n\r\nWeakness - At times, it was difficult to stay engaged because the material covered was so vast (global history takes A LOT of time to unpack).",

                "I would. It won't stress you out a ton, and there is something to learn no matter how much history you have learned. Since it is a pretty broad survey course, you will only get a sliver of each topic that on its own could be its own course, but I enjoyed the topics on ecology, disease, and discovery. It was a new and a different way of thinking about history. Also, Professor Semmel is very kind and is helpful when you meet with him. This class will most definitely be better in person as well, because he loves to have discussions that were difficult and awkward to have on zoom.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The class offers students from all academic backgrounds the opportunity to learn history in a fun environment. There was very little pressure in this course because all of the assignments were essays that you had ample time to prepare for. The grading of the assignments was very fair and generous. The professor is very kind and helps all students perform to the best of their ability in the course. Lastly, the workload is extremely managable.",
                "I would recommend this course (if taught by Semmel). He's an incredibly kind professor. The content is pretty neat  how all these different parts of the world connected in a time that most don't consider as incredibly intertwined. The readings are pretty good, very few duds. Coursework isn't intense, this is a good 4th in a heavy semester \/ 5th in a light.",
                "It's a good introduction to global history and helps students get better acquainted with the field. Anyone wishing to develop broad knowledge about the world should take the class.",
                "As a STEM major, I think this class was really cool and didn't assume any prior knowledge. It lets you get a little taste of everything. For a humanities major who is looking for something more in depthand organized about somethingmore specific,  maybe not.",
                "Absolutely yes. This was my first history class at Yale and I learned a ton of extremely important information. I feel like I now can understand the current events of our world and contextualize them. If youre a history buff, maybe this class isnt for you.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the workload is not bad, and it is an interesting course to take, especially if you need a humanities credit",
                "Yes great professor",
                "Absolutely, this was an amazing class!",
                "Yes! It's a relatively easy and enjoyable history course, even for non-majors. Do not take it if you are looking for a super deep analysis of historical concepts.",
                "For anyone who wants a strong understanding of places across the world in the 1800s, this is the perfect course!",
                "Yes it was a very interesting and engaging course.",
                "Probably not. It was too chaotic.",
                "Yes! The structure of the class was unique and geared towards student learning. If you're looking to fulfill the distributional requirement, I recommend taking this course - especially if you're not a humanities person.",
                "Maybe... It was an alright course but I have had better history courses",
                "Yes I would recommend it to anyone interested in history."
