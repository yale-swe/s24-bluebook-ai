    "I thought it was really great for learning to appreciate the poetry we read. Reading it out loud and then slowly discussing selections really allowed us to think about the writing, style, and form. The workload was also not overbearing at all, which gave us time to really focus on the readings. It did sometimes feel like our class discussions never had enough time to cover everything that was important. Also, I felt like we didn't talk enough about form and style when reading Paradise Lost (heavy focus on ideas).",
    "Strengths: fair workload\r\nWeaknesses: not the most dynamic reading list",
    "I only wish that this course could have been longer so that we could spend more time on the Canterbury Tales and the Shakespeare\/Donne\/Herbert portion of the class!"

    "Yes! If you are willing to put the work into the readings and discussions, you will learn a lot and improve your writing."
