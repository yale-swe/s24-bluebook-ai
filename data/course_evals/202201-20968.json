I also honed my ability to engage with academic articles and present the main ideas to peers.",

                "Good overview of the way IR treats questions of international order and cooperation",
                "This course is a great introduction to the concept of \"international order.\" At the beginning of the semester, we read and discussed various important works by many of the key thinkers in this discourse. These authors included Ikenberry, Mearsheimer, Trachtenberg, Hurd, Keohane, Huntington, Fukuyama, and more. Having established a strong foundation of what international order means, how it is treated, and how it came to be, the course moved onto to more contemporary discussions of international order and critiques of it. We discussed the role of small states in constituting order, considered the roles of non-state acts and illiberal regimes, as well as cyber warfare and its potential for instability. I now feel very comfortable reading other papers in IR as I recognize most of the names and concepts authors reference and take for granted, and this course has prepared me for strong future research in this subject."

Other than that, really no improvements could be made.",

If you are interested in understanding why our international structure, which we often take as a given, looks the way it does, and if you are interested in developing the knowledge and skills necessary to evaluate threats to the current order, this is a class for you. There is a lot of reading assigned each week that you truly do have to do in order to engage well in class, so just a fair warning.",
