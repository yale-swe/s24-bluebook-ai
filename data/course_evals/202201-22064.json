However as the course progresses you get better at reading scientific literature.",

The homework is reasonable and the class exists such that students are required to be engaged and present but not conduct hours of busy work. The instructors could spend more time in class asking students to work through practice problems since students have different levels of email Iwrits with statistical analysis.",

The professors should definitely earn teaching awards for how great they are :) Dr. Whirledge is a wonderful instructor was super organized all along",
