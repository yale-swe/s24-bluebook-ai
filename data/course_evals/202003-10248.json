                "I learned how to better write concisely and clearly. I learned that some constraints that high school English teachers fed to us are invalid and misleading. And I learned how to pay more attention to rhythm in prose.",
                "How to come up with a new topic to write about each week, how to think before writing, how to revise for concision, how to write with rhythm",
                "Often Yale creative course focus on the whole piece and not every element of the piece, and Verlyn taught me to Zoom in and carefully analyze what each word means. He also taught me the importance of rhythm  when a piece sounds strange to the author when its read aloud, it wont read well for others, so fixing the flow is of utmost importance.",
                "We wrote a lot! So I learned to write better. And to pick my own topics.",
                "Clear, clutter-free writing, an ear for the poetic possibilities of sentences, confidence in my ability to both turn out regular work and nurture any idea with a critical eye through development and revision.",

Very empowering.",
                "I developed a new way of thinking about and approaching writing: as the sentence suggests, that way of writing centers on moving from one sentence to the next, perfecting each one (as much as one can perfect writing) before moving to the next. My descriptive and narrative skills improved immensely, and generally, I learned how to write about difficult topics in engaging, meaningful, and succinct ways.",
                "My idea of writing completely changed through this course. My writing was freed from unnecessary conventions and became clearer and more concise. I gained confidence in my writing after having written unprompted every week. I could also see improvement week over week, a result of fruitful class discussions and detailed feedback on my work during office hours. In the weekly routine of writing, I also learned to notice what interested me and how to communicate it. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously (and perhaps even more valuable), I became a better reader. I learned to let go of \"theme\" and \"meaning\" and focus on the sentences and rhythm instead. I started to notice what was interesting in the prose itself, which made reading a much more enjoyable experience!",
                "This class is a great chance for students to refine their prose.",
                "focus on improving sentences on a word level; emphasis on clarity and meaning of interactions between words; built trust in my own writing and ability to trust the reader's logic",

                "How to write!!! In this class, you forget everything you've ever been taught about writing. It really allows you to find your own voice and become comfortable with your prose.",
                "This class made me a better writer and thinker. I learned to think cogently \/ consciously about the sentences and words I choose. You'll develop concision and power in your writing. Many of my 2-pagers began as big muddled mushes, full of very nebulous ideas and feelings... But by the end of term, I was able to figure out how to tackle strange ideas and wrestle them onto a page in a way that's understandable. The class allows you to experiment with topics\/ideas you might not have otherwise. You'll build confidence and creativity, starting with the simplest sentences. We all learned to write more poetically, and to tackle big ideas through oblique approaches. Verlyn worked closely with each of us to hone clarity and precision in our work. Reading my classmates pieces and seeing them grow was a revelation  you learn so much through this process!  The time I spent on this class was invaluable.",
                "I learned so much from this course. I learned a ton about writing and really felt that I improved, but I also really felt that I learned a lot about being a person and a good listener! I loved this course so so so much.",
                "Writing and all its beauties and complexities. This class was a place to talk about the act of writing itself, the content of the writing (what works and what doesn't), and overall, how to become better writers."

                "This class was a bright spot in my weeks. The structure of the class is great - I liked being able to choose what to write every week, and 2 pages is just enough to dive into a topic. Even over Zoom, the class maintained a supportive atmosphere. I liked listening to pieces being read aloud, especially those written by my peers (though it may be neat for the author to read their pieces too!). I also really liked revising the \"worst\" sentence in each person's piece. Since we break down every piece so much, though, each person only ends up having their piece workshopped by the class once or twice - you have to go to office hours to get the most out of this class.",
                "Strengths of this class include the small class size and the class format, which consisted of readings of both outside authors and classmates work. My only regret is that we did not meet often enough.",
                "I liked its chillness- you just write and talk about writing. It did sometimes feel a bit unstructured but thats not necessarily a bad thing.",
                "Verlyn is a lovely man and an amazing teacher. I really appreciated the routine of the course  we wrote around two pages every week, read our classmates and a sample essay, and after 12 weeks, we were simply done. No final paper worth 40% of our grade that changed our experience of the course into a solitary one. I loved the rhythm of thinking and writing and coming together, and it helped me learn a lot while not even feeling I was working too hard  Id sit down at the end of the week with my journal-like brainstorming google docs and realize Id been thinking about the class all week. Very few classes at yale achieve that.",
                "Had this class been in person, I feel that we wouldve been able to cultivate an even better class dynamic. The strengths of this class were in the workshop every week where we were able to apply what weve learned in the class on a technical level.",
                "No weaknesses. Strengths were a thriving and kind community, lots of personalized feedback from the instructor, great readings, small, intimate class setting, clear learning goals.",
                "Strengths: Pretty much everything. The biggest strength is Professor Klinkenborg, who is an absolutely wonderful professor, a skilled writer, and an even better person. I also think the course is structured really well and the weekly writing pieces and weekly reading for class both worked quite effectively. The feedback was really effective in moving my writing forward, and I felt that focusing on writing new pieces rather than emphasizing revising was a smart move for the course and for writer development.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None (sorry!)",
                "The greatest strengths of the course is the weekly feedback on our writing assignments and the discussion in class. I was able to expose myself to different ways of writing through class  what was good and what wasn't good. In addition, Professor Klinkenborg's line by line edits of our weekly work and openness to discussion during office hours was very helpful for understanding my own writing practices.\r\n\r\nThere are no weaknesses!",
                "The strengths: you're writing the same amount every week. Verlyn very much leaves the seminar in the hands of the students in it.",
                "strengths\r\n-class zoom drive where we all shared our work each week (very fulfilling to read everyone's pieces each week even if they weren't discussed)\r\n-class scrapbook drive to build unity\r\n-very available for office hours each week\r\n-anonymous bad sentences discussion each week to think about mechanics of sentences\r\n-weekly chances to write short pieces and receive regular and clear feedback\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- i feel that the course size (bigger than 16 so we didn't all fit on one page) made the class feel a little more anonymous and less seminar-like. some faces blended together and I would've appreciated a slightly smaller class and maybe more time in the beginning to get to know each other so that the faces have people for other classmates",
                "The Professor was very fair and gave wonderful feedback. He was always present for office hours and really encouraged line editing.",
                "The only weakness is that you don't get to have your piece workshopped in class very often, but it's fun to talk through the prose of your classmates.",
                "Strengths- the format of writing 2 pages each week was a struggle but a great one. You write even when you think you have nothing to say. You learn to read and reread and edit. The careful line-edits from Verlyn taught me so much about tiny nuances in rhythm to big structural things that I did fairly badly at the start of the term. I learned so much from this combo of big-picture as well as granular thinking\/editing. I loved the pieces we read in class; they were diverse, provoking, and showed us what was possible for the format. Office hours were insanely helpful  you can talk to verlyn about anything, and it really helps you get past brick walls! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I struggled a lot in this course, but it was a good thing. There were many weekends where I hated what I wrote and started from scratch 2-3x. But the more and more you learn to lean into the process, the more you learn. Dont get too stuck in your head; just try things. Verlyn is incredibly kind and will help guide you through the troughs of sorrow. One thing  I actually would have liked to read more poetry in the class. The scrapbooking idea Verlyn came up with was cute. It was kind of hard to stay on the bandwagon but I really appreciated seeing these little visual glimpses into peoples lives (and pics of their pets!)",
                "This course is incredible. I loved the standing assignment and the freedom to write whatever we want, I loved the readings that accompanied it, and I loved the community built by this class. I loved the attention Prof Klinkenborg gave to each of us, and I really felt cared for. I loved how much discussion there was between everyone in the class, and I loved reading out the bad sentences as well. No weaknesses about this class at all :)",
                "Strengths: Freedom!!! So much freedom to let our creativity and TRUE written voices come out. Also, Professor Klinkenborg is exceptional.\r\nWeaknesses: Also freedom!!! It can be a bit overwhelming, having no guidelines for our two pages each week. But as I mention above, it's probably worth it. I think this year it was hard because my inner voice was often influenced by the sadness and negativity in the world... sometimes (in my opinion) having a prompt or guideline would have provided me a necessary nudge AWAY from what was hijacking my mind when I was trying to think of new paper topics. I also wish that everyone got at least one chance for their piece to be peer reviewed (some got pieces reviewed multiple times, some, not at all). I think it's a really special experience to have a piece discussed by the class, and all of us deserve that chance!"

                "Professor Klinkenborg did a tremendous job bringing the class together. First off, we submitted our work in a shared Google Drive so we could read each other's pieces. He also created a Scrapbook folder where we could add pictures, music, writing that interested us. By getting to know other students in the class, I felt much more comfortable engaging in discussions and writing about personal subjects.",
                "Verlyn held drop-in office hours multiple times a week. Even though the course was small (about fifteen), the drop-in office hours were what made me feel engaged with Verlyn as an instructor. It was during these meetings when I felt like I was learning most.",
                "worked\r\n-the 10 minute break in between (I cannot emphasize this enough this is essential for longer seminars to reduce zoom fatigue and encourage student engagement)\r\n-the class google drive encouraged community \r\n-the some sentences anonymous weekly discussion encouraged engagement\r\n-the open class dialogue prioritized student voices\r\n-the open and frequent and regular zoom office hours (as opposed to doodle \/ calendly scheduled)\r\n\r\nimproved\r\n-zoom seminars really need to be small enough to all fit on one gallery screen",

It is a low-stress class that leads to concrete improvements in your writing. Verlyn is also an amazing professor that any student would be lucky to have. However, if you don't ask, you get zero feedback about your grade during the entire semester, so you should be okay with that if you decide to take the class. The focus is truly on your growth as a writer.",
                "If you're terrified by the idea of choosing your own topics each week or would prefer to focus on content instead of style, this is probably not the class for you (although maybe that's more reason to take it...). Given that you write ~700 words a week and do not have a final paper, the workload is manageable and enjoyable. To get the most out of the class, though, you should be aware that you will have to put extra effort in. I recommend going to weekly office hours and working on revising your pieces independently (there is no external incentive to revise).",
                "I would recommend this course. Verlyn is a fantastic professor who cares about his students, and the assignments each week allow you to really take a deep dive into your work and focus on making it better.",
                "It depends. If you want to leave your writing workshop with polished pieces to submit\/publish, this is not that course. You dont do revisions here or get much in the way of line edits. But its great for figuring out what youre interested in and for developing a regular practice of writing.",
                "Yes!",
                "YES. YOU WILL LEARN AND BECOME BETTER",
                "Yes. Great for anyone who wants to improve their writing and learn more about the world of creative non fiction. Also for those looking for small, intimate classes.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Regardless of your major, this class is worth taking. Writing about yourself and the world around you is a wonderful skill to have and this course teaches it beautifully.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! This is a class that erases a lot of your preconceived notions about writing. If you are willing to let go of past practices you've been taught, you can improve and learn a lot more than you'd expect.",
                "Yes. No question. Verlyn is a great teacher. The assignments are consistent and fun.",
                "If you want to learn how to learn how to write sentences that stick and beginning to find your voice, definitely take this class. I am so grateful I took it. It was especially helpful during this time.",
                "Absolutely!!!! Not only is it a class that you have complete freedom to write what you want, it's also a relaxing\/stress-free class. I'm glad I took it during the pandemic, when it was so much to write about. The class gave me the room to think through my thoughts, and then write them down.",
                "Yes, one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale! Its transformative and youll become aware of all the ways you censor yourself and your thoughts due to the strictness of academic writing. I came out a better writer, thinker, and person.",
                "YES YES YES! This course is incredible. If you want to become a better writer and make some friends, TAKE THIS COURSE!!!",
                "In a heartbeat! Anyone who wants to become a better writer should absolutely take this course. You will come to love the art of writing, and to love your classmates by the nature of this class, it's inevitable you'll leave with new friends."
