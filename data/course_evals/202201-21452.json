                "I read a variety of grata works, learned techniques of close reading, became more comfortable writing English papers",
                "I got a chance to read a wonderful array of classical (Greek, Roman, Shakespearianthough I will admit Shakespeare may not be truly or strictly \"Classical\") texts and tragedies. And we got to unpack these in a good amount of detail, and I got to improve my writing skills via writing about these texts.",
                "knowledge of foundational works, what tragedy is, analysis while thinking of the contemporary world",
                "I learned how to closely read, analyze, and discuss all kinds of tragedies spanning from the Greek plays to 20th century adaptations and re-imaginings. I also learned how to discuss fascinating political, social, and philosophical issues through a literary lens. Additionally, I felt like I really improved my analytical writing skills.",
                "Great insight into the tragic genre and ability to write about political themes and messages in literature",

Professor Ellermann's feedback on papers were quite helpful for improving writing, and he was reasonably clear about what he wanted to see in our writing.",
                "I loved this courseby following tragedy from 5th century Athens to its modern iterations, I developed a newfound appreciation for the genre and an ability to contextualize contemporary tragedies in light of their broader literary history. And, of course, I was able to read some truly incredible plays!"

                "This course is wonderful. Professor Ellermann is kind and engaging, the reading list is excellent, and the workload is manageable. Professor Ellermann gives wonderful feedback on papers and is willing to meet with students to discuss further. Only weakness is that office hours are limited and inconvenient. Would be better to have more office hours in the middle of the week.",
                "cant be helped but it moves quickly so if youre sick one day youll miss a lot",
                "The list of readings is incredible and full of works that I've always wanted to read but never had the opportunity to. Professor Ellermann was an amazing instructor who helped us broaden our discussions while keeping us tied to the text. His mini lectures at the beginning of each class were also really helpful in grounding my understanding of the text at hand.",
                "Great selection of books but I wouldve liked it to be a little slower with fewer books to allow more time for each",
                "The strengths are that it has a lot of very strong texts that cover a lot of different eras of tragedy. A weakness is that not enough time is spent on tragic modernity which is by far the hardest part of the course to understand.",
                "Professor Ellermann was a great instructor. He was caring and the lectures before class discussion were always helpful. The readings were by and large very interesting, but perhaps the syllabus could do with some revision with regard to some of the modernist plays. I felt as though the class was slightly disengaged with a few of the slower, lengthier, texts, and it made for difficult conversation.",
                "This course is amazing! I think everyone should take it before they graduateand I don't just mean English majors. The course's reading list is incredible; I think most people in my class developed a newfound love for classical Greek tragedies, a passion for King Lear, and an interest in the often overlooked Roman tragedies. Professor Ellermann has done an excellent job of organizing this course; it's all student discussion, but he expertly guided the discussion and pointed us to specific passages that grounded our conversation."

                "Absolutely. Wonderful course with books that everyone should read!",
                "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in learning more about a small set of classical texts/tragedies (Greek to Roman to Shakespeare) and who are interested in reading some very compelling modern texts. It was quite engaging and I really enjoyed what I got out of the class and readings! The essays helped me improve my writing and thinking. For me it was a bit of work because I struggle with close reading a bit (and often get engaged by other questions instead), but it was a good learning experience.",
                "yes, its the kind of yale course i was excited to take when i got here",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student, regardless of whether the student has done much literary analysis or has had much exposure to the Greek tragic genre. I learned an immense amount and had a ton of fun while doing so, and the class has made me want to take lots of English classes in the future.",
                "Absolutely- a great opportunity to read some extremely important plays in the context of a great class",
                "Yes, the texts we cover are very engaging and interesting and the class discussions foster an environment of learning.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Professor Ellermann is fantastic and a great facilitator of discussion and the works on the syllabus are very rich.",
