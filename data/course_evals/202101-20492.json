                "I learned to pull interesting facts from an in-depth historical overview and relate them to my specific interests.",

It was also fascinating to learn about the various identity crises Russia went through and what Russian politicians, thinkers, poets, and artists had to say about those crises. I developed critical reading and discussion-leading skills through the course.",
                "I thought I gained an understanding of Russian history and culture.",
                "Insights into Russian culture from the 1800s to the modern-day (2000s)",
                "You will learn the broad sweep of Russian cultural history in the modern age and develop a good overall understanding of themes, issues and trends.  It is not a course that delves into much detail, however, with one lecture devoted to each topic.  I enjoyed this wide lens though as it meant you were exposed to a number of topics and could delve deeper through the readings.",
                "A thorough understanding of Russian history, chiefly from the time of Peter and Catherine to the present day",
                "I developed a familiarity with modern Russian cultural history, including literature, music, art, politics, and religion.",
                "I developed more skills with being able to critically discuss and engage with coursework with fellow students. Each discussion section was an excellent time to get to understand the course material more deeply by openly dissecting and discussing them."

                "Strengths: The culture classes (Prof. MacKay) were really interesting to me, and the reason why I took the course, I really looked forward to section\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Between 100-300 pages of reading per week which to me is a lot for an intro class, some of the history lectures were difficult for me to follow (but I also don't have any background in history or Russia)",
                "This course is a really fascinating look at Russia. However, lectures occasionally went over dry or somewhat less interesting aspects of Russian history. Also, the readings were a bit unmanageable.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Carefully chosen, varied, and interesting texts\r\n- Lecturers had clear passion and a large knowledge base for the subject. \r\n- Material presented in both an engaging and informative format\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Date for the final exam/final paper was left very vague until near the end of the course, which made it hard for students to plan reading week.",
                "Overall very good. Sometimes the lectures moved very fast and I had trouble interpreting everything being said. Sometimes I felt there was a disconnect between the \"history\" and the \"culture\" lectures.",
                "The lectures were good but could have been better structured with more slides to make it easier to get the main points.",
                "I think this is a wonderful course overall, but I had some minor issues with communication about the midterm and final. For one, Im not sure it was reasonable to give such a lengthy exam to be written during a 24-hour period. Another minor point was just that the communication about the date of the final exam was very late, making it difficult to plan how to study and prepare. Overall, I thought the lectures and readings were incredibly engaging.",
                "The instructors are lovely and the lectures keep you engaged as the topic changes each week.  The readings are also well chosen and interesting.  The atmosphere of the class (even online) felt open and exploratory so I looked forward to going to class.  Sections were definitely when the discussions became more nuanced which was nice as they gave you a chance to dive deeper into ideas that had caught your attention in lecture.",
                "Great course; good that it combines historical and cultural learning. Wouldn't change much.",

I would also recommend it to a non history major who wants to explore Russian history as the lectures are easy to follow and the instructors are super helpful and open to chat in office hours about any topics that interest you.
