                "Strengths: The strength of this course was the professor. Irina Andreevna is one of the kindest, most nurturing teacher that I've ever met. She really cares about your learning but is also incredibly understanding in general. I thought the classes were well-organized and responded well to the questions or weaknesses of the class. The homeworks were very helpful and I always received feedback on my work. There was also a good mix of textbook exercises and conversation practice. I believe that at the start of the semester, there was some discussion about incorporating readings in Russian into the class, but that wasn't really done for the most part because the homeworks themselves were already a fair amount of work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The one drawback of this class is completely unavoidable, but it bears repeating that this class is a huge time commitment. Although the individual homeworks are not extremely taxing, they do require between 1-2 hours of your attention every day. For some reason I found L4 in particular to be especially time-consuming, maybe because there were more questions that required you to think about your answer and put together responses lucidly, as opposed to grammar drills. For me, this is a worthwhile investment and I don't think there's any way around it, but I would say that you need to be very prepared to put in the hours, and your schedule should accommodate that. And I think that it's important to be very committed to learning the language, because sometimes the work can be a slog and it can be difficult to get through.",
                "Well taught and interesting but everyday language is a grind",
                "The strict structure of the course, as well as Irina's adherence to the syllabus, makes it very easy to follow and stay on top of your work."

                "Absolutely, if you're interested in learning Russian, especially since (in my experience learning Russian here) the courses are a gradual accretion of the various elements that you learn about case and aspect. Qualitatively speaking, I think the class gave me a much greater degree of comfort and facility with expressing myself. I am by no means fluent, but I have gained a better grasp over the grammar, sentence structure, and common phrases. The improvement is noticeable not only in terms of reading and listening, but also in speaking as well, which to me is the hardest part of learning any language when you're in a different country.",
                "Yes!",
                "Absolutely. If you want to improve your Russian, this is the course for you, but only if you're willing to do the legwork.",
                "To any students interested in studying Russian, I would absolutely recommend this course. The course material builds on each skill/unit very well. The instructor and TF were excellent at explaining the intuition behind the nuances of the language."
