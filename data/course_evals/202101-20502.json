This course picks up right where the previous left off, but because it's designed to be taught in the fall semester as a second year of a two year sequence, you start with a review that focuses on school and getting to know one another. But then we dive right into grammar, taking everything up a notch. Who knew there could be so many motion verbs... the list just gets longer and more complicated. And reported speech on every single quiz and test--can't forget that! And lastly we covered participles participles participles. We read some absurdist Russian, watched Soviet Winnie the Pooh, and read a story called Pelageya. My Russian skills have definitely improved, even if I feel limited in the things I can say, and I no longer really have to think about noun declensions. It all starts to click.",

                "Sometimes it felt as though the contrast in teaching style between the TF and Professor didn't mesh well and hindered learning. That's not to say that both weren't excellent, just that their approaches were extremely different.",
                "very strong course. best foreign language option at yale",
                "Strengths: the class' pace. Some students clearly struggled with the pace of the course, but I thrived. I think if it were any slower I wouldn't have as strong a grasp on the grammar, or more generally, the language. You really have to know what you're getting yourself into when you take a class called \"Intensive Russian,\" especially when marketed as a course for students with \"superior linguistic ability.\" This is no joke. Also, Constantine and Ilia are fantastic teachers. I think Zoom certainly hindered their abilities greatly, but Constantine knows his stuff inside and out, and coupled with Ilia's engaging teaching style and use of multimedia, it worked really well. \r\nWeaknesses: the amount of homework became a chore. Felt tedious. Some days we had upwards of 15-20 pages of workbook work to complete, and it wasn't teaching or reinforcing anything. Also, we started having to teach ourselves a lot of the material, then to be tested/quizzed on it, which is not right in a language class. The point of class time is to learn the material, and we did not always do that. We'd spend needless minutes answering inane questions or going over extremely simple concepts, to the detriment of actually learning the most important and most difficult things. We never really spent adequate time on participle formation and usage. And reported speech was barely touched upon in class; I learned most of it through the quizzes/tests -- which is definitely not how it should be. And much like the previous iteration in the fall, the disconnect between Constantine and Ilia was palpable. Especially when it came to homework -- turn in homework to Constantine, and w/o fail in 48 hours you'd have it back. Turning it in to Ilia, however, was a futile effort, as it'd be a real game of Russian roulette. Is he going to give it back or not? Did I waste my time or not? And lastly, the breakout room partnering up stuff -- some students were really, quite frankly, sucky partners to have in a language class. You could get a delightfully engaged partner, or someone completely checked out, lost, and not aware of what was going on. Really doesn't serve any party well in a language class when you have to carry the weight and then report back to the whole class what you discussed... if you didn't discuss anything! But alas, that is a problem with most language classes.",
                "The class does a fantastic job of leading you to understand grammar in a deep and instinctual way. We practiced it a lot in class and it was really cool to see early on in the semester my peers using all 6 cases in a sentence naturally after learning them only last semester. After finishing this class (including last semester's 125), I realized that although we got speaking practice and sentence-construction practice in class and homework, we are kind of trained to only speak in a particular way; although we're very familiar with certain constructions and talking about specific topics like those treated in the plot of the video companion to this class or units that we spent lots of time on like travel and city life, I felt at the end that I am somewhat limited by these topics. This is all to say that I think there should be a much more heavy emphasis on being creative with your speech and writing -- one presentation about politics with tons of unfamiliar vocab and a couple non-templatic writing prompts in the last few homeworks doesn't quite cut it. The major rebuttal to this point is that we don't have time for this in this class, and that's valid, but I think the class would be truly intensive and get you up to an advanced level if it was restructured to consistently integrate this.\r\nThis is OK though -- I presume that L5 courses help expand your range of ability and in general this class is a superb foundation for further Russian study and practice. After only one year, it's great to feel somewhat close to fluency and feel like I just need one more push, like a trip to Russia or a structurally different L5 class, to get there.",

                "The amount of homework made sense, it was what I expected for an accelerated language class.",
                "The strengths of this course are the speed and precision with which grammar is covered. The weakness is that we sometimes focused too much on topics that the class considered to be rather easy and then rushed harder topics. Moreover, there was sometimes simply too much homework. In the end, the homework was modified but I still feel like I would have been more enthusiastic about Russian with less homework.",

                "know what you are getting into. it really does not make sense to take this course unless you have a knack of learning foreign languages/know some russian already. it is lots and lots of work. that having been said, it is very rewarding and allows you to get a lot farther in russian than you would on normal sequence.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, but only if you truly believe you are of \"superior linguistic ability.\" This is NOT A JOKE! About halfway through the semester, I could feel a tangible drop in engagement from several students, and it really hinders the whole experience if people just aren't following the topics. Some days, about half of the class was participating and following along, and the other half was just... lost. Similar issues occurred when we started discussing readings in class; the same two or three people would chime in, and the rest just sat there... dazed and confused. We all want to learn Russian (or at least, I would think that is the case in a class such as this) so why not put the effort in? \r\nAlso, be prepared for a lot of homework, that at times, can feel like busy work. Pages upon pages of the same exercises: describe your doctor's appointment, tell your friend you're sick and not going to make it to class, explain your symptoms. That's in the book maybe five, six times? A little repetition never hurt anyone, but there is quite a bit. This class requires a lot of time outside of class, and a lot of motivation. I enjoyed myself because I love language classes and learning the minutiae of the grammatical structure of a language. So you definitely need to be passionate about what you're learning. This class can be a chore, or it can be the joy of your life. After all, you're learning from perhaps the best Russian professor in the world, Constantine Muravnik, so take every opportunity you get.",
                "I would definitely recommend it if you want a shorter commitment to Russian classes and if you're up for the nature of the strengths and weaknesses of this course. I probably wouldn't take an intensive language class again, because you do miss out on some of the fun parts of language learning with the necessity to speed through material and drill certain skills more than others. But the great part about an intensive class is that most everyone in the class is up for it and loves language learning as much as you do, and it is definitely an experience that will jump out at me when I remember about my time at Yale. Great community in the class and you really do see so much progress in a year, benefit from the pace of an intensive course in other ways, and see a lot of Russian every week.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in Russian language this is definitely a great class to take. Be aware that it is intensive! There are high expectations and a lot of work, but it is very rewarding.",
