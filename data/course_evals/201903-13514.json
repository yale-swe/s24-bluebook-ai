    "This seminar taught me about long-form journalism and how to craft a nonfiction essay over a longer time frame using interview material. I learned how to merge facts and reportorial information with vivid detail and close observation (which was more on the creative side) while still bringing clarity to the piece.",
    "I learnt to read with more attention to writers' stylistic choices and techniques. More importantly, I learnt to write and research extensively on a single topic for a long period of time (through the second and third papers). This really helped me develop my attention to detail and structure, gain an intuition for details to include and omit.",
    "The primary thing I developed during this course was my writing skills. I learned how to structure both short and long pieces of writing. I learned to differentiate between different genres of writing that I had previously conflated. I also learned how to craft a narrative out of disparate personal experiences and anecdotes.",
    "I learned how to write creative non-fiction-- a style that I found refreshing compared to the heavily structured academic texts that I am writing constantly for other courses. It was a great class for exploring my interests as a writer , and getting to read classic and fascinating environmental literature and journalism.",
    "We practiced the ability to write one environmental themes, honing various aspects of writing including style, pacing, plot, etc..."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked the fact that we had the choice of building on the second essay and essentially make it the final paper, but I think more short writing prompts or exercises would have been helpful. I also wish we had gotten our first assignment back earlier in the semester so I could see how I was doing in the class.",
    "Strengths: loved the readings and the assignments. prof burdick moderates discussions well and i really enjoyed the class sessions. the workshops and detailed feedback were incredibly helpful too\r\nWeaknesses: minor point, sometimes there was a lack of clarity on assigned readings until the day before class, making it hard to plan. would be nice if the syllabus was more detailed and covered these bases.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed class each week. It felt like time well spent, where we really dug into the readings and our own writing. I appreciated the pacing of the course, as well as the many opportunities to give and receive constructive criticism with the rest of the class. I also enjoyed Professor Burdick's teaching style. That being said, I wish I got more feedback from Professor Burdick. He didn't write much on our papers (and usually took a while to give feedback) and frequently told us not to worry about the grade but ultimately graded quite harshly. Workload can also be quite heavy at times.",
    "The main strength of this course is the opportunity it presents to focus on writing. While some environmental themes and topics are important to the course, the craft of writing takes center stage. Additionally, having someone as knowledgeable and approachable as professor Burdick is an extremely valuable asset to the course. The main weakness I can identify in the course is in the pacing of some of the assignments. The first and second assignments are due very close together, which made getting a good draft in for the second assignment difficult.",
    "Strengths:  The class provided absolute freedom to write about whatever you were interested in so it was excellent for exploring my interests. The readings, especially the short-form articles, were very engaging and lots of fun to read. The best aspect of this course was its small size and impressive discussion on every students writing. There is no shortage of feedback, especially if you take advantage of office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class lacked some structure and most prompts were very open-ended so it did not push you to challenge yourself by undertaking different styles or formats, also it would benefit from more workshops on specific writing techniques and avoidance of common pitfalls. Also, you may often read a long book than only discuss it for 15 minutes which can be frustrating. Grades are not stressed in the class, which is enjoyable... but I did often feel blind-sided by my final grade on an assignment after Alan seemed very complimentary of the initial drafts.",
    "I think it's a great course. I think sometimes I was a little unsure about what the readings were simply because I'm not an organized person, the syllabus didn't outline things week to week, and I perpetually neglected to write down the next weeks readings at the end of class\/I lost my notes when I did. It would have been a little helpful if there were announcements on canvas, but then again this was the result of my disorganization and I can't fault Professor Burdick."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to those who are interested in nonfiction, reportorial-like writing. The feedback I received from Professor Burdick and the class was tremendously helpful for my own writing skills. However, there's not a lot of structure with regards to actual course content.",
    "Yes! especially if you want to write about space (\"environment\" in writing about the environment is very broadly defined), learn to be more observant, and learn to work on a single topic \/ project for a while.",
    "I would recommend this course without a doubt--my writing was absolutely strengthened, and I generally enjoyed the assignments and loved my class--but I think it is important to note that this class requires a good amount of effort (not a drawback--just important to know!), and grading is a bit unexpected. I turned in assignments that I was proud of and did not always feel like I received the clearest feedback on the grade even after going to office hours. Also, sometimes you would do readings or short writing exercises but they would never get brought up or used in class, which was disappointing. Overall, though, I think this is a crucial class to take, and it's a different type of work from what we usually do at Yale. I found it very enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Anyone interesting in writing could benefit from the assignments and feedback given in this course.",
    "Yes. It is an excellent course for first-time exposure to environmental journalism if that is an interest of yours, but it can equally serve anyone who wants to look at their writing through a fine-toothed comb. It stressed constant editing and helps you find your voice as a writer while drawing from the expertise of environmental writing from the past fifty plus years.",
    "I think this was a great course, Professor Burdick was a fun professor that seemed very invested in our growth as writers. It was chill but also felt productive and was something I looked forward to every week."
