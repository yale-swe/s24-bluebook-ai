   "comments": [
    "I learned basic micro economics in this class.",
    "I learned a lot about micro and I learned how to think like an economist",
    "I had never taken an economics course prior to this one, and I learned a lot about how people think and how that can affect their decisions. I\r\nlearned how to see math in a more applied way, and started to learn more about decision making in the real world and why certain corporations work the way they do.",
    "I learned microeconomic analysis and many economic principles. Having taken econ in high school, I now feel more comfortable in economics than I did before.",
    "I learned some basic intro economics concepts and techniques",
    "I learned a lot about general introductory microeconomics, but this course was particularly useful in engaging the math component of the course that the lecture supposedly fails to tackle.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics. I learned about many things ranging from Supply and Demand up to Labor and Externalities.",
    "I developed an understanding of how to approach problems from an economic frame of thought.",
    "Gained mostly problem-solving skills because the professor would put students on the spot to answer questions, but not in a pressurizing way, it was definitely constructive. Obviously, I learned basic Econ techniques as well.",
    "Independent learning skills utilizing online resources.",
    "Learned all about microeconomics and how to efficiently work with study partners to complete the P-Sets......",
    "I learned so much about economics! It was my first time ever taking an economics class and it was great",
    "Learned the fundamentals of microeconomics and their basic applications",
    "I learned quite a lot about consumer behavior and decision making. I also got better at drawing the weird flipped graphs that economists use."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness - slides were thin, so reviewing them after class was difficult as some content was missing",
    "A strength was in the slides with made the lectures more interesting and in some of the material. But at times the class, both the format and the concepts, were quite boring. I know there are some topics that need to be covered, but I wonder if there's a way to make it more engaging while doing so, perhaps by truly making the so-called seminar class a seminar, instead of a small lecture as it was.",
    "Excellent preparedness but sometimes I wanted to be more involved in the class",
    "The content is very strong and connects well. The class itself is very fast and I did not feel prepared for many exams. The problem sets did not relate much to the exam content and classes were very lecture-heavy which I did not expect from a seminar course.",
    "My teacher was very nice and accommodating. She taught well and always posted class notes to review. The only problem was that I often did not feel prepared for the wording on the tests, but that is likely a personal problem.",
    "Strengths in the course include Professor Martis genuine desire for the students to succeed (she is always willing to stay after and talk and encourages question asking as much as possible). The PowerPoints are promptly updated and she emphasizes concepts that are most important. A weakness is that there isnt a textbook to follow, so youre basically left to the PowerPoints.",
    "The strengths are that it teaches a foundation of microeconomics. The weaknesses are the method by which this information is conveyed. There isn't a standardized textbook that is used so all knowledge is based off of slides which can be a bit confusing at times. I think making the slides easier to understand and fully using a textbook would help understanding of the concepts.",
    "I enjoyed the smaller class size and content in the course.",
    "Strengths would be the accessibility of the professor, and the ability to simply raise your hand to ask a question. A weakness is that the professor would sometimes rush through slides, so I had to spend significant time reviewing lecture slides because she skipped over them entirely but still expected us to know the material on them.",
    "I could not understand the professor's english. It is incomprehensible.",
    "Strength: very interesting lessons that can be applied to the real world, the examples on the slides are fun to attempt (yet fail...), collaboration is key to success,\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too fast paced, one example isnt enough to grasp the concept, math is deemed to be so easy when its not (in certain lessons, not all), \r\n\r\nHow it could be inproved: well I would say to go slower but the pace now covers all the concepts... so only go slower if you want to cover less concepts?",
    "This course could be improved by having more frequent references to outside sources or authors; I found it useful to approach the same topic through different lenses and explanations. This is to say, less of an emphasis on personal power point presentations. \r\nA strength of this class was its rigour, difficult problem sets, and engaging in-class material.",
    "Professor Maria Sarti is amazing. It was a little bit hard to follow her pace in the beginning but she is extremely willing to help us whenever we need to, and her slides are very helpful. I never had to read the book.",
    "Material was covered at a fast pace and was a bit of a struggle to keep up. Also, a lot of time was dedicated to some subjects that saw little importance with regard to testing and some subjects that showed up in evaluations were glosses over",
    "Sometimes the problem sets were kind of confusingly worded, and there wasn't much of a way to directly ask Prof. Marti about it before the problem sets were due. This was less of a problem once problem sets started being due Wednesday, because office hours were on Monday."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes - provides a strong basis for microeconomics and economics in general",
    "Perhaps. You will learn the concepts but it was quite boring and by the end I completely stopped paying attention in class, electing instead to teach myself the concepts during the p-sets and in preparation for the final.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I fell in love with the subject material and had a really good time learning it and grasping the material. I will say the student has to put a lot of their own work in outside of class. I went through all the lecture slides every weekend and wrote questions and mastered how to do the problems. The slides are very important for Professor Saezs class!",
    "Yes, Prof. Marti was very nice. The class was pretty engaging and the material was relatively easy to follow.",
    "Yes this is a fantastic introduction to microeconomics. Concepts are taught clearly and being in a seminar environment is extremely conducive to learning.",
    "I would, but only if you are deadset on being an Econ major because the information is a bit difficult for those who have little to no Econ background.",
    "Yes! I found the course interesting and felt that I got a lot out of it.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course for anyone thinking of taking Intro Micro and on the fence between the lecture and the seminar. I did not take the lecture, but from conversations with friends who did, the issue with skipping slides is much worse in the lecture and asking questions is difficult if not impossible. Take the seminar if you have the chance.",
    "I would say to go to office hours.",
    "If you have great economic intuition, take it! If you love self learning, take it! If you can grasp concepts after one example, take it!",
    "I definitely would! This course gives anyone the tools to better understand the markets around them, as well as the choices they make when they are consuming. I would recommend the student to take advantage of offic hours, and to work collaboratively with his peers--microeconomics is a difficult subject to learn by yourself, and requires outside help.",
    "I would, very useful",
    "If you are interested in the subject, go for it. For more casual and\/or uncertain students, it wasnt the most engaging course",
    "Yes, I'd say it's a good starter to microeconomics. Prof. Marti also has a lot of memorable examples on her lecture slides, and emphasizes all the content pretty regularly."
