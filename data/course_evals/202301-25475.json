                "In this class, the skill that we practiced the most is asking not just what happened but also thinking about the historical implications, effects on today, and analysis on other topics when studying history. Through both primary and secondary sources, we think about understanding different parts and questions especially when it comes to connecting this class to modern day American politics and labor. This class also provides a foundation on the history of labor in the United States and the rhyming patterns that we see."

                "Strengths: Prof. Klein is brilliant, every one in the class was engaged and thoughtful, covered a lot of content pretty in-depth\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Really heavy workload, definitely the highest of any Yale class I've been in. Sometimes felt like I was just barely keeping up with everything. Also for the research paper, while there were deadlines for individual pieces along the way, there really wasn't much feedback on them so it felt like I was flying a little blind.",
                "Strengths: really a unique and important class, well taught, engaging subjects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can jump right in a little, so it was a struggle to adjust to the workload and background knowledge in the beginning",
                "While the course is well-constructed and the syllabus progresses nicely, I think the sheer amount of required readings and viewings was at times overwhelming and worked to the detriment of the course. There are certainly weeks for which the syllabus can be tightened.",
                "The strength and weaknesses of the course lie in the readings. I understand this was a graduate course changed into an undergraduate course, and I fear that the level of reading was just too high. The syllabus explained that readings are around 150 pages, but for I would say at least a third of the weeks in the semester--though maybe more--the readings hit more than 200 and sometimes 300 pages (especially the readings on Marx, Polanyi, and Wood). The historical context is important and more information too, but I wish that there could be more selected readings to focus on. If there were to be that many readings, it would be best to organize which sections to skim and which sections to priortize. Especially for an undergraduate 100-level course, the readings were quite intense and sometimes lost me, rendering it difficult to engage in the seminar discussion. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, because the readings were just so good, I have went out of my way to get my own copy of them to read in the summer.  The readings themselves were excellent, but as stated above, the experience could have been better if there were less/more curated for the undergraduate level.  I wonder if assuming the readings were more manageable, there could be a mid-term assignment that helped us connect the readings throughout the week so there could be some better way to remember the content of the course in a meaningful way."

                "I really don't know. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, this was one of the most intellectually hefty and engaging courses I've taken. You will learn so much in this course and the approach this class takes to understanding labor history and political economy are hugely important and often left out of other history courses. I really do believe all people studying history, and particularly U.S. history need this perspective.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the course is really difficult. I think you have to want to dive into this stuff and really dedicate yourself to it and it's probably helpful for the rest of your course load to be on the easier side.",
                "Definitely! Although it's a decent amount of reading and work, it's not only a great subject but also a good history seminar, for those interested in historical writing and practice.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in labor organizing and the history of American capitalism, you should take this course. And if youre, not, you really should take this course.",
                "Overwhelmingly, yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to driven students who are interested in a survey of American labor and economic history. If you are willing to dedicate the time to this course, you can certainly gain a lot from it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially those interested in labor politics and especially those who seek to imagine alternatives to capitalism. The class itself does not go deep into this, but instead looks at the history of those who tried to reimagine and change the state of labor. I came out of this class with not just a deeper understanding of the history of US labor politics, but also with a deeper understanding of what needs to be done today."
