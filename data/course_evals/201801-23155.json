   "comments": [
    "The course could be made more rigorous in software engineering.",
    "The class was very well structures and interesting.",
    "lectures on coding were not that relevant, would have been interesting to have more guest lectures",
    "Strengths: With my extremely busy schedule this semester, I so appreciated the flexibility of this course. I appreciated that this class did not seek to take up more time from students than needed. Many professors try to fill up class time with meaningless content just to kill time, but when we finished early, Xenios simply allowed us to leave. Later in the semester, when the class was much more self-driven, class time turned into brief weekly meetings, and more time was spent outside of class with our groups, coding our projects into existence. I really appreciated that Xenios shortened formal class time to allow us extra time to work on our projects.  It's difficult to find Yale professors with this level of empathy for our hectic schedules.\r\n\r\nI also really liked that we had the opportunity to hear problem pitches from real physicians and translate these pitches into prototypes by the end of the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many. I think that the lectures on JS, HTML, and CSS at the beginning of the class were well-intentioned, but I'm not sure how effective they were. Maybe a more interactive workshop-style lesson would be more engaging\/effective.",
    "It being a Project-based course makes it interesting, but the first 2\/3 of the course was too slow \/ could be put into a much shorter number of weeks, and lectures could be more engaging",
    "This course was well organized and very engaging. I enjoyed the structure and the personal attention that the Professor gave to each student always."

    "Yes. It DOESN'T count as an elective for the CS major. But you should still take it, if you need a science credit.",
    "Of course, the class was very informative, interactive, and interesting.",
    "really awesome project based class, not that much of a workload but you learn a lot about prototyping (you get what you put in)",
    "Yes! This is not only a SC credit, but a great way to have ownership over a project and carry it from ideation to prototyping for a real client with a real need.",
    "If you're looking for a project-based course with not too much workload, yes"
