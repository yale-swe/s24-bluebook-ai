   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of knowledge, especially a new way to do hardware generation, which is using CHP program.",
    "VLSI; chip layout; asynchronous design and compilation of code into circuits.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. You learn a ton about VLSI (very large scale integration) and designing integrated circuits. You learn to WRITE CODE that compiles into a set of production rules that is essentially a recipe for constructing any type of asynchronous circuit you can imagine. It's dope.",
    "This course tied together so many aspects of my EENG and CPSC classes in one elegant, well-taught package. From EENG 200 (intro to MOSFETS), to CPSC 202 (binary logic) , this was a fantastic implementation of concepts in a more concrete, focused context. I learned layout tools, analysis techniques, and lots of appreciation for the electronics that are now commonplace.",
    "Learnt how to compile an algorithm to a silicon chip.",
    "I learned not only how to synthesize microchips and designs for microchips, but also how to construct the tools that check microchip designs for errors.",
    "This is an incredibly difficult course, but I came out of it knowing how to do VLSI for asynchronous circuit designs. We learned how asynchronous circuit design works and then actually implemented our own custom design as a final project. We also got a bit into compilers since we had to build a compiler that converts CHP code into ACT production rules."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class is pretty good in the class organization.",
    "Strengths: a relatively uncommon area of study\/research, which can be exciting to work with. Rajit is a great professor. Class and assignments are very fun; evaluations (short quizzes + one midterm) are no sweat. You spend most of your time drawing colored rectangles on a computer, which is a ton of fun.\r\n\r\nCons: psets could be very challenging, and final project was much more complicated than we realized. May just be growing pains associated with a new class, but definitely be reasonable when selecting final projects. We were working with a lot of new tools written by the professor or his lab, so there were a lot of bugs\/undocumented behaviors.",
    "Strengths: Fascinating content, steep learning curve, fantastic teaching.\r\nWeaknesses: Minor kinks to be worked out (first time it's being taught).",
    "The strength is undeniably Professor Manohar. He is relentlessly enthusiastic, an excellent lecturer, and has structured the class in an effective and engaging way. The lab-based grading is ideal for this type of course, and the quizzes and midterm were exactly in line with the lectures, making them very fair. My only weakness would be the unnecessarily huge amount of busywork that was Lab 4 (using a previous lab's compiler to lay out a large function block). I felt that I gained the experience needed for the final project after spending 8 hours on it, but then needed to put in about 20 more to finish.",
    "I think stressing \"good chip layout\" for about 5 minutes at the end of one of the lectures during the mid point of the course could save people from some frustration down the road. In general, this course was absolutely incredible.",
    "While the material is interesting, the assignments require more time than any other class I have ever taken.",
    "Very well taught and material is very interesting and useful.",
    "It was an amazing course with ample opportunity for help from the instructor.",
    "The strength of the course is that you are forced to learn a lot, it all make sense, and you come out of it pretty satisfied with the new skills you gained related to silicon compilation. The course could be improved with more office hours later in the day - consulting with the professor was absolutely necessary for the course since the programs he provided us would sometimes have bugs, but he only had morning office hours that frequently interfered with classes. Also, it was hard to tell exactly what material would be on his quizzes sometimes."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. This is definitely a very good class.",
    "If you like puzzles and are interested in learning about how chips work\/VLSI, definitely go for it. Just make sure you are realistic about the time requirements.",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes.\r\nRajit is one of the best teachers in Yale STEM. He's so passionate and so brilliant. The material is so complex but somehow feels eminently understandable at the end of the course. Please do yourself a favor and take this. You'll learn how to construct sophisticated integrated circuits with 5-6 lines of code. Don't try to deny that's dope.",
    "YES! Rajit is truly exceptional, and you should do anything to get a course with him. This course itself gave me a concrete comparison to how complex and detailed physical circuit design is, while applying parallel programming techniques and combining the entirety of the intro sequence of EE and much of CS into an applied course. I don't normally take detailed notes, but this class had me glued to my notebook with sketches and concepts. It was so interesting and incredibly satisfying to see your hand-drawn circuits work. Plus, you get to have your final projects actually printed in a foundry! For free! If you have any interest in how chips are designed and the intricacies inherent in that process, you HAVE to take this course.",
    "This is the best engineering course I have taken at Yale, and in general probably one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It is a lot of work, but Rajit is incredibly dedicated to helping every single student succeed. He is a brilliant lecturer capable of explaining anything with ease. He's incredibly active on Piazza and very willing to meet with students outside of class. His email response times are legendary.\r\n\r\nYou spend the semester learning about asynchronous chip design, with the final goal of designing and implementing your own chip that is sent out for fabrication. Even with numerous helpful tools at your disposal, the process takes a very long time, and towards the middle \/ end of the semester, you will easily be spending 30+ hours a week working on design and layout. Do plan your schedule accordingly if you want to take this course, but do not let the time commitment deter you! This is really the only opportunity at Yale that allows you to do something this incredible. (You get to fab a chip for free, something that normally costs hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to do!). It's also one of a few courses that will open the door for jobs and internships at companies like Intel, Nvidia, ect. \r\n\r\nIn general, this is a 400 level engineering design elective - with a vibe similar to Medical Devices, ect. Just like all the other design courses, you'll spend a lot of time on it, but every moment is absolutely worth it.",
    "Not unless this was the only class they were taking.",
    "Yes. Professor Rajit is an amazing teacher and the material is very interesting",
    "Absolutely. It was fascinating, engaging, and effective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to come out of Yale being able to call themselves an electrical engineer. We sent off a chip design for fabrication that encrypts data at the end of this course - how cool is that? I feel like in our other courses in EE, we learn bits and pieces about how transistors work, but in this course, you get to actually make something with that knowledge. At the same time, this class will require a LOT of time, and I recommend you easier\/less courses than usual if you will be taking this class. A lot of the time we felt like we were being thrown off the deep end when we were being assigned this labs. Making time to attend Professor Manohar's office hours was absolutely crucial to finishing the labs. Also, I would recommend taking the course with a person you know well and can work well with. The latter half of the course is highly collaborative, and if all group members do not contribute their part, you will not finish the labs. The final project took spring break and a week of all-nighters with my group to finish. Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone who can plan for the commitment it requires."
