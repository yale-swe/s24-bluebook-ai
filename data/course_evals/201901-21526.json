   "comments": [
    "I think it was a great course. If anything, maybe more overlap with the textbook. There were some terms in the book we never talked about in class but that wasn't a huge deal. It was a really well organized class, loved it.",
    "Extremely good feedback and help constructing studies and papers. Involved very constructive discussions.",
    "The course is very individualized, which is great. Since everyone has different reasons for taking the course and is working on different ideas for the individual project, for the second half of the semester in particular, it feels like you're in you're own course doing what interests you which is a great feeling. There's also a heavy emphasis on rewriting of course since the class is writing intensive, which forces you to go back and re-examine what you've worked on and improve it. One weakness is that because it's so writing intensive, having a midterm included in the midst is a lot and its current format is fairly difficult and stressful. Maybe an alternative could be to replace the midterm with other assignments that fit more with the design of the course; a midterm just felt so out of place and it was long and tedious. For the first half of the semester, there are also quizzes on Canvas every class based on chapters in the textbook, so you essentially are teaching yourself most of the material as you go along, which can feel like a lot and I personally didn't feel like I retained everything I read for the entirety of the semester, so cutting down on the number of quizzes or discussing the content a bit more in class could also be helpful.",
    "More one on one time with each student if they need it during class",
    "This class teaches very useful skills but also tends to give some busy work."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It was great and I learned a lot.",
    "This is a very good class if you would like to learn to do research, make surveys, and write papers. Its also a writing credit which makes it very attractive if you need that.",
    "If you're not a neuroscience focused person in the psych major this is basically your only option to fulfilling the research methods requirement, but it's a good class to take. It feels like a lot at times, especially for the individual project, but by the end you feel prepared to run your own experiment if you're going for a BS and you just feel like you've gained valuable skills if you're getting a BA. Regardless, it's a solid writing credit and I feel like my writing overall definitely improved over the course of the semester, and I'd recommend it.",
