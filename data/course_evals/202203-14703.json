The weakneds is that there was too much bteadth and bot enough depth, in that we read a lot of texts at the cost of not being able to go fully in depth for every one.",
                "In H&P, more than in the other ones, the readings were particularly fragmented. We read disjointed sections from different places within different texts. I think this may simply be a feature of DS but I would prefer reading more of each work with a smaller volume of books. I think it would make remembering what Ive learned easier as well.",
                "Prof. Smith is fantastic in section, and was great at covering the broader points of texts. I felt the actual history behind each of the texts was not covered enough.",
                "A lot of great strengths! Only improvement is maybe slightly reducing the syllabus reading to allow for more in-depth conversations.",
                "Strengths: professor's knowledge, syllabus, essay topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: at 9am",
                "I think I had two major flaws with the course. Firstly, it sometimes felt like we were trying to extract political meaning out of texts that were not fundamentally political in nature. This was most acute with, for instance, Genesis in the Bible. Secondly, texts also often felt very similar. However, the ideas we experienced were still great and I on the whole think the structure was great.",
                "Loved the material and the teacher",
                "The strengths are that it really immerses you into the intellectual rigor of the texts. The weakness is that I wish there was more guidance in terms of writing and the grading standards.",
                "This course was very strong when it came to identifying central themes of the texts and passages that were relevant to understanding those themes. This may be a critique of DS on a larger scale, but I wish we would have been able to pursue more depth on certain texts, or had more room to compare them. If a few class periods were not dedicated to a specific reading and instead were more for open discussion, I think this would significantly benefit the course (Professor Smith for this course did do this once or twice, and I found it to be a very invigorating change of pace)."

I think Historical and Political Thought specifically is best suited for those who intend on taking the course due to a deep interest in history, political history, or the development of societies.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in History, Politics, and the greater meaning and importance of the two, especially in the context of the West. This course also discusses the intersection of History and Philosophy more than I was expecting it to, and I think a lot of students might be interested in exploring that."
