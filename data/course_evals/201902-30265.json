    "I thought much more about the different aspects of art and theory. I learned about how to interpret art and how to think about art--not in a prescriptive way, but much more in a thoughtful and individual way!",
    "I developed an incredible amount of skills from visual literacy through studio work, methods and surrounding art practices, a visual vocabulary as it pertains to the art, and how to critique and engage a piece of art. I also gained insight into major concentrations such as graphic design, painting, printmaking, photography and sculpture. I developed insight into myself with work I did not know I was capable of doing. I also developed insight into artists I respect and am inspired by.",
    "I expanded my impression of art and learnt to evaluate arts more specifically. I tried some mediums and methods that I didn't experience before. I learnt more about artist and art in readings."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: extremely individual and thoughtful. Went into the theory of art in a way I really enjoyed.\r\nWeaknesses: not much skills development, which I probably should have expected from a survey course.\r\nImprovement: it was pretty rushed, which is kind of a result of the summer session.",
    "This course only has strengths. The strengths are all the assignments, the professor, the topics taught in a fluid manner, the trips to the YUAG, the presentations from Professor Valentine and much more.",
    "I liked the discussion part of the class. I improved my understanding of materials assigned by other students' evaluations. I got to see many real art works instead seeing them on ppts. I also got to experience visual art by interesting ways."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If they're interested in learning about art in an intellectual\/theoretical way and trying to apply it to their work, then they'd really enjoy this course.",
    "Yes I 100% would. This course has opened up my eyes through a new lens I never knew was there. It is a great introductory course and a course about progress and self-discovery, not about the finished result."
