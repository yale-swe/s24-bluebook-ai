The texts also take mea. very longtime to read. I think it would be helpful if there were a way to actually learn more of the vocab.",

The films and essays that are chosen are quite interesting and enjoyable, and  spark interesting discussions in class. I wish that there were more smaller homework assignments through each chapter to get more familiar with the material.",

The movies and stories that we studied were truly interesting and enjoyable, and led to fascinating class discussions.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness would be the organization of the course, with a semester schedule that changed quite a bit throughout the semester."

You certainly get out of it what you put in to it, so if you really want to learn more and practice advanced Chinese this course provides a lot of opportunities to do that, but if you would rather just use this as an opportunity to maintain your Chinese skills, this course does not force you to do too much work.",
