                "I learned a lot about Latin American politics in a general overview. Exactly what I expected",
                "This class helped me better understand the general background of politics in Latin America. It was helpful in giving me a big-picture idea of defining characteristics of politics in Latin America and how we can understand them. Although we did not go into any topic too in-depth, I think the topics we discussed were interesting and helpful to know at an introductory level.",
                "This course provided key insights into the economic development of Latin America, as well as the transformation of its political and social institutions. The course attempted to answer the question of what makes Latin America unique, and it did so through its inquiry of the historical trends and contemporary observations of the region. The course provided skills for evaluating competing theories (e.g., presidentialism in Latin America), Additionally, the course addresses Latin American politics through the political party framework, as well as issues of populism and authoritarianism.",
                "i learned a great deal about the course subject matter, but i feel that i also improved a great deal in my ability to critically read and write about political science matters.",
                "This course served as a really good overview of the Latin American regional overall, giving a good glimpse into a lot of different aspects of Latin American politics (corruption, historical legacies).",
                "I developed a great knowledge of Latin American history, culture, politics and economics. I also learned how to do a great deal of political science reading and how to engage with the readings in class discussions and writing assignments. This is a great course and very well set up to facilitate student learning.",
                "This course have me a great overview of important themes and topics in Latin American politics, exploring both broadly and deeply concepts like inequality, democratic institutions, gender in politics, etc. I got better at applying specific examples for the theories we discussed and at reading current events news.",
                "The course provided an overview of the various topics relevant to Latin American politics. The course challenged many traditional assumptions that comparative politics had of Latin America by presenting competing theories for economic development, inequality, migration, etc. At the end of the course, we understand that Latin America has a unique history and development path with many variations across countries due to a combination of external and internal factors.",

                "I really enjoyed section discussion in this class and thought the assignments were well thought out to help my learning throughout the course. Lecture, however, was not super engaging and the readings often felt excessive.",
                "Strengths: The teaching team, both the professor and teaching fellow, are extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter and are extremely helpful and available to students. Additionally, the course material is taught very clearly and in an approachable manner, with all material being clearly discussed during lecture and the readings being thoroughly addressed in section. The reading selection was also excellent and proved to be excellent supplements to the course material. Improvements to be made: it would be helpful if expectations for assignments and assessments were a bit clearer to ensure that students include all of the relevant information in their assignments.",
                "I think a strength of the course is definitely Professor Sellars and the teaching assistant, Sofia. The two are a great team. Professor Sellars' lectures are very clear and concise, and she does a really good job conveying the information. In section, Sofia is an absolutely integral part of the course, and section is very helpful for understanding many of the course readings. A weakness of the course was, at times, the amount of reading that was expected. The newspaper and film assignments could feel a bit tedious at times, but overall the course has no true, concerning weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Informative discussion sections, varied and reasonable assignments, broad variety of topics on syllabus",
                "The course connected the topics presented each week very well, complementing well any pre-existing knowledge the student may be bringing. Expectations for students are made clear at the beginning of the semester, and the professor and teaching fellow are readily available for office hours each week.",
                "Strengths - good broad over of Latin American politics and general trends to build on in later courses\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - At times too broad, I would have liked more extensive case studies."

                "Definitely, if you are interested in Latin American politics and have never really studied it before. I think the topics covered were quite helpful to me as someone with no previous Latin American politics background. I also appreciated how organized and clear the assignments were and the TF Sofia was great at leaving feedback. However, if this is not a topic that interests you I would suggest taking another poli sci class.",
                "Yes, good introduction to the politics of the region.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student of political science or Latin America who is interested in the economic and political development of the region. This course is not a history class, but rather, it takes an analytical approach to understanding why Latin American is the way it is presently, and where it is going from here.",
                "yes! i really enjoyed the subject matter and i felt that the course was extremely well organized and effective. i left the class feeling like i had learned a lot. i think the work level was also very fair.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! If you have never taken a course of Latin America but you are interested in the politics of the region, this is a great gateway to Latin American politics.",
                "Yes! This course is a good introductory political science course and is good for anyone who might be slightly interested in political science or Latin American politics. Also, the workload is constant but extremely manageable.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in comparative politics or Latin American studies because the course provides a good foundation for understanding regional patterns of development, migration, and inequality. Even from a US perspective, a focus on Latin America is useful since the US is home to many Latin American migrants, and the US has played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of Latin American countries.",
                "I would recommend this course as a broad basis before more specialized courses, but not for a deep dive."
