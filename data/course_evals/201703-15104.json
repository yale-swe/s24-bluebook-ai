    "The course was an analysis of dramatic TV dialogue and high-level readings, mostly on Racism in America.",
    "Honestly this class was really poorly structured. While I appreciated bringing black studies scholars in conversation with the show, we spent too long harping on the same points. In addition to this, I do not feel like I got that much more out of the show than if I had just watched it by myself.",
    "I got better at identifying and explaining elements of race theory after watching all of The Wire and doing the readings for the class. I found this new and exciting to be able to look at how certain themes we discussed in class (use of the black body, the anti-state state, etc.) manifested on screen.",
    "Greater understanding of the context behind things in the wire.",
    "I definitely think a lot more about the paradoxical nature of the neoliberal state than I did before.",
    "I learned about contemporary theory on race and institutional racism, and my learning on this subject was informed by discussion of these themes within The Wire.",
    "I learned a lot about the modern history of the United States in relation to racial capitalism.",
    "I did develop a better lens through which to view film and television, and a new exposure to the works of Coates, Baldwin, and Glaude.",
    "I got better at critically analyzing television, especially through the lens of critical race theory. Closely reading cinematographic strategies, paying close attention to character development etc. Did not at all improve as a writer or former of arguments.",
    "I developed critical evaluation skills when it comes to serial drama. Conceptualizing the drama as integrated with its form was completely new to me.",
    "Critical thinking, critical inquiry, argument development, emotional understanding.",
    "Learned to think deeply about the hidden themes in Black film.",
    "I learned to digest film in a new way.  I had never taken a film studies course, and Professor Bradley helped me figure out what to look for and what certain patterns reveal.",
    "I developed my skills of developing how to perceive situations and environments in different ways.  Certain scenes in the wire could be interpreted to mean so many different things.  The workload was very light, however, and Professor Bradley clearly had a certain interpretation of each scene and each theme in the Wire that she expected her students to agree with.",
    "I think this class did a great job of connecting the show The Wire with racial theory.  I read so many books about race and class in the world that taught me a lot.",
    "Systemic racism's impact in America",
    "I gained greater confidence in speaking in class , whilst simultaneously being exposed to interesting ideas and classmates from various different backgrounds.",
    "I developed my knowledge and understanding of critical race theory through many challenging readings and then applied them to a film studies course - something I had never done before.",
    "This class was an amazing way to look at the show The Wire. I learned a great deal about implicit and explicit institutional racism in the U.S. and about how race is manipulated and portrayed by various institutions, including the police force, the government, and the media. I also learned about creative and cinematic methods used to influence an audience.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "You have to watch a lot of TV and do a decent amount of readings, but its worth it",
    "I feel that this course could be improved by perhaps having one more assignment between the midterm assignment and the final paper assignment. There was so much information that we covered, and it would be great to perhaps balance that out by having another writing assessment.",
    "This biggest downfall of this class is the Professor: the professor SHOCKED me. If you take this course, be prepared not to be able to ask the Professor questions after the lecture, or during office hours for that matter... in both of these instances, I was met with such a high level of hostility that I had never experienced before in my entire school experience! The professor tries to trip you up, single you out, and put you down. Add this to her other list of accomplishments, such as not showing up last-minute for 12% of the lectures, getting rid of discussion sections and making it an in-class discussion (of 50 people) 2 days before final schedules were sealed, systematic ignoring of students' emails and, finally, talking about how bad Yale College is for not having 'lights that dim' and 'chairs that turn', even though one pays '$50,000 a year' to come here... in the school year of 2015-16, 52% of the student body received the amazing financial aid at Yale: so what an offensive thing for a Professor to say in class. If this Professor wasn't teaching the class, it may be a really interesting study of a great TV show, supplemented by high-level readings... but as long as Professor Bradley is teaching, I WOULD NOT TAKE this course if I was you.",
    "Strengths: The Wire is a great show and a great vehicle for discussion. I also thought the readings we did (Gilmore, Lebron, Coates, Williams, Glaude, etc.) were very eye opening and interesting. I thought that these ingredients mixed together made for really interesting thought projects and discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that Professor Bradley's PowerPoints had way too much text on them and when she didn't post them, it made it difficult to get all of the important quotes into your notes. I also think that we should have had sections for the class instead of having class participation be 30% of the grade. It made for some conversation-hogs and a subjective grading system--how can you talk if you don't get called on? It would have been great to have a place to discuss certain themes more in-depth. I also think that the class should have been a seminar--there definitely were 15 people that were really into the course and then 20 that were zoning out, so that seems like a missed opportunity to me. I also didn't think Professor Bradley's teaching style was very conducive to comfortable learning (she often came late, sometimes missed class entirely, complained about how we didn't get to talk about stuff enough, etc.). I think we should have had sections that counted for our participation grade and not talked during lecture, but instead had her lecture to us--I though she had a lot of cool places to lead us that she didn't get to because most of classes were made up of discussion.",
    "If it was a seminar instead of a lecture.",
    "This class got off to a bit of a rocky start as Professor Bradley figured out the best way to run it, but it definitely picked up and ended strong. I do think that Professor Bradley expected a higher base level of media analysis background from the students taking the class so maybe making that more clear in the syllabus\/course description going in or finding a different way to ease in people who have never done film studies before. This class might also make more sense as a seminar, but it was pretty good as a participatory lecture.",
    "This class could be improved by including fewer readings and slowing the pace a bit. We had to rush through parts of the show because we covered so many readings and finished watching the show a few weeks before the semester was over. Also, the insistence on participation resulted in artificial participation by students who just wanted the box next to their name to be checked for the day.",
    "The strength was in the readings and content of the lectures. The weaknesses were in the length of the show and the shortness of time in class, meaning either we'd have a surface level discussion of all topics, or in depth discussions on only certain aspects of the show\/readings\/history.",
    "The class had a very interesting source material, and some of the readings were great, but others were harder to follow, and the connections to the show seemed to be a big stretch. I also wish we had gone a little more into some of the film techniques used in the show, rather than just the storyline.",
    "It's in that strange space between being a lecture and a seminar, at about 30 kids but in a large room. Decide which it is, and let it be molded to the learning style of whatever size it should be.",
    "No weaknesses. Stellar course.",
    "Forces everyone to participate and to think. You can be a spectator but you always feel engaged in the conversation.",
    "The readings were so fruitful.  They revealed so much about the show and framed our discussions in unexpected but thought-provoking ways.  Professor Bradley could be a little more patient with the students because I think people were sometimes afraid to say something that she wasn't already thinking.  I actually really liked the \"leminar\" style and thought it worked well for the subject.",
    "The strengths of this course relied in the dialogue that scenes from The Wire created in class.  The weaknesses were in the redundencies of the lectures led by Professor Bradley and the lack of openness she had to students with differing opinions",
    "The class would be better taught in a smaller class size, this would help improve discussion.",
    "Professor and TA's are very unapproachable",
    "The readings were incredibly interesting and informative , my only suggestion would be that class participation became a little tedious at times with kids repeating what the last person had said just to earn their participation points whilst much of the discourse was interesting there were occasions when it felt like classmates were speaking simply because they enjoyed the sound of their own voice",
    "This course is very intimidating. The readings are complicated, especially for someone who has never engaged in topics of critical race theory before. Grades are heavily based upon participation, which can be difficult for students when the class is over 50 in numbers. Besides for being nerve-wracking to speak up, there are a few select voices that seemed to dominate conversation and Professor Bradley was often very critical in specific answers that she was looking for. Participating ended up being very stressful and oftentimes embarrassing. It felt very high-stakes to contribute and I'm sure that my participation grade suffered despite my attendance and engagement during discussions.",
    "Strengths - mandatory attendance, teaching style (teaching concepts to lead into class discussions), literature used to support learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - classroom layout did not support collaboration very well",
    "The course was very strong in the material that it introduced and the lines of investigation that it explored, but it would have worked far better as a seminar course with a longer class time, as this would have allowed for stronger and more significant discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Yes definitely",
    "If you are interested in analyzing policing institutions through a lens that also focuses on a discursive discussion of race and class within the analysis, this class is for you! This class taught me a lot about how to constructively identify the issues with the criminal justice system. Professor Bradley is also brilliant.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. The professor gives  EXTREMELY LOW grades for the papers. The professor also adopts an elitist point of view when lecturing the class on The Wire - which, by the way, was a TV show I loved before taking this course, and now is completely ruined for me. She makes you seem like a nuisance for taking the class - she doesn't respond to emails, not receptive during office hours, and don't even try asking her a question after class... if you take this class, you will soon realise that it was one of the biggest mistakes you've made at Yale.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It was poorly structured and taught. Professor Bradley often seemed like she did not even want to be there. Take a class with a more passionate professor!",
    "Unless they change this class from a lecture to a seminar, I would not recommend. She tries to base a lecture off of participation, and it's hard to keep track of who is talking with so many people in a lecture room.",
    "I would recommend the course, but with the disclaimer that it's not just watching a TV show--you have to grapple with the larger themes at work within the show and how they reflect the America we live in today. Also, sometimes Professor Bradley is a bit irritable and that can make class uncomfortable.",
    "Great subject material.",
    "This class is definitely worth taking. I think it will be especially strong moving forward as Professor Bradley gets used to teaching the class. It's a great reason to watch The Wire - a show many people consider to be the best television show of all time - but that is why I marked it as higher workload. Watching half a season a week is a lot, so be ready for that. Overall, the reading are very interesting and you will gain an ability to contextualize the nuances of the show within larger American political and cultural theory which is quite cool. You'll never think about racial sentimentalism or the paradox of the neoliberal state the same way again!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is very interested in The Wire and issues of race in modern America. I would not take the class if you are just interested in the show itself, as most of the class is spent discussing racial issues.",
    "Yes, it was my favorite class of the semester. The readings were the most interesting of any of my classes, and Professor Bradley has so many interesting perspectives. Despite technically being a lecture, there was lots of opportunity for discussion with other students. Aside from all that, The Wire is a great show in itself, and having the opportunity to watch it along with the historical context and analysis provided by the class should not be under-appreciated.",
    "Yes, although you definitely have to be willing to work.",
    "Take this class if you dare. It's a shame since the material (watching and reading about The Wire) is fascinating and incredibly rewarding. However, Professor Bradley makes it very intimidating by requiring participation as 30% of your grade in a 40 or 50 person lecture. It was often difficult to get email responses from TF's and the professor which made it harder to get help when needed. It was a very intimidating class dynamic overall, with about 5-10 people who consistently spoke in class and the rest of the group hanging back. Professor Bradley often comes to class irritated with one or another thing about Yale (our classroom with desks attached to the floor really seemed to bother her), and only occasionally would we end class with her feeling satisfied -- the rest of the time it was with exasperation and making us feel like we weren't doing nearly enough to deserve a place in the class. Overall, amazing topic and I do feel that I learned a lot, but be warned about the participation and overall vibe of the class. If she ever offers it as a seminar that would be great.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course both as a perspective on blackness in contemporary critical theory and as a film course. Professor Bradley is brilliant and expects participation from her students which leads to a great learning environment.",
    "Yes. Highly recommend for anyone interested in humanities and\/or social sciences.",
    "Definitely would. Professor Bradley is amazing. The Wire show is amazing. And i enjoyed the class and all i learned through its readings and discussions.",
    "This is one of my favorite classes that I have ever taken.  I would not have gotten through all of The Wire at this rate if not for this class, but I'm so glad I did.  If you like TV and want to learn about the War on Drugs and blackness in America, this is a worthwhile class.  The readings are illuminating and the show is so rich.",
    "Excellent course.  The show is one of the best in my opinion and watching it in a broader academic context is really enlightening to the problems that plague American society and cities today.",
    "great class, great professor. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have the time to  watch all five seasons of the wire and do the readings in order to get the most out of it.",
    "If you've seen The Wire or have taken AfAm courses involving critical race theory then you will most likely enjoy this course and Professor Bradley might like you - which seems to be helpful. If you are someone who is late to class, don't sign up for this course as you will be given an stare-down as you walk into class. Also, if you are nervous about speaking in front of 50+ students every class, do not take this class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Bradley is excellent and teaches the class in a format that is engaging and hands-on. The content is so interesting and I really feel like I learned a ton while having fun. It did not feel like work at all! Expectations are very reasonable and the class is easily manageable if you attend class and keep on the deadlines well. The Wire is one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale, and enabled me to see the show in a completely different light than I would have just watching it independently.",
    "Yes, very good skills are developed and social issues explored"
