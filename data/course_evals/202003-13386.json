            "comments": [
                "I liked how the course lectures were divided into \"prelectures\" and \"live sessions\". The prelectures were helpful in that I was able to learn about course content thoroughly, and live sessions were helpful in practicing and asking questions about the contents.",
                "Strengths: clear expectations, engaging lectures, relevant homework assignments\r\nWeaknesses: too much lecture time with prerecorded lecture on top of actual class meetings",
                "Strengths: I feel like I learned a lot, and I enjoyed having speakers come in to talk about different areas in data visualization as well as emerging technologies.\r\nWeakness: Pre-recorded lectures were super long, and we also had live virtual lectures.",
                "not a lot of guidance for learning js at the beginning. at the end, all the work came out of reading docs. I think it taught concepts well though. goes through a lot of material quite quickly. tests are super dense though.",
                "Strengths: The problem sets were a good way to learn d3, and the live lectures were sometimes pretty interesting, although I didn't learn much from them in the end.\r\nWeaknesses: The midterms and final involved a lot of rote memorization. Testing students' abilities to analyze a visualization or choose the right one for a situation might be better.",
                "This course could have been a lot easier if there was a more recent version of the d3 library reference book available. D3 updated during our first week of class, so our textbook was outdated for some parts of the interface. This made trying to do certain parts of the assignment more difficult than necessary, because we essentially had to look up online for examples using the recent version of d3 (often times this took the bulk of the work). Also I felt the use of live and prerecorded lectures resulted in us spending more time in lecture than we would have in a normal, non covid term",
                "Strengths: psets taught a lot about front end languages and were very fair\r\nWeaknesses: live lectures were not the best use of time, recorded lectures had all the content but live lectures were always the same - getting into breakout rooms and discussing pros and cons of different visualizations. Weren't very useful in my opinion but I understand student participation is important.",
                "One strength was that a portion of lectures was prerecorded and the rest was a live discussion.",
                "This course did a great job in teaching D3.js to students. I feel like I learned a lot about the coding aspects and how they related to the concepts taught in class. It would be helpful to have more in-depth discussions about the material.",
                "The course had very interesting and enjoyable problem sets. However, part way through the semester all of the course content was in the prerecorded lectures and I wish a little more time was spent on the actual content in live sessions",
                "Strengths: Well organized material that built on itself. Weakness: Problem sets seemed a bit disconnected from the timeline of material covered in class.",
                "The problem sets were a strong aspect of the course. But given how long they could take I think that they should be weighted more heavily. The parts should be worth much more than they are.",
                "Maybe re-ordering some material would help. Some topics like marks\/channels seemed as if they could be better placed earlier in the course.",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\nThe assignments. While not overly hard, they do force you to create one of a lot of different types of charts and make said visualizations interactive. By the time you're finished (if you've completed all the psets and are happy with the structure of your code), you have a solid code base to go back to to create future visualizations. Also the professors -- they are both amazing people, and worth taking a class with. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nThough this course attempted to adapt to online learning, it honestly didn't do a great job of it. To be clear: I really appreciated the amount of effort and thought both professors put into developing this course. But what ended up happening is that students just didn't watch the prerecorded lectures (or waited until right before the exam to watch them), since there was already a required reading due before class (and that had an associated written response assignment).  We spent the in class time looking at interesting data visualizations and analyzing them, but the professors expected simultaneously too much and too little from the students -- after being put into breakout rooms and discussing for 10 minutes, we'd come back and spend the next half hour recapping what went on in each breakout room. This was too much engagement (it got boring, students didn't speak up, and honestly I think a lot of us were there so our participation grade didn't go down) given the little amount of work we'd done in the breakout rooms.",
                "I wish the course could have included questions that followed up not on just readings, but on the recorded lecture. I think that would have maximized engagement there. \r\n\r\nI really liked in the in-person format - it helped me think more about applications",
                "Strengths - the asynchronous lectures were much better than any live versions. The psets were also very fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I felt very unprepared for some of the questions on the exams, especially the short answers, which felt like \"gotcha\" questions and were super detailed, rather than testing principles and general understanding."

And know that you'll be learning a bunch of theory in class, and doing the practical bits (which might interest you the most) in the psets for the class, which are not worth that much of your grade. That said, you'll definitely leave the class with some practical skills, and with a solid overview of the field of data visualization.",
