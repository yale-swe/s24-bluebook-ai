It is an immersive course without actual immersion in the country or culture of the language and the areas focused on are definitely more beneficial than if we were to learn a list of numbers, colours or animals. I think I have become quite eloquent in a very short amount of time.",

My professor was very understanding and supportive of everyones struggle in the class and the unity of the challenge made the learning environment extremely welcoming, despite having no idea what the answer was to a question the professor asked at times. I think the way this course is set out and instructed is wonderful, and that is clear because their method has worked for many years thus far.",
