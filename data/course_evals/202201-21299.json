                "Loved the detailed, line-level feedback and focus on narrative, logic, explanation, and story in non-fiction. It will be key for future courses and my future writing in general."

                "I wish we spent more time reading professional works from journalists",
                "I love the structure of assignments. I think the flow is excellent, and each builds on the other in a very helpful way. Prof. Zimmer gives very helpful and detailed feedback on drafts.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved is the workshop sessions. Peer feedback and the discussion during class was very helpful, but I think it could be improved with written feedback. I often left the sessions feeling like the conversation was useful, but I had lost some of the finer points of what was discussed before I was actually able to return to my draft. Other workshop-based classes that friends have taken have asked that students annotate their peers work before class and write a ~1 paragraph response to the piece, which they then leave with the writer so that they have several sets of full feedback. The reading for this class is comparatively minimal compared to many other courses, so I think asking students to do a closer read of their peers' pieces with annotations wouldn't be a huge ask, but would really improve the quality of feedback we receive.",
                "Strengths: assignments were good practice for writing real journalistic pieces, the readings were super interesting and we had a guest speaker come in from the Atlantic who was amazing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Zimmer fostered a fairly negative class environment by encouraging critiques more than positive feedback and a \"reader is always right mentality.\" But some students would not read the pieces beforehand and couldn't provide valuable feedback, so the reader's comments in this case were often just misunderstandings. What resulted was students ready to tear each other down and providing mediocre feedback. Given the majority of class was in this format, I felt like the only practice I really got was re-editing my pieces over and over again. Upon submission, even after giving a decent grade, Zimmer only provided negative comments on the pieces which were sometimes constructive but literally destroyed every single sentence to the point where it was difficult to maintain a sense for if there was anything I was doing right. I feel like I left the class with all my weaknesses as a writer because I wasn't told how to really improve other than practice."

                "Yes, honestly it was not as much workload as previous years rated this to be",
                "Yes definitely. My writing and understanding of how to write improved immensely. I loved reading all the pieces he chose as well as my classmates and doing critiques in class was very helpful.",
                "Honestly, no. I was so excited about this course but I think it ended up not being worth the amount of work and the stress it added to the semester. I think one could get a lot out of it if theyre really devoted to the assignments, but you should think twice about signing up.",
                "Yes, definitely take this class, especially if you're somebody who has strong expertise in some field but feel like you want to improve how you communicate about that subject. Or you're just interested in journalism! It definitely requires some commitment; most of the learning and work in this class actually happens outside of the classroom during reporting, drafting, and editing. But this class totally changed the way that I write, and the detailed feedback from Prof. Zimmer and my classmates was super helpful in refining my work.",
                "No! Just because Zimmer is a world-famous and great journalist doesn't mean he is a good or supportive professor. You would learn a lot more by just working with the student publications and reading a lot of good science journalism.",
                "Professor Zimmer's comments are clear and highly keyed in on your writing, and he and the rest of the class both take the greatest care for improving everyone's writing. This course is for anyone who wants their writing to be fully dissected, taken apart, and put back together again in a stronger way. I'd recommend taking this Credit\/D due to the strict (but very fair!) grading, but it's the best use of a Credit\/D that I can imagine"
