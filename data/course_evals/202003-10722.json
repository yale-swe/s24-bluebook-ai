                "Recorded lectures were a strength for sure. It does move quite quickly... However, psets were pretty helpful and exams weren't too bad.",
                "The strengths are the lectures are engaging and very thorough. The professor is enthusiastic and makes stats fun. No weaknesses.",
                "strengths: manageable workload, so many office hour opportunities, JDRS's corny humor; weaknesses: nothing",
                "This was probably my best course this semester. The recorded lectures were both manageable in terms of time, and also consistently well organized, easily digestible, and actually pretty entertaining.",
                "JDRS is a fantastic professor and by far one of the most understanding professors I had this semester. A weakness of the course is the difficult with making sure that all points were covered in Psets to get a decent grade (otherwise you have to spend significant amount of time in office hours with TAs)",
                "Online format made it difficult to get extra help, clarify grading, or stay on top of assignments.",
                "Strengths: absolutely wonderful instructor, easy to understand breakdown of material in lectures, fun outros to videos that I looked forward to watching. JRDS never stop teaching!",
                "The course is run very effectively and will offer you everything you need if you choose to take advantage of all resources.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is SO charismatic and engaging even when pre-recorded. I feel like I know him really well despite never meeting. Lectures are clearly divided into topical videos within daily modules, and PDF notes were always easy to follow. Quizzes, psets, and exams are all fairly designed.\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture could be several minutes shorter if story-time digressions and personal anecdotes were cut. Lectures are long enough (they're cute and funny, but I need to know how long they *actually* are so I can budget my time).",
                "I think this was a great course! The format allowed me to practice while also moving at a pace that worked for me. The flexibility of the asynchronous lectures meant that I could balance my workload around my other courses. Also, JDRS knows his stuff and was adept t spelling out these concepts.",
                "I think that a strength of this class is the amount of office hours held. It was amazing to know that anytime I had problems or questions, more than likely I would be able to find a time in the day to attend office hours.",
                "This is a really good class. I think it was suited really well to the virtual format, and I would encourage Professor Reuning-Scherer to keep many of the virtual aspects of this class in place moving forward.",
                "Lectures are some times a bit too in depth and cover more than is needed for the homeworks\/exams, which can make things confusing. Office hours are really good.",
                "For being online, I think it was an excellently designed course.",
                "The heavy bulk of asynchronous lectures made the class hard to follow at times, but that's just a temporary issue. The TAs were great and JDRS was always helpful. The whole teaching team truly wants their kids to succeed and it was nice to be a part of that in my first semester of college.",
                "The strength of the class was JDRS, who is a good lecturer and fun to watch. However, the asynchronous format was not only unmotivating, but painful to get through. I found it difficult to learn the material, and also apply it in homework and quizzes.",
                "Strengths: This class was asynchronous and organized well with lots of office hours for help with problem sets \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes office hours would be canceled on short noticed or moved, however, it is also understandable that sometimes things come up",
                "I think this is an excellent course. It was ver fairly graded and worked very hard for all the students to succeed. There was plenty of patents for the students as well, and time to get help.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is an amazing lecturer. Despite the entire course being taught virtually with prerecorded lectures, I was highly engaged throughout because of JDRS' energy. The pacing of the course is also very well designed to facilitate learning. There is enough time to go to office hours or review concepts before psets, quizzes, and exams.\r\nWeaknesses: None. Make sure to take advantage of office hours, though. Without them, especially in this virtual environment, this course can feel very disconnected.",
                "Weaknessess\r\nYou have to go to office hours to be able to answer the questions on the PSET completely\r\nSome of the TAs aren't as helpful as others\r\n\r\nStrengths\r\nLots of help available\r\nTests are VERY doable and easier than the PSETS",
                "This course was enjoyable and I was able to work at my preferred pace!",
                "JDRS is a really engaging lecturer, and I found his office hours (along with most of the TA office hours) to be really helpful. The material is fast-paced, but as long as you take advantage of office hours, the workload is manageable! Really appreciated how the exams were open-note as well. Would have been nice to allow for one homework grade to be dropped, as so much of the final grade comes from the weekly homework assignments.",
                "The office hours held by JDRS, the TF's, and peer tutors were all very helpful. JDRS always tried to keep the lectures as engaging as possible. He also added a bit of fun at the end of some videos!",
                "Great course overall!",
                "JDRS is an excellent professor - very passionate, makes statistics fun and interesting \r\nTA's were very helpful for psets and office hours was useful to cement concepts that weren't as clear during recorded lectures",
                "The professor is great, and the homework are very helpful. However, it's just a lot of information... and it's hard to consolidate all of the information before you need to move on.",
                "The course was fast-paced but there was a lot of support along the way for students.",
                "More structured in person engagements besides office hours to incentivize students to attend",
                "Its a great introduction to statistics for those with little to no prior knowledge. This course is quick though--and keeping up is not a given, especially in a pandemic where everything is asynchronous.",
                "strengths: JDRS!! Great at making stats easy and fun, super engaging despite it being a recorded lecture",
                "Strengths: a lot of office hours help, lots of quizzes to keep students on top of their work\r\nWeaknesses: not live lectures",
                "Strengths:\r\n- JDRS is a phenomenal lecturer!!!!!\r\n- the clips of his family JDRS would include at the end of videos\r\n- lots of TA office hours, which were super helpful for problem sets\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- TAs weren't super helpful for studying for tests\r\n- sometimes it felt like I was going to office hours just to get all the right answers on the problem set, not to actually understand what I was doing",
                "Strengths: format was very flexible and accommodated online learning from any time zone incredibly well; lectures made sense for the most part and flowed well\r\n\r\nImprovements: more clarity with what is expected on homework for grading purposes but office hours do exist for that so eh i guess",
                "strengths: synchronous sessions that allow students to watch lectures on their own time, variety of TA sessions\r\nweaknesses: not always clear expectations for assignments....it would help if there was a rubric\/criteria for students on assignments so that they know what to expect on tests",
                "Strengths: good and not-too-hard QR credit, JDRS is an engaging instructor, I really liked his funny family dancing clips at the end of lectures, also lots of great TAs with various office hour slots, Antalique's review sessions were very helpful, the homework was manageable and helped you learn the material well.\r\nWeaknesses: during the second half of the class, the TAs' office hour times were unreliable (there were several times when some TAs canceled their slot with no announcement or just minutes before it was supposed to begin, which was frustrating); I also felt like there could have been a bit more communication between JDRS and the TAs (sometimes when students would ask questions about grading or exam format at office hours, TAs would speculate or even give conflicting answers, which then caused a bit of tension on piazza during the final weeks)",
                "The asynchronous method of instruction is great because there is no specific time that this class meets. Given that, there is a ton of office hours help available. Even if you can't make the Zoom (or in-person) times, there are resources to get help over email. \r\n\r\nSometimes lectures wouldn't be posted following the schedule outlined in the original syllabus, but they were there eventually.",
                "I feel like JDRS is a phenomenal professor, and he truly explained things in depth in lectures as well as office hours. I think there were plenty of options to get help in the course - there was basically office hours every single day. I took advantage of this and it really helped my grade. The one weakness I would say is Minitab. I really don't think using Minitab is useful - maybe teaching us R would help us more in the future. When I asked other friends who took Statistics before at other schools or in high school what Minitab was, they had no idea what it was. I don't really think it is useful, so that's probably one thing I would change.",
                "There were many office hours available and the teaching fellows were ver helpful.",
                "This course has such an amazing and funny professor! At the end of the recorded lectures, he'd add in clips of his talented family members playing instruments or singing, and it always brightened my day! JDRS is the only stem professor I've met who actually cares about his students succeeding and doesn't try to pit students against each other. He was open to answering any questions during office hours and his explanations were super helpful. You could also go to the TAs' office hours. The review sessions were also helpful. However, I do wish that we could have had more practice problems\/review sessions in between exams. The amount of information was a bit overwhelming at times and the conceptual stuff was hard to grasp. I wish we had been able to have more practice problems and maybe review sessions for the harder conceptual stuff. But the grading distribution makes it so that exams aren't that stressful, which was really nice!",
                "strengths - professor is so funny and bright all the time, makes the dread of stats (im a humanities major) a little less dreadful.",
                "I thought it is good and reasonable as is.",
                "JDRS is a clear and compelling teacher and there are many opportunities for support. \r\nStudying for exams was confusing because the questions were different than the homeworks or the quizzes and there was not much explanation given about this.",
                "Very interesting material",
                "The course was recorded which allowed me to work on it whenever I had time. Professor Reuning-Scherer was engaging and worked his best to make the recorded lectures personal and as enjoyable as possible. His silliness was appreciated in what can be a somewhat dry topic. No big weaknesses.",
                "Great instructor with supplementary lecture materials. The TAs are also a great resource.",
                "Strengths - JDRS is phenomenal as a professor. He makes somewhat complicated statistical concepts very easy to understand and all of his assessments and homework assignments are incredibly fair \/ designed to promote student learning and retention of the concepts rather than trick students with overly challenging questions. This has been my favorite course at Yale and I have nothing negative to say about the class.",
                "The instructor is engaging, but the nature of it being entirely asynchronous can make it a bit tedious and impersonal.",
                "Strength - JDRS is one of the most engaging lecturers Ive ever had. Slides were organized engaging and concise, and videos were fun because of his personality&humor and fun family clips at the end.\r\nThere were office hours almost every day multiple times a day so lots of opportunities for extra help on psets etc. I appreciate that we could go at our own pace with the canvas quizzes (could subrmit whenever).\r\nAlso the teaching staff are SO generous and accommodating, always gave extensions\/forgave slightly late psets if you just ask. Just communicate and it will work out.  \r\nOpen book exams with very generous time limits. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lecture videos were not posted super far in advance and we were told they would be. So students couldnt get ahead if they wanted.",
                "The professor's lectures were incredibly engaging, and the course structure was helpful in keeping track with the modules. The only potential weakness of this course (which is really on students) is that it can be easy to fall behind, and the class moves fast in a way that makes it difficult to catch up. However, there are a ton of office hours offered and the ULA's were super helpful.",
                "No weaknesses: homework was clear, office hours and piazza were super helpful, JDRS is great",
                "Would much rather prefer if lectures were live as they would keep everyone much more accountable and help in keeping everyone up to date. I really appreciated the regularity of office hours and how understanding the TAs were.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is funny, friendly, and pretty good at explaining concepts. Weaknesses: The asynchronous format of the class makes for a pretty low level of engagement, since there are no discussion sections or opportunities to interact live with instructors other than office hours. As someone who isn't a math person, I felt a bit like I had to teach myself many of the concepts by rewatching lectures over and over and going through the powerpoint notes.",
                "Strength: JDRS is a good lecturer (and his frequent jokes through the lectures provide a good laugh!). The lecture slides are very informative and quite detailed, and JDRS is super good at walking through the slides and doing demonstrations of the concepts\r\n\r\nWeakness: The pre-recorded lectures seemed like a lot, with each \"lecture\" being broken up into 3 separate lecture postings. Also, some of the homework questions were broad and\/or confusing in what they were asking for and required some clarification; nothing too big, but just a little stress-inducing at times.",
                "Strengths: Lots of office hours and pretty good recorded lectures",
                "I enjoyed the virtual lecture format and thought that the professor was very clear and also engaging with material that may have been quite dry with another professor. There were also plenty of office hours with the professor, the TAs, and peer tutors that I found very useful and practical over the course of the semester.",
                "The course is well-structured, and JDRS is very passionate and engaging. There are office hours throughout the week, offering support whenever you might get stuck on a problem.",
                "Professor JRS is the strength and light of this class. He is an engaging and dynamic lecturer, even online, and is able to summarize, repeat, and convey information unlike many of the most talented scholars at Yale. I don't mean this as an exaggeration. It is difficult to teach and it is even more difficult to teach an introductory course over recorded lecture to many non-Statistics inclined students.",
                "Strength: JDRS and record lectures.\r\nWeakness: Can't think of anything really big, other than that one or both of the midterms will probably be challenging!",
                "Strengths: the assistants were extremely helpful as I struggled with the class in the all virtual, recorded lecture class format. JDRS creates videos that are both entertaining and insightful. \r\n\r\nWeakness: difficult to meet classmates and talk with them about material we were learning. This is a class that I regret taking online and wish that I had done in person.",
                "Strengths: This course was a perfect asynchronous class to take during the remote semester because you could develop your own schedule to complete each of the modules, which helped me since I worked usually during typical work hours. Having no due date on the quizzes was a plus, and still having dates for each module helped me stay on task. The lectures themselves where the biggest strength, always going into perfect depth, and even adding light and fun skits towards the end to make remote learning less stressful. I loved this course so much!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, lectures for the day would go above the typical 1 hr, 15 min limit, but it was made up with a few other lectures going below the limit. Some of the only ways to get help on homework was to go to the office hours, and I had trouble attending them because my schedule wouldn't allow for much flexibility. In all, there were still many opportunities to excel in the course and receive feedback.",
                "Strengths: plenty of office hours, understandable lectures\/good teaching, consistent feedback\r\nWeaknesses: easy to fall behind (but thats the nature of online courses)",
                "This course offered a lot of supports to students, including very frequent office hours, review materials and options to have assignments re-graded. This may not be a weakness, but it is important to note that the examinations are much more like the quizzes than the problem sets, and the problem sets are as much a lesson in using data sets and graphing tools as they are a lesson in the statistics themselves.",
                "Strengths: Plenty of office hours and support through piazza, course is very well organized into modules and quizzes on canvas, tests are straightforward, JDRS keeps lectures interesting",
                "No weaknesses - as someone who would normally hate statistics, I have to say this class is amazing!!!! JDRS is absolutely incredible and he genuinely does the impossible in making a class like this (for someone like me) super engaging and interesting!!!",
                "The recorded lectures were easy to follow with clear examples and explanations. However, problems on the homework sometimes seemed to be only loosely based on the lecture, and you needed to attend office hours to be able to figure them out.",
                "Strengths of the course are the quality of the recorded lectures as well as assistance of all of the TAs. I also really liked the weekly quizzes that were low-stakes because it allowed me to see how much I was actually learning from the lectures.",
                "Strengths: TAs were helpful with homework assignments, recorded lectures were useful\r\nWeaknesses: exams were highly difficult in relation to the rest of the class material and requirements",
                "Strengths - there are many office hours offered, help is always available, lectures are prerecorded so you can take the class at your own pace\r\nWeakness - because the lectures are prerecorded, it's easy to skip out on a lecture and fall behind",
                "Strengths: lots of contact with prof\/TAs despite recorded lectures through office hours, funny and engaging lectures \r\nWeaknesses: boring stats material",
                "strengths: JRS is an engaging and effective lecturer, asynchronism works during a pandemic\r\nweaknesses: asynchronism can make a course easy to forget about"

                "JDRS kept lectures interesting and sometimes fun (ZERO SAID EILEEN) but it would be also nice perhaps to have more engagement with other students in the course (I made some friends through office hours that I DMed and people could interact over a GroupMe but peer-collaboration office hours could be fun). The abundance of TA hours have been really helpful (especially JDRS's lectures). Lectures assigned on days of exam though were difficult to do sometimes though.",
                "The virtual office hours were really helpful, and there were lots of times to choose from. There should be closed captioning available on the lectures though, for differently abled students.",
                "There was a mass amount of office hours every day of every week which was very helpful for our problem sets and exam practice.",
                "Recorded lectures and virtual office hours both worked great! Also loved the format of the midterms (open book\/note, 3 hours timed to take a 1.5 hr test whenever within a 48 hour window) -- super understanding of our situations and really allowed me to put my best foot forward",
                "The fully asynchronous model could be improved.",
                "Frequent office hours were very helpful!",
                "The prerecorded lectures were organized and executed well. One weakness might be a lack of office hours for students remote in different time zones.",
                "The virtual office hours were immensely helpful!",
                "Office hours were incredibly helpful. I reliably went to Thursday office hours with Prof JDRS, which were great.",
                "Having the course online completely with the quizzes having no late policy was very helpful in allowing me to shift my priorities as needed.",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful for students in different time zones, esp breaking them in manageable chunks",
                "The recorded lectures work well but can be hard to focus on with no accountability.",

                "I think that the video lectures were nice, but having office hours is what really helped me understand and cement the information being taught.",
                "This class was great virtually. As a student who has trouble focusing for long periods of time, recorded lectures were super helpful because I could go back and listen to parts I had missed while doing homework. Virtual office hours were also great because it made easy to talk to the professor as often as necessary whenever I needed help.",
                "Honestly, I think I went to office hours way more than I would have if they had been in person. The online format was great and should be kept, even post-COVID!",
                "I wish that there was a synchronous component to this class aside from office hours.",
                "Asynchronous lectures were terrible. They were not engaging at all, and it was extremely hard to learn anything from them. It was easy to get behind as well.",
                "This class succeeded in being geared towards learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, I can't think of anything that I would want changed",
                "All the lectures were recorded which was very helpfully cause you could do them on your own time. It was also helpful cause you could go back and register to them.",
                "There were a lot of (virtual) office hours offered throughout the week. This allowed for students to review difficult concepts needed for the quizzes, psets, and exams. In some sense, the virtual nature of the office hours was more conducive to reviewing some of the technical, computational subjects through Zoom's share screen feature.",
                "Lots of help and deadline extensions",
                "This course was all recorded and was completely asynchronous which was helpful when I had a busy or eventful week in other courses.",
                "Having the lectures pre-recorded made it very easy for people in various time zones to engage with the material! My only suggestion would be to schedule office hours later in the day\/evening (East Coast Time) so that those on the West Coast\/international students have an easier time attending virtual office hours.",

                "The class was made very accessible via recorded asynchronous lectures and a large variety in office hours options.",
                "Having the class be fully virtual accommodated everyone no doubt. But it was also hard to have such little engagement ever besides office hours but those were quite optional with little incentive to attend since theres so much other work going on",
                "Exam method, as well as class and office hour structure, were all really smooth. The only issue I had was that announcements could often and easily did go unnoticed unless one was actively checking, and at that point it could be too late, as occurred to me multiple times.",

                "success: asynchronous sessions, accommodation for students with varying circumstances, flexibility with assignments\r\nimprove: more communication on grading, esp across diff sections",
                "The class transitioned to online very well: it was all taught asynchronously, the exams were open note, and the timing was flexible. There was a technical glitch in one of the last modules in which JDRS's face and explanation was not lined up with his screen on Minitab, but that only happened once. Overall, I think JDRS and the TAs handled the online transition very well.",
                "The numerous office hours available was a great way to adapt to COVID, and taking advantage of this was super helpful. I feel like there should be some mandatory aspect of the class though - everything was pre-recorded, so it's easy to fall behind and not hold yourself accountable.",
                "I think there was a lot of outside support for this class.",
                "I think the recorded lectures succeeded because since we were all in different time zones, it made it easier for us to just watch the lectures whenever we could instead of having to come to a live lecture. The TAs were also amazing because they would be available almost every day at very different hours, which meant that students in other time zones could easily go to office hours. I do wish that maybe there had been a few live lectures, though, just so that we could stop and ask questions if needed. It would've been nice to do a live lecture with the professor as a review session. Otherwise, this class worked well online! The resources were endless (Piazza was super helpful) and I felt like I learned a lot!",

                "TAs and instructor were very accommodating. Not much could be improved, but if I had to choose one thing, I would say that I didn't like the course's use of MINITAB because it's not applicable for research at Yale.",
                "Recorded lectures were very helpful because they allowed students to move through the material at their own pace without falling behind because of the weekly quizzes (which were not part of our final grade so the low stakes assignments really just helped students master the concepts).",
                "It was pretty much adapted to COVID learning same as it is typically presented I think, live but recorded lectures may have been helpful in addition to pre-recorded.",
                "The format he had worked super well! Pre recorded lectures that had personality, and manny office hours available. Only feedback would be to post lecture video earlier for ppl who want to get ahead.",
                "The course lectures were recorded, and review sessions, as well as office hours, were held on zoom. These went really well, and there were enough office hours throughout the week that no session (in my experience) was ever too busy on zoom to be productive. Additionally, there was a Piazza platform for the course where students could ask questions both related to content and course structure, so it was easy to get help and get in contact with people who could explain things.",
                "I appreciated that the lectures were recorded for the pandemic - it made it easier to fit the class into my at-home schedule, and I was also able to go back and review concepts I didnt fully understand.",
                "Office hours were definitely a success and were always almost efficient and clear. On the other hand, I would prefer if lectures were live as it would keep me more accountable and less on task (rather than falling a couple of lectures behind due to the amount of work).",
                "The asynchronous format of this course was probably my least favorite thing about it, to be honest. I found it very difficult to find the motivation to work through the long hour-and-a-half recorded lectures and teach myself the material. I think the course would likely be improved if the virtual lectures were given live, so that we could ask questions as they came up rather than having to wait until the next office hours. This would also ease the workload by limiting our out-of-class work to the quizzes and psets.",
                "The use of Piazza was definitely helpful and was an absolutely invaluable tool for this course for question asking and answering!",
                "The recorded lectures and several office hours were very helpful",
                "I thought that the recorded lectures worked very well. The professor was very engaging and posted the lectures and homeworks well in advance, and he made it clear what he expected from his students. There were also virtual office hours that I found to be very useful.",
                "Virtual office hours were very helpful. Usually, going to office hours can be inconvenient, but it was super easy to log on and ask a quick question.",
                "The pedagogical skills of Professor JRS carried the course through the online semester. His combination of repetition of key themes, clear delineation between theory and practical skills, explanation of technologies and strategies, and interspersing of engaging stories made this course successful.",
                "The recorded lectures and very ample office hours was very nice.",
                "Antalique Trans assistance and flexibility with scheduling times to go over material single handily helped me to make it through this course. I wish I could have met more classmates and been able to review material with them in person etc. I dont know how you make that possible with the class structure, but it would have been helpful.",
                "Having the lectures prerecorded was great. But when the audio didn't match the video it was difficult to follow.",
                "Practices that succeeded: multiple quiz attempts, open note exams, being able to have access to lectures in advance, supplemental asides at the end of lectures (!!), and friendly\/compassionate professors\/ta's. Could be improved: more collaborative work with students, that is the only thing I can think of.",
                "The office hours were helpful, good response times to emails",
                "This course was already online and asynchronous prior to the pandemic, as far as I know. That being said, I greatly appreciated the plethora of self-teaching resources available and the promptness with which lectures were recorded and uploaded. The course definitely felt like it wasnt hastily moved to an online format, and while the more intimate interaction of in-person classes and office hours was missed, this was a truly excellent course at combating the difficulties of online learning.",
                "The organization of the course (google calendar on canvas, modules, recorded lectures, zoom OH) all worked well given the current situation.",
                "Don't change a thing! Abundance of times for live office hours is fantastic, and loved the asynchronous style for a class like this and the ability to watch the videos at a convenient time throughout the week.",
                "A recorded format is not as engaging as a live virtual lecture, but the lectures were very concise and the logic was very clear.\r\nThe office hours were very abundant which makes for more online engagement.",
                "I felt like I was able to learn and understand concepts given the completely pre-recorded lecture format (fun clips at the ends of lectures were also a treat!). Other than office hours, though, I tended to not feel engaged, so maybe some live classes working examples would be helpful.",
                "I feel like this course was designed in a way that was already quite prepared for the difficulties that the pandemic posed.",
                "In terms of COVID, the class's online prerecorded lectures and live office hours made for an environment where lack of in-person contact didnt affect the learning\/teaching at all.",
                "Recorded lectures with tons of contact hours with the prof\/TAs made for a really good combo in which the classes could be completed on my own time but I always felt like I could get clarification\/help at any point.",
                "Asynchronism works for this sort of large QR lecture during the pandemic. The abundant office hours were helpful too."

                "Yes - easy and great way to learn basic stats.",
                "If you have already taken AP Statistics (which I haven't), you might want to consider an upper-level stats course or a different QR course altogether. I think that while the course was no Orgo or Math 230 (which I haven't taken LOL), thinking that it will be so easy is where issues start forming because then you get behind and realize you know nothing and there's an exam and homework. It's so easy to end up lectures behind, but overall, it's been alright and if you go to office hours, get your stuff done, and study up you'll probably be okay :)",
                "Yes! If you need an intro stats class or even just a QR this class is really engaging and you have so much help and support in order to succeed and learn the material that is needed to learn.",
                "Yeah! JDRS is great and you'll do well as long as you go to office hours!",
                "I would only recommend this course if a student is not encouraged by discussion, question asking, or collaboration with peers. The fully asynchronous formatting made it hard for me to stay motivated, and though there were office hours, they were primarily used for going over the weekly homework rather than for conceptual help.",
                "Yes. I would highly recommend attending office hours to maintain a higher level of engagement with the course.",
                "Absolutely! Stress-free way of learning stats if you are somewhat of a QR person. I know some Humanities people who really struggled in the course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this as your first statistics class at Yale. The work is manageable and you can receive a lot of help.",
                "Yes, it's a manageable QR credit and useful knowledge to have",
                "Yes. I would definitely recommend this course, as well as any other taught by Prof JDRS.",
                "Yes definitely! Also take it with a friend to check conceptual understanding of topics when working on the psets!",
                "Yes the professor (JDRS) is amazing and entertaining.",
                "Yes, not too rigorous intro to stats course that will still teach you so much, and excellent instructor",
                "If you want to learn some extremely easy statistics with reasonably little stress this course will work extremely well. If you're hoping for an in depth introduction to statistics it may be a little light.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to statistics, or a good refresher for those who took AP in high school. JDRS is an awesome professor.",
                "Ehh. As a senior in a STEM major, this class felt frivolous. As a frosh, sure. I don't think I'll remember much of the content. But like, this class doesn't lie about what it iswhich is very cut and dry. Intro Stats is certainly not a creative nor surprising classand that's OK. Take CS50 instead.",
                "Yes! You probably have to take it anyways, so take a deep breath and go for it. If you try your best things will probably go well. Try to have fun, and use the knowledge gained to enhance your other academic work. You got into Yale because you are bright and hard-working, so you are exactly where you need to be right now. Good luck :)",
                "Yes, I think this course is great to have, regardless of what career\/major.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!! It's such a great class: you learn so much and everything is really well explained. JDRS is awesome, and there's tons of support if you need help. This is a great class for non-STEM people too.",
                "Yes, I would. I've heard that some other classes like PSYC stats, are easier, but I think that this class gave a really good overview of a lot of different things. It was actually really helpful with stats. JDRS's lectures are pretty entertaining and I liked the little videos he included at the end. What I will say is that sometimes the pre-recorded lectures are a little confusing so GO TO OFFICE HOURS! They are super helpful, especially with the homeworks. Also- make sure to watch the review session before exams- they are really good.",
                "I absolutely would if they are willing to stay on task and ask questions when they have them.",
                "No. There are other alternative introductory statistics courses in other departments that have to be better than this class. Although it is easy, it is not worth taking.",
                "Yes, this is a great introductory course on statistics. I came in with no statistics background (not even from high school) and I was able to learn a lot. The workload is reasonable as long as you stay on top of things!",
                "Yes. This is a. very good course if you want an interesting, fun class that is math related.",
                "I highly recommend this course to a student looking for an easier QR credit or seeking a simple introductory course. It was well-taught and well-designed to facilitate learning and encourage engagement with the materials and the instructors.",
                "Take it if you have to take STATS as a requirement. It's not that bad.",
                "Yes, I think this is a great introductory course for students who want to learn more about statistics and data.",
                "Yes, especially if you are a non-STEM student looking for a manageable and relevant QR, I'd definitely recommend taking this class! JDRS offers a lot of support outside of class.",
                "This seems like a good course for an introduction to statistics.",
                "Yes. Great basic statistics course.",
                "Yes, great way to learn about statistics, something that is everywhere in the modern world, more than we realise. Very accessible and manageable content and JDRS is great",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, take it!",
                "Yes I would. The course is a good level of intro into statistics but at the same time wasn't boring at all.",
                "Yes! It was a solid intro to statistics with good pacing and a lot of opportunities to seek assistance.",
                "Absolutely. JDRS is a blessing and this is extremely important stuff to understand for life, in media consumption, in general I think it would be hard to call yourself educated if you dont know basic stats because life is about interpreting hard facts and stats is an exercise in exactly that",
                "Yes, I took it because I needed another QR and found the material here not only extremely engaging but useful in everyday life.",
                "definitely! JDRS is a great professor, I used to not like stats much before",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Great QR credit. JDRS is wonderful. I'm a history major and when he was helping me study for the exam, he made up an example problem and incorporated the exact area of history I'm concentrating in. This was sweet of him and kept me engaged.",
                "Yes! JDRS is a great professor and manages to make video lectures entertaining. Social science stats are pretty widely applicable and the flexibility with this version of intro stats made it super easy to keep up with work (no synchronous lectures !!)",
                "Yes, good introduction to statistics",
                "I would. It was fair overall and a good introduction to statistics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. What I have found this semester is taking intro courses is super important, because intro courses in high school are completely different to intro courses in college. Learning the fundamentals can make or break how you do in your other classes.",
                "Only if you really like stats or if you have to take it for your major. I would not take this class just to fulfill your QR requirement because it is not a gut and the conceptual stuff is very hard. But the professor and the TAs get that not everyone has the same level of stats knowledge, so I didn't feel like I was behind anyone else.",
                "Yes. It is a good intro to stats.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, this is a relatively painless way to learn important skills and information, and shockingly enough I sometimes actually found myself enjoying it. The TA's were incredibly kind and helpful and flexible.",
                "-yes",
                "Yes, it's a good introductory course to get a sense of stats. I took it primarily for the QR credit, but it's pretty straight forward and organized. I took AP stat in high school so I think it would be fast if you hadn't, but it's doable overall. I liked that the lectures were recorded and mostly watched them at 2x speed. Professor Reuning-Scherer was engaging and made the lectures fairly fun to watch given the dry topic area. Overall, good course if you're interested in statistics and\/or need a QR.",
                "Would recommend to anyone looking to learn basic statistics",
                "Aboslutely. I would recommend that all students at Yale take this course, even if they do not think they are \"good at math\" or a \"STEM student.\" Statistics is something that applies to every field of study and there is no better professor to teach these fundamental concepts than JDRS. He is very accommodating to all students regardless of their statistics background and really wants to see each of his students succeed. This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale without a doubt.",
                "Yes, if they want a basic statistics summary. Social sciences branch encompasses a lot of different topics, so its definitely broad.",
                "If you need an intro stats course, then YES. JDRS is the best",
                "Absolutely. Learning how statistics work and the basics of interpreting data is very helpful in doing and reading research, and this course is taught in a way that makes it painless if you're not particularly excited by math and numbers. There are a ton of resources offered if you're struggling at any point by really helpful and understanding TAs and ULAs, and the class is structured in a way that makes it easy to keep up.",
                "YES! great QR that's actually useful for any major",
                "Definitely take if you have limited statistics experience. Its not hard, but you learn a ton.",
                "If you have some background experience\/knowledge on Statistics and want to deepen your understanding then, yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who have taken statistics before and\/or don't mind putting in the work to a math class. As someone who is not really a math person, I struggled a fair amount during this course, but by the final exam I did feel like I had a strong understanding of everything we learned.",
                "If you are interested in statistics or need this course, I would suggest taking it. The course does utilize relatively simple math, but it does get a bit confusing at times if you are not particularly \"good\" at math or quantitate thinking.",
                "Yes. It is not horribly time consuming and a very manageable way to get a good understanding of statistics",
                "Take it if youre sure youll stay on top of the work. Once you fall behind, its really hard to catch up again without getting overwhelmed.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to get a foundation in statistics. I thought that the course was very well organized and think that these are important skills for students to have regardless of their careers. However, they need to be sure to stay motivated, because it can easy to get behind on lectures, so it's important to hold yourself accountable.",
                "Absolutely! I think this is a great course that all students should consider. Regardless of your major, these skills will benefit you.",
                "I would to non-Statistics majors! This is a very engaging and easy QR class. There is joy in keeping up with the class materials and, with a little studying that does not break your back, the exams are fair (still stressful, but not designed to trick you).",
                "Yes! It's a great intro course. I'm not a stats major, but was still able to understand material. JDRS is a very good lecturer, and he's quite organized and teaches it in a way that's easy to understand. You have to do a little bit of thinking and additional studying (including memorizing some formulas, though all midterms and exams were open note), but if you put in the effort, you learn a lot. The PSets and exams are structured in a way that evaluates how well you learned the material. It would be beneficial to really pay attention and go to a lot of office hours during probability, especially if you don't really understand it.",
                "I would recommend someone to take this class during a normal year. I struggled greatly with virtual learning, but enjoyed learning about stats. JDRS was a wonderful professor and I always enjoyed his lectures. I can only imagine how fun it would have been to take in person.",
                "Most definitely. This course is designed in the interest of students, and you can tell. Each lecture operates with an understanding that most students have no statistical background knowledge at all, and so they aim to introduce material first and apply it second. Thats always a wonderful way to learn and engage with heavy material, in my opinion. You can go at your own pace throughout the course, so if you can dedicate yourself without synchronous scheduling, this course is for you. Otherwise, you might find yourself backtracked with many modules, which isn't fun to catch up!",
                "If youre interested in stats, yes! A very good intro course to see what stats is all about. I think JDRS is a very engaging teacher and helped me understand all the main concepts of intro stats.",
                "Yes, this is a great course for anyone with any level of experience in statistics. The professors and TFs were very supportive, even when you werent always doing well, and the course is very flexible to peoples individual needs. I thought this was great either for someone like me needing a QR credit or someone interested in more intensive statistics study.",
                "Yes I would, I learned a lot and always felt like I could get help from office hours or on piazza.",
                "Yes!! Great for QR or for anyone with a casual interest in data science",
                "I would recommend for any non STEM majors who want to earn a qr credit while learning something that will aid them in analyzing the data they come across in the future.",
                "Yes! This is an excellent course for anyone who sees using statistics in the future and JDRS does a great job at breaking down concepts.",
                "Yes, easy course that you can go at your own pace",
                "Yes! I believe everyone should take a basic stats class, especially 103.",
                "Yes, its a very good foundation and the professor is funny and engaging. the TAs were helpful and understanding. Grading was entirely fair, and reflected properly if you watched lectures and attended office hours before a problem set .",
                "Yes, if they want a straightforward QR credit that teaches some basic tools to analyze data. Or, if they are interested in statistics. Is manageable, not invigorating."
