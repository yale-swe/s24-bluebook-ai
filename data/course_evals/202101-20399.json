                "Strengths: Simona is a pretty good lecturer and definitely cares about her students. If you had farina for 110, Simona is more structured in her teaching and expect a bit more day-to-day work. Also Simona is a LIGHTNING FAST grader which was much appreciated--usually you would get your tests back a few hours after they were submitted. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: BEWARE THERE ARE 3 ORAL PRESENTATIONS YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ARE NOT ON THE SYLLABUS. It was really frustrating to have the presentations just randomly dropped on us with little foresight, especially when you have a heavy course-load. Also Simona did not tell us explicitly what your grade is on the presentations, so that part of your grade is kinda up in the air. They are not too complicated, (usually like 5 mins talking about your hometown or a part of Italy) but were a tad bit annoying and definitely the most boring part of the class was presentations at the beginning of classes. Also the Temi (essays) were a tad bit annoying to do weekly but it is intro lang at Yale so it's par for the course.",

However, BEWARE THERE ARE 3 ORAL PRESENTATIONS YOU HAVE TO DO THAT ARE NOT ON THE SYLLABUS. This is mentioned but not explicitly stated on the mock schedule on the syllabus and they are really annoying to do last minute. The presentations are packed into the first 2-2.5 months of the class and are a bit time-consuming, not to mention it's hard to be graded for your speaking with only a semester of a language under your belt. That all said, Simona is definitely a kind person and a solid prof--she's from Italy and drops little tid-bits hear and there in class about italian culture and makes sure to foster a pretty laid-back class environment.",
