                "I learned various new reactions and all of the ways to optimize them according to your substrate and desired product.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The knowledge is clear and organized.\r\nWeakness: The chalk is producing large dust when using. Dust-free chalk is recommended.",
                "Lectures were well paced, lectures were given at reasonable speeds (mostly) and psets were aligned well with content covered in the lecture. The overall pacing of the class could be improved, however, as we ran out of time for our final pset, and there were many lectures late in the semester that seemed to go faster than the earlier lectures, which is perhaps the opposite pacing you'd want in the finals period. Also, pset feedback and answer keys could be written more clearly.",
                "The material is taught by an extremely knowledgable professor and he makes it very accessible for someone interested in organic chemistry.",
                "By nature of the content, it can sometimes be a flood of information. The course overall sets you up to learn new synthetic chemistry well and begin thinking about issues in the routes to synthesizing desired compounds.",
                "Strengths -- Ellman, his knowledge, psets did a great job of preparing you for exams, good mixture of breadth and depth\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- almost none, the only suggestion I can think of is that sometimes when a stereoselective reaction is drawn, it is unclear which isomer of the catalyst leads to which isomer of the product and isomers are vary rarely noted as R or S during lectures, so I think being more specific about which isomer is which and naming them would be helpful for clarity. Otherwise I think explanations of stereochemical rationale are excellent",
                "The straight lecture style wasnt super engaging. I think a couple pauses for audience participation would be warranted",
                "Lecture and homework correlated very well but it could be more engaging in lecture.",
                "I enjoy how in depth the class goes and the problem sets are very useful with real-world applications. I wish that maybe the class went a little bit faster so we could learn more and finish all the topics listed on the syllabus.",

I enjoyed the weekly problem sets very much as they allowed me to consolidate the knowledge learned in class. I also appreciated the references to scientific literature in this course. I will surely refer to them during my graduate studies.",

Inorganic chem helps a LOT for the second half of the semester, as there are a lot of transition metal catalyzed mechanisms that you'll have to go through, so if possible, I'd recommend taking some courses on transition metal chemistry/organometallic chemistry before this course.",
