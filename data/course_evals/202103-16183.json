                "This is a global course, both in scope and in approach. Going into the course, the broad syllabus and breadth of topics seemed overwhelming. But this course presented events in a way that encouraged me to think about history of the twentieth century in a globalized way. It did not focus solely on the Great Powers and, later, the superpower rivalry between the US and USSR. Instead, we took a broad look at trends such as the emergence of the developing world and the impact of modern innovations through several inflection points around the world. This course broadened my thinking and my approach to history generally. I also feel I can see connections between 20th century events and the modern 21st century conflicts and events. It's a really global course which encourages you to think about history generally, not just reiterate knowledge or readings.",
                "I learned a ton about everything that has happened over the last 100 years. We covered a lot of politics, which I loved, also economics, social movements, some cultural history and more. I learned to think critically about a lot of these events which I knew only basic summaries of, gained some skill to connect them, and became a more concise writer through the four assignments.",
                "Both general and more specific knowledge of major world events and happenings in the 20th century.",
                "A solid grounding in 20th century world history including decolonization, the major wars, and the rise of China. I feel more informed reading the news, discussing politics, and contextualizing current global affairs because of this class.",
                "This was a survey course of 20th century history from a global perspective. Honestly for me it was a lot of relearning of material I had encountered in past history courses but it was interesting nonetheless.",

                "It could be improved by either lengthening lectures or by diving into more specific events in section.",
                "strengths\r\n- lectures extremely engaging and easy to follow\r\n- very interesting readings \r\n- papers that gave a lot of freedom \r\n- content was excellent \r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- need more of a reason to go to lecture (the main reason I went was because Professor Westad is extremely engaging and the content is interesting - but when the course gets bigger and does not have as many history majors, there should probably be more of an incentive to attend lecture) \r\n- structure of course with large participation grade but not enough guidance about how to succeed in section",
                "Strengths: Professor Westad's lectures are dynamic and engaging. He is a fantastic lecturer with a gift for making complex concepts, such as the remaking of the financial system in the 1970s and 1980s, really approachable. At the same time, he delivers his points concisely while allowing for questions at regular intervals during and after lecture. Overall, really strong lectures which will keep you coming back. \r\n\r\nThe structure of the course assignments, four 1,200-word papers, gives you license to really digest the readings without worrying as much about a midterm or final. It's a really well-paced, intuitive structure which does allow for improvement across the four papers.\r\n\r\nThe course covers a wide variety of topics; it is truly a global history course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a significant reading load for this course, especially at the beginning. But the reading will even out, especially as you adjust to the reading load, and the four assignments are spaced out to give you time to complete any readings if you are behind. \r\n\r\nThis course does not delve very much into specific historical facts like details about WWI itself (it's not necessarily a weakness, since this is a global course). It could be frustrating not to have additional details within lectures and readings. Fortunately, the readings and texts have good references and help you to find other additional readings you may wish to include in the four written assignments.",
                "The greatest strength of the course was the passion and knowledge professor Westad brought to lecture. I believe the greatest weakness, however, is that there are no examinations in the class. The lack of any examinations means that there is very little incentive for students to attend lecture or learn the course's materials, outside of lectures and readings which pertain to their chosen essay topics.",
                "Lectures were great, the readings were pretty good and section was actually the most helpful and enjoyable I've had so far at Yale. Prof. Westad was very engaging and incredibly knowledgeable, and Nikolaus cared more about us than any other TA I've had so far. The assignments were quite short, which was great, but the one downside was the grading was sort of weird. I felt like by the end I had improved in my ability to write to Nikolaus' wishes, but not necessarily improved as a writer. I learned to keep everything very simple, but I was still frustrated by some of the stuff he took issue with in papers. Overall though, a very good class.",
                "Section was incredibly time consuming, but the way the course was structured was a huge strength (4 papers over the course of the term). Lecture was also great.",
                "The lectures were well produced and the section discussions were interesting. While the reading load was heavy, the grading structure allowed for flexibility in prioritizing the topics that most interested you. You get to pick what you write your essays about.",
                "Strengths: Professor Westad and our TF Nikolaus made a great teaching team. Lectures were engaging and the workload wasn't too bad. At the beginning the reading load felt very daunting but eventually I got used to it (and learned to skim). I loved how much freedom and flexibility we had in our papers, both in terms of topics and timing. We just had to turn in four papers before their respective deadlines, so you could pretty much write them whenever you'd like. \r\nWeaknesses: I often found myself craving for something more in-depth, but because we had so much ground to cover, it wasn't always possible to really delve into any particular topic.",
                "I thought the course was a great overview of the main events of the twentieth century. However, I thought more focus on the Middle East could have been a good addition to the course.",

                "yes because of Professor Westad but the course does need some restructuring before it as accessible to other students",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a global perspective on history generally. Its focus on events at a global scale, analyzing the events of the Cold War from non-superpower actors for example, really broadens the historical debate around the events of the 20th century. I enjoyed the structure of the course and recommend it to those interested in global history.",
                "I could not in good conscience recommend this class, in its current form, to other students at Yale. The grading of the entire course is far too arbitrary. Papers were graded harshly and several students seemed to be punished for omitting arguments or positions that the TA personally held. Feedback constantly contained language such as \"I wish you had mentioned this...\" or \"Why do you not mention...\" Additionally, the topics of the essay assignments were far too broad for the 1000 word limit and in many respects thus set students up for failure. Finally, it was not made clear at the beginning of the semester the standards to which we would be held for our section participation. In section, and in the subsequent grading of it, it felt as if we were being held to the standards of graduate history students, not those of undergraduates taking a history course. The professor should maybe consider making the class a seminar instead of a lecture as I feel that this would better match his teaching desires and style to the students who could succeed in such a course and meet his lofty expectations.",
                "Yes, definitely, especially a history student! Nikolaus, unlike most TAs, does actually expect you to do the readings and care about section, so I wouldn't recommend it to those hoping to take it easy. But if you want an overview of a bunch of the most important things that have happened since 1900, this is an excellent course. If you're someone who likes to have a lot of interaction with your TA, this would also be a great class for you.",
                "Yes, its a brilliant overview of many aspects of the 20th century. The choices of topics for essays means that you get to explore the things that you enjoy.",
                "Absolutely -- especially if don't know much about 20th century world history! Professor Westad is knowledgeable and a great teacher! Westad prioritizes the events and trends that are most relevant to explaining the shape of our world today, making the class incredibly applicable to understanding current events.",
                "I think it would be a great introductory course for someone interested in learning more about the 20th century. But if you're looking for something more specialized or more in-depth, this might not be the right course. However, what I really liked about it was that the professor and the TF gave us a lot of freedom in choosing our paper topics and suggested great secondary sources outside the syllabus, and you'd have lots of opportunity to go beyond what's covered in the lectures.",
