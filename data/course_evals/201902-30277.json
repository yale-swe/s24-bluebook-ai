   "comments": [
    "Efficient, easy to follow along,",
    "Strength: There are enough practices for us to understand the abstract ideas and the course facilitator is nice and willing to answer my questions promptly. The workload of the course is very reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeakness: There is no time for the facilitator to go through homework with us. There are still some questions for me left behind. It would be better if some common mistakes can be explained during lectures.",
    "Strength: This course is well organized and rich in content.",
    "this course is really useful as the basis for every subject. the lectures are reasonably organized and well taught by Parker. \r\nbut the course was a little bit dull without any interactions between the teacher and the students. if it can involve more activities and discussion, it will be wonderful.",
    "The course covers statistics in a clear and conceptual manner and delivers exactly what is promised in the course description; solid understanding of fundamental statitistics. The homework workload was however a bit excessive at times and was at some times slightly tedius since most of the homework assignments involved writing down exercises that were quite simple on many sheets of paper.",
    "Weaknesses - moved way too fast, too little times on quizzes\r\nStrengths - professor was very kind and cared about students, mindful of making ideal statistic citizens",
    "Professor Holzer was a good teacher, and class was easy to follow.  \r\nHowever, the TA was nearly impossible to understand and follow, and I was absolutely unable to communicate with him or figure out what was going on in the section, which unfortunately graded all my problem sets. The other students in the TA section all also spoke a language other than English, and I was not able to overcome the language barriers in the Section.\r\nMaking matters worse, the textbook was full of incorrect answers, which I pointed out to the professor, so that made the sets difficult to complete with accuracy. There was no communication to students about the incorrect printed answers, and combined with the TA Section problems, it was not easy to know what to expect in terms of accurate problem sets and grading. I actually really like the subject, the professor, and trying to solve the problems, I just did not have an easy avenue to review problem sets, which other students were able to do to achieve perfect results."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think statistics is an important area to learn about and provides a good base to take other courses.",
    "Yes. This course is well designed to give students a foundation of statistics. It is not super hard, but still challenging, for students without statistic background, which is the reason why this course is interesting.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. The introduction is very interesting and the methods I learnt in this class are useful.",
    "i will strongly recommend this wonderful course since it is useful for everyone in every subject. \r\nthe teacher is friendly and enthusiastic of answering our questions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any other student that wants to get into statistics for the first time.",
    "A basic intro to stats is pretty essential Id say",
    "The course and Professor Holzer were good, and interesting and meaningful. \r\nHowever, I did not find the TA Section to be helpful for all students because of language and communication issues.\r\nI'd recommend improving the TA system for the class, so it's more useful to all students, and I would urge someone to have the textbook publisher update the answer key so it is accurate."
