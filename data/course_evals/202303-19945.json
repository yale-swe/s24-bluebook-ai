                "During this course, I learned about the epistemological and ontological divide within academia due to colonialism. Additionally, throughout the course, we reviewed literature from scholars who, if left to the \"great tradition/dominant group,\" would remain unheard. We explored the discourse and disconnection in the context of environmental justice, spirituality, race, capitalism, and colonialism. We were also given the academic space to research and pursue our interests.  The skills, insights, and knowledge I feel I have personally acquired are those needed to dismantle such forces in pursuit of collective and global understanding."

The professor was genuinely interested in each one of us as people, and the discussion-based format of the class lended itself to that. The cultural diversity of the class was such a strength, especially for the type of material we were covering. Personal stories from my classmates contributed to my understanding throughout the class."
