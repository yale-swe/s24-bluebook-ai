                "My oral and written spanish improved and learned so much about the culture of spanish speaking places.",
                "I learned about different social issues in Latin America and Spain (i.e. sustainable cities, language education, healthcare, law) and I gained new vocabulary to discuss and write about these complex topics.",
                "This course was great for practicing speaking Spanish in the classroom with other students at your level. I learned especially a lot about human rights and systemic injustice in Latin American countries. If you're interested in developing academic and diplomatic (some may say) vocabulary, this is a good starting point!",

                "The course integrates many different types of homework such as articles, journals, podcasts, and documentaries on all sorts of topics which makes the work super engaging and interesting. I appreciated how in-class discussions were valued and how Professor Sanchez-Walker facilitated discussion to include everyone. The class does a great job of recognizing viewpoints that are often ignored in studies of infrastructure and history and I especially appreciated the emphasis on indigenous traditions and culture. I think the course could be improved by focusing more formally on grammar and vocabulary. While I loved being able to practice Spanish through oral and written assignments and feel like my grammar improved through practice, reviewing grammar rules could've been helpful.",
                "Noelia Snchez Walker was the course's biggest strength. She is so organized and engaged.",
                "Strengths: 1) Profesora Snchez is a knowledgeable, understanding professor who teaches and explains new topics very well! She also gave a lot of feedback on our oral and written assignments, so we could improve our Spanish. 2) The classs workload was pretty low (I spent around 1.5 to 2 hours on HW each week) and the class time went by pretty fast and was never boring. 3) I advanced my language skills in all areas: oral, written, listening, and reading.",
                "Our professor was phenomenal at keeping us engaged; the real-world problems drew my attention to the class. I wish there were more large conversations (like back and forth between students). Sometimes simply answering questions was great but we did not get to apply conversational language as much. This is not a class for learning conversational Spanish, I wish there was more of this. But you certainly come out more fluent that you went in! \r\n\r\nI also loved the Talk Abroad aspect. Getting to speak to different native speakers was a great experience to really push my speaking skills and have to speak Spanish on-the-fly without subbing in many English words. Super effective for learning fluency.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-offers various ways to consume and produce spanish (essays, podcasts, presentations, videos, conversations, audios, etc)\r\n-held in depth conversations in class with spanish\r\n- discussed various topics\r\n-Talk Abroad allowed us to speak with people from across the world on these subjects and learn more about their culture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-This does not count toward the certificate although we spend a significant amount of time in class using Spanish and learning a lot about hispanic culture"

My ability to communicate in Spanish has noticeably improved and I always looked forward to completing the coursework because of how interesting it was. The workload is manageable and I always felt comfortable and supported in class.",
                "Yes! if you are looking for an L5 class that will improve your Spanish ability, this is a great course.",
                "Absolutely! If you want to gain practice speaking and writing about more advanced topics in Spanish (especially before taking a 200 or 300 level Spanish class), this class is for you.",
                "Absolutely, 100% especially is it is with Noelia. I couldn't recommend another lecturer more, she is so amazing, understanding, and knowledgeable. If you want an L5 credit, taking this course is a great way to get it. If you want something that really pushes your language or Hispanic culture skills, however, I would recommend doing a different L5 course. I may call this a great in-between all other L5 Spanish courses and L4 if you feel you need a little more confidence before jumping into more rigorous work.",
                "Yes. I definitely felt my Spanish improving each day and allowed me to keep up with the language while also learning new information about various countries."
