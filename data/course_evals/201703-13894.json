    "I grew in my ability to read a text and further analyze its meaning while also developing my interpretation of the topic at hand.",

    "I learned a lot about the theory and practice of sound.  I engaged in challenging discussion, research, and writing that allowed me to grow as a person.",
    "Both my academic writing and ability to analyze and discuss complicated texts improved significantly.",
    "New perspectives on the concept of sound.\r\nGreater appreciation for writing.",
    "I learned how to navigate a writing course at Yale. I also learned how to share my opinions on readings through class discussions and written work.",
    "I improved my writing skills and got familiar with the resources available to me at Yale. I also got a general introduction to the area of sound studies, which I am continuing to read about."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include an extremely involved discussion. The readings are relavent to current events. Some of the readings were a bit too advanced, but I was able to understand the content through the class discussion.",
    "I loved the topic of this course, including the readings, the topics of discussion, and the videos. I found it very interesting, especially in the discussions it allowed with the rest of my classmates. This allowed us to foster a very close classroom environment, which I found integral to how much I liked the class. I think that the course would be a bit better if we received more concrete feedback on how we could improve first drafts, such as with rubrics.",
    "The course involved many interesting texts, projects, and discussions. I felt as though I got more out of the in class discussions than the papers though, and more discussions about writing rather than theory would have been beneficial.",
    "Unorganized curriculum.\r\nGreat discussions.",
    "Since it is an English 114, there are strict guidelines and specific areas that must be go over. It is holding the class back.",
    "This course's strength was how engaging it was. Almost all of the reading were very interesting and everyone's research papers were very unique. This meant the discussion was of very high quality. Sometimes, however, if the texts were too abstract or not accompanied by listening examples, the discussion was a little dry. Also, sometimes I felt that we spent too much time going over assignments. To me this issue was mainly reactionary to the first essay, which was due only a week into class, and therefore was not well-introduced."

    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has the skightest interest in sound or music.",
    "This course both expanded my thinking and was incredibly enjoyable, so I would absolutely recommend it to peers, especially those that have a passion for listening to and\/or performing music.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for students who wish to learn about\/discuss sound (music, environment, theory, etc.), but who do not so much care for seriously developing their writing (as a first and foremost focus).",
    "Most definitely. This class was truly enjoyable and I definitely learned a lot.",
    "This course has interesting readings and papers.",
    "Yes! The professor is amazing once you get to know him and the topic of the course cannot be more interesting.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I think this is a great way to get writing experience but be able to apply it to something fun and approachable, like sound and music."
