Obviously, that's a more personal answer, but the readings and discussions in this class are bound to improve your level of thinking\/writing in French in one way or another.\r\n\r\nFinally, I had to opportunity to consider a wide range of perspectives on femininity, feminism, religion, family, etc.",

                "I think the course's small size and level of interaction were the major plus. As the semester went on, the five of us became a lot more comfortable together, and I think the discussions improved accordingly.\r\n\r\nMme. Sanjabi is the kind of professor who I'd describe as \"casually brilliant.\" She says things like they're no big deal, and then a few seconds later you realize that she's just expressed a really complicated idea that you had never even considered.\r\n\r\nI did feel like the workload was very manageable throughout the semester and suddenly became very high during the last week, when we had to turn in an essay and prepare a final presentation. However, Mme. Sanjabi was very flexible and understanding of our concerns - more so, in fact, than any other professor I had this semester.",
                "The course is rigorous but the work is not too challenging and it is manageable. However, I constantly felt behind the other students and there wasn't time to catch up or work towards understanding due to the pace of the course. There isn't much tutorial support or a writing tutor so it is very self-selective. Some of the readings are also uncommon so it can start to feel isolated when there aren't many people or sources who understand and can support you. Madam Sanjabi did do a great job at doing the best she can to provide context, history, and analysis on each reading. We also spent time examining each other to also help investigate their writing.",

It is challenging but incredibly fascinating and you will find yourself wanting to engage with the material even if you don't fully understand it. This is a first-year seminar which means you will only get the chance to take it as a first-year and you should. The class truly is not about getting a good grade or getting a language requirement it is about learning and expanding your mind. Very interesting I do recommend.",
