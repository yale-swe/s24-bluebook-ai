                "Through this class, I improved my written and spoken Spanish and familiarized myself with legal terminology in Spanish. I also learned about numerous different legal concepts, including the distinctions between the civil law and common law, different Latin American constitutions, and penal law systems. From our weekly readings and podcasts, I was exposed to many fascinating current event topics, such as oil spills in Peru, the fast fashion industry in Chile, elections in Colombia, and gentrification in Puerto Rico.",
                "During this course I was able to enhance my Spanish writing skills. I was able to better understand the intricacies of the legal system in Spain and Latin America. While doing this, I was also able to to learn about the cultures and ways of living in many different Spanish speaking countries.",
                "I learned about the various legal systems \/ political atmospheres in Spanish-speaking countries. We also touched on elements of criminal law which was very interesting.",

                "I really enjoyed this course! The strengths of the course is that it gives a good overview of numerous legal topics and we analyze many excerpts of statutes and constitutions. All of the podcasts and articles that we had to read for the course taught me a lot about recent events in different parts of Latin America and Spain. Additionally, since the course has a lot of weekly writing, I was able to significantly improve my Spanish writing ability over the semester. The only small weakness of this class is that sometimes we had to answer a lot of questions for the podcasts, which took a long time. However, the workload for the course was very manageable overall.",
                "I believe a strength if this course is that every week we are discussing a new Spanish speaking country and are able to gain more cultural awareness. Somethign that can be improved upon is the amount of questions that get asked on a homework assignment for podcasts. Sometimes for a 40 minute podacst there are about 40 questions which takes a very long time to complete when you have to pause to write an answer so often.",
                "The main strength of this course is its organization. Profesora Carreras is very structured, which makes following along easy. There were not many weaknesses, but sometimes this course ends up being sort of lecture style. I think it would be helpful to have more group discussions \/ activities if possible.",
                "This is a very good Spanish class that provides a lot of knowledge. However, the only weakness would be that the work at times feels very repetitive, but nonetheless still enjoyable.",
                "strength: very structured\r\nweakness: a bit repetitive",
                "strengths: Mercedes is sweet and wants you to succeed. The podcasts for homework were pretty interesting. The final essay is a lot of fun since you get a lot of liberty on the topic.\r\nweaknesses: the lectures dragged on a bit and were boring. I wish we spent more time talking with each other, seminar style, especially since there were not many students in the class. I was hoping to debate and engage with the material more since a lot of it was controversial, but most of it was simply presented to you in the form of writing it down on the board. The homework was excessive, and this ended up being one of the most heavy courses of the semester (6+ hours a week in homework). However, around mid-semester Mercedes realized she was killing us and eased up a bit on the amount of homework (I really appreciated that).",
                "Strengths: Interesting course material, empathetic teaching style\r\nWeaknesses: Tons of assigned workload that didn't seem to actually matter once we got into class. Professor was lax when it came to grading, but required large quantities of written assignments per week."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if you are seeking to improve your Spanish writing and reading skills. While there is not as many discussions in class, there was a great shift in my Spanish writing and reading ability throughout the semester.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student interested in broadening their knowledge on the legal systems in Spanish-speaking countries. We delve deep into many different topics from election campaigns to climate issues. I also very much enjoyed comparing countries \/ their respective systems side by side.",
                "Yes! This is an amazing L5 Spanish and a really fun class!",
                "Absolutely. Mercedes is amazing. Workload stays the same throughout the entire semester, if anything less as it goes on.",
                "yes - she is an amazing teacher and it's a great first L5 class to take",
                "Sure, but only if you have the time to do the homework. The actual material is interesting if you're into law, but the way it is presented is not very engaging. I wouldn't say it is a 'must-take' but if you're looking for a Spanish credit this is alright.",
                "Yes, probably. Legal Spanish is a great Spanish credit that does improve your Spanish due to the amount of listening and writing involved. I would warn them of the high workload but reassure them that the professor is not strict and is very empathetic."
