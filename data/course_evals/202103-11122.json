                "The material was really interesting and Professor Manohar did a great job teaching it. The labs as well, while lengthy, were often fun to work on. The tools we used were finicky and buggy, but fortunately Professor Manohar was usually available to help debug.",
                "The lectures and homeworks are very well-organized. The tools we used were still in an early state and sometimes buggy, but that was kind of cool because we were working at the cutting edge. Also, Professor Manohar is an absolute expert, extremely responsive, and a fun guy.",
                "Strengths: Rajit is extremely knowledgeable about the field, and a good number of the tools used in the class were built by his group. The subject of the course is fascinating  you get you learn how computers work at the most basic levels. The professor and staff are all very responsive to questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the software used in this class is kind of dated/buggy.",

                "If you're at all interested in digital circuit design, I highly recommend this course. Professor Manohar is a great professor and this material is his field of expertise. It's insane how far I've come in my understanding since the beginning of the semester. Admittedly, the material is challenging to grasp and there is quite a bit of work, so make sure you budget enough time for this class. But this class is really one-of-a-kind; I doubt any class offered at any university would give you the same experience.",
                "Absolutely. I am a CS major with no EENG background, so the first few lectures had me worried, but the goal of a lot of the class is to build abstractions so that we usually don't have to worry about physical properties and can think at the logical level. I would recommend being familiar with basic gates like NAND, NOR, etc. but you could always pick them up as you go. The asynchronous design focus is really cool because very few people are doing it, and it could be revolutionary. Professor Manohar is amazing and an expert in the field, plus his stories are fun.",
                "Yes  this course is a great overview of how a chip is made. You'll probably want to have some background in programming and/or circuit design, otherwise the class might be a bit difficult to follow. But if you've got the time and are looking for a challenge, this course is a great opportunity to learn from one of the best people in the field. The assignments and projects are all group-based, and the professor and TF are all highly responsive  you'll find plenty of support if you ever get lost in this class.",
