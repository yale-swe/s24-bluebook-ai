                "Our conversations in class sometimes felt a little slow, but I enjoyed the structure of a weekly film and reading response. It meant that the workload stayed consistent throughout the semester, there is no midterm or final exam/paper, and I received lots of feedback about my writing that I could implement as the semester went on. I noticed a real improvement in my reading responses over the course of the semester as I became more familiar with film terms and noticed recurring patterns and themes between the films.",

                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in any combination of German history, Holocaust and Nazi history, the early/mid 20th century, questions of modernity, the emergence of new technologies, and film as a medium. I learned so much about the cultural context of film production and am going to take these insights into my other courses. It's not that much work, but the weekly reading responses do require some thinking and time. I loved being able to watch interesting movies for a homework assignment, so the reading responses didn't feel like a burden, but you do need to account for a solid few hours of time outside of class each week.",
                "Absolutely! If you are a film major looking to talk about great films, this is the class for you. If you have never taken a film class before, the subject matter might be daunting at first, but prof Hagens makes it extremely approachable. One of the best seminars Ive taken at Yale!"
