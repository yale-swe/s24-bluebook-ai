   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Introduction to canonical texts in language\/cognition scholarship, critical reading of anthropological\/linguistic texts",
    "I learned SO much about how language develops culture, how we talk about culture using language, and how different cultures use language differently. I'm sure I learned things I don't even realize yet.",
    "One of the most valuable skills that this course taught was careful and critical reading. This may sound odd, considering how many courses at Yale are reading heavy, but the way that this course is structured is conducive to particularly close readings of difficult texts. This result is made possible by the open-ended and informal nature of the reading response assignments as well as the volume of reading (it is very doable, one or two articles or chapter excerpts each week). Additionally, I developed new insights about not only relationship between human culture and language, but also the intellectual history of how academics from various disciplines have approached similar topics. Having this bibliographic knowledge has been very helpful for my own research.",
    "I learned to love language as something so much more philosophical than I could have ever imagined. We read a lot of papers that broke language down to its bare bones, uncovering the semiotics and situational functions of language. This class was completely different from any other language-related course I've taken, teaching me to think about speech and grammar through cultural grounds, footing, sign relations, and so many more lenses.",
    "How language and culture are connected; how language, linguistic practices & theories can be employed to analyse cultural systems; problems of the standard understanding of the function of linguistic and \"shifts\" & \"changes\" that have been developed to deal with those issues"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The syllabus tried to pull out the salvageable idea from canonical texts without a thorough analysis of those texts' shortcomings. The biggest weakness of the course was its failure to address the absence of race and gender in the actual knowledge production - not just in writers' politics but in how those politics inform their ideologies and, subsequently, their claims.",
    "Weekly reading responses were super helpful in writing the final paper, and the readings felt like they had all been carefully chosen to complement each other. Reading load and topic varied nicely. Class discussion was insightful and added to our understanding. We pulled from a lot of disciplines though so it would have been great to spend some class time (maybe the last or second to last day) figuring out what ideas were just being given different words.",
    "The main strength of the course is that it has a very manageable workload, which makes doing thorough reading and studying possible. Additionally, the subject matter is interesting and engaging.",
    "This was a super engaging course! Both the Professor and the TA were fantastic!",
    "Professor Kockelman is a really fun teacher! He is literally the only reason why I was able to understand what we were reading in this class. The readings are typically quite dense, especially if you have no background in linguistics or anthropology, but I felt like I'd come out of each class like I understood what the writers were analyzing. Also, I'd like to say that although some of the readings were long and\/or convoluted, I never found them tedious.\r\nOne of the best aspects of the course is how it's taught. Professor Kockelman frequently mentions past readings so as to affirm what we have already learned. We're welcome to discuss the readings as we see fit, and I never felt like we would be shamed if what we said strayed a bit from what Kockelman was expecting. \r\nI guess the only part of this class that may seem nerve-wracking is that, although the reading responses are meant to be a part of the grade, we never actually received any grades for them. Because of this, you just sort of have to assume that it's graded on a pass\/fail scale and hope that the final paper goes well. I will say, however, that we received feedback\/small notes on our reading responses, which was great.",
    "everything in the class - reading assignments, reading responses, lectures - were well organised and connected, and was helpful for me to internalise the theories\/frameworks dealt with in the class"

    "This course was incredibly interesting, even as someone with minimal background in either linguistics or anthropology! It definitely expanded how I think about language and its role in the public space, in various kinds of processes like racialization. The workload was completely manageable, with weekly readings+reading responses and one final paper. Reading some of the theory was slow for me as I lacked experience, but it got easier as the course went on, and when I couldn't fully make sense of the reading on its own, Prof. Kockelman's lectures helped a lot in grounding the more theoretical things in real phenomena and explaining them in comprehensible ways. Prof. Kockelman is also so much fun to listen to during class; he's hilarious but he also does a good job synthesizing lots of information and drawing connections between different parts of the course.",
    "Definitely! I came into the class with zero experience with linguistics or anthropology, but had a great time regardless. Some of the readings were a bit dry and academic, but the discussion in class made up for it. Paul is such a funny lectureryou have to at least shop the class to see what I mean, but I could've filled a book with quotes from the class that had me dying every time. So I ended up learning a good bit about language and culture, but mostly just had a really enjoyable time. Workload was also not bad at all, weekly readings and responses took a couple of hours, and besides that it was just the final paper. Would definitely recommend!",
    "This course is especially suited to students who think they'd be into linguistics, but don't like the grammar and phonetics and are in reality interested in systems thinking and semiotics.",
    "When I realized what the course was about (a few weeks in), I thought it would be instructive for me to have my ideas challenged. However, I often felt like my ideas were not being received well by the professor or my peers. The lecture-style did not facilitate interrogation of the topics, but instead the course was primarily spent catching up to the professor's understanding of the material.",
    "It's cool but only take it if you (think you) like linguistics",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It provides a new lens with which to view language and culture. The novelty of the information and theoretical concerns presented applies to both those with and without backgrounds in anthropology and linguistics.",
    "Yes! This course was fascinating. I looked forward to it every single week.",
    "I definitely would! This course opened my eyes to a discipline that I was previously completely unfamiliar with.",
    "Yes, especially if you would like to know how language functions in society. Even if you're not an anthropology major, the course is great particularly for those interested in philosophy of language\/culture, concerned about post-structuralism, post-colonialism, critical theory etc."
