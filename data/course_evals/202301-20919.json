                "I learned about birds from many different angles: evolution (from dinosaurs!), feather evolution, color, sight, physiology, sex, etc! This course gave me a really strong appreciation for evolution (more so than my evolutionary bio class...). There was also a really insightful section at the end of the class on sexual coercion and autonomy in birds.",
                "I learned so much more than I imagined by taking this course. Beginning with the expected, I learned about feathers, bird physiology, display, and song. As for the unexpected, we refuted typical conceptions of sexual selection and discussed queer gender theory. I also found myself learning more about the physics of flight than I had in my physics classes.",
                "I learned a whole lot about the evolution and biology of birds (even as a kid who grew up with birdwatcher parents). This class made me love birds a whole lot more, and it's probably the class with the most fascinating material that I took at Yale.",
                "I learned everything I ever wanted to know about birds.",
                "This is a very comprehensive course for learning about birds. I learned everything from bird evolution, to development and physiology, flight and migration, to reproductive systems.",
                "General knowledge of avian physiology and behavior",
                "I learned all about birds, from their origins to their physiology.",
                "I learned so much about birds, including their physiology, behavior, and breeding systems! Through the associated lab, I learned to identify birds by family and apply the material from the lecture to identification skills. I learned about the current debates within the ornithological field, including Darwin v. Wallace and cursorial v. arboreal theory of avian flight evolution. I learned about how a feather grows and why birds are so colorful. This was definitely my favorite course I have taken at Yale thus far.",
                "Much deeper appreciation and understanding of birds, thinking more about beauty in a both philosophical and evolutionary way",
                "This course simultaneously provided a broad review of the life of birds while also taking a particularly deep dive into their aesthetic evolution and experience. I learned a lot about avian physiology and evolution.",
                "A broad knowledge of the working physiology and origin of birds.",
                "I learned broadly about the field of ornithology, including the evolution, flight, migration, and feather growth of birds. By writing the final term paper, I learned how to research and approach a scientific paper while also diving deeply into a subject matter of my choosing.",
                "Great overview of bird biology and biology in a broader context.",
                "I learned a great deal about the biology of birds, in particular their physiology and behavior. Writing the paper was challenging and did help me improve at official scientific writing. The units on behavior, bird intelligence, sexual selection, and aesthetics in animals were particularly eye-opening, and really changed how I see the non-human world and how I want to approach biology in the future."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This course is very well-organized and well-structured, and Professor Prum is a charismatic and kind professor. I found the exams to be quite doable, and the work is spread out evenly throughout the semester. I also thought that the course is designed in a way that makes it equally accessible to both science and non-science majors; I am a history major and had never taken any kind of biology course in college, but this course did not assume much prior knowledge while simultaneously being engaging for all levels. \r\nWeaknesses: I had a few friends who struggled a lot on the exams. The exams are not curved, and so you do truly need to attend lecture and study for them in order to do well. But from my experience, this is not challenging.",
                "I found the lectures to be at times a little too fast paced. However Professor Prum is an outstanding lecturer who captivates the whole class and keeps them interested and engaged. I thought there could be better support for the exams, there was little/no direction or advice on how to study (maybe I just struggled as a non-stem major understanding how to study)",
                "Strengths: I thought the material was really interesting and fun to engage with. There was no regular work, just exams and a paper (which I really like). Prum is a super engaging lecturer, and it was cool to be learning from a top researcher in the field. He was so excited about everything he taught.\r\nWeaknesses: the term paper is ten pages long and there was not a lot of support for the writing process. I also didn't like the very beginning of the course where we went over the phylogeny of birds (felt a little unmotivated/boring to start the class with).",
                "Strengths: Professor Prum is fantastic. His knowledge of birds, and anything somewhat adjacent to birds, is boundless. If you ever want to take a class with someone who not only guides a field but is the field, you should absolutely take ornithology. The class gave me a much greater appreciation for the natural world at large. \r\n\r\nThe exams are fair albeit quite detailed. I would recommend reading the book and taking notes then using the class to supplement notes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think including key terms more clearly at the start of a new slide section would be helpful. Sometimes it would be difficult to know which terms to take particular note of. Similarly, including some additional text on slides might be useful when there is more difficult terminology. \r\n\r\nInvolving the TAs more may also benefit the course. I would sometimes have questions, but Prum wouldn't be at his office hours.",
                "Strengths: Amazing lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Final paper really snuck up -- I think that there should be more structure (like requiring students to submit their topic/brief outline by the midterm) to prevent procrastination",
                "Difficult course because there is no homework and the tests are worth almost all your grade.",
                "Though I think Professor Prum is very engaging, the balance of material did not feel like a great representation of what was on the syllabus. We ended up diving far deeper into some subjects, while barely touching on others.",
                "The professor is very passionate about the subject and gave very engaging lectures. The tests were pretty difficult, but the material itself is very manageable and interesting.",
                "The strengths of this course are the structure, the professor, and the contentessentially all of it! The structure of three weekly lectures, two cumulative lecture examinations, one cumulative final, and a research paper makes this course incredibly doable in terms of workload. There is no outside \"homework.\" With that said, this class is NOT a gut and should not be taken as such. If you want to learn about birds, this is the course for you. While the \"cumulative\" format can be scary, ultimately, it only benefits you for the final. The content moves from dinosaur origins to flight to physiology to breeding systems to evolutionary theory in a smooth fashion. Professor Prum is outstanding! He gives exciting lectures and explains everything in detail using helpful analogies. He genuinely wants everyone in the class to learn and be excited about birds. Also, the birding field trips are wonderful experiences to test your knowledge in the field! One possible weakness was that the slideshows of the lecture material are only posted a week before the exam; however, I found this to be manageable and not a real source of stress.",
                "I think the lectures are at a good pace and that the information was very well delivered. I would say that the midterms were a little oddly timed (a little too close together) and that the final paper snuck up on a lot of people. Other than that the strengths are the fantastic course content and Prof. Prum-- he is a super engaging lecturer!",
                "I wish we had some small quizzes throughout, whether take home/in-class or not for a grade, just to have more incentive for retention of what we learned in lecture",
                "I thought we spent two much time discussing mechanisms of color production - I wish could couldve spent more time on vocal behavior or behavioral ecology.",
                "I quite liked the lectures; I do wish the slides were posted sooner before the exams to facilitate early studying.",
                "The lectures of the course were fascinating, and Professor Prum was a very engaging lecturer. However, at times the lectures went over material very quickly, which could be challenging during more complex units. The addition of outside reading of the textbook would often clear up any confusion since note-taking in class needed to be supplemented. Though laid out in the syllabus, the assignments and expectations of the class were a bit vague. Throughout the course, I was never aware of my performance or the pace of the class.",
                "Wel paced and well structured.",
                "Professor Prum is a wonderful professor and lecturer, and the material is really engaging. I also liked the format of the course, since it was nice not to have much work and be able to focus on learning the material. The field trips were also a highlight. I honestly wouldn't change anything, unless the field trip to Ecuador could be reinstated!"

                "YES! This was such an incredible course. I would recommend this to absolutely anyone, but especially to fellow humanities majors looking for a science credit. In addition to the basic concepts one would expect from a bird class (anatomy, etc.) this course engages with concepts of beauty, sexual autonomy, scientific debates, and more. It is so much more than just a class on birds, and Professor Prum is a truly brilliant professor who is so passionate about teaching and his work. I also found this class to be quite easy, and if you attend lecture and study just a little bit you will be successful. I have so many friends who have taken random classes for their science credits and hated them, and I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to take this one. Prum only teaches it every other year, so take it when you can!",
                "Yes!! Birds!!",
                "Yes, its a fascinating course where I learnt a lot. Its not really applicable to anything I want to do in life but it was a great course to take for the fun of learning.",
                "Yes! If you want a fun science credit, are interested in evolution, or think birds are cool, take the class! I went in blind and it ended up being my favorite class this semester! Low stress and you learn lots of cool bird facts!",
                "Please take ornithology! I am not an E&EB major, and ornithology is one of the top three classes I have ever taken at Yale. I think many of the classes I have taken at Yale, although excellent, have made me aware of a wide variety of problems with which I was previously unfamiliar. This is great but also does not necessarily make me a happier person. Ornithology, in contrast, instilled in me a genuine sense of wonder about the world again. I loved learning about birds--their beauty, song, etc.--and I was taken by how ornithology is so cross-cutting. For example, Prum wrote an article about lame duck presidents.",
                "Yes! This class was super enjoyable and fascinating at every turn. As long as you show up to class, spend a day studying before the test, and start your final paper well in advance, it doesn't turn out to be a whole lot of work, and not too difficult to do well in. Super glad to have been able to take the class -- probably one of the finest lecture classes at Yale",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is at least curious about birds.",
                "Would recommend to anyone who feels passionate about birds, or want to learn more about the diversity of life in general.",
                "Absolutely, but only if you are already interested in birds or biology. If not, there may be moments in which the material is frustratingly niche",
                "Yes, this is not a gut science course, but you become a bird expert by the end of the course. Professor Prum is also an amazing professor and it is great to see how passionate he is about ornithology.",
                "If youre taking this for a gut science credit, DONT. He says this is not a gut at the very beginning. And its true. It is not. There is a lot of memorization and a lot of details to know. If youre passionate about birds or not, you will learn a lot. But even if the workload seems low, trust that this class will have you memorize a lot for the exams. Repeat, this is not a gut.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! The contentbirdsis awesome. The format is approachable. The workload (especially if you are only in the lecture class) is manageable. I highly recommend taking the lab as it makes lecture content much easier to process and can be very helpful on exams. Professor Prum is a prominent ornithologist in the field who basically discovered or worked on almost all of the content in the course. It is the opportunity of a lifetime.",
                "I would highly, highly recommend this course. While I am an art history major (was mainly trying to get my SC out of the way), this class changed the way I look at the world, art, birds, beauty, and my role in all those things. There was so much value in going really deep into the study of one clade/genus/species and yet getting perspective on a world so much larger than the specific topic. I loved this class so much and I'm telling all my friends to take it if it's the last thing they do at Yale. TAKE IT!!!!!",
                "Yes, Prof Prum is very passionate about what he's teaching and the lectures have always been very engaging and insightful",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to any other student. Birds are one of defining features of the environment around us, and this class will greatly enhance your appreciation of them.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student with the warning that it will be a full 1-credit workload, and nothing less should be expected.",
                "The class is quite interesting even if one doesn't have any background in ornithology or previous interest. The content is very broad, and tests require a lot of review beforehand to cover all the material presented in class. Still, for a humanities major, the information is understandable without previous science courses. I would recommend the course if one is willing to engage during lectures and outside of class. The workload is manageable if you don't procrastinate on the final paper.",
                "Yes, its a great course.",
                "Absolutely. It was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Ornithology stands out especially among science classes for being interesting and relevant to my own life. I learned a lot about birds that really expanded my knowledge of avian biology and diversity, but the units on behavior, intelligence, and sexual selection changed how I see the world and approach biology."
