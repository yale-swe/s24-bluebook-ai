                "You do learn a lot doing a project like this, but it's a bit of a trial by fire. At certain points, it felt like we got thrown into the deep end and had to learn to swim very quickly, learning how to work as a team, work with our client, and understand the issues and the culture in a very short space of time and all virtually.  We were lucky in that our advisor was amazing, but our client was not very helpful. They took a really long time to send us information that was often vague or incomplete and didn't seem engaged in the project they asked us to do. I think the capstone project could be improved if we started the year with a basic workshop on doing the capstone in general and working with a client where previous seniors could give advice and answer questions. It would also have been good if the judges and Jackson representatives had given us written feedback on our final presentation and report.",

Because we weren't allowed to go to Garissa, it was very hard to get an idea of what the situation was on the ground and make helpful recommendations. We also had several issues with tech and time zones when meeting with our advisor or interviewees.",
