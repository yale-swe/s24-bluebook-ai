                "We learned to combine high level math skills, problem solving, and physical intuition in order to solve fluid mechanics problems. We became experts in balance equations and derived the Navier Stokes equations of fluid motion.",
                "From learning fundamental things such as tensors and hydrostatics to, mass, momentum, angular momentum and energy balances and their applications in microscopic balances of Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows in pipes (analyzed in both cylindrical and cartesian coordinates) to macroscopic balances in stationary and moving control volumes, this class has taught me a plethora of fascinating physical phenomena. Scaling arguments (derived from the Buckingham Pi theorem and previously used to cleverly find the energy given off by an atomic bomb) served as a useful tool to modify the Navier Stokes equations to fit Creeping Flows, Lubrication Flows, Inviscid flows and Squeezing flows. In conclusion, one of the best classes I have taken in my life.",

                "Strengths - Professor Vanderlick is an dedicated professor who cares about her students and making sure they improve over the course of the semester. She is great at explaining things and is very high-energy and engaging. The psets are time-consuming, but the exams are very fair.\r\nWeaknesses - the class sped up a lot towards the end and we covered a ton of material in the last 2-3 classes, and I'm not sure I have full command over it. Also, we had a lot of problems that weren't released on a typical, regular schedule and sometimes, I felt like office hours didn't happen frequently enough to keep pace with the rate at which new problems were released",
                "Weaknesses: This class is a lot of work, but that's to be expected. Make sure you don't overburden the semester in which you take this.\r\nStrengths: Professor Vanderlick is so amazing. She knows what she's doing -- trust her, even if her methods seem different at first. For example, there aren't psets in this class, but rather \"loose\" problems that are due 4 days after assignment. So, you are constantly practicing and won't fall behind. Exams are open note in a notebook she provides for you. The problems are not just regurgitating examples from class, and there is zero useless memorization involved here: you are learning how to think and problem solve. It is very satisfying and it WORKS.",
                "A strength of this course is the constant engagement. We did not have weekly problem sets, but instead we had 4-6 problems a week. You were unable to slack off or miss a class because of the fast pace.",
                "I believe the strength of this course besides the wonderful and thought-provoking lectures is the freedom of tackling the class how one wants to. For example, the problems are not weighed in terms of the grade but they are essential to understanding class material. Also, the to find problems coupled with the professor's vast knowledge of the literature drives the students to seek more example problems online.",
                "Professor Vanderlick really encourages participation and makes sure that you are fully engaged and absorbing the material. It might be a little difficult if you're a procrastinator -- the pset is split into homework problems that are assigned every day\/every other day and you need to submit the answers within three business days.",
                "This course requires a lot of time and effort, but the payoff is really great. I came out of this class feeling a lot more confident about my problem solving skills. It pulls material from previous classes, specifically diff eq and physics, so it does require some brushing up on those topics. The lectures are almost seminar-style because the class size is so small and the professor likes to keep everyone engaged, but it kept me focused during class. If I could add one thing to the class, I think having recordings of the lectures would be really helpful in case you have to miss class or you want to rewatch.",
                "There are many strengths to this course. From the effort put in by Professor Vanderlick in class to the many homework problems assigned for good reason, there was no other way that this class could be facilitated to better encourage understanding of the subject. No weaknesses."

                "I would recommend this fluids course because of Professor Vanderlick's teaching style, and how good she is at providing context, analogies and real-world examples. She's very good at explaining why what you're learning matters.",
                "Dr. Vanderlick will tell you this on the first day, and I agree: this course is not easy. It is very much a bootcamp. But, like a good workout, while it is difficult in the moment, and the homework problems will take quite a bit of time, you will feel that it is worth it at the end. You will look back at fluid mechanics, a subject that sends all chemical and mechanical engineering students running in terror, and feel the satisfaction of having mastered it. This is the #1 class that made me feel like an engineer. Honestly, even if you are an ambitious physics student or something and don't even need to take this class, take this class. Much of this can be attributed to the excellent teaching of Dr. Vanderlick, so make sure to take the course with her.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class over the mechanical engineering version of fluid mechanics (if you have the option). This class might be more work, but you will better understand the concepts, and Professor Vanderlick is very fair with the grades. Your grade will reflect the work that you put into the class.",
                "I would highly recommend taking this course especially with Professor Vanderlick teaching it. Having previously taken but dropped the MechE departments fluid mechanics course, this course is still quite a bit of work but the way the homework and exams are delivered renders every step of the learning process clear. Prof V is a very engaging and down to earth lecturer with an awe-inspiring passion and appreciation for the beauty of the subject who rallies student participation without shame.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student that is interested in taking a fluid mechanics course.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this course to another student, but only if their major requires it. If a student must take a fluid mechanics class for their major, they should 1000% be taking this class with Professor Vanderlick."
