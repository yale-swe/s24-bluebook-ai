                "Prof Loewenberg is the strength because he's one of the kindest professors you'll find at Yale. Weakness was the lack of math teaching to make it more accessible, but I think it just ended up making us more confused.",
                "Strengths: Professor Loewenberg is great, always very willing to help anyone with questions or concerns, and has a vested interest in making sure that everyone is engaged with the material. He is also very accommodating and willing to make changes to the course structure based on feedback. He made sure to have one on one meetings with everyone in the class to get an idea of where we stand with the material and just get to know us better. The psets weren't too long, and were doable if you attended recitation. The recitation system was very helpful, and our TA Rostacia was very dedicated to answering questions, and was always available to guide us if we needed help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material was sometimes very difficult to understand, and sometimes the lecture notes did not match up with the live lecture, making it slightly confusing.",
                "+Professor Loewenberg and the TF/TAs for the course were amazing. Lots of different opportunities were given to ask questions in lecture, in a Q&A forum, and office hours and the lecture notes provided were great intros and recaps of material. Problem sets were interesting and appropriately challenging.\r\n\r\n-Lectures sometimes just 'landed' somewhere which could be confusing to follow. Then again, this is also because there was a lot of supporting material going into the lecture.",
                "Overall, this class was taught very well and was extremely reasonable for a beginner audience, especially non-stem majors. Loewenberg makes the intro to chemical engineering very easy to digest and participate in, and very pleasant.",
                "The level of engagement of the professor as well as the teaching fellows really made this class for me. Some of the concepts that were covered in lecture were a bit difficult to wrap my head around initially, but Professor Loewneberg and the teaching fellows were always there to help the class understand these concepts.",
                "One strength was that it taught the fundamentals of chemical engineering without requiring a foundation in physics, chemistry, and advanced calculus. \r\n\r\nThat being said, because it did not require background knowledge, the superficial coverage oftentimes led to a lot of confusion, with us skipping several steps in solving problems, and with a few oversimplifications that led to more confusion. Possibly introducing the fundamentals of solving a differential equation ad coverage of some basic physics concepts would have been helpful in the beginning.",
                "Strengths: Very helpful recitations, professor is very willing to help if you reach out \r\nWeakness: lack of structure in class, professor jumps to steps which make things a little confusing, sometimes professor solves problem a certain way and then realizes he did it wrong and erases half of what he wrote before which makes things confusing",
                "Strengths: Professor is always seeking for feedback, really cares about students, and great study guides combine knowledge of past homework assignments in preparation of exam. I learned the most in preparing for the exams.\r\nWeaknesses: A little hard to follow, especially with the virtual format. Do not be afraid to ask questions during lecturethe professor expects it.",
                "Various resources were always available to assist with learning the material. Prof. Loewenberg was always willing to listen to feedback and provide assistance. The readings did not correspond well with the in-class lectures, but previous lecture videos and office hours accounted for this setback."
