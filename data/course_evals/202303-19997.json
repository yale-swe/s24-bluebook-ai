                "Learned about how economic thought went from religious interpretations of interest to modern day behavioral economics. All was exciting and fun to learn.",
                "course material provided great incites on both historical and contemporary economic thinkers while provided for a create foundational understanding of economics",
                "I thought this course was unique amongst Yale's current economics offerings. You read and understand the ideas of many great economists and thinkers, and Professor Dimand makes all the texts and concepts extremely clear and interesting. I was able to situate Yale's introductory and intermediate economics classes in the broader history of economic thought, which was and will be invaluable as I continue to study economics at Yale.",
                "Learned about how economic thought has changed over time and what the economic debates were during each transition period.",

                "Understanding of the evolution of economic thought.",

                "A lot of the ideas in modern economics are often taken for granted. This course sheds light on the origin of those ideas and how they developed over time. Overall, it's a very helpful course for Economics majors to put their knowledge in context. It's also an interesting course for anybody to take.",
                "learned a lot on history of economic thought",
                "I learned a lot about the development of economic thought throughout history and the impact of the surrounding geopolitical conditions on the different perspectives and understandings of the economy. I had the opportunity to learn how the great economists, such as Adam Smith and David Hume, have created and developed their own economic models and beliefs regarding the economy and the role of different economic factors in the success of a society."

                "I didn't find the discussion sections to be super necessary; but if you feel like you have questions it might be a better time to ask than during the lecture, as that might cause us to fall behind (lecture schedule is very structured). Papers can be hard to read at times, but that's why you show up to class! The prof does a great job covering and summarizing them.",
                "Strength: we cover a lot of ground but it is not overwhelming; you get a good understanding of the evolution of economic theory and political economy philosophy from the mercantilists (and even earlier with the scholastics) to today; you cover left-wing, right-wing, and center theorists",
                "Was an amazing course, only critique would be to have the links to the specific readings the prof wants us to do",
                "strengths \r\n- professor is very knowledgeable and answers questions thoroughly \r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- formatting for sections was unproductive \r\n- also disorganized with the course sections at the start of the semester which made it difficult to partake in section",
                "Strengths: Professor Dimand is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, and it shows. He also has amusing slides and jokes, and is generally approachable. The subject material is fascinating, and there are no other classes at Yale that cover it with the depth and care that this class does.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't find the discussion sections productive. The format did not feel like a discussion, as everyone just asked one question and then didn't listen to anyone else. I like the idea of having time to share our own opinions on the texts we read, but I don't know if it was actually necessary. Also, overall feedback on the tests and exams was minimal. It would be nice to have a sentence or two at the end with general comments\/ideas for improvement.",
                "Lectures were very well done - slides had the information you needed on them so you could focus on listing to the professor's commentary instead of trying to catch up on writing down everything the professor said. One thing I didn't like was it was a lot of reading, too much at some points.",
                "This course was pretty good, only weaknesses is I think discussion sections could be better structured to facilitaite conversation amongst students. The current format is students saying something, and then the professor responding. I think if students were encouraged to respond to one another more often (this only happened a handful of times the entire semester), discussions might be more enganging.",
                "Very important and interesting class. First few weeks were repetitive and not the most engaging but got much better.",
                "Strengths - professor knows this topic inside and out. The workload is good and the course covers all the main and most important ideas from economics over the last 300 years. Weaknesses - lectures can be a little dry at times.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material. Lectures are well-structured. Discussion sections are very helpful for clarifying concepts learned in class. I'm glad that discussion sections were added to this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "more organization and details on slides. wish there were summaries of key info since we had so much info and was not sure which is important and which isnt",
                "I truly enjoyed the content of the course and the lectures by Professor Dimand. There are helpful, in-depth explanations of concepts during the lectures and very interesting assigned readings that build upon lectures. Additionally, there were discussion sections that allowed people to voice their opinions and ask questions regarding different course material."

                "Yes, 100%. It might be a toughie for those who aren't history buffs, but if you are an economics major, you should absolutely take this course. It puts into context so many of what we've been learning in other economics courses. If I had not taken this course, I really would be missing out on some key pieces. Context is so important.",
                "Yes, this course is very interesting. It's a great survey course of economic philosophy.",
                "Yes if theyre interested in learning about the development of economic thought",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about economic theory from a historical perspective this is the perfect course. Actually reading primary works of the Economists discussed was very enjoyable as well. The reading is a lot, but I genuinely enjoyed going to lecture each time.",
                "Sure, I think it's an important course, especially for economics majors. I don't think its that much work (1 midterm, 1 final, 1 essay, weekly partipciation in discussion sections). The only times you really have to put in a lot of work for this course are for the exams and the essay (start it early and write more than just the min page requirement). I wrote the essay over the course of a week (with 1-2 all nighters) and ended up doing well. Also learned a lot about the topic that I researched.\r\n\r\nBut yea, would recommend this course, although it can be a bit dry at times if you're not interested in economic history. However, at the same time, it's nice since besides the assignments listed above, this course doesn't require that much effort.",
                "Yes, very important topic, enthusiastic professor (if you talk to him) and not the hardest class.",
                "Yes I would the content was very interesting especially for me an economics major",
                "Yes if they are an econ major as it is important and interesting information for them!",
                "Highly recommend. A great class for students interested in economics, history or philosophy. Prof Dimand knows this course and is more than willing to explain topics in immense depth.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody, but especially for Economics students. I strongly feel that every Economics major should take this class before they graduate. A lot of the ideas that are learned in the core courses, i.e. Intermediate Micro and Macro, have their roots in this class. This course traces the development of economic ideas through time, which helps with putting the ideas in context.",
                "yes if you like history and writing. classes can be boring",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it allowed me to have an understanding of the foundational principles of economics and understand how the classical economists' beliefs affected our current economic models. I now view economic affairs such as globalization, trade, and manufacturing in completely different ways."
