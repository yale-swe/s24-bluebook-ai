                "I learned so much from this course. We covered some of the most fundamental courses in Western intellectual and political history, texts that are so important to read but that I could not have understood on my own. Lectures, class discussions, readings  all were incredible and I learned lessons I will carry with me.",
                "I was exposed to some of the seminal works of political philosophy and political thought of the last several centuries. I gained an appreciation for how the various thinkers' ideas interact, their similarities and differences, and their historical contexts. I also became a much stronger writer.",
                "So much. I was so deeply fulfilled by the fall semester of H&P with Prof. Garsten that I was worried spring would be a letdown. However, it was anything but. While the texts we read and the discussions we had were absolutely rewarding and intellectually challenging, giving me a great framework for understanding modern political thought, and my classmates were brilliant, the greatest strength by far was Prof. Kronman, who is a master of leading discussions and making connections across texts.",
                "2nd semester H&P is one of the best classes I've taken. The curriculum is an excellent survey of political thought from the Renaissance to the modern age, and I feel I've gained such an appreciation for political philosophy. As with all DS courses, the pace is fast and one could always dive more deeply, but I feel the H&P curriculum provides a meaningful point of entry to many different streams of political philosophy. The regular papers challenged me to become a clearer writer, and I feel I've improved at conveying my thoughts over the course of the semester. These texts are ripe for analysis, and I found writing about them an enjoyable way to build my skills.",
                "Directed Studies H/P helped me write clearly and concisely, as well as make, evaluate, and defend philosophical or historical arguments.",
                "I learned to think deeply about the insights of the authors on the syllabus. I developed frameworks for thinking about them individually and in dialogue.",
                "Through this class I was able to draw upon an immense breadth of knowledge and synthesize new and cutting-edge ideas.",
                "So much. Especially: contract theory, Tocqueville's right-on-the-mark understanding of America, what Rousseau thought a good life was, what Hannah Arendt thinks redemption is."

                "Part of me wishes we didn't have to move quite so fast, but I also appreciate the number of texts we were able to cover in just one semester, and there are none that I would want to see dropped from the syllabus. I do wish there were some content warnings when the texts we read included pretty shocking anti-semitism, racism, and sexism, which most of the time went unaddressed. Other than that, no weaknesses! Amazing class!",
                "Professor Kronman is absolutely the greatest strength of this class - he is knowledgable, challenging, and most importantly, tremendously passionate about what he's teaching. He pushed us to take our understanding of the texts further and encouraged everyone to consider multiple perspectives on each of the authors. The greatest weakness of this class is just that it moves so fast and you don't get to spend as much time as you'd like on any of the authors, but that's part of the nature of DS.",
                "Strengths: Second semester H&P is truly phenomenal. It's much more cohesive than first semester -- reading the federalist papers with knowledge of Locke, Rousseau, and Hobbes is such a treat. If you are lucky enough to get Professor Kronman, even better. He knows these texts back to front, and he structures class so well. Class discussions were so engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Kronman, intelligence of classmates, richness of texts, pace\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too little time on Kant and Hegel, our being off-schedule just enough so that most class meetings would include ending one text and beginning another (and almost never discussing the text lectured on in our section later that day)",
                "Second semester H&P has very few weaknesses in my mind (and is a definite improvement over the first semester). The lectures were consistently engaging, and the syllabus is well-designed. As with the previous H&P, it's a bit confusing as to what the papers are meant to be: with literature and philosophy it's pretty clear what type of paper to write, but it's sometimes difficult to know whether to write H&P papers more like a classic argument or like a philosophy paper. DS would benefit from more structured writing guidance as a whole, not just through writing tutors.",
                "This course could not be improved--the readings were fascinating and the sections with Prof. Kronman were incredible. The sections were exciting, and Prof. Kronman gave excellent essay feedback.",
                "The only way to improve this course is to let Kronman give more lectures.",
                "No weaknesses. Other than I wanted to get a hold of the professor more and he was often in a rush somewhere."

The class will make you think in new and more intense ways, and you will leave the class astonished at how much you learned and how much your thinking evolved over the course of the semester. The combination of some really important and thought-provoking texts and a professor who is both incredibly knowledgable and very passionate about what he's teaching is a special one. I am so very glad to have taken this class.",
                "YES. If you do first semester DS, continue it in the spring! H&P makes it worth it. Finding patterns between texts in the first and second semester is so rewarding.",
                "Absolutely. DS is a program of ineffable value.",
                "I would without a doubt recommend this course for anyone interested in the development of political theory. This course is the epitome of what DS has to offer: it's comprehensive and balanced and I found it extremely satisfying to work through these centuries of political thinkers. Second semester H&P is much more philosophically oriented than the first semester, which is something that I enjoyed.",
                "Yes, yes, yes!!!!!",
                "Yes, it's a great way to learn to appreciate the central tensions of western political thought.",
                "This class (with Kronman) is a must-take. It interwove all the texts and ideas we encountered in the first semester of DS into a larger picture of the world, and I can truly say it was the single best learning environment I have ever experienced.",
