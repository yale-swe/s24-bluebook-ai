                "Teacher was fantastic, as engaging as one can be.\r\nA bit too fast-paced for the first semester of a language -- some things can be forgotten pretty easily",
                "This course moves very quickly. In many ways, this was wonderful because I strongly feel that I have learned a lot. However, I feel that the fast pace of the course makes it difficult to retain knowledge.",
                "Strengths: dedicated and interested teacher; fun learning environment \r\nWeaknesses: adherence to the textbook seemed stifling at times; some assignments seemed to be given out as busy work with no real goal; could be more feedback after major assignments as grade seemed a little random on the final presentation",
                "Strengths- covers a lot of material and by the end of it I felt like I could hold a decent conversation in Italian. Weeknesses- sometimes the amount of vocab and grammar we had to learn\/memorize each week was overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: daily learning really helps reinforce concepts, the Italian department does an excellent job of catering events that enable students to build and practice their Italian skills, homework is manageable and the course grading encourages learning. Variety of assignments helps to build Italian skills in a variety of ways.\r\nWeaknesses: the high number of exams in the course places a lot of pressure on the students to learn the material in order to prepare for the test rather than to keep material in their long term memory. Perhaps incorporating more oral presentations or more quizzes and less formal exams would help promote comprehension."

                "Definitely, didn't expect much going in -- now definitely interested in continuing Italian",
                "Yes, I would. If you want to see tangible growth in your language skills and you have a passion for Italian, you should definitely take this course. Be prepared to take a test every two weeks, and make sure to come to class prepared.",
                "I have now taken two languages at Yale: Spanish and Italian. Overall, I enjoyed Italian more, although this is only my first class in Italian so its difficult to truly say. I think Spanish is taken by so many people that professors lose interest in the subject itself at a lower level because its a requirement-I didnt feel that in this class, and I think in general the professors are more engaged with the class. That being said, language courses in general are a lot of work, and I felt that with this class. If youre not sure what language, I think Italian is a good place to start.",
                "Yes I would, but you have to be genuinely interested in learning Italian and put in the effort.",
                "Yes! Especially if you're familiar with another Romance language, this is a great language to take with phenomenal faculty who are there to support you."
