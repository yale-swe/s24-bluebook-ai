    "The content was certainly a strength, but there could have been more focus on correcting mistakes during classes",

    "I think this is Theresa's most interesting class because she has so many personal perspectives on the topic. Theresa's classes are always great. Would be nice if the class were a little smaller, so I should probably stop writing positive reviews, but she's great, take this course.",
    "Yes - it's an interesting course that improves knowledge of the German language and an important part of German culture",
    "Yes, the topic is interesting.",
    "Yes. The class is very good as a language class but the topic of East Germany is also fascinating.",
    "Yes it was great",
    "Yes, if you want to improve your German and enjoy history.",
