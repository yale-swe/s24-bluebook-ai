                "This course is a good course to take between high school and college level Latin. However, it requires a very good understanding of Latin Grammar. The course also requires a good grasp on vocabulary, which means learning different methods on translating that would help with the memorization of vocabulary that may be rare or unique to the author.",
                "Better grammar, quicker and more accurate at reading Latin, learning the different nuances in the Latin words.",
                "I think I have better translation skills",
                "The amount of time I spent on each assignment drastically decreased as I increased both efficiency and ability to simply read Latin.",
                "Learned the distinctive styles and perspectives of three Roman authors (Virgil, Livy, Ovid) and the different visions of Romes founding. Of course, translated a lot of Latin, but also learned how to produce translations that are more elegant to an English-speaking audience.",
                "I learned how to translate more efficiently.",
                "I learned a lot about critical thinking of big thematic topics connecting multiple pieces of literature, and how those themes reflect on the time period of the authors themselves. I enjoyed discussion of these big themes and how they are relevant to each small piece of writing we read."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the course presents a well-proportioned amount of material per class. The format is very standard for a Latin class, mostly centering on going over translation and discussing literary elements as they come up in the reading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class format can sometimes get tedious, as each day is essentially the same. For greater comprehension, perhaps more discussion days should be included in the course.",
                "The biggest weakness was the pop quizzes. They only added more stress to the course as they were random and initially, could cover any of the material of the semester despite students not going over it in class. They also required a memorization of the vocabulary. I think it would be better to announce them in the future instead of having them be a surprise to students. \r\n\r\nThe strengths were probably the text selections and variety of authors. It was fun seeing how the authors connection to the Rome of their time affected their portrayal of its founding. I do wish more time had been spent on this part as opposed to going over translations.",
                "Strengths: positively excellent teacher\r\nWeaknesses: assessments caused a lot of anxiety due to their randomness",
                "I think the way class is structured (straight translation for 75 min) could be improved to increase engagement. Information about assignments, exams, etc could also be communicated more clearly. Also, it sometimes felt as if opinions that differed from the status quo were frowned upon and that one interpretation was expected and even forced at times upon us (as opposed to letting us come to our own conclusions)",
                "The course did a great job of incorporating multiple authors into a cohesive curriculum. The passages selected were enjoyable to read and worthwhile to compare.",
                "This course focused on translations, which helped bolster ones Latin translating skills. While there were moments when the class touched on interpretation, it would be interesting and helpful to further discuss the interpretative elements of the texts.",
                "Strengths: Professor is very knowledgeable and I learned a lot from his comments, a perfect amount of reading every week, interesting material \r\nWeaknesses: classes are usually structured the same way, so it can feel repetitive towards the end. Many of the discussions felt one-sided, where students were asking the professor questions rather than responding to each other.",
                "The beginning of this course was unnecessarily stressful because of the pop quizzes, but the second half was much more enjoyable. I think that the class could have benefitted from having more materials available online, such as handouts and grades. Also, since Solodow is sometimes picky about how people translate things and takes issue with other existing translations, it would have been nice to have an official, Solodow-approved translation that we could use to review for the exams in case we missed something in class."

                "I would, but only if they were truly well versed in Latin grammar and ready for a heavy workload.",
                "Absolutely, because Professor Solodow was a wonderful teacher who improved my Latin skills more in one semester than in 5 years of prior Latin.",
                "It depends on what other students are looking to get out of the class. It was a lot of work, and I think if the classmate is only looking to fulfill a language requirement this is not the class for them.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a Latin course that introduces you to college Latin and gives you a good grounding in three canonical authors. If you are already confident in your Latin, I might recommend a more literature-intensive class, but this still would be a good introduction for you.",
