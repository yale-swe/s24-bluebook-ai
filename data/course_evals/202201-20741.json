                "I learned a lot about linguistics and gender\/ sexuality studies. It was a super great intro to both courses and to college level courses in general. Professor Weber was really good at teaching us about how to read academic articles, interpret statistics, and generate research type writing.",

                "This is a course with very introductory material. If you're a first year who hasn't taken any linguistics or gender studies classes, you might learn some cool things in this class. Most of all, you'll meet good people and have good conversations, and it'll be a low pressure environment. However, most of the things we learned were at quite a low level, even for people who have not yet been introduced to these topics. We learned a bit of linguistics, but not enough psychology for the class to be listed as a 300-level psychology course.",
                "I learned about theories relating to feminism and gender, as well as studies about different ways that language and gender intersect. The whole course is based on the idea that language both reflects and perpetuates gender norms.",
                "I learned a lot about linguistics and how gender is indexed by language.",
                "Introductions to linguistics and to gender studies; intersectionality; linguistic indexicality\/speech acts, human vs grammatical gender, gender and sex as spectrums vs binaries, \"does (linguistic) gaydar exist?\", gendered metaphors\/insults, trans speech",
                "I learned about the connection between language and gender, and how relevant this intersection is in the real world.",
                "I learned more about linguistics and learned more about gender studies, as well as points of their intersection.",
                "By taking this course, I gained a basic foundation of linguistic concepts through a gender perspective. The lectures built on my understanding of sex and gender from previous courses.",
                "I learned about linguistics, gender, and the interaction between the two.",
                "Though I knew this was an introductory linguistics course, I was still surprised by how baseline all the information was. Though I appreciated that Prof Weber didn't take any background information for granted, it was very difficult to engage with this course because none of the material felt new or challenging.",

I am leaving this course with a greater awareness of how gender dynamics and constructs play into everyday life, specifically through language.",

            "comments": [
                "This course advertises itself as an introduction to both gender studies and linguistics. Sadly, in casting that broad net, it fails at both. A future iteration of this class would function better as an upper-level linguistics seminar through the lens of gender studies, in a framework that assumes that the person taking the class has operational knowledge for both subjects. However, I think that Professor Weber does make a real effort to try and make the class engaging, but the survey level is not compelling or sufficient in creating a solid knowledge base for either subject. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the written assignments (such as the biographical report, language and media, etc.) were borderline insulting in their simplicity. While I think this may have been an attempt at creating a light workload, they felt like busy work, and I found I did not learn much from them at all. A future iteration of this class should do away with them entirely; at least the quizzes made you accountable to doing the readings.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Weber. They're really really an amazing professor, highly recommend taking this course with them.\r\n\r\nAlso, you get time to review for the midterm in class and are allowed to bring a sheet of notes to all exams.",
                "Strengths: The class was very fun; I didn't know it was geared towards first-years, but even as a senior, I had a great time learning about this field, especially because I am NOT a linguistics expert at all. It was fun to learn about language and gender in this interdisciplinary way. Professor Weber was also a really knowledgeable professor, and I liked that they allowed us to discuss certain topics in smaller groups. It was nice to get my peers' perspectives on some of the topics, especially those that I struggled with a bit. \r\nWeaknesses: Professor Weber is great at explaining smaller concepts, but I had a hard time putting all of the information together to create a larger narrative. This made the midterm really hard for me and others in my class, as I felt a bit untethered. I also felt like we didn't get enough of a linguistics primer at the beginning of the course, so certain linguistics concepts were confusing to me, and I could never figure out how to integrate these basic linguistics concepts with the rest of the course. I just wish we had had more chances to zoom out during lecture, because by the end of the semester, I was feeling really lost about how everything connected.",
                "strengths: interesting content\r\nweaknesses: taught unclearly, graded too harshly, not much guidance",
                "Very well organized, clear topics and ideas, felt like I had plenty of major takeaways at the end of it, and very applicable to every day life. I notice a lot of the stuff I learned in this class in my daily life now. Not too challenging or too much work, it felt very manageable while still being informative and instructive.",
                "This course is a survey of both linguistics and gender studies, and feels like a very superficial glance at both fields. I am not sure if a course like this can exist at the introductory level without feeling repetitive and, despite the professors efforts, still discrete and not quite interdisciplinary.\r\n\r\nHomework assignments and reports felt like busy work and assumed that we were more like middle-schoolers than college students. There is no reason why I, as a sophomore in college, should be writing a 1-2 page biographical report on someone.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Weber is nice and is good at encouraging dialogue from students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Material is far too simple, even for an introductory class. I think the course needs to nail down what it wants to discuss and dive in a little deeper to get the insights across. While at times the class would present more difficult material, it never felt necessary or important to engage with that material on a deeper level. Finding a way to make the content more meaningful so that the class feels rewarding to take will require more concrete readings and a stricter syllabus, in my opinion.",
                "The strengths of this course are types and balance of the assignments (it alternates between a quiz and a short written assignment every week), as well as a very reasonable workload. The readings from the textbook are written in a very accessible way, and most of the studies we read were very interesting and relatively easy to understand after going over them in class.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is how different assignments are weighted. The midterm and final combined were worth 50% of our grade, despite getting little to no guidance on how to prepare for the midterm specifically. I would rather have had more assignments throughout the semester that were not graded only on completion, and have the exams be weighted a bit less.",
                "I liked the group discussions in the class and the professor was very engaging. I would have appreciated more specifics on the major exams in the class.",
                "The course was great!! Really appreciate how accessible\/approachable Natalie is as an instructor, and the interactive\/inquisitive\/low-stakes environment they created in class, especially as an intro gender and sexuality studies course.",
                "Very low engagement, disorganized prof, and unclear instructions",
                "I liked the format of incorporating discussion into class in the middle of lecture.",
                "I appreciated the breadth of topics we covered and learned a lot about linguistics, but feel like a lot of the study of the intersection of WGSS and LING was very nascent\/not very established in the field, so a lot of our learning felt like learning about hypotheses.",
                "I enjoy how the class gave us the opportunity to explore our own interests through the smaller assignments, such as the rabbit hole assignment and the linguistic reports.",
                "Strengths: It is a fairly low-demanding class. The readings are not very hard and most assignments are very low stakes. Many topics are exciting. There are a lot of group discussions, and I found many ideas from my peers very intriguing. Weaknesses: Some of the materials are very straightforward, so I think they are not new for most students. Natalie is frequently late to class and sometimes does not start until 10 minutes after the scheduled time. The structure could have been made more clear; for example, the format of the final was not given until the final exam period.",
                "I think Prof Weber does do a good job of trying o make the course accessible and accommodating, which not enough professors do. The assignments were straightforward and easy. There is no discussion section and attendance was not required in lecture. However, this meant that overall engagement was low. Students were rarely in case and I did not feel particularly stimulated by the material.",
                "I really think this course would work much better as a seminar. The topics had the potential to be so interesting, but learning about complex gender dynamics from mediocre PowerPoints just didn't work for me.  I think we should have read Language and Women's Place given how much we talked about it, and I really think we should have had more involved papers rather than exams. I would have felt more intellectually challenged and fulfilled in those scenarios.",
                "Strengths: In-person collaborations and discussion time between students really helps see different perspectives and opinions on the topic and breaks up the lecture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough depth into certain areas and too much into others. I felt like at some points the class was entirely gender and I would have liked to see more discussions on linguistics alone instead of only in gender context, because it felt very gender-heavy and not very linguistics-heavy",
                "This course had some interesting readings and materials covered in lecture, but it wasn't that engaging. I think lectures were too long, and some of the group discussions dragged on and seemed irrelevant. I wish we had shorter lectures or more interesting group discussions. Because the class was available on Zoom, most kids didn't show up in person which also hurt engagement.",
                "strengths: accessible TFs, accessible course, accessible professor\r\n\r\nweaknesses: it was difficult to follow along at times, and understand the 'narrative' or broader topic\/theme of individuals lessons. I also feel like new linguistic terms were snuck into lessons without sufficient explanation or definition of them beforehand, so that was confusing.",
                "I think that this course covers extremely relevant and fascinating subject matter. The textbook is a wonderful and easily digestible resource. However, I do think that this course would be better in a seminar format rather than a lecture as I think this subject requires a lot of discussion (and the small discussion groups were indeed the most rewarding part of lecture). Or at least, I think this course needs a discussion section.",
                "I think this is a super well-organized course that encourages a reasonable level of participation.",
                "This course is well designed, but it spends a lot of time explaining that structure which seems unnecessary. It has a lot of interesting material butressed by fairly weak explanation of that content. Neither intro ling topics nor intro women's\/sex\/gender topics were explained as thoroughly and correctly as compared to intro courses in either. This course would benefit from more time\/research put into the class sessions beforehand. It also started consistently late. That being said it was okay and the professor was clearly trying.",
                "strengths ... prof was approachable \r\nweaknesses ... its called language and gender but it really felt like some classes were about language, and others were about gender. it was super disjointed and didn't feel like there was any through line. exams were graded harshly\/hard for an otherwise painfully easy class. if this class is taught again there needs to be a much clearer connection and analysis of how langugae effects gender, and gender language. this started to come at the end of the semester, and this improved the class, but hte beginning of the semester was really disjointed."

                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about linguistics, gender studies, or psych. The readings were interesting and of reasonable length, the assignments felt meaningful (not just busy work), and the teaching team was super accessible and helpful.",
                "I would! Even if you're not a first-year or linguistics major, the course is great and everyone can get something out of it, no matter your major.",
                "not unless it is necessary for a requirement",
                "yes, it's a very interesting class that teaches you a lot of useful and applicable information.",
                "yes. esp with prof. weber",
                "Honestly, no. I was looking to take this course as a gut and it taught surprisingly little but expected a lot of us from exams. The grading felt disproportionate to the rigor of the content learned in class.",
                "No. It simply was too ... simple ... to recommend to anyone. If you want to take a course that is super easy and requires little outside work, then I suppose you could take it (if you want a class that you don't have to engage with). Otherwise, the only people I'd recommend take this course are first years who want to have some conversations about gender with classmates at a surface level. We don't dig deep enough to come out of class saying \"I was intellectually challenged!\" If you're looking for that, skip this class and take a WGSS class--they are much more difficult, but they will inspire the type of learning you are probably looking for if you landed on this class. The class, unfortunately, felt unnecessary, especially for anyone who wasn't a first year. If you've done absolutely any level of psychology, WGSS, or linguistics, do not take this class-- I guarantee you will be disappointed with what is taught.",
                "Yes I would, especially to people who are looking to explore concepts relating to linguistics or psychology without necessarily majoring in it. Just be warned that if you are looking for a course to take to see whether you would be interested in linguistics in general, this may not be the main optionthe assignments are more similar to what you would get in a psychology class (research report, create your own study), rather than actual psets. That being said, the course is really eye-opening when it comes to certain everyday phenomena I assumed were true, but aren't actually (like that men interrupt more than women).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a pretty good beginner course for linguistics and gender.",
                "Yes, definitely!! Even (and especially if) you've never taken a language or gender studies course before. IMO i think every student should be familiar with the contents of this course.",
                "Please do not take this class. Find something better.",
                "I would! It's an interesting class and it covers important topics.",
                "Yes, I think it's a good introduction to both linguistics and gender studies.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they're interested in linguistics! It was very beginner friendly and the instructors were very welcoming.",
                "It's a reasonably easy class, and you would get something out of it, but it's not as exciting as I imagined it would be.",
                "I don't think I would. I think that most people at Yale have already learned most of this information and there are other courses that engage more critically with the topics of language and gender, though I have generally not had a good experience in the linguistics department. My suggestion is PHIL or WGSS.",
                "Unfortunately I would not. I wanted so badly to love this class, and there were a few topics that were very interesting, but everything felt very surface level in a way that other introductory courses aimed at first years did not. If you haven't spent any time thinking about gender dynamics, I think this class could blow your mind, but if you think about gender a lot, it's not worth your time.",
                "I would recommend it if you're interested in either of these topics and want a very general introduction, but not if you're looking at something to go deep into one area or another. I understand that this was an intro class, but a lot of the information felt very surface level and I don't feel that I've ultimately come away with much more knowledge on either linguistics or gender.",
                "If you are interested in linguistics, sure. There's a fair amount of technical linguistic knowledge to be gained from the course. If you're more interested in the WGSS side of things, probably not. The gender aspect of the course is information you will have likely already encountered, especially if you identify as a queer person.",
                "I would if you're going to be engaged, but it can very easily become a class you don't show up for and only do assignments in. I think other intro WGSS classes are probably more engaging.",

                "I'm not sure I would recommend this course to another student because while the subject matter was really interesting, I don't think the format and organization of this course did it justice.
