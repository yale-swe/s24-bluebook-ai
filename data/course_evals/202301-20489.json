The course goes into great detail from writing formal letters for an internship, to creating your own poetry and multimodal projects. You become exposed to a variety of famous authors in the Spanish language and even learn the History of many Latin American countries.",

                "Strengths: It feels manageable and gives you a chance to improve your spanish both through speaking and writing. I really like the requirement of peer edits on most assignments because you get the chance to meet someone new (plus she gives you time to do this in class too).\r\nWeakness: Some of the projects were very demanding for the point ratio, this was definitely something I believe should have been more chill in my opinion.",
                "The organization/structure of the canvas course could be better and less confusing because sometimes there were so many things on the modules that you were not sure what and when to watch.",
                "I think the course is super engaging and I love the wide range of assignments. The only thing Id say is itd be nice if we could get our assignments returned to us with comments a bit quicker, I felt like I was waiting for them for a while and didnt have a good sense of what I needed to work on in the next ones.",
                "Could be more organized with clear details on the expectations.",
                "A lot of writing which definitely improved my grammar, but not much speaking.",
                "Loved the range of writing we learned and the types of projects we didespecially the level of creativity we got to have. Profa. Tortora was awesome.",
                "The strengths of the course is that its well organized but the syllabus is flexible in a good way. Grading feels lenient and Professor Tortora deeply cares about each individual student, reading and commenting on weekly, required journals. The course serves its purpose really well in terms of learning the different ways to write in Spanish. The texts and media studied are a good balance of historical documents, literature, and film. The only weakness Id say is that sometimes group activities dont work efficiently, but this is largely down to students in the class. Furthermore, the class is what you make of it, and if you dont apply yourself, you can continue in the class with good grades and not necessarily improve your Spanish.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tortora's willingness to help and offer advice, the variety of writing assignments, large amount of thorough feedback, multiple forms of sources that keep things interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I found that the syllabus didn't match what we did in class, but for the most part, Canvas and what Professor Tortora tells us in class covers everything"

The workload is a bit high and the professor does expect you to dedicate a good amount of time to her class, but she is flexible with scheduling if you talk to her. Sometimes there's too much going on at once, but as long as you stay on top of it and keep track of assignments it is manageable.",
                "Yes! Its a great and interesting course.",

                "Overall yes I would. The professor is amazing and so kind and caring. Truly an amazing professor. The course will definitely improve your writing, but wont help as much with speaking.",
                "100%!! I absolutely loved this course. Profa. Tortora is incredible. I learned a lot and really improved my writing. I also learned so much from my peers! Really glad we got to work together often.",
                "I would recommend this course as an essential introductory course if youre pursuing the Spanish certificate. The workload is very manageable, and you learn a lot about the Spanish speaking world.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is a well-structured Spanish course that has many opportunities to practice and improve your writing and speaking skills. The work is well-balanced throughout the semester and the feedback you receive is useful, so you actually know how you can improve. Classes were always pretty interesting and the variety of assignments ensure that you have a variety of situations to practice and learn different skills."
