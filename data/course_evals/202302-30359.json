They were wholeheartedly committed to the course and to their fellow students. Every student was here because they wanted to be here. I loved every day with them. The work that was produced by the students in this class was especially meaningful to me. Totally in awe of the worlds they created through their stories. I also appreciated that although I came as a novice writer, the other students were welcoming of my work, were straightforward in the workshops, and showed me solid paths to improving my fiction writing. It's sad that we are only together for such a short time. Professor Sexton is one of the most incredible instructors I've ever had. The curriculum is amazing and I feel like it has truly changed my life. Every part of this course will be with me forever.",
                "Although this is no fault of Professor Sexton's, at times we had so many interesting things to talk about and our seminar was only so long! Otherwise, the course is very well structured for student engagement with high levels of feedback for improvement on writing and plenty of time for group discussions. This course both pushed me to become a better writer and maintained a positive and encouraging writing atmosphere.",
                "The only detriment of this class is the amount of material: although I'm not sure a better alternative would be having less material available. The course is so discussion heavy that we did not get to it although I also understand that this is typically a semester-long course.",
                "This is mostly due to personal preference, but I would have liked to see more variety of genre for the stories we read - for example fantasy, or romance - to see the same fundamental ideas applied to these different contexts."

                "Yes. It is an eye opening class. It is the best environment to explore fiction writing at any level. I came as a beginner (and left as a more informed one), but there were insanely skilled writers all around me that were much more experienced than myself. Even the other \"beginners\" were insanely talented. Despite the differences, every student was genuinely encouraging and welcoming of one another and put in significant time in workshopping each other's work. I am also grateful that this course was ran in the summer as I feel it enabled me to commit a lot more time than outside of class to the course than I would have taking four other classes.",

                "I came here to learn what it meant to read fiction through the lens of a writer. I left an improved fiction writer with an imagination that feels like it's on fire now. I just want to write and write and write. Even though I came here as a beginner, I feel like I am leaving here as a much more informed (beginner) writer. I found that at the very beginning with the first prompt I wrote like I thought a writer was supposed to write. I had no idea what I was doing and was not true to my own style at all. Then I quickly threw everything away and tried to commit to what I learned in the \"Masterclass in Fiction Writing\" book. I decided to write purely in my own voice, just as I sound in my own head, without trying to find fancy words and replace everything. I feel like my writing became much more intuitive and believable because of that. I found my own style and voice, which is minimalist (and I learned there is nothing wrong with that style!). Then my writing somehow became meaningful (to me, sorry I had to subject others to it, and everyone was very welcoming). The writing prompts became like a therapy session, and I slowly created an entire world around my childhood memories. These short narratives that were coaxed out of us through this incredible curriculum were deeply personal and meaningful to me and have changed my life\/ will stay with me forever. I will also try to continue developing the worlds I created here. Even if nothing else comes out of my writing, capturing snapshots of these worlds on paper has had such a significant impact on my own well being. I am forever grateful for this course. Also, I cannot wait to see what the other students do. Their writings were incredible. Joe needs to write several books because the world needs his prose. Rowan needs to publish his book because the world needs to learn about the Illustrious. Maia, Stella, and Mitchell need to submit their final stories to the New Yorker immediately, really. Somebody must contact them and get their stories published. If the New Yorker turns them down, then I'll never read another New Yorker article again.  This was just a life changing course. Thanks for a wonderful summer.",
                "I will write clearer and more precise stories (aka \"machines for reading\").",
                "I will use this class to write fiction and think of its discussion points as I read. I do both of these things seriously.",
                "Its already helped me improve the writing I do in my own time, which is helpful if I ever decide to attempt to sell a book, and which improves my quality of life."
