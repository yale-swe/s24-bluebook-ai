I wish there were more time to hear Professor Zedillo talk from his experience or open the floor to questions.",
                "The course provides a good broad overview of the major economic trends in Latin America in the past century. It also enables you to delve deeply into one economic topic or country in the region. The course is strengthened by Prof. Zedillo's unique vision, and the best parts of the lecture are when the Professor provides his specific insight onto topics that overlap with his work experience and history as President. \r\n\r\nWith that said, class engagement was overall poor, which I believe is a direct result of the environment created by the lecturer. Rather than asking the classroom questions and letting students discuss amongst themselves/share their own views, the interaction is very one-directional despite this being a seminar course. It was disappointing to spend so much of class time reviewing the readings through the student presentations, rather than delving into the material more deeply. The schedule for student presentations was also poorly managedsome students had to present twice and some only once, with no prior warning that this would be the case. It would have also been nice to receive more clear instructions about the final papers expectations further in advance. \r\n\r\nContent-wise, I believe the course is most enjoyable when the incoming student already has a good working knowledge of Latin American economic history and is looking to refresh or deepen that knowledge. I wish we had spent more time discussing some of the crises in the 1990s and early 2000s, which we somewhat glossed over. \r\n\r\nI also wish I would have received specific feedback on my midterm exam, as I have no idea what I could have improved on or whether I was factually incorrect or not.",
                "it was a really interesting class and i learned a lot, but the learning curve in the beginning was very high i had to teach myself a lot of stuff about foreign exchange rates. the whole first half of the class is mostly about foreign exchange rates. it would have been helpful to have some of those basics explained more in class.",

His knowledge of globalization and Latin American economics is so deep, much of it coming from his experience being the president of Mexico right after NAFTA was signed and implemented.",
