There are other great classes such as logic stats or Econ that can be used to satisfy the distribution requirements that will actually be helpful to you later. This is a dead-end class.

    "I thought the flipped classroom idea worked very well for the course, but I think having a video due every night before class is excessive. I believe there should be one per week due on Mondays so that students can get an idea of what they will be doing, without having too much extra work on top of problem sets.",
    "The flipped classroom does not work at all and is unhelpful to understanding the material.",
    "The flipped classroom sucks",
    "I didnt think the prep videos did a very good job explaining the overarching lesson, it delved too much into one specific example problem that wasnt necessarily applicable to the problems that followed in the prep quiz.",
    "Course is fairly slow that allow beginners to catch up.",
    "Flipped classroom learning... did not personally work for me. \r\n\r\nThe way the different sections with different teachers are taught should be more standardized across the board. Some teachers gave their students VERY helpful summary sheets regarding the concepts, whereas my professor did not, which did not help me at all.",
    "Strengths: a lot of resources if u need help \r\n\r\nWeakness: like most introductory math courses it was very boring.",
    "The flipped classroom model was not effective for this material.",
    "The flipped course is horrible. It forces you to learn all the material on your own. The videos and prep problems are not sufficient.",
    "The videos were awful and unhelpful. They need to be updated and walk through different types of examples. Also, more grace on prep problems-i.e., you must do them before class, but another attempt may be taken after class, once the math has been explained better. \r\n\r\nA lot of us had to use old high school notes and borrow high school BC Calc notes from friends.",
    "The course is strong in its teaching of the material, through lectures, videos, and problems. However, I personally do not like the flipped classroom method, and would prefer a lecture of the material first, and then reinforcement videos that apply more to the practice problems.",
    "problems different than presented",
    "Flipped classroom definitely has problems.  There was a large discrepancy between online practice problems, textbook problems, and test problems. My section teacher was friendly and eager to help, but not great at teaching."

    "Yes, the instructors are very patient.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. The way this curriculum is designed is rather hard to follow, especially for someone who has never taken BC Calc before coming to college.",
    "Only if it is a pre-req",
    "Absolutely not.",
    "Absolutely not. DO NOT take this course unless you absolutely have to.",
    "No; only take it if you need it specifically. There are other great classes such as logic stats or Econ that can be used to satisfy the distribution requirements that will actually be helpful to you later. This is a dead-end class. I took AP ab in high school and wanted to continue Calc in college for the sake of learning and this was a truly terrible experience. We didn't do anything wherein this could be applied to our actual lives. We didn't do interesting problems that made you think and become better at math, work to be proud of even in the abstract. It was just wrote memorization and copying; few students ever cared to learn why the math works and actually think, and if you wanted to do those things it was enourmoysly difficult with the way the class is set up. \r\nMy individual teacher, a grad student, got much better as we went along and started bringing in objectives sheets with a summary of the days material, which made it better to learn, especially since the videos were aweful and he basically had to teach us from scratch. \r\n\r\nWith all the opportunities yale has, don't waste your time, money, or a class slot on this class unless it is a requirement. If you need to make it to Math 120 or Enas 151, take the class somewhere else or self study in the summer, because you will be incredibly poorly prepared to take those classes.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Though the flipped classroom teaching is difficult, it is a good course for understanding the fundamentals of calculus.",
    "Mostly as a prereq, since it isn't very interesting on its own."
