    "Survey course with wide range of topics and lecturers.",

    "gave good insight into the research opportunities available for cognitive science students",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of current topics in cognitive science, which makes a sort of disjointed major feel more unified. It gave me great practice digesting and asking questions about academic papers.",
    "I developed more focused information and strategies for tackling my senior thesis as well as gaining information in a wide variety of research areas across cognitive science.",
    "I was exposed to many specific projects within cognitive science and various areas of research in the field. It was really helpful to hear from faculty at Yale.",
    "I learned about various fields in Cognitive Science, from hearing professors in different disciplines (e.g. psychology, anthropology, computer science) come in and give presentations about their field of interest.",
    "This course was great for getting a better understanding of the diversity of cognitive science-related topics being researched by Yale professors. The weekly assignments also helped to develop critical reading skills and my ability to analyze scientific papers.",
    "Heard some lectures",
    "Learned about the senior thesis writing process and various scattered topics in cognitive science introduced by professors in the different fields; developed skills relating to forming research questions and interacting with professors"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The daily responses were quick and easy, and the lectures were always interesting.",
    "Strengths: amount of work corresponds to a 1\/2-credit course\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes no one is interested in the topic of the week\r\nImprovements: build a stretch-break into the class",
    "I love the guest lecture format.",
    "I loved the format where we heard from different professors each week but I think it didnt need to be such a long class length.",
    "This course would ideally take place in the fall of the junior year.",
    "A strength was hearing professors from different disciplines speak, and thus gaining a baseline level of knowledge across various topics. A weakness was that having gone into this class knowing my particular area of focus within Cognitive Science, some of the lectures that were very unrelated to my area of interested (e.g. philosophy, anthropology) seemed a bit irrelevant and boring.",
    "The course should have been a Fall semester course; by the time the end of the semester rolled around, it was too late to start working in some of the labs that we were hearing about. Moving the course earlier would only help to improve the entire purpose and goal of the class: helping us find a research spot for our thesis.\r\n\r\nIt was also a surprisingly high amount of work for a half-credit course, given it met for a full seminar time slot every week, and had two weekly assignments and an (albeit short) final assignment.",
    "The lectures are very disjoint, but some are good. the main thing this class could use id more stuff to help you prepare for your thesis directly, since that's the point anyway (e.g. like more in-depth versions of the three senior thing). Also make it later in the day. half the class was always asleep.",
    "it was very well organized to give junior cogsci majors guidance. while the double weekly responses were annoying, they did help me get more out of the class by keeping me engaged and making sure I was thinking critically and asking deep questions about the material"

   "comments": [
    "It's required lol",
    "For cog sci majors, yes!",

    "If you are a cognitive science major, it is required. You will enjoy it and it will actually help you with your senior thesis project.",
    "Not super relevant because everyone who takes this class has to, but it's painless!",
    "We have to take it! But yes, I would. Many of the guest lectures were absolutely fascinating, and it is rare to find the opportunity to hear from so many great professors and get credit for it.",
    "Irrelevant. The major's good though so don't let this scare you off. Besides it's kind of cool to hear random cogsci stuff, some of which is super intersting.",
    "Well, it's mandatory for cogsci majors, but yes :)"
