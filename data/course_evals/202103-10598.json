                "I learned a widely-applicable framework for formally and thoroughly analyzing how music shapes time and vice versa.",
                "Through this course, I was able to learn about all the parts of music that music theory typically glosses over. We dove into meter and rhythm, and looked at scenarios where our traditional definitions of meter do not apply. We also learned about musical perception and how the body responds to music, which was another interesting insight I had not previously considered.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Freedom to analyze pieces you are passionate about and receive genuine feedback on your work. The balance between choosing your own pieces and being introduced to new things by prof. Cohn is just about perfect. Aditya is a fantastic TA. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not even a weakness, but I think this class deserves a follow-up course about non-metrical and quasi-metrical pieces. We lingered on simpler concepts towards the beginning and middle of the course, so when pieces with abnormal musical time were introduced with little opportunity for analysis at the very end of the course I was left wanting more!",
                "This was a fantastic course with no weakness.",
                "The curriculum was quite expansive and answered many questions I'd previously had concerning meter and then some. However, I feel as though the first unit (representing meter and pulses) was perhaps slightly too long, and the last few units perhaps slightly rushed. In addition, although the course wasn't a composition class, it would've been interesting to push the analysis of certain rhythmic concepts a little further into their application, instead of simply pointing at features without understanding how to use them.",
                "Strengths include the detailed manner in which the model of musical time is built up, the repeated opportunities to apply the material to one's own preferred genre of music, and the group presentation format which allows one to learn from the ideas of others. The only weakness was that the schedule was a bit too uncertain, with the nature and due dates of assignments often fluctuating.",
                "This course was very interactive, so we were able to participate in class to best entrain the meter of the pieces the professor presented. I really enjoyed that we were often asked to clap along to the music, write out what we entrain, and participate in the class lectures. There were a lot of opportunities for exploration of our own music, and it was quite refreshing to be able to choose any piece of our liking (not just classical music as is often the case in other music theory courses). I really enjoyed learning about the different types of music everyone in the class listened to and enjoyed, and it was especially intriguing to see everyone apply the same musical concept to such varying pieces and songs. The only weakness of this course is that towards the end, it became slightly monotonous, so I would have appreciated even more opportunities for engagement in the later lectures, as it became slightly more dull to sit and listen to pieces for the entire class period.",
                "Strengths: really interesting subject, professor exudes enthusiasm, fairly good workload, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: spent too much time focusing on basic concepts\/definitions, low class enthusiasm\r\n\r\nI think the best way to improve this course would be to spend less time early in the curriculum and in the middle and more time later on. I thought the subject matter was really interesting, but we spent a lot of time in the middle of the semester focusing on metric relations, etc. and I think we could have spent more time on the interesting parts at the end. I also felt like the class itself wasn't very enthusiastic during class time, people were mostly timid answering questions, etc. I don't know exactly what it was about the course that made it this way - maybe something about the room was a little imposing or intimidating for people.",
                "strengths: breaks down your knowledge and builds it back up again. \r\nweaknesses: if you're scared of presenting in front of people, this seminar might be a little tough.",
                "Strengths: You can take this course even if you haven't taken a music theory class before. The professor actively tries to not use conventional music theory terms to describe things, so it isn't a big disadvantage at all. Weaknesses: The last couple weeks of the course did become a little hard for me to follow."

                "Ever listen to a song you like and wonder what is going on rhythmically? In this course you can explore those questions under the guidance of a fantastic professor AND be introduced to music your peers are passionate about. This course is friendly to non music majors and your grade will reflect the effort and passion in your work. I would highly recommend anything taught by Professor Cohn!",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Certainly, I believe it fulfills a niche that no other class covers. The class can be used as a prerequisite for more advanced music theory courses, and the teaching style and topics are quite refreshing for someone interested in studying music theory. However, almost no prior knowledge in the field was required, which makes it an excellent choice for those new to music theory.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you have an interest in really understanding the machinery beneath the music we hear. In addition, it's a great way to explore many different kinds of music and the associated meters (or lack thereof). For a STEM major like me, it was also more satisfying than many humanities\/arts classes in that there is a precise quantitative underpinning to the material, so it rests on firm theoretical ground.",
                "I would recommend this course to any musician wishing to take a slightly unconventional approach to music theory. This is a refreshing break from traditional music theory, so I would definitely suggest you take it if you would like to gain new perspectives into the music you listen to and learn new ways to analyze it.",
                "I think I would recommend for people who are really interested in the subject. I also think the course is designed more for people who don't know much about music theory already, so I'd say that if you wanted to dig deeper then perhaps take one of Professor Cohn's other higher-level courses on rhythm.",
                "yes! especially to those who are interested in meter and rhythm. this class offers a different approach to the way we explore it.",
                "Yes! It was a great fun class to take to balance out my STEM-heavy semester. It was so cool learning about how we perceive music, and all the different factors that influence our perception."
