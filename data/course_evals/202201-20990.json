                "Strengths: wonderful opportunity to perform important works, underrated pro is you get really close with your group, great chance to work on musicianship \r\nCons: not really any..it is definitely a lot of work for .5 credit but Overall its a wonderful opportunity",
                "I learned so much.",
                "Our group had many setbacks related to illness and covid, but in the end we were able to pull together our piece. Perhaps access to technology (microphones) usable for online coachings could be helpful!",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this course is the relationships you build with people. The amount of rehearsal time spent together brings groups really close together and builds the trust necessary for the making music at a high level. The coaching and mentorship from other musicians is also incredible. I have never had a negative experience in a studio class or coaching. The community is incredibly supportive. I think this course could be improved by increasing the amount of performance opportunities.",
                "The strengths are of course the strength of the students and teachers, the friendly and supportive community, and the opportunity to play chamber music. The only weakness I can think of is that the repertoire selection is sometimes very limited. I understand that the priority is to teach students, and the standard rep might be the best option for this, but some more breadth for more established or experienced groups might be really great.",
                "strengths: good presentation\r\nweaknesses: random groups not always conducive to collaborative relationships",
                "I think the weekly coachings are super helpful and the biggest strength of the course. The only thing I would suggest is sometimes I wish I could meet individually with some of the coaches so I can get some extra feedback that applies more specifically to playing my instrument.",
                "This is one of my favorite classes at Yale! It is has incredible coaches and is a wonderful way to become a more cohesive and communicative chamber musician. I don't have any weaknesses"
