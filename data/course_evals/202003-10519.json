                "Sandro was an amazing professor who really helped out his students and dedicated a lot of his time to improving the course. There weren't any noticeable weaknesses, although I do not think that that much thought was put into making the switch online.",
                "The curriculum is highly political. The curriculum of the class is highly steeped in left-wing political causes. I took this course to learn Italian, not have a political narrative shoved down my throat. I know Im not the only person who feels this curriculum and this professor actively and unabashedly try to push a political narrative on their students. Sandro would pivot from giving us a homework assignment praising the PCI (Italian Communist Party) to saying that right-wing Italian politicians are hateful and racist. I DONT CARE!! WHATEVER! Just teach me Italian ffs",
                "Strengths: Sandro was an absolutely incredible professor who was really passionate about the course and cared about his students. The VHL textbook provides a lot of practice and clear, concise information. I also really enjoyed the asynchronous activities, like watching the Italian films. They were a great way to break up the lessons.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the pace of the course was very fast- at some points during the semester we had exams once a week. I know this is the nature of an L3 language course, but I would have loved to take more time to pause and learn more about the culture and contemporary issues discussed in the unit. Additionally, sometimes breakout rooms would not be effective in keeping me fully engaged with the material.",
                "The course facilitated consistent learning through daily meetings and work, which was a source of certainty in otherwise uncertain times. I received a lot of feedback which helped me improve my comprehension, and students had the opportunity to set individual goals which helped me focus. The professor was kind and understanding, and I looked forward to coming to class everyday!",
                "This class had a lot of work, however I think it was necessary in order to improve my Italian. The work assigned was always very helpful (it wasn't busy work).",
                "Strengths- enforcing old concepts to mix witth new concepts and to retain memory.",
                "I have only good things to say about this class. Sandro was an incredible teacher and he facilitated a great discussion every day. Italian classes are usually very hectic and at an almost break-neck pace, but Sandro really made it seem less daunting  I felt confident about my abilities by the time the tests came. Films were fun, if a little weird, as were the readings. The VHL Workbook was often finicky and quite frustrating. I don't think I got much out of that part of the class.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a star seminar and I'm happy I took this class with Sandro."

                "The asynchronous activities (films) really succeeded and broke up the pace of the class. The textbook was also very successful. I also think the format of the exams worked well (simply posting them on canvas and giving an allocated time to complete them). The environment around the tests was not that stressful. \r\nSometimes breakout rooms were not engaging, it really depended on who you were placed with and the dynamic of the group. I preferred the whole-class discussions where I felt more obligated to stay fully engaged.",

                "It felt a lot more demanding than my other classes that had switched to have more asynchronous aspects given remote learning. This class continued to meet every day which I understand is necessary because of the format of the class, but was still pretty draining given the times we are in.",
                "It was as good as it could be for virtual engagement.",
                "Succeeded in the way we could watch italian videos and dig deeper into italian culture",
                "Sandro's seminar-style discussion was very effective and helpful, as were his presentations. Virtual engagement even allowed for unique experiences that I don't think could be replicated in a traditional format: Sandro was able to take us on a mini-tour of Montreal's Italian quarter and tell us about Italian-Canadian relations first-hand. This is way better than sitting in a classroom!"

I thought Sandro was going to be a chill professor cause he was wearing a backwards hat and a jersey for our first class, turns out hes actually a hardass who grades super harshly and will haggle to take points away from you. Find another professor if you wanna take L3.",
                "Yes, L3 Italian was a great review of what I learned in L1\/L2, and it was taught in a very effective manner. I truly feel like I improved in my conversational Italian and am at a much higher level than when I entered the course. Sandro was a wonderful professor who created a low-stress, engaging learning environment.",

You will improve and hone in on your fundamental grammar, speaking, and comprehension skills before moving on to L4 italian. My favorite parts of the course were the cultural and etymological explorations and the kind students, professor, and department.",
