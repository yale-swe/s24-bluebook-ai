                "This course helped expand my understanding of what constitutes language, its functions, feelings and manifestations. Through a wide variety of literature (mixed media, multi lingual, experimental, poetry, prose, theory, plays), I learned about how language interacts with and is shaped by identity and culture. I also developed stronger creative analysis skills.",
                "This class sharpened my perspective on bilingualism, and by extension, how I see myself. The assignments also helped me with close-analysis, and Jane's feedback was consistently encouraging and on-point.",
                "I learned a lot about the different ways of being bilingual, and how language influences writing and perspective. The readings for this class are very diverse, and I was able to read many works that I wouldn't have otherwise discovered had I not taken this class. Since this was a first year seminar, it was my first time writing a college English paper, so I also learned more technical essay writing skills like how to incorporate secondary sources.",
                "I learned about the multidimensionality of the human experience and how this manifests in literature. I also learned important essay writing skills.",
                "Writing and critical reading.",
                "This class enabled me to read a great variety of literature without having to be burdened with complete works.  We worked with excerpts with which we explored bilingualism and multiculturalism.  This course has allowed me to become a better writer, but more so a better thinker.",
                "This class had such an interesting makeup of students and a unique professor perspective that allowed us to have really interesting discussions, and I really enjoyed learning about my classmates' personal lives. I also gained insights on cultures that were not my own, as well as lenses through which to examine my own culture."

                "I found most of the texts we read for this class highly engaging and genuinely very interesting. I learned so much and feel like I was exposed to a lot of beautiful, powerful literature and theory through this class. However, I sometimes got frustrated with how Professor Mikkelson ran class. Even though I walked away from every class with a deeper understanding of the text(s), I found that discussions were sometimes not as engaging as they could have been. We tended to spend class analyzing pieces from start to finish, rather than on a thematic basis, which I think would have led to a more engaging and free-flowing discussion among students.",
                "Jane is incredible. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale so far! The readings in this class were excellent (I'd even call some of them life-changing), and Jane's feedback on my writing was consistently encouraging and on-point. I also enjoyed the format of the class (short lecture on background of reading followed by class discussion). Jane was super available to students and directed class discussions in a way that made me see the readings in a completely new light.",
                "Strengths: incredibly interesting and diverse reading list, engaging discussions, clear assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: during discussions we often spent a lot of time reading through almost the entire body of work that was assigned, and at times I wanted to just jump straight into discussing the text so that we could dig deeper.",
                "It would be amazing if it counted as a writing credit because we did do a good amount of writing between the essays and short responses, but did not receive any writing credit. Maybe the Professor could adapt the assignments to align with Yale's definition of a \"writing course.\" Otherwise, it was a very interesting course, despite being at 9 am!",
                "It was repetitive but sometimes there were good discussions.",
                "This course allowed for a great amount of freedom and flexibility in the work produced by the student.  The responses, reflections, and essays were largely open-ended and allowed students to write about compelling and interesting topics.  One suggestion I would make is to space out the due dates for the short responses, as these piled up fast toward the end of the semester.",
                "A strength is definitely Professor Mikkelson! She is so encouraging and fantastic at facilitating discussion (especially for a 9am seminar). I also really appreciated having the space to practice intertwining academic and personal writing. Weaknesses are that sometimes the reading topics seemed to stray from the \"bilingual imaginaries\" focus of the class."

                "Overall, I would recommend this course to another student. Even though there were parts of class discussions that I think could have been structured differently, I really loved everything we read, and thought that Professor Mikkelson was kind and inspiring.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course, especially if you are interested in bilingualism. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale so far!",
                "Yes! If you have the opportunity to take this class, take it. It was my favorite class this semester and I highly recommend taking a course with Professor Mikkelson. This class introduced to me to so many amazing authors that aren't on a typical reading list, and made me think about bilingualism in new ways.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings that Professor Mikkelson chose were so interesting and the seminar format allowed for deep classroom discussions about the content. Also, Professor Mikkelson provides great academic support for first-years who are just learning about Yale's standards for writing.",
                "No, I do not feel like I got much out of the course.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student at Yale, even if they aren't on a humanities major\/track.  As a STEM major, I thoroughly enjoyed this seminar and made many friendships and relationships throughout the semester.  The workload is very manageable, and more importantly, the content is super interesting.",
                "Yes! It was an interesting first-year seminar, and the readings were for the most part very insightful. Also, because of the nature of the students who choose to take a seminar called Bilingual Imaginaries, you end up having a very cool group of classmates with diverse backgrounds and heritages. I enjoyed this class and it felt like a perfect transition into college classes. Grading on essays wasn't very harsh, which helped facilitate actual learning and made me more confident in writing since I wasn't constantly stressed about my grade for this class."
