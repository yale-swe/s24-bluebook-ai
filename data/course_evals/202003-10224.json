I think part of that is because of how it's organized around poets rather than particular themes; \"getting to know\" the poets was so interesting and surprisingly helpful in tapping into the layers of their poetry.",

                "no weaknesses, an incredible course!",
                "one strength is that all of the TFs and Prof are super engaged and willing to help students and honestly make the class wonderful\r\n\r\na weakness was there wasn't always much student engagement in section (though for that students are more to blame than the course) and sometimes the lectures were longer than the allotted time.",
                "Its a good overview of modern poetry but sometimes I felt like there wasnt adequate instruction on how to analyze poetry. Instead, we were just told to read poems and figure it out as we go based on Prof Hammers analysis",
                "Strengths: Discussion section was very well organized and prepared for by TF",
                "I think the availability of the professor and the teaching fellows was a strength of the course, but I think a little more direction in the weekly readings could have made it easier to be better prepared for discussion. We would often read a wide range of material, but not end up discussing the majority of it.",
                "I think, as far as an online course goes, this course perfectly executed the format. The content was engaging and steady, but didn't require a huge amount of interpersonal discussion to understand. The recorded lectures allowed me to connect with the readings in a new way each week. This structure felt really important for readings that at times can be difficult to access. I don't really have weaknesses for this class. I think it worked.",
                "Strength: Prof Langdon Hammer, whose informed and nuanced interpretations of poetry have inspired a keener sensibility in me. The course also strikes a  good balance between Ame, Brit & world poetry and draws interesting thematic connections between various poets and their creative contexts. Weakness: Weekly reading assignments could be more directed, e.g. with specific questions given beforehand, to inform section discussions.",
                "The recorded lectures were a bit of a struggle for me, though it helped that they were on the shorter side. My biggest complaint is that we only went over maybe four or five of the fifteen to twenty poems that we read before every lecture. However, the small sections were an awesome way to go in depth, and Professor Hammer is fantastic in lecture and in office hours."

Being able to pause\/slow down\/speed up as needed allowed me to take more thorough notes, which I've even consulted for papers in other poetry classes. Something I didn't realize at first would be a godsend was the lack of discussion posts! Instead of requiring students to come up with something ~super smart~ that everyone will read on Canvas, Prof. Hammer asked us to send him a weekly email about basically anythingquestions, thoughts, confusion, \"even an emoji,\" as he told usand no one was penalized for missing a week or two. This took the pressure off, allowing me to ask\/say things I was really interested in\/curious about without feeling the need to sound \"academic,\" so to speak, especially when there are so many other things to deal with right now that are more important than discussion posts.",
                "I thought it was useful that we had small discussion sections, albeit over zoom. I think it can be difficult to pay attention to recorded lectures, though, so perhaps making one of the recorded ones into a live lecture would be useful.",
                "See above.",

Even if you don't know the first thing about poetry, this class is designed to give students the most concrete entry points as possible into reading contemporary poetry. There were tons of really helpful handouts (which I downloaded and will definitely be using in both personal and academic future pursuits). Prof. Hammer and the TFs will get you excited about contemporary poetry and make you feel comfortable tossing around ideas and questions in discussion.",
