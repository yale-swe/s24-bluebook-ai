                "An understanding of intellectual and aesthetic history regarding modernism.",
                "I learned a lot about close analysis of more abstract poetry than Im used to, and this was also my first experience spending an entire semester working closely with one piece of literature. I also learned a lot about analyzing outside sources and allusions, and about the modernist movement and its place in history.",
                "If you want to take a deep dive into the Wasteland, this is definitely the way to do it. You learn a lot about modernism, Eliot's influences, the allusions in the poem, and the poem's legacy.",
                "I learned a great deal about modernist aesthetics and bridged many many gaps in my knowledge of Western intellectual and cultural history.",
                "I think the most valuable knowledge I gained from this course was the ability to find a new interpretation of a work each time I read it--I realized no work is static, and even interpretation is like translation: we as readers will always add our own biases, but that doesn't make the work of interpretation any less important or beautiful, particularly not with a poem like the Waste Land, which begs close reading.",
                "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Grimstad's lectures are always fascinating and eye-opening, and I've learned much about The Waste Land and its relationship to Modernity. I've gained a much better understanding of the poem itself, and all the course materials were enjoyable to read and class discussions were always engaging."

                "Really interesting course with great readings. The assignments were a little loose, which I liked but was definitely a bit challenging. I",
                "If you like modernism, this is an excellent class. If you know nothing at all about modernism, it might be totally overwhelming.",
                "I like the wide variety of intellectual sources in the class. I think discussion often became unfocused.",
                "The discussions could have been more focused but overall the course was very engaging.",
                "In seminar, several students needed to be reined in to allow others to speak--participation was very uneven across the class. Things like jargon and references to works people hadn't read made people feel excluded from the discussion. Perhaps more structure to discussion or more active facilitation would help.\r\n\r\nLoved the readings each week--digestible amounts of relevant and helpful content. Also appreciated Grimstad's willingness to let students bring in different perspectives from their areas of expertise. He was very open to letting the students dictate the curriculum.",
                "Strengths: great syllabus. Grimstads enthusiasm is infectious and I got the sense he really cared what everyone had to say. I enjoyed that we read around Eliot rather than just reading his poems and essays. I left with a much clearer understanding of modernism. Weaknesses: the class was too big. Too many contributions at once, hard to have streamlined and clear discussion. Additionally, I wished that conversations were more grounded in the text itself, sometimes if felt like we talked about general themes more than anything specific.",
                "Strengths: Professor Grimstad, very manageable work load, high intellectual engagement, interesting material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think Professor Grimstad could have managed class discussions a bit better so that the same three people (who liked to hear themselves talk) didn't speak the whole class",
                "Single-work courses allow professors to dig into the depths of their knowledge and students to learn something beyond the superficial. The careful attention to The Waste Land and only a few other works allowed us the space to work out the subtleties instead of glossing over them. I think it may have been good to do some of the auditory stuff earlier in the semester though.",
                "I thought this course was amazing. It gave a very good overview of modernism with relevant, interesting readings and good discussion. I wish we had read slightly more of From Ritual to Romance, listened to more Tristan and Isolde (or read some of the stories the Opera is based on), and spent a little bit of time with the Golden Bough in order to look deeper into the occult significance behind behind The Waste Land. It also would have been cool to read some of the literature from world war I as well! On the other hand, this class could very well have been two semesters long, and I'm really glad we read what we did! There were times where it felt like the conversations strayed into literary theory that we hadn't read, which was a little bit isolating--I wish during a few of those times there had been a redirection, or we had been asked to read some of those sources so everyone could participate equally! Overall though, a really really wonderful class!",

                "Yes! But only if grimstad reduces the class size. I think if he does the class will be even more engaging. The waste land is a highly complex and fascinating poem. You will learn a lot by just attempting to make sense of one phrase.",
