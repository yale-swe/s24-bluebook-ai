He is great at guiding the discussions, and the readings for the course are all very interesting and manageable length-wise. Readings are varied from futuristic short stories to theory which helps keep students engaged. Clear feedback on assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't particularly think of any.",

I think one thing that could have been improved was guidance for the discussions -- sometimes the texts were long, so I would have appreciated more clarity about the important parts of them to discuss.",
                "The professor, discussions, and readings were the strengths of this course. Professor Tazudeen and the readings he provided us with gave me a fascinating new approach to thinking about environmentalism, and how it may vary across peoples. This made the discussions very interesting as well. One potential weakness is that the course often focuses so much on the ideas of the readings and the discussions that sometimes there wasn't as much emphasis on improving writing skills. H",

This course is a super helpful introduction to college writing (professor Tazudeen gives great feedback!) and if you have any interest in environmental topics then you will find this class to be a super engaging opportunity to knock out the writing credit. You'll come out of this class with some new perspectives and it's a valuable course for anyone regardless of major.",

If you would like to learn more about ecology, more specifically black and indigenous ecology, I would highly recommend this course. The material was engaging and fulfilling."
