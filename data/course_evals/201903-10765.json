   "comments": [
    "The importance of Chinese literature throughout the Chinese tradition.",
    "Learned about all of Chinese history through the lens of philosophy, literature, and art.",
    "I learned a little about all time periods in Chinese history, and overarching themes that define the Chinese Tradition. We read many primary texts in addition to the history.",
    "The content of what is considered the \"Chinese Tradition\"",
    "A survey of Chinese literature, philosophy, history, and culture, from the very first dynasty until right before communism. Professor Bender describes it as \"like directed studies but for china, and much less intense\" and I think that's pretty accurate. We learned a lot of philosophy, read many of the famous texts of China (like Journey to the West and Story of the Stone), and even talked about Chinese paintings.",
    "I took away an overview of the Chinese tradition--3000 years of Chinese literature, philosophy, and history. Very brief, but very well-taught.",
    "Learnt about prominent texts in the Chinese tradition from a host of different fields -- history, literature, philosophy, etc.",
    "I learned about culture, thought, and tradition throughout Chinese history. I learned how to write more literary analysis-type essays in Chinese.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of Chinese literature and philosophy. Loved loved loved the choice to take a chinese section especially.",
    "I gained an overview of 4000 years of Chinese literature, philosophy, art, culture, and history. We learned about major schools of thought, literary movements, and got select readings from some of the most influential and prominent works of Chinese literature, from Laozi to Lu Xun. The content was somewhat superficial, and we did not get a chance to properly explore a specific genre, but that is simply due to the sheer volume of content we were covering in a semester.",
    "A solid overview of Chinese literature and philosophy, starting from Confucius and ending with Lu Xun in the late Qing.\r\n\r\nIn CHNS 200, Prof. Bender would teach the Monday and Wednesday lectures, and on Friday you'll go over the same text\/topic in Chinese with Prof. Zhang. The class and section really complements one another and I gain a lot of insight from reading and discussing the text in Chinese every Friday with Prof. Zhang.",
    "A broad understanding of the course of chinese history and exposure to the most important philosophical and literary figures and movements over all the dynasties. Also got a taste of what these works are like in the original language",
    "I got a great refresher on Chinese history from a cultural and literary perspective, and I got a good sense of how literature and philosophy built on and challenged its tradition over time. Most interestingly, I learned about the many ways that literature impacted the sociopolitical lives of the Chinese, which is something that isn't really talked about and doesn't have a parallel in the United States.",
    "I learned a lot from ancient Chinese thought, philosophy, all the way to poetry and more modern literature. The Chinese section exposes you to plenty of texts, and reading them in their original form is fascinating.",
    "I learned the very basics of Chinese literature, philosophy, and art from the past several thousand years, providing a good foundation from which to explore any specific time period and topic in greater depth. I gained a greater understanding of how these intellectual trends and works can be understood within their historical contexts, as well as ways in which these works remained relevant over the remainder of Chinese history and into the present day.",
    "Developed a broad understanding of Chinese history from the Shang Dynasty all the way until the 1900's. Learned how to close read poems, analyze paintings, and draw connections between philosophies and ancient literature.",
    "I gained so much knowledge about the Chinese tradition: past philosophers, ideologies, and literature, than I thought I would ever learn. Thanks to this course I see so many connections between the traditional China of the past and the modern day China I hear about so often. Some insights I have gained from this course is how westernized my way of thinking has become. In particular, as a Christian, I find that I approached the Buddhist and Taoist teachings from the mindset of Christianity which is not how those should be approached. Now, I find Buddhist, Taoist, and Christian ideas in every day life wherever I go, and I see similarities between these ideologies that I hadn't known about before.",
    "Not only did I learn about the various foundational aspects of Chinese culture, I also encountered texts I had never seen before and learned how to analyze them. Professor Bender introduced a variety of novel insights into what the Chinese tradition is. I began thinking about the meaning of literature, the distinction between philosophy and literature, and the importance of poetry and song in founding and propagating a civilization. This was a truly excellent course!",
    "I gained a broad overview of the Chinese Tradition, the main ideas that run throughout its history, and the new and interesting ways in which they have manifested in literature, drama, song and poetry.",
    "Actually learned so much",
    "Incredibly fascinating and mostly very deep coverage covering the span fo 4000 years of the history and development of the Chinese tradition.",
    "This class was absolutely incredible. Not only did I learn an immense amount about Chinese history, but through that it influenced how I view my own life. It provided me with insight to change the way I look at life, and quite possibly made me a happier person in general.",
    "I learned the ins and outs of classical Chinese texts and ideologies. I also learned some classical literary Chinese in order to read some of these texts.",
    "Understanding the chinese tradition, themes, ideas"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All the lectures were very engaging and also the Chinese sections are really fun as well!",
    "This is one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Bender is an engaging lecturer, and I genuinely enjoyed going to class and listening to his lectures. The workload was very manageable, and the paper assignments helped me dig deeper into some of the material and understand it more fully.",
    "Strengths: Lucas Bender is great, section is great. Weaknesses: So Much Reading, but that comes with the package. Should be expected",
    "The lectures were engaging, the readings were interesting (though long), the grading was a good blend of testing and essays. Overall a very strong class.",
    "You go through a lot of content, which is both a plus and a minus. It might be improved by having a more consistent reading load, as those tended to vary week to week.",
    "Strengths: Professor Bender is extremely knowledgeable, passionate, and kind! He organizes the course very well and I thoroughly enjoyed every topic. I really looked forward to going to every lecture because they were always really interesting. Dihao (my TA) was also very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the lectures could be longer than 50 minutes because sometimes the information felt rushed. I was in the Hu section and sometimes they felt dry - I think it would be cool to do more engaging activities during section. It was rough doing the last essay during reading period, so it would be helpful for the due date to be during the week before reading period instead.",
    "Strength:\r\n1. Luke is a great professor--teaches very well and lecture is engaging and easy to follow\r\n2. You get a decent sense of different aspects of Chinese literature\/philosophy, learning the main tenets\/points of major texts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. I didn't think discussion section was helpful, but I had fun during them",
    "Lectures were well ordered and delivered and the material was extremely interesting.",
    "A big strength is the format of the lectures. They follow an intuitive arch and are really well delivered by Professor Bender. He is a fun and engaging lecturer, and he always put in enormous effort to be available and approachable. Another strength were the readings; they were all really interesting and well-integrated into lecture discussions.\r\n\r\nI felt that readings could have been supplemented by a reading response of some sort each week, even if it were only graded pass-fail. This is because there was simply a lot of reading to get through, and the course could have maybe benefitted from a bit more structure related to the readings. I did, however, love that Professor Bender had a prompt for each reading written on Canvas. this gave more direction and elicited more meaning while doing each reading.",
    "I felt like the ending of the course was a bit rushed and it felt kindof random what we decided to focus on since 4000 years of history is just too broad.",
    "I personally really valued the Chinese section of the course, because it made the class so much more enriching for people who spoke Chinese and had a Chinese background, as we could engage with the course on a much deeper level. That being said, there was a bit of a disconnect with the English lecture and the Chinese assignments and section, as oftentimes when we switched over to Chinese, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out who was who and what was what. Additionally, because lots of the readings were in English, writing papers was a bit challenging, especially if we were trying to grab quotes from the reading, given that we often had to source the Chinese texts ourselves. If there could be a bit more integration in this respect, possibly with more Chinese readings to go with every English lecture, and more Chinese on the presentation slides, it would make it much easier to make the transition from the English aspect of the course to the Chinese aspect of the course.",
    "I thought the class was great! Lectures were informative and the assignments are reasonable (three short papers, a midterm, and a final). Highly recommend it.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- it gives a great overview of chinese civilisation, the texts are interesting but not outrageously long, plenty of opportunity to talk to section leaders and professor",
    "Professor Bender's lectures are fantastic, and the course material (because it's a survey) is almost always interesting and important. Because it's a lecture, it's harder to do a deeper dive into any of these texts or ask questions, and the section was not especially engaging, which better planning could improve (pre-picking passages, coming up with most in-depth questions). It's also tough because not everyone is engaged in the section.",
    "The class is very well-organized. The English readings might feel a bit too much, but I was able to get around by just doing readings for the Chinese section which are quite manageable. Both Prof. Bender and Prof. Zhang are very engaging teachers",
    "This course did an excellent job providing an overview to the Chinese canon despite the limitations of having to fit such a large volume of material into such a short semester. One way to improve this course would be for the University to accord as much respect to the study of non-Western humanities as it does to Western humanities. In perspective, it is absurd that students have the opportunity to study the Western canon through Directed Studies over two semesters and six courses, whereas a similarly large volume of learning on the Chinese canon is compressed into a single semester-long course. Moreover, Directed Studies advertises itself as providing access to some of the top professors in the University, as well as distinguished speakers from outside the University. Why is there no such level of institutional support granted to the study of humanities outside the Western canon? This is not to mention humanities fields that are even less present at Yale than East Asian studies.",
    "Strength: Course was taught very effectively, information was concise and very interesting",
    "Strengths of this course is most definitely the professor and the discussion sections led by his teaching fellow. They are so good at engaging the students in the topic of the lecture, and are also quite knowledgeable in the area of study this course is focused on.  The most difficult aspect of this course was trying to read, understand, and remember all of the complex ideas in the reading assignments. However, that is both a strength and weakness of this course because it is precisely due to the wide variety of readings that we do that I was able to learn so much from this course; however, it was also because of these readings that I had trouble keeping up with discussions at times. Another weakness of this course is perhaps the lack of writing preparation given prior to the papers that are due throughout the semester. I felt incredibly under-prepared for all three papers, and had a difficult time trying to understand what the professor or teaching fellow was asking me to produce.",
    "Strengths: interesting and engaging lectures, meaningful essay prompts, well-organized curriculum, good amount of readings, good amount and structure of tutorials\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes tutorial was not as engaging as lecture",
    "The course achieved its objective in providing a very broad sweep of the Chinese Tradition, in that sense not covering any thing in depth can hardly be a weakness. If I were to redo this course, I would probably try doing it in the Chinese section instead!",
    "No weaknesses",
    "The lectures were incredibly fun and engaging, the readings fascinating, the professor's and teaching assistants' responses were super fast, and the gallery tour was a great touch.",
    "It would be really helpful if readings for the Chinese section could be posted before Wednesday. Frequently we would receive that week's reading on Wednesday late at night, and need to read them by Friday's section. I had super busy Thursdays unfortunately, and that made it hard to balance my work!",
    "Great lectures, awesome readings, wonderful balance of literature, art, and philosophy.",
    "Very personable guy, great teacher and not too rigid in his ways. I think we should be able to use computers to write the essay portions in the Chinese exams. It's been done in some higher level Chinese classes to great effect.",
    "Strengths: Bender is a fantastic lecturer.!!!!"

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend to students who want to get a decent amount of exposure to various forms of Chinese literature from ancient Chinese poems to modern short stories!",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a very well-structured course on interesting material.",
    "Yes yes yes",
    "This is a really interesting Hu\/Wr credit that expands your horizons, and requires no prerequisite knowledge. Take it if you find the subject interesting and it fits in your schedule!",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in the literary tradition of China or many of the cultural\/philosophical aspects that still manifest themselves in the present day.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! I am a STEM student that was looking for an interesting humanities \"gut\", and this class really exceeded my expectations, and was probably my favorite class I took this semester. It's not very difficult but it's a really interesting intro course. I took the class for the Hu credit so I only had to write 3 3 page essays, which I was really grateful for as a person that does not enjoy writing.",
    "Yes! Very, very good course for getting a brief overview of Chinese literature, philosophy, and history. What you get out of it is what you put into it (e.g. how much you do the readings, how deeply you read them, how much you want to engage with them for paper, etc.). The papers aren't too long, but the topic are very well-designed. Lectures are super engaging, and I actually enjoyed going to lecture a lot. Luke is also a very kind person, and I enjoyed getting to meet him outside of class :)",
    "Yes. It is a great introductory survey to eminent works in the Chinese tradition.",
    "Absolutely. I think that if you are interested in the humanities in any respect, you ought to know about the Chinese tradition. The western cannon is a really limited scope to draw from, and this class does a great job of introducing and entirely new cannon. I think any and all would benefit from this course, but particularly those interested in history, china, or the humanities.",
    "Yes! Especially those who would take the Chinese section: I loved that i got to learn about the texts in english and then got to see the original text.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who speaks Chinese, especially third culture kids, and students with some Chinese heritage or cultural background, that did not grow up in a purely Chinese context, as this course allows students to engage more with Chinese literary tradition.",
    "I highly recommend it! Take the Chinese section with Prof. Zhang if you can. It'll really enrich the class to discuss the readings in Chinese, and writing the papers were also very fulfilling. I was surprised at how I was able to write literary\/philosophical analysis in my essays. \r\n\r\nEven though the class isn't really a Chinese language class, the discussions during section, the essay, doing the reading, and even the exam, provide plenty of opportunities to practice reading\/writing\/speaking, with Prof. Zhang also introducing some key phrases and classical Chinese terms along the way.",
    "Yes, I found it so wonderful",
    "Definitely. If you want a great cultural and literary survey of China, this is an excellent way to do it.",
    "If you are looking for a Humanities credit, this is a solid class. I took the Chinese section despite not being a native speaker, but Prof. Zhang was nevertheless very welcoming",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to gain exposure to the humanistic tradition of a region radically different from the West that is so over-emphasized here at Yale. Even for folks who have some prior background knowledge on Chinese philosophy\/literature, this course can fill in gaps in your knowledge and pull everything into perspective.",
    "Yes. The content is very interesting and the professor's tests were very reasonable. The TF's were also very supportive and engaging.",
    "Yes, because this course was interesting, engaging, and filled with insightful lessons and readings. It opens up the minds of students raised in the West to ideologies and ways of life in the East. Furthermore, the lectures were always so much fun to listen to; they were my favorite part of the course.",
    "Definitely! It is a great way to explore a culture which is just as important globally as the Western heritage, and yet sadly not given nearly as much attention. I wish more students took this opportunity to explore the fascinating, rich world of the Chinese tradition.",
    "Yes, if he or she is interested in the Chinese Tradition.",
    "Yes of course",
    "Absolutely. Prof. Bender is excellent. Everything a humanities professor should be.",
    "Absolutely, for anyone interested in Chinese or East Asian studies, and either has some or no background in its geopolitical, religious, or cultural history.",
    "Yes! Professor Bender is an amazing teacher who is both extremely kind and passionate about what he does.",
    "Yes, the instruction is excellent and the subject material is very interesting. Even the TFs were strong.",
    "Yes definitely. yale has too much of a focus on the western canon, this is the way to shatter that bubble",
    "Yes."
