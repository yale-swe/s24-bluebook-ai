                "He could have taught us more woodworking techniques instead of pushing us to do sculptures without going over basics on woodworking.",
                "Strengths: The course itself was very interesting -- I learned how to use various machines in the woodshop to sculpt\" wood, and I felt like I learned sufficiently enough to appreciate and understand more about the wood sculpture tradition in America. I also really enjoyed viewing everyone's final projects at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course itself was very disorganized. A clearer syllabus with a calendar attached and a grading policy would have been helpful. There was one project where John gave us only a few days' notice of in advance and then only a week to finish the work (keep in mind we only meet once per week). That was an incredibly stressful process for everyone and honestly really kept the class morale low for the rest of the semester, especially because he kept talking about how we needed to spend more time in the woodshop. There were also some comments made by the professor which made for a distinctly uncomfortable learning process, particularly during crit, targeted towards specific students which were more passive-aggressive than constructive.",
                "Strengths: Shop access, our TA was incredible \r\nWeakness: I don't feel like I learned anything in this class besides very basic uses of shop tools. We watched a few videos of current wood artists, which I could have watched at home, and then sort of just had work days, except we got very limited supplies and little useful feedback.  Critiques were messy and I don't think I got anything out of it. I think there should be a lot more theory and foundational work, as well as much more guidance on projects.",
                "Strengths: This class allowed me to explore a different medium with support.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think this class did not do a great job of introducing woodworking as an artistic medium. We learned basics of woodworking but did not really discuss the theoretically. There were no trips\/minimal artist talks.",
                "This course's biggest strength is its resources access to the shop, materials, and technical guidance from the shop hands.\r\n\r\nI found this course to have many weaknesses, which may have been mostly caused by the instructor. For one, I never felt very comfortable working in the shop, and John Drue made me feel even less comfortable in that space. Working with him was frustrating and belittling most of the time.\r\n\r\nThe course was also very badly organized. We spent the first several weeks just making push-sticks and watching extremely inefficient demonstrations of the tools. Then, our later projects had much shorter turnarounds. John Drue didn't schedule a time in advance for our final crit during finals period, and then when he tried to set the date on top of our other final exams, he got angry with us for trying to \"negotiate\" his final. But it was clear that the misunderstanding was due to a lack of preparation on his part. He never figured out how to post anything on canvas, so he informed us about all of our projects and deadlines by just replying to the same email thread all semester.\r\n\r\nFor an intro sculpture class, this course was far too unstructured. I think John Drue intended to give us creative freedom, so he only offered technical advice in response to our specific ideas for projects. As a result, I never had a clear understanding of what to do next, so I had to ask for help every step of the way. The problems with this system were that (a) we had to wait around a lot for guidance and (b) John Drue often had a hard time understanding what it was that we were asking. I wish we had been given assignments that just forced us to learn skills we could use on our own, like joinery techniques and how to set precise angles.\r\n\r\nIf the class involved a stronger exploration of the conceptual and theoretical basis for sculpture practice, perhaps this lack of structure would have served us well. But I found our critiques and discussions of readings to be surface-level, ungenuine, and unfocused. Every time we spoke, John Drue would repeat our ideas and try to change them to fit his ideas better. Then wed have to say, No, thats not what I meant, and explain our ideas again.\r\n\r\nThe one saving grace of this course was that the TA, SR Lejeune, did an exceptional job. SR checked in on us to make sure we were ok and to help communicate things to John Drue that we weren't comfortable bringing up directly. They also went out of their way to help with projects, and when they weren't able to help, they made sure to introduce us to the other shop hands and let them know what we'd need help with."

I don't even know where to begin with this class because it was such chaos from beginning to end, but this was by far the worst art class I've ever taken at Yale (and I know this is a sentiment shared by other students). The course itself was very disorganized. A clearer syllabus with a calendar attached and a grading policy would have been helpful.

There were also repeated comments made by John which made for a distinctly uncomfortable learning environment, particularly during crit, targeted towards one to two students which were more passive-aggressive than constructive. As a four-hour class on Thursday, all of us students arranged our whole class schedules around this class, and it was honestly so disappointing to see the way it turned out it did. This class was not representative of the art department at Yale.",

                "The resources we had access to in this course are well worth your time, but I think the course varies a lot depending on the professor, so I dont know whether to recommend it. With John Drue teaching, I didnt feel very comfortable in the class and I didnt acquire the foundational skills I wanted to, so I wouldnt recommend taking the course with him in the near future, especially considering that there are other intro sculpture classes taught by more experienced professors. John Drue might do a better job in the future, with more teaching experience.",
