    "I gained a much better understanding of HTML and CSS (I had taken online courses on it in the past but they never really stuck) and feel comfortable using it to build and fully customize my own websites. The class really starts from the beginning with HTML\/CSS so it's totally okay not to have programming experience. I learned a lot about how the internet has evolved since its invention, especially relating to aesthetics and how we use them online.  I learned about experimental web design and web art and the ways web design can be used as a tool for subversion (this probably came more from my own research\/exploration of the topics we covered, but the class and materials are a fantastic introduction to these topics if you're interested in them).",
    "Proficient, practical, and useful understanding of HTML coding and CSS stylesheets with a touch of optional JavaScript.",
    "Broadly speaking, this course does a great job of introducing students to webpage design, HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. However, rather than teaching via abstract coding, this course does an excellent job of anchoring your learning to an overarching, course-long project. This allows students to be creative, make important design decisions, and ultimately determine how they wish to carry out certain things and achieve certain goals of their websites. In this way, the course champions \"learning by doing,\" which I feel is the most effective way to learn any kind of software development.",
    "Use of CSS and HTML, knowledge of internet history.",
    "Great introduction to web design! I learned and practiced the fundamentals of HTML\/CSS, and I feel like my coding improved throughout the semester. We also developed some tenets of graphic design and typography.",
    "HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript.",
    "I learned how to develop websites from scratch, using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Through this course, I discovered that websites are closer to works of art than they are to coding projects."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: \r\nMatt is a great teacher and super helpful, always around to answer questions and gives very helpful responses. He's very understanding and chill, which makes the class feel chill instead of stressful. He really encourages everyone to follow through with their ideas, while giving constructive ideas and direction. He doesn't try to insert himself into your ideas at all, just suggests paths that you might find interesting and align with your ideas, without any pressure to follow through with them if you don't want to.\r\n\r\nThe material itself is also a strength because it is much more engaging than the typical computer science class. Being in the art department, it's much more visually focused and uses coding as a tool rather than the subject. You don't need to have a background in art to enjoy or do well in this class though, which I really appreciate. \r\n\r\nAnother strength is that the main project of the course is a series of newsletters (and a website to host them), which lets you explore any topic you want. There is full freedom in what you want to explore and how you want to present it. There's no requirement for format (if you want to do writing, art, photos, etc). It really promotes free and individual exploration and makes for a fantastic opportunity to work on something you're really interested in with the help of a teacher. We also did multiple \"crit\" sessions with guest teachers\/graphic designers, which gave a fresh perspective on your work and topics and were super engaging. Hearing the ideas and crits of other students gave me a lot of ideas for my own work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nAlthough it's necessary to cover all the information in a few weeks, I think the length of summer session classes (especially being online) can provide a challenge in engagement. This isn't the fault of this course specifically at all, but staring at your screen for three straight hours in class is tough and makes it hard to pay attention for the last hour or so. There was also sometimes a little more lecturing than I thought was necessary for the material, but the content was interesting and we did a lot exercises and took breaks, so it was still very engaging.",
    "Strengths include engaging assignments, very useful information, constant feedback, and excellent professor and TA. Lectures were very well done, with some brief history then a live coding session with time for questions and trying on your own. Two minor strengths: Dropbox Paper was nice to have ongoing access to edited lecture documents; 5-10 minutes break during lecture was perfect for taking your eyes off the screen and refocusing for the second half.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was how much creative liberty it offered the students within the prescribed premise of the class project. This allowed for a high degree of engagement and kept the material interesting for the duration of the course. One weakness is that it became difficult to maintain focus for the entire duration of the 3 hour lecture; the instructor can work on breaking up the talk with participation activities or other fun ways to keep the class fresh.",
    "I thought the material of the course was well-done, but I thought there should have been more exercises that directed us towards more specific skills. We had some exercises that directed us to using fonts, favicons, etc. But there were some skills: table layouts, positioning, animation, etc. that I think we should have had small exercises for. Also, I would have liked these small exercises to incorporate Java, even if Java wasn't part of our final project. Towards the end of class, I felt like we stopped covering new material.",
    "**Strengths:** Professor Wolff was great and very helpful! His real-time coding during class set good examples for best practices. If we had an idea in mind, but werent sure how to accomplish it, he was always willing to walk through and debug via email and jsfiddle outside of class. Throughout the term, as we sent out more material, he would periodically follow-up with feedback\/critiques, so we could continue refining our layout and designs. He also did code reviews so we could get some personalized feedback, and a progress report & grade projection at midterm. Especially for something as abstract\/subjective as art, I was surprised how direct, clear, and insightful Professor Wolffs and our TA Nicks feedback was, and feel like with their continued guidance I was able to develop my eye for design. And Nick was a great TA! He brought a different perspective with an eye for graphic design, and offered helpful feedback throughout the semester, both in and out of class, on how I could make my layout, color choices, and typography clearer and more effective. I appreciated his help and input! Also on several occasions during class, Professor Wolff brought in accomplished professionals to give us a new perspective\/outside feedback on our website\/newsletter designs, which evolved throughout the term. The main project in this course was developing and publishing at least 6 issues of an email newsletter of a topic of our choice, and building a website archive for them. I appreciated the freedom we had in creating our own unique website, design language, and topic. I also appreciated the fact that deadlines were flexible in the sense that we needed 6 issues by the end of the course, but we were able to decide when we would send out each issue. As a result, I spent a lot of time developing the necessary tools in the beginning, and was able to send out most of my emails towards the end, while some peoples timeline was completely different! It was always a welcome surprise to see someones latest newsletter show up in your inbox. Overall, Im very happy with how my site turned out, which Ive continued to maintain after the end of the course. I think this was definitely my favorite class I took this summer, and I learned valuable skills that I will take with me.\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses:** Learning HTML\/CSS required a substantial amount of work and continued practice; in addition to putting together the email newsletters+website archive, we had some additional low-stress homework assignments to practice making a webpage from scratch (repetition is the mother of all learning). However, I feel like the topics of the homeworks were a bit weak: sketching the front page of the NYT with pencil and paper, and embedding the scan in an HTML page; going outside to take a picture of our internet box, and embedding the picture in an HTML page. In the future I would want these assignments to be a bit more meaningful(?).",
    "It was really good as an intro class, but the 3 hour class time is a lot to sit through. The prof did a good job at alleviating this strain by giving short breaks.",
    "This course was very strong overall and I don't think it had any weaknesses. The one thing I could think of to improve would be to explain a little bit more about JavaScript in the role of web development."

    "YES! I think anyone would benefit from and enjoy this course. If you are at all interested in visual arts\/aesthetics and technology, I urge you to take this course. This is my favorite course I have ever taken at Yale and by far the most engaging.  You are given absolute freedom to do whatever you wanted and actively encouraged to push boundaries, even if it doesn't turn out how you expected. There's no failure as long as you are trying, so you don't feel any pressure to be safe or successful or look smart, which is a great feeling and a change from the typical Yale atmosphere.",
    "100%. Matt does a great job of facilitating HTML and CSS learning. Requires no prior programming experience. Excellent course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great introduction to the principles of web design and front-end software development.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course since most courses at Yale don't teach real world skills, but this one does.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! Professor Wolff is great, kind, and generous with his time, and makes an effort to ensure that everyone can succeed! If you put in the work, you will definitely learn a lot. People came into the course at different levels, but everyone visibly grew as the course progressed, as you could watch their newsletter styles continually changing, incorporating targeted feedback.",
    "Yes, it's a great intro to web design class",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it can be valuable to both Art and Computer Science majors in that it helps as an introduction to the technological side of art as well as providing essential information on the art side of computer science."
