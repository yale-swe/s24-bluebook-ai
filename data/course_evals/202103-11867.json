                "Way too much time spent on linear algebra, then trying to do complex analysis in the span of two weeks was ridiculous.",
                "Strengths: the order of topics was well done, so that themes from earlier reappeared in later, seemingly disparate parts of the course.  Homework solutions were detailed and very helpful for evaluating my work and reviewing.\r\nWeakness: the homeworks did not closely correspond to the lecture, especially toward the beginning of the course.  The course could be improved by more closely following just two-three references.",
                "Strengths: the course contains many aspects of math\r\nWeaknesses: it is very hard to understand the contents by listening to the lecture.",
                "Very clearly organized typed notes. Lots of mathematical insights are embodied in it. Provide a strong mathematical basis for my physics knowledge. I personally enjoy the mathy side of the course, but I think it may be too mathy for most other physics students.",
                "I think TA office hours would help the course a lot. We only had the one two-hour block of office hours. Although useful, it felt a bit rushed given that most problem sets were due on Wednesday. Also, I think the notes the instructor uploaded lacked somewhat in the latter half of the course. Finally, some topics (mostly Complex Analysis) were too rushed. Other than that I think the instructor taught the course well and the problem sets were fair and interesting.",
                "The course is well-designed and fast-paced. Students can learn a lot if actively participate but easily lost if not.",
                "More practice problems would be helpful",
                "I think it would be helpful to make the class note complete and covering all the content in class.",
                "A lot of useful topics are covered. You can really learn a lot. But sometimes it is hard to follow in class. After class problem sets are challenging. Need to spend a lot of time on this class.",
                "Professor Nick Read does not provide nearly enough support or resources throughout the course for us to succeed. He actively tells his TA's not to hold office hours, discourages questions or comments or only vaguely answers questions during his office hours, not to mention the fact that he holds his office hours in his small office and expects his 15+ students to pile into instead of actually having a covid safe room, withholds homework assignments from those few students who might have had to miss class for an emergency and were unlucky enough to have to do so on a homework day, he is never consistent in returning homework on time and if you want to contest some of the grading errors the TA's and Prof Read are incredibly difficult to track down, he only provides clues or tricks and tips to only his favorite students in office hours, and although he provides textbook references sometimes, he never offers the students any advice on how to actually acquire the 130$+ books he is referencing. Though this course is meant to be challenging inherently, all of the additional hurdles that Professor Read presents to his students adds unnecessary difficulty and anxiety to this course. Telling students that all they need is \"intuition\" for mathematical topics that the majority of us have never actually taken courses in is, aside from being wildly unhelpful, condescending.",
                "Good coverage of topics that appeared in other graduate courses. Complex analysis was rushed and the corresponding homework set was unusually difficult - it took me two to three times as long as the other homework sets. In class, it may have been more useful to do one or two examples slowly rather than ~5 examples with skipped steps. There were several days where I didn't get much out of the examples as the skipped steps required intuition that could only come from practice. Office hours were generally useful. At moments, the grading of homework sets was inconsistent."

The topics that were more challenging for me (like asymptotic analysis) may have been interesting if the class was more pedagogically-oriented, but the goal seemed to be to rush through it so we can cover more ground.  After multiple rigorous assignments, I still do not feel like I have a handle on that particular topic.",
