I was able to refresh my understanding of how different macroeconomic variables like interest rates, consumption, investment, unemployment rates, and exchange rates interact with each other. On top that, the professor taught us how we can use the models and combine it with data and econometric methods to evaluate the relationships between the various variables."

                "I really enjoyed Professor Fair's insights into research and macroeconomics. We talked a good amount about current events and some of the important literature in the field, and it was very helpful to hear his thoughts on certain topics! The class size (8 people) was also a big advantage, since I think this made facilitating discussion a bit easier. Professor Fair was always accessible, and provided helpful feedback throughout the writing process. No real weaknesses, other than maybe some clearer guidelines for the first paper (in terms of how to structure the research, etc.).",
                "The strength is the professor's versatile approach to teaching the class given the richness of the macroeconomic literature. He gave us exposure to many pivotal works in macroeconomic literature and combined that exposure with a review of traditional macroeconomic models so that we could understand how the models were supported or not supported by research. I think this approach helped me understand how macroeconomic research is conducted and allowed me to become a better consumer of works in the literature."

                "Yeah, I would. I found this to be a really nice senior elective in the department. Provided you have some degree of econometrics background, this class should be accessible enough for you to still learn a great deal. More than anything, I think I built up more of an intuition behind macroeconomic events that I didn't necessarily get out of the core ECON classes. The class is certainly open-ended in terms of what you can research and work on, so if you have a particular interest in the field of macroeconomics or finance, this is a great way to explore that interest in a relatively stress-free manner (with enough help from Professor Fair and the TA to make it work!). The small class size really facilitated learning, and also allowed me to be more engaged in class discussions in general than I might have otherwise been. Professor Fair does cold call at times though, so make sure to stay on top of the assigned reading for class! Overall, a hidden gem!",
                "Yes, I recommend this class to another student, especially if they want exposure to macroeconomic research and also to research in general. The applied focus of the class is great for giving students practice with how to conduct research."
