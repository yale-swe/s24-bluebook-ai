                "The course was strong in that all the lectures were very well prepared -- there were lots and lots of media examples which was helpful. Personally, I would have liked to see more use of coding throughout the semester since we were taught it during every lecture and only really used it in the final project. I also thought given the small size of the class, more discussion could have been possible.",
                "The class lectures have a lot of content and have very interesting examples from the news articles, videos, and journal articles. If you are taking the YData class along with it, lots of topics will overlap. Some of the homeworks are quite difficult and annoying as they require you to find examples in media and journal articles of certain statistical methods, which can be hard to find. The Homeworks are quite easy if you pay attention in class and reach out for help. Professor Donoghue is quite a fair grader and you will get a good grade if you put in the effort.",
                "The strength of this course is the manageable workload. The weakness is that lectures focused too much on looking at media examples that were also covered in the textbook  I wish we spent more time actually covering the statistical background. I also wish we'd looked at more complex research examples  I feel like I only know how to interpret very basic analyses."

                "I would if you want to sediment your understanding of stat concepts that are at a fairly basic level -- if you've already taken 1+ 100 level stat class there's going to be a fair amount of repetition. However, you do a lot of it through a media lens, which is great if you're interested in the media or journalism. Also, the professor makes sure to ensure that students understand stats concepts on a real theoretical level and not just a computational level which is very useful.",
