                "The course's strengths are probably that the class is small so that it is easy to engage with the professor, and the lecture notes are very clear, and move along with a textbook, which helps a lot.",
                "This course, despite a small class size, is pure lecture. Engaging students more in class, like by having them work through practice problems, would be helpful.",
                "Very mathematically rigorous course, which is good for those choosing to take this course. Perhaps more routine computations as exercises or during lecture would be helpful. The two pset drops were very helpful, as well as the fact that psets were graded on a 0-3 scale (eliminated stress over minor details, which was really nice).",
                "As someone not particularly fluent with math prior to enrolling, the math 120 pre-requisite is a little bit misleading. In fact, most of my time I spent learning the math itself using other resources. Having finished the course, I dont recommend taking this until after math 250 or the math 230 sequence unless you want to spend a lot of time learning math unrelated to Econ.",
                "Strengths: The course was organized and was run in a timely efficient matter. The expectations were pretty straightforward in terms of weekly psets and a midterm\/final.\r\nWeaknesses: It is unclear what is expected of students in terms of how to write and structure proofs. There were no clear guidelines or instructions given at the beginning of the course and there was little feedback on psets to indicate how students were doing.",
                "Strengths: Very in depth and proof-centric. There is a continuous logical progression to the course materials.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It is sometimes difficult to grasp why we would like to explore some particular concept until after the fact."

Unfortunately, I found the lectures to be unclear at times and learned the majority of the content through reading the textbook on my own. This class also struggles from similar frustrations of many classes (the professor uses different notation from the text book, the problem sets have unsolvable errors, TA hours are spent learning corollary topics rather than clarifying lecture).  Ultimately the course is not recommendable, but is still somewhat manageable, with straightforward exams and decent organization.",
                "Should only be taken by people with sufficient command of concepts from introductory economics. Experience in mathematics is not enough.",
                "Yes if interested in a much more solid foundation of microeconomics, but I recommend you take either math230\/231 before or introductory analysis or related courses that cover beginner topics in point-set topology and analysis beforehand, as you need to use the notions of continuity, convexity, etc. to describe agent behavior in microeconomics.",
                "If youre comfortable with working with math and vectors and are looking for a more rigorous introduction to micro theory, yes.",
                "This is an extremely difficult proof-based courses and I would honestly not recommend this course to another student unless you have a strong desire to spend hours studying economic proofs. The course moves at a fairly fast pace and there are high expectations for students to learn a lot on their own. The psets and exams in this course are also very difficult, even if you understand most of the lectures. At the end of the day, not sure what utility this course will provide.",
