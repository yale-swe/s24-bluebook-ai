                "As a student who had little previous knowledge about Lusophone Africa before enrolling in Professor Machava's course, I learned a lot through this seminar over the course of the semester. I learned how to analyze European colonialism through a comparative perspective, as well as how to interpret how empire impacts the present day through studying historical memory in Portugal, Mozambique, and Angola. Most importantly, however, Professor Machava encouraged us to conduct firsthand primary archival research in the archives. In conjunction with the weekly response papers, this class taught me how to synthesize a large amount of information quickly in order to draw cohesive conclusions about the past.",
                "I learned about various aspects of colonial and post-colonial Lusophone Africa.",

                "I loved how immersive the discussions and other readings were. It was occasionally difficult to get through all the reading, but its definitely worth it when you get to participate in active discussion.",
                "The strength is that it is engaging and interesting to read about. I believe I have gained a lot from the class interms of dissecting articles and books.",
                "The strengths of this course was definitely Professor Machava's instruction. Beginning with the first week, he questioned us on each of our points during class, encouraging us to go deeper with our analyses and tie our claims to the historical evidence. He was incredibly helpful for expanding the way I think historically and the methods I use when conducting research. I especially appreciated the open question format that guided our group discussions. I cannot think of any tangible weaknesses for this course except that I wish I had received a little bit more personal guidance on my final research paper and response papers throughout the semester. I think it would have been helpful to have deadline markers for the paper throughout the semester because it was easy to get caught up in the minutiae of our weekly response papers rather than focusing on the bigger picture of our term paper. We also didn't receive much personalized feedback on our response papers.",
                "Strengths: Professor Machava, the readings. I think the course could be improved by incorporating more survey-level/broader foundational content into the history of the regions, either through reading or lectures.",
                "Benedito Machava is a treasure and it is well worth getting to know him and his areas of research, which mostly focus on post-independence Mozambique."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! I have taken both a lecture course and a seminar course with Professor Machava, and he is a fantastic instructor who really engages with his students to encourage them to dig deeper into their analyses. Moreover, the content of the course is fascinating, and I greatly enjoyed the course readings we read throughout the semester.",
                "Especially if you have no prior exposure to studying colonialism in Africa. The Portuguese case study is a useful one for thinking about colonization on the continent more broadly. The class has a lot of great primary sources that gave color to the independence struggle"
