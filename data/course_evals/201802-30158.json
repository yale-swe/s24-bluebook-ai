    "I learned a lot about the region's recent history. Given that these events in the former Yugoslavia happened relatively recently, they typically do not make it into high school level history courses. I had not had a lot of exposure to Southeastern European history, and so this level of immersive learning was incredibly fulfilling, although at points emotionally challenging given the devastating nature of the genocide and war.",
    "I learned about the Bosnian genocide from first hand accounts, documentaries, lecture, and readings",
    "You learn a lot about the Bosnian Genocide, a topic that is rarely discussed outside of the context of Southeastern Europe. While traveling around, it was very interesting being able to connect what you learn in the classroom to the real world.",
    "Not only did I learn about ethnic cleansing and conflict in the Yugoslav Wars, but I also learned abou religious tensions and wars and global involvement as a whole.",
    "Detailed history of the Balkans and the challenges of the future.",
    "I learnt so much about the Bosnian genocide and its social, economic, and political repercussions on the Balkan area, particularly Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia.",
    "Through this course I was able to learn how to apply my knowledge from class, and readings into real life situations and conversations, as well as how to critically analyze current events that are still up for debate today.",
    "I was able to learn about a subject that I was incredibly unfamiliar with. The course was eye-opening, and I am so glad that I have a better understanding of the Balkans and the former Yugoslavia now.",
    "We learned a broad history about the Balkin region and some of the social and religious dynamics."

    "My favorite aspect of the entire course was our trip to Bosnia. Learning about the genocide and then actually visiting Sarajevo was an incredibly interesting experience. I actually would have liked to have spent even more time in Bosnia, because while Dubrovnik can feel overwhelmingly touristy, Sarajevo felt more authentic. Overall, I loved the course and came away with a much better understanding of the history and culture.",
    "Strengths: the Croatia trip is unlike any other opportunity at Yale. Dean B has created such an AMAZING course and trip in Dubrovnik that has been so so valuable to me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was little accountability to how much we learned. I also felt the final paper was very rushed. Perhaps the long weekend should be before the Bosnia trip, and then we have more time in Dubrovnik to really flesh out our papers and give them proper attention",
    "It's wonderful.",
    "The strength of the course were the excursions and how we learned directly from communications with those involved in the break up of Yugoslavia. A weakness might be the limited class time, but I think we all learned more from the excursions and conversations we had.",
    "It was a very interesting course because the messages were very powerful and the hands on experience of being able to see the effects on the region made the lessons much more impactful.",
    "Strengths were lots of hands on experience with seeing what we were learning first hand. Also the readings were extremely helpful to understanding the class.",
    "strengths: straight-forward, comprehensive overview of the genocide- the perpetrators, victims, and reconciliation.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was the Professor, Dean B. because she cares so much about the material, the area, and us."

    "Absolutely. This is a fantastic way to learn about Southeastern Europe, explore a new city, and come away with two credits. Dean B is so nice and easygoing.",
    "YES!!!!! A million times yes, it is not a stressful course and you have a lot of fun and meet new people!",
    "Definitely. I learned a lot and it was very easy to digest.",
    "Yes I would! Dean B is not only a fantastic Professor, but also a great guide and leader throughout the whole course. I learned so much from her and had a wonderful experience.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was interesting to learn about the incredible times.",
    "Absolutely, I learned so much from the class and from the excursions. It changed my point of view and opened my eyes to many new cultures and peoples.",
    "Yes, it was an incredible opportunity to learn about the Bosnian genocide, something I knew very little about before this class. I feel as though I want to be more informed about world genocides and how they started\/ why\/ and what can be done to prevent such violent and brutality in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to any interested person. The course is interesting, extremely well taught, and the opportunity to be engaging in the local culture outside of the classroom is an opportunity that no one should pass up",
    "yes!"
