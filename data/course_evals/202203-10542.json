                "I developed an appreciation for Opera and an understanding of some musical terminology.",
                "Essay writing skills, how philosophies can be reflected in the style of music",
                "A really good grasp of general structures in opera from 17-19c, and how their structural shifts reflect differences in philosophical thinking over the time periods we studied.",
                "Lot of knowledge about opera and the operatic tradition, also how opera is involved with philosophy",
                "I learned so much in this class. As someone with a background in opera, I took the class hoping to learn more about its history. Not only did I learn about its history, but I learned about its intersection with philosophy, its technical development, how to look at its individual parts and understand how they come together to make the whole. I learned how to listen to opera with a more informed ear, and I cannot wait to revisit my favorites to see what they sound like after having gained so much insight!",
                "Watching and analyzing classic operas, as well as dissecting their philosophical undercurrents",
                "The class introduced me to many operas, both famous and less well-known. It also gave me a sense of the chronology of opera, how the medium changed throughout history, as well as. basic history of  aesthetics.",
                "Learned a lot about selected philosophers and their views on music, and opera from all viewpoints. When talking about opera, we covered the formal musical devices used by the composers, as well as the impact the opera had on society by reading non-philosophical texts.",
                "How people study philosophy, how people study opera, how the philosophies of a time affect the operas its composers produce, how operas influence philosophers",
                "Gained a lot of knowledge of the philosophical works and operas discussed in class. Learned how to engage with texts and analyze them with an unconventional medium.",
                "Writing papers which challenge synthesis across seemingly unrelated topics. I also had to learn how to read passages quickly, searching for the main points."

            "comments": [
                "The strength of this class was its organization. We never bit off more than we could chew and spent a healthy amount of time unpacking each reading and opera. I really enjoyed that this class aimed for depth rather than breadth. I do wish it was more of a seminar style though, because it felt like we covered a lot of topics that merited more class discussion but there wasn't space for it in the course.",
                "Great class discussions, good reading selection, good opera selection, great instructor.",
                "Strengths: great class discussion; topical/relevant readings; good amount of work/work always felt purposeful; engaging operas; a true introductory course for non-music students.\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Tomlinson is a dynamic speaker, but sometimes we would get off track during discussion; there were no established office hours--I would have really liked to be able to drop by and discuss operas outside of class more frequently; essay feedback could have been more specific.",
                "I found that Professor Tomlinson has very strong opinions and is not always amenable to students that ask questions or challenge his notions. At various times he would snap at students that asked questions he viewed as irrelevant. I felt this did not create a very welcoming learning environment. Additionally, I found the paper feedback to be very lacking. The strength of this course is that Professor Tomlinson has deep knowledge of and passion for opera and selected excellent productions for the class to watch and enjoy.",
                "I loved how the teacher would sing the opera to us at the piano and engaged us throughout the class with discussion",
                "Best course I've taken at Yale so far. If you're interested in music as a subject of history, this is the class for you. The professor can feel a little intense, but if you're simply not an idiot then he will like you. The only weakness I can think of (and this was so minor) is that sometimes the subject of the night's readings will take two classes to unpack, so we'll be a bit behind in terms of class discussion. Professor Tomlinson is one of the smartest philosophy and music professors out there.",
                "I really liked how each lesson Professor Tomlinson recapped the readings and engaged us in discussion because it helped me understand all of the texts on  much deeper level. There were a few texts that I wouldn't have gained half as much from if Professor Tomlinson hadn't explained them! I also really enjoyed that Professor Tomlinson showed us versions of arias from different productions, sung by different singers, interpreted in different ways because it gave a more 360 viewpoint of the things we studied. I also loved that Professor Tomlinson played out themes and sections of the operas on the piano in class because it helped me zero in on the things he wanted us to hear, so that I knew what to look for when watching the opera itself. I am biased because I love Carmen but my only improvement would be that we spend one more week on Carmen and get to write an essay solely devoted to Carmen ;)",
                "Strengths: Professor Tomlinsons engaging lectures and expertise, the operas themselves (which are a must-see). Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, well-selected operas.\r\nWeaknesses: class time would have benefited from more structured time for dialogue, and better lectures. course felt stuck between a lecture and a seminar.",
                "Strengths: Prof Tomlinson attracts people spanning the range of musician to philosopher/humanities student, and it makes for diverse viewpoints in discussion. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n\r\nIt was sometimes hard to follow the structure of the lectures, but to be fair the lectures were extemporaneous.",
                "The biggest strength was professor Tomlinson. If you get a chance to take any course with him, do it. He has a luminous intellect and his lectures, while manic, are a treat--packed with brilliant insights and connections (about musicology, music theory, staging, art history, philosophy of art, of history, metaphysics, orientalism, psychoanalysis, what have you). Another strength was the syllabus--the four operas we studied (Don Giovanni, Tristan und Isolde, Carmen, Simon Boccanegra) were all beautiful and different and philosophically rich. \r\nOne weakness of this course is that there aren't enough writing assignments, and much of the non-reading work is watching the operas, so if you lose motivation at any point, you're on your own to develop accountability mechanisms. I think this course could benefit from weekly \"reading quizzes\"--for the operas, not the readings--to make sure that we've actually watched and paid attention to the shows. This would have engaged me more, at least.",
                "As a student with no musical background, this course was was easily accessible and helps students learn about musical theory through classroom discussion.",
                "The professor's passion about the topics engaged the class and the discussions were extremely thought-provoking. However, sometimes his passion lead him to spend significant chunks of the class time answering tangential questions. This time was so significant that the teacher had to cancel many of the readings near the end of the year so that the class could stay on track. This is much learning lost in my opinion. Additionally, Yale Course Search lists this class as having \"no prerequisites.\" However, as much as I enjoyed this class, I am convinced that I would have learned much more had I taken an introductory philosophy class. In fact, I believe I was one of only two underclassmen in the class. Most of the students were upperclassmen philosophy majors, making it difficult to find common ground for discussion. As a final suggestion for improvement, I would mention that this teacher was not great at clarifying his prompts for the papers. Many students would stay after class to ask him clarifying questions and would leave often feeling more confused than when they entered the classroom. Moreover, his comments on my writing were, while well-meaning, often confusing and harsh. My writing did improve in this class, but only because it forced me to write about foreign topics, not because of his feedback.\r\n\r\nAll things set aside, this course has provided me with unique perspectives which are not available in mainstream academia.",
                "It might be nice to either have more regular office hours or have more regulated checkpoints before an essay is due to help with their development. Also, I wish that the prompts for the essays were available more in advance to the essay's due date, like at the start of each opera's section so we could think about the prompt as the unit progresses."

                "I would hesitantly recommend this class to another student if they love opera and have knowledge about music. This will probably be a frustrating class for people who are interested in philosophy more than opera or who dont have a musical background.",
                "Yes, I thought this was a really fun course!",
                "I would absolutely, but I think you have to really lean into the music-nerd thing.",
                "Yes, you would learn a lot in the class even if you do not have a musical background",
                "YES! It is rather a niche course, but for anyone interested in opera, philosophy, or classical music, I would say this course is a must. It's not only that I learned a lot in this class, but also that the things we read, the connections we drew were so niche and specific -- I consider myself someone who is able to teach themselves things well, but I would not have known to search for these things on my own.",
                "Absolutely. This is the perfect course for more analytically minded writers to engage with the fine arts. Professor Tomlinsons expertise and insight on both the music and philosophy are unmatched",
                "I would, but there are likely better courses to introduce one to opera. If you want something that will also give you some basic history of philosophy of aesthetics, the course is good for that.",
                "Yes! Whatever your background it, this course will deepen your understanding of music and the selected philosophers. Tomlinson is passionate about the material and is easy to engage in after-class discussion.",
                "If you're an opera snob, I'd definitely reccomend this class. If you're into musicology, or nineteenth century European philosophy, I'd recommend it. It's definitely a niche subject, but it touches on a lot of pretty bit philosophical topics. I can't speak for philosophy majors.\r\n\r\nIf you like to talk a lot in class then I probably wouldn't recommend the course--professor Tomlinson likes to keep a throughline going in his lectures, and if you add in your own musings--and he doesn't see them as relevant--he might shut you down in a firmer way than you expected.",
                "If the student is a philosophy major or has a strong background in philosophy, I believe they would really enjoy this class. However, take the \"no prerequisites\" with a grain of salt. This class will be EXTREMELY difficult for those who are deciding to take this class as music lovers who do not know anything about philosophy.",
                "Yes absolutely, but only if they understand the course they're taking. If you think this is a class where you can make breeze through the material and make things up in your essay, or even if you pay attention to all the material and just think you can write the essay at the last minute, think again. If you're very passionate about opera or want to learn about a very niche topic from someone that cares a lot about it, then yes definitely take this course."
