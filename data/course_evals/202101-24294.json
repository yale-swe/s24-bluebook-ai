Also theory behind cultural sociology and related debates, recent publications that measure culture in various methodologies, and how to apply all of this to your own project (and your own novel dataset).",
                "This class taught me how to analyze qualitative data in a way to make connections, see trends, and make inferences and arguments based off of those connections and trends. This is incredibly useful for the sociology major because it gave me a method to analyze work that could be applicable to a number of other classes as well as thesis work. We also learned, more generally, different methods to use to analyze data sets and when each method is most useful and applicable.",
                "This course provided an in-depth introduction to the use of data science methods for \"measuring culture\" and understanding the complexities of meaning-making in social contexts. I developed skills in coding in the R language, finding and analyzing data from computational and sociological perspectives, and interpreting academic research related to this \"formal\" approach to social science. I discovered that the methods of data science are readily applicable, often surprisingly straightforward,  and powerful tools for sociological inquiry.",

                "Strengths include the instructor and TF. Daniel was a great instructor and always led incredibly thought-provoking class discussions and lectures. Jeff was super helpful as TF and led really productive sections that provided help with the labs. The course content was another strength, particularly for people interested in studying culture even with no background in R or data analysis.",
                "This course dealt with a lot of interesting and innovative methodological approaches. The research projects were engaging and exciting. However, a lot of the code was complicated for beginners. A little more support or perhaps collaborative learning when working on the labs would really help students understand the code at a deeper level, which would only enhance their capability to produce an excellent independent research project.",
                "One strength of the class was the flexibility it offered students in terms of how they applied class materials to their own research projects. There were a large variety of research topics that were done using the various methods learned in class. I think this is a strength because it shows how applicable these skills are and it means the class can serve students with various different interests.\r\nOne weakness Id say is that there was not enough time to learn R code for the class. We were recommended to Google our questions and use the vast number of threads and other online resources to answer questions. For the future of this class I might recommend having some more specific or clearer resources available for learning R, or more comments in the lab assignments explaining what each variable/argument does so that we can adapt that code for our own purposes.",
                "This course did an excellent job at introducing students to the approaches researchers take to \"measuring culture\" through computational techniques. Classes and readings were engaging and informative, and discussion sections and assigned labs were very helpful in building skills and reinforcing key concepts. I think that a more segmented approach to assignments and projects could be beneficial for students still adapting to the R language and computational techniques, with a larger number of smaller assignments over a longer period of time. Class time could also be more clearly separated from coding instruction and tutorials, because balancing those with lectures on theoretical content and discussions of class readings proved difficult.",
                "The course was overall fantastic, with very little room for improvement in it's nascent stage. I think that one thing that could be improved is more time to discuss the read material, and more facilitation from the instructor to force people to speak."

The sections for the class were really helpful and allowed us time and space to ask technical questions that we didnt have time for in class. Also, the professor, TA, and ULA were all very gracious in offering any assistance needed in clear and helpful ways. \r\nI think my only challenge with the format of the course was that it was so late in the day, but that couldnt be helped.",
                "The use of Zoom, with its chat function and breakout rooms, proved very useful in the course. As most work was done on computers, the class translated nicely into a virtual setting. Occasionally the formatting of lecture slides meant that they did not translate easily onto canvas for later viewing by students, which can be improved for future class."

Incredibly thought-provoking readings and lectures/discussions, great way to learn basics of R and the different ways to measure datasets of cultural phenomena, and awesome flexibility on the project to work on something you're truly passionate about. Balance between readings, theory, and code was spot on. Bonus points if you've taken SOCY 202 Cultural Sociology--this course is a quasi-part 2 and is a great bridge to contemporary techniques of studying culture, particularly in the digital domain. Highly recommend for every SOCY major to take--there will definitely be something in the course that relates to your interests!! (Plus it's a QR!)",

Additionally, this class offers so much freedom to explore topics youre interested in and apply the skills you learn in the class to the things you find most engaging.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning new ways to approach social science research, specifically combining computational methods and the study of culture. Students should be prepared to take time adjusting to and practicing the R coding language if they aren't already familiar with it, and understand that they will get out the course what they put into it.",
