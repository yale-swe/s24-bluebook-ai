                "I became a much better writer and critical reader of fiction and religious texts. The course focused on works of science fiction from the last eighty years and religious texts going back thousands of years and scholarship on them. I became much better at reading them all, understanding them, being able to relate them to each other, and have discussions where I could present and defend my views and also ask questions. The class did a great job of showing how you can take something, for instance religion, and apply that as an analytical tool.\r\nI also worked on refining my style when writing analytical literature essays. I also spent a lot of time organizing and revising my work, something I had not done much in high school. This class was a great avenue for that and I felt I got a lot of support on all of those.\r\nFinally, I just really enjoyed the opportunity reading a lot of science fiction that has been on my reading list for a while, exploring some new texts, and reading religion that I had not been exposed to previously. The class combined two interests I had in a way that made me really excited to explore more in college. Beyond exploring my own interests, I really enjoyed learning all about my classmates experiences in both science fiction and religion which was super rewarding and helped me feel more connected to my classmates.",
                "I learned a lot about writing from this course. As my first writing course at Yale, it introduced me to what a college-level essay is supposed to be. It affected the way I write in a very tangible way. The writing skills I learned in this class also helped me in other classes I was taking concurrently, and I think they will definitely help me in the future too. I also learned a lot about critical thinking and analysis of ideas, all of which will also be valuable moving forward.",
                "I learned to hone my skill in argumentation, be more detailed in my analysis of materials, and discuss original insight during class.",
                "I learned a lot about different religions, and also how to think and write about genres and stories on a meta level.",
                "Learned a lot about religion as a basis for social systems as well as the portrayals of religion in science\/speculative fiction. Developed technical and argumentative writing skills; writing clearly and concisely, with an awareness of breadth vs. depth, was emphasized.",
                "Lots of knowledge on sci-fi and some religious history from this course. Writing skills were developed. Many insights into the intersection of religion and sci-fi.",

                "The class overall is very strong. It moves quickly which means you cover a lot of texts and it is very interesting to learn about them all. You get enough depth to understand them, but sometimes I wish you would spend more time on something, but I felt we did at least have one class dedicated to each topic which was nice. Class was also conducted in a variety of larger and small groups discussions with both open conversation and more focused questions which I loved. We also had some interesting visiting professors.\r\nThere was also a lot of feedback given for writing projects. Both Professor Doerfler and our TA Amanda were available to discuss every paper and offered very constructive feedback both during the writing process and as feedback. \r\nThe one thing to improve is sometimes a week will have a lot of reading, and sometimes there would be very little. This was simply because every text and its supporting articles were assigned together, this sometimes led to a lot more work one week than the next. There would typically be forewarning for longer books, but it would be nice if some of the scholarly articles were actually assigned earlier.",
                "Professor Doerfler and the teaching fellow Amanda were extremely knowledgeable about science fiction, religion, and writing. They were incredibly helpful with advice on writing papers and responded very quickly to questions. I think the material we read was also fascinating, but the real highlight for me was the amazing teachers. I think the reading assignments were sometimes a little excessive, like basically having two nights to read a 400 page book. The length of reading assignments in such a short time frame is the only thing I would change about the course.",
                "This course was honestly fantastically detailed and intentional. I do not have any critiques.",
                "It's a little bit difficult at times to have great discussion because we read a lot and often I found it hard to distill a lot of my thoughts into our short classtime. That's mainly because it was online though. I enjoyed the discussions and reading cool religous\/sci-fi texts, and you just have to be careful about pacing reading in the class.",
                "Strengths: material was very interesting. Connected together a lot of relevant themes across texts (both technical ones and fictional ones). Discussion was very captivating. Weaknesses: more clarity on work expectations would have been helpful. For example, assigned essays could have had clearer guidelines\/examples.  Pacing of work can catch you off guard as well. Typical reading is about 1 book a week. Workload itself was manageable, but some guidance\/forewarning in the beginning of the course regarding pacing would have been appreciated.",
                "Professor Doerfler is excellent at leading and facilitating discussion and very knowledgeable in both the realms of science-fiction and religion. I received good feedback on much of my work, which was quite helpful.\r\nAt times the reading schedule created circumstances where we had to read far more than was comfortable but with time set aside, and preparedness for the difficult weeks, the reading was still quite manageable.",
                "Very strong on content. The seminar discussions could be improved a lot by encouraging students who dont talk as much to engage. Some of this may be due to the limitations of zoom, though.",
                "High reading workload expected - intense but manageable. The conversation led by Prof. Doerfler was always very insightful. I was never bored in class."

                "Yes. This was my favorite class I took this fall. I am planning to be a STEM major, and as my one more humanities focused class, it was perfect. I have always loved science fiction and I loved getting to just read more for an English class. I have also wanted to learn more about religion, and this class was everything I could have wanted with that with both intense background, reading of core texts, and incredibly informative lectures. I also feel like I improved a lot as a writer, even coming into Yale as a relatively strong writer. I was able to focus on my weaknesses and get a lot of feedback. Overall, if either of the topics for this class interest you, I would take it. I would caution you that it is a lot of work. If you want to do all the readings (which you should because they are fascinating and well-chosen), it will take several hours for every class. The three papers also require a little bit of time if you want to do well on them, but I felt they were very worthwhile investments of time. Also Professor Doerfler is amazing and nice and interesting and just a joy to be in class with, so please take something with her.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wanted to learn about writing and was up for a class with a bigger workload. The class would likely be interesting to someone who didn't know much about religion or science fiction. There was a large gender balance in my class, with 8 boys and 1 girl, so I would also encourage more girls to take this class.",
                "Yes I would. The subject matter is very interesting, and the readings are extremely enjoyable even outside of an academic context.",
                "If you're okay with reading a lot, and are remotely interested about a good cursory view of religions in a somewhat more interesting\/cool context, then I think this class is good for you.",
                "Yes - very interesting material; course is well structured; thought provoking. Workload is a bit heavy but manageable.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this class. It was by a wide margin my most enjoyable class this semester if difficult at times. Professor Doerfler lead the discussion well and did a good job of making sure everyone had a chance to speak (even amid the difficulties of a virtual seminar). I suggest you be aware of the reading load, however, because if you have other classes with lots of reading or very large p-sets it may be difficult to handle.",
                "Definitely if you like sci fi!",
                "I thoroughly recommend this course as it is both interesting and fun and explores an important area of literature that is often neglected."
