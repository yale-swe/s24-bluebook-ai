I also enjoyed the free writes at the beginning of class and the opportunity to write creatively in the final assignment. Another strength of this class is that the professor was always willing to have individual meetings to discuss our work. \r\nOne aspect of this class that I feel could be improved is knowing what is expected each week. Often the homework was posted on Friday or late in the weekend for a Monday class, which made it difficult for me to prepare sufficiently.",
                "Strengths: good analysis of academic writing \r\nWeaknesses: sort of inconsistent in the idea of what was wanted from us in our writing, it felt like the standards were somewhat all over the place and the essay prompts were open-ended, which was hard because it was hard to know what to strive for in our essays. \r\nA lot of small articles were read for homework which didn't allow there to feel like there was a strong thematic throughline to the course and the class was small which meant that the same person always dominated the conversation every single class, more of an effort to diversify the kinds/formats of discussion would have been helpful",
                "Strengths: feedback is clear and concise.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some readings were not associated to beauty at all and the homework assignments were posted way too late."

                "yes! professor jones is very helpful and a wonderful instructor. she's very flexible with meetings and is always willing to help. the material was interesting and didn't assume any prior knowledge in beauty/art, which was great as someone who isn't very artistic or knowledgeable in art history. the readings were diverse and changed the way i view beauty in media and advertising.",
