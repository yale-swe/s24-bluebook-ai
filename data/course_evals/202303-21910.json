Perhaps could have more focus on engaging with the (optional) readings at the beginning of the semester so everyone is on the same page of general background knowledge; it was unclear how many students knew (or didn't know) the names of the instruments, because the readings were optional. Attendance was also sometimes an issue, which caused the in-class rehearsals to be missing certain parts / sounds.",

It just felt good playing music, learning instruments, and seeing the progress that we made in such a short time. And the melodies are so soothing! But if you are lucky to get into this course PLEASE SHOW UP EVERY TIME...ON TIME. It's only once a week and doesn't require much outside practice, so you should be able to fully commit to this, not withstanding emergencies.",
