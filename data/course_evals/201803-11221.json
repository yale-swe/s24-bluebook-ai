    "I got a good overview of global affairs, from the middle east to current day issues",
    "I learned that to understand the present and have a hand in the future of a country, you must understand its past. I learned a lot about US interference in the Middle East that I had not known before and learned that we, as a country, need to learn from our mistakes. This class taught me that there are so many issues under the umbrella of global affairs that cannot necessarily be separated from each other and must all be considered in my attempt to understand the way the world works and how I can play a part in improving it.",
    "Knowledge of the world",
    "Gained an insight into the world of global affairs and how different events around the globe have affected\/continue to affect world politics",

    "I gained a lot of general knowledge about current world politics as well as a little experience in debate and policy building.",
    "In this course, I learned about international relations theory and current global issues. I heard various perspectives at approaching these issues, how they were caused, and what countries are doing right now to fix them. I am very interested in this class, and the topics are very interesting; we talked about the Chinese economy, the Yemeni humanitarian crisis, and the Russia\/US debacle.",
    "I learned a lot about current conflicts in the Middle East and their historical pasts in the first half of the class. In the second half, we studied some of the more general topics of the globe. With regards to skills, we wrote three different types of essays with specific prompts and themes that helped me to build a diverse writing skillset.",
    "I don't think that I really became knowledgeable about any one topic during this class (except maybe Iraq), but I did get a sample of a lot of different issues and subjects within Global Affairs. \r\nI also was able to practice writing a policy brief, and proposing recommendations in the final presentation.",
    "broad overview about recent global events- cool to hear very personal experiences\/testimonies about said events",
    "I learned a general knowledge of global affairs. There is a heavy focus early-on surrounding the Middle East so I gained very specific knowledge in that regard. However, later on in the course, we do move on to other parts of the world.

    "Learnt to write policy memos, use primary sources from the real world to write essays.",

   "comments": [
    "i loved the speakers each was so interesting. I also loved when the professor would explain concepts because she is so smart and experienced. I thought that she could have done a few more lectures even though the speakers were so cool.",
    "The course is heavily focused on the Middle East for the first half and then a flurry of other topics for the second half. I would have liked if we spent more time on more topics instead. However, Professor Sky is an amazing lecturer and her lectures were my favorites. She's extremely talented and knowledgeable about her field. Her guest lecturers helped me to decide which courses I'd like to explore in the future and were equally knowledgeable about their fields, although my interest varied.",
    "Most things are taught in the american perspective, its almost as if sometimes the nstructors forget that Yale is a global institution with international students.",
    "Strengths are that it's exactly what is promised - a gateway to the global affairs major. Seems almost like an advertisement for the major though. I wish we'd have spent more time delving into certain topics and discussed them in greater detail. Also wished we'd heard more from Emma Sky herself - she's so cool and this is one of the few opportunities we get to take a class with her at Yale. We also could've received better or more feedback on the papers.",
    "Strengths were the variety of speakers and hearing real-world speakers almost every week. Section was also a perk! One issue is it expected you had background knowledge on the Middle East, which I did not have. This left me confused at times.",
    "Maybe instead of a midterm, do 3-4 policy essays. The 40% midterm can kill your grade if you don't kill it.",
    "I really enjoyed the guest lecturers and the readings. I would have loved to have more opportunities to craft policy like we did for our final.",
    "The strengths of this course are the guest lectures, the topics, and section discussion. However, I really didn't like the long readings we had with each speaker. One time we had to read a 74 page research paper before the class (WHAT?!)",
    "Strengths:\r\nGuest Lecturers\r\nThematic elements\r\nProfessor Sky knows the reality on the ground\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nAccess to Professor Sky",
    "It was fascinating to hear some of the guest lecturers and Emma speak, but I feel that some of them dumbed down the material they were talking about.\r\nAs a sampler for global affairs, the strength of the course is that it allows you to get a sense of which subjects you may want to learn about and which you may not find interesting, but, on the other hand, you obviously don't get much depth into any subject. \r\nA strength was the final presentation, which allowed for creativity and research, but a weakness was that we only spent a week on China and a week on climate change, whereas we spent almost a month and a half on Iraq.",
    "Strengths: the TAs are were great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the information presented in this class was much more basic than I expected; I don't think I learned very much. Part of the problem was  how many different areas we tried to touch on, instead of focusing anywhere for depth. I suppose I should have known from the course description and syllabus, but, as a first year, I couldn't tell that this was going to be the case. Having different lecturers for each class was hit or miss; I wish Professor Sky would have led more classes, since she has a lot of experience we could have learned from.",
    "strengths: breadth of course, cool to learn from first person testimonies\/experts in the field, Emma Sky is so cool (would have rather just taken a smaller class with her as the professor) \r\n\r\nweaknesses: disconnect between lectures, the final paper and presentation felt very random (not related to most of the class), some of the guest speakers were not organized\/seemed like they did not prepare much, grading seemed somewhat subjective",
    "The strengths of this course are definitely the guest lecturers as well as Professor Sky herself. They are able to make this course truly special and allow for greater understanding. A weakness would be the intense readings that many times felt unnecessary and also that some guest lecturers are clearly not as prepared\/experienced as others and thus the quality of each lecture can vary drastically. I think cutting down on some of the readings and balancing out the quality of each lecturer is a good strategy to resolve these weaknesses.",
    "The lecturers were hit or miss.",
    "Too America centric.",
    "Strengths: really good lecturers and an enjoyable work flow. \r\nWeaknesses: A bit too easy not not be engaged. Would recommend more hands-on things.",
    "I really enjoyed the sections and lectures, as they were both fresh and interesting. The only thing I would change is to have more student interaction during the lectures.",
    "I learnt the most from this course from doing the readings, which were varied and fairly unbiased. There were a few guest lecturers who were especially insightful and engaging - Aleh Tsvinsky and Omar Sharif come to mind - and I appreciated the effort to bring several difference voices into the class.\r\nI believe that a course that attempts to provide an \"introduction to global affairs\" is inherently prone to two pitfalls: either it focusses too singularly on one topic or region (and thus is not truly \"global\") or covers too much, very superficially. Unfortunately I think this course to some extent did both of these things.\r\nThe first half of the semester focussed entirely on the Middle East with a heavy focus on the US (and, to a lesser extent, the West in general) perspective of those affairs. This seemed to pander to a US audience, which I recognize must be the majority given Yale's location, but I felt that this narrowness undermined the attempt of the course to teach global issues. The second half of the semester covered a range of topics. These topics were heavily weighted towards those directly related to the US and especially US national security - for example, a lecture on \"Russia\" was actually a lecture on US-Russia relations and China was largely framed in the context of the US-China trade war. Unfortunately when handling topics that were not directly related to the US, a degree of ignorance on the part of the class was assumed, resulting in a highly superficial discussion that was largely just based on very generalized, basic facts - the lecture on Conflict and Justice in Africa was a prime example of this. \r\nI would argue that the assessment model further entrenched this narrow perspective and hindered students' active engagement and opportunity to learn from this class. The midterm papers were too short for students to be able to properly discuss and critically analyze their ideas, and the assessment criteria did not encourage students to extend themselves by doing further research and engaging with current affairs beyond the scope of class material. These elements would have allowed students to broaden their perspectives and also would have allowed them to engage with the matters most important to them: it is essential to recognize that students take this class from a wide range of fields and interests and it would be ideal to allow them to explore these in their assessments beyond what is able to be covered in class. The assessments were also very narrowly defined in their real-world application: the \"policy\" assessments were restricted to the US government and the UN, and thus prevented students from exploring other mechanisms to create change (such as technological innovation summits or community-based organizations and projects). Allowing more innovative solutions would have definitely broadened the scope for students to engage in a more realistic and less US-centric approach to global affairs.\r\nI also felt that the assessments were too leniently graded, resulting in a lack of constructive criticism. I did not feel that I really learned anything by doing the assessments; instead, I simply regurgitated information and opinions I had been fed in class.",
    "Strengths: Really fascinating speakers and reading materials. Discussion section was usually very engaging. Not high stress or pressure. \r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures didn't dive in very deep and felt like a very shallow analysis of a topic.",
    "The guest speakers were fantastic, but I wish I could have seen more of Professor Sky in lecture.",
    "Having many people talk about many different things which dont particularly relate is kinda confusing",
    "This class is a really fun survey class that is quiet easy without much workload, but since it is so much of a survey class, sometimes the course lacks a central core. I learned a lot, but at the same time I feel like I didn't. I really wish professor Sky would have taught a bit more rather than relying on sometimes great (and sometimes mediocre) guest speakers.",
    "Incredibly light workload. Lecture attendance is pretty much optional.",
    "strengths - structure, guest lectures, assignments\r\nweakness - the final was very different from what the course emphasized",
    "The course spent way too much time on the Middle East at the expense of important topics like the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America etc.",
    "Strengths are the speakers 100%. Most were fascinating, but a few (especially the climate change speakers) were a little bland.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few more smaller assignments could improve the class, but really enjoyable.",
    "The course changed too much - final essay became presentation and essay. There was not enough information given about the workload before the shopping period ended. This change meant my reading period was a lot more intense than i had planned.",
    "Strengths were that we had a diverse range of topics to discuss, and that section was interesting and beneficial. This course could be improved if perhaps the first two essays were due at different points in the first half of the semester rather than together, and also if we had more lectures by Professor Sky herself. Most of the lecturers were great, but some were more engaging-- and I wish they could have come more than once.",
    "The final project was awful.",
    "Loved the diversity of content, but the professor herself was rarely part of class. Each class we had a guest lecturer, and the professor spoke maybe during three lectures over the course of the semester, and she did little to connect one lecture to another.",
    "Some of the guest speakers could have been less American or Euro centric....",
    "Strengths: variety of topics and guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: classes are a bit incoherent and are not well thought out after the midterms",
    "Better more coherent speakers with slides and important details noted",
    "The strengths are the interesting material and great lectures, and the presence of a discussion section to help with the material. It does feel like the discussion sections could be made longer.",
    "Strengths -- Sometimes we had interesting speakers. Weaknesses -- Many flaws. If you want an A or A- (through effort and hard work), I think you should avoid this class. In my opinion, there wasn't too much of a connection between knowledge\/good work and the grade you receive. Many students said the same thing.",
    "Strengths: the guest speakers are really cool, Emma Sky is a super cool Professor and definitely someone whose life experiences you want to hear about. Weaknesses: lectures could be boring, the only grades you have are the midterm and final, which was kind of a strength because it meant the class was pretty low stress most of the time, but could be stressful around those times.",
    "Strengths are the engagement and bringing in other people to share their perspectives, weaknesses are that classes did not always seem to connect",
    "Strength was all the guest speakers that were extremely impressive.",
    "Some of the guest lecturers were a little boring but thats the nature of a class that covers many topics.",
    "Lots of interesting speakers were invited to speak.",
    "This course is a very basic and entry level course, but at times it felt discombobulated. Most lectures were guest lectures on independent topics not related to a larger concept. This meant that some lectures were pretty bad wile others were fascinating. I appreciated the casualness of the class, but it could have had a stronger stucture.",
    "This course is good because it allows you to get a feel for which professors and topics most appeal to you. But its weakness lies in never going very deep in any particular area. If there had been better framing to tie all the topics together, it would have felt less disjointed.",
    "Strengths: amazing lectures and lecturers, fascinating topics. Weaknesses: touched on so many topics in a shallow way that I'm not sure what I learned as a whole+ assignments could've been connected to the material better. Could use more rigorous structure and leadership from the professor, and perhaps less guest lecturers. Readings were too much and often never came up in class or section, would be better to have less readings per class that will be referenced in lecture and discussed thoroughly in section.",
    "The strengths were the way in which the lecturers constantly changed, but that didn't guarantee good and clear lectures.",
    "Since this course has new lecturers basically every class, it is very up and down. Sometimes the lecturers would be great and engaging such as those on the chinse economy and nuclear proliferation. However, more often than not the lectures would be bland and somewhat pointless. I wish this course had more lectures from Emma Sky covering the history and present situation of places like the Middle East. I thought all of Emma Sky's lectures were great, but we only got around 3 of them the entire semester!",
    "strengths: interesting, good lectures, professor sky is very engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: didn't go very in depth with particular topics, didn't learn to analyze things on my own very well, no incentive (like tests or quizzes) to retain information from lectures",
    "Strengths are the professor! Professor Sky was amazing. I learned a lot from her and her guest speakers. Weaknesses was that sometimes readings were not relevant to what was discussed in class and the midterm and final didnt have that much guidance.",
    "The guest lecturers are often disorganized and some are irrelevant to the course.",
    "This gives a somewhat shallow introduction to all of the topics covered and focuses mostly on the Middle East; therefore \"Global\" is a bit of a misnomer. Some of the lecturers were brilliant (ex. the one on nuclear armament) and some were less so. I am glad that I got a deeper introduction to the history of the Coalition in Iraq, however. Emma Sky is also great.",
    "The speakers really bring the course alive and make the classes very exciting.",
    "There is way too much reading. No one ever did the readings (which was very clear in discussion section) because they were boring and far too long. I was disappointed to see that Emma Sky only taught a few lectures. Instead, older, boring professors came in to teach lessons during which most of the class did not listen. It got to the point where people didnt even feel the need to come to class. I was disappointed by this class because I expected it to be incredibly interesting (as I am very interested in Global Affairs), but I was bored during every lesson.",
    "A strength is that its a great introduction course and accessible for all students. However, some of the lectures were not engaging and felt unnecessarily broad.",
    "There was essentially no structure, which was part of the appeal, but also caused many students to disengage and not really participate at all.",
    "I really enjoyed the opportunity to listen to various speakers. They were really interesting and added a different perspective to the material.",

    "Yes. It is a class that introduces what is happening around us.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is particularly interested in the Middle East or open to learning about it or would  like to take a survey course on global affairs. The other topics include US relations with Russia, China, and climate change, but they are not stressed until the end.",
    "Yes, it opens someone's mind about what is going on in the world.",
    "Yeah, but probably just to a first-year who's looking to decide whether they want to major in global affairs or not.",
    "Yes, if you want to be more well informed and know about world issues from the people who work on them directly, this class is a must.",
    "Absolutely. Take it if it fits.",
    "I would! I found it gave me a base of knowledge on global politics and sparked my interest in fields of study I otherwise would not have pursued.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend! This course is wonderful, in that it creates well-informed Yale students about current global issues. I loved interacting with others from various places in the world and hearing perspectives that differ greatly.",
    "Yes, because it has something for everyone, whether one wants to major in Global Affairs or simply wants to take an interesting class.",
    "Yes, if you want to explore a lot of topics and hear cool people speak then you should take this class. However, don't go into it thinking that you'll really be able to learn about something because it is a bit spread thin.",
    "I would only recommend this course if the student has very little prior exposure to what's going on in the world for the past few decades. If they have kept up with politics at all, something more challenging would be more worth their time and energy.",
    "Yes and no. If you want a broad\/surface level overview and hear diverse world fellows speak...then yes. This would be a good class. However, if you want a deeper understanding of the topics (although the middle east was covered very thoroughly), I would recommend taking a smaller seminar or a more specific lecture class. I think this class tries to cover too much. The workload is pretty low so it could be an interesting fourth or fifth class.",
    "Yes if you truly care about global affairs! It also is great if you want a baseline for this information without a super heavy workload.",
    "If you really need a social science gut, take this but beware that there is both an oral and written component to the final. If you do not like withstanding section and a whole lot of superficiality, please do not take this course.",

    "Yes!!!",
    "Yes. This introductory class really hooked me on global affairs and foreign relations.  If a student is interested in any sort of major involving foreign relations, this class is a must.",
    "I would recommend this course to only one specific kind of student: a student who felt they were completely ignorant of global affairs and international policy. I would not recommend this class to any student wishing to learn more about global affairs from a truly international perspective, any student wishing to learn more about solutions to global affairs beyond US and UN policy, or to any student who would like to engage with any specific interest. I would encourage any student considering taking this class to consider very carefully whether an introductory class in global affairs is likely to produce meaningful learning opportunities for them.",
    "If you are looking for a relatively stress-free intro class to learn about some interesting issues, then yes.",
    "Yes, if you are passionate about global affairs go for it",

    "Yes! Great instruction and extremely interesting regardless of one's interests.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "No, this class does very little to develop any skills or teach anything beyond cursory knowledge of the Middle East.",
    "Yes! Especially if you like listening to smart people talk. And especially if you are at all interested in global affairs.",
    "Absolutely. Great introductory course.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to become more literate on global issues. Although it is a very first year-dominant course, I think anyone would benefit from hearing the lecturers and learning about current events and conflicts. Section is actually interesting, as we often had debates and also free discussions. The lectures weren't the most engaging lectures I've ever been to, but I would recommend actually going to them in order to get the most out of the class.",

    "Yes, it is a very fun class and insightful to international relations",

    "This class was a bad experience for me. I would not advise you to take it. I perceived it to be disorganized, and a LOT of work, with three 5-page papers and a group presentation. To me, it seemed as though there was not much of a connection between knowledge\/good work and the grade you received. There were a bunch of flaws I had never before encountered in any other class (three five-page papers with vague topics - and 2 of them are due the same day, a group presentation with unclear instructions and grading criteria)...",
    "A great intro class!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who wants to gain an understanding of mostly the Middle East and exposure to cool lecturers with all different kinds of experiences.",
    "Yes, this course taught me a lot about very relevant issues today",

    "Absolutely. It  was an incredible way to learn about the world's current condition. I also think it is so important for everyone to be aware.",
    "Yes, for first years.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class, but only if that person has space in their schedule for something less serious. Some of the lecturers and their stories are really interesting and it was a great privilege to hear them speak, but the class as whole felt like it didn't have much fo a direction.",
    "I think its a cool class to take first year, or as something to attend interesting lectures for. Beyond that its not a class meant for developing deep knowledge or understanding.",
    "Yes, purely for the amazing opportunity of seeing all the guest lecturers.",
    "Yes if they want to understand what the big picture of how our world works.",
    "Honestly, no. There are definitely countless other courses I wish I took. I thought this was going to be a good introduction into global affairs and global politics in general, but found the class to be of little value. I recommend simply taking a more concentrated class on something you're interested in and exploring the major of global affairs in a different way.",
    "yes. for an introduction into an area Yale is very strong in.",
    "Yes! Great intro to global affairs and the middle east.",
    "If you're looking for a gut, take this one.",
    "This course offered interesting lectures and informed my opinion on whether I plan to apply for the Global Affairs major. It is not, however, a class where one learns a whole lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student as understanding the global issues give us a larger perspective.",
    "This course will not improve your writing. The assignments are random and unclear. The lectures are meant to be interesting because they cover very interesting topics, but I found them super boring. Take this class if you want something incredibly easy but unfulfilling because you can get by without even going to lecture.",
    "I would. Its very interesting and relevant.",
    "Absolutely.  Amazing class I think everyone should take.",
    "This is a great way to explore different international issues and get a sense of which areas of study you are particularly interested in. I would recommend this class to a first-year student.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are searching for a foundational understanding of world happenings and are okay with not having as much Professor interaction. I personally really did love this course, perhaps due to my section especially.",
    "yes because it helped me tackle tough topics"
