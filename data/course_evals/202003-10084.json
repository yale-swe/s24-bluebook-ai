I think I developed a more robust understanding of Back feminist theory, reproductive justice, as well as medical anthropology. The readings and discussions were both enjoyable and stimulating.",
                "As I am a student of architecture, this course helped me to understand many of the women's reproductive health issues in the US- especially for the black and brown women. My book review skills have improved vastly and my general writing skills also have improved thanks to this class."

                "The class is very well structured, so it would suit students who are interested in having highly organized seminar discussions. The assignments are likewise well organized, with a blueprint available for each book review. The ethnographies are well-selected, though I do wish there were discussions of aspects of womens health that are not always about their reproductive health.",
                "The course is excellent and the diversity of topics that we covered was really great.  I think that finding an ethnography about queer womxn to read as a class would be a great addition, but it seems like that's more of a problem with a lack of existing literature than with the class itself.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting course material, Professor Inhorn obviously is very interested and knowledgeable on the subject matter, and her excitement also seeps into the course. Everyone has the opportunity to go into depth about their more niche interests by leading seminar for a day. \r\nWeaknesses: The grading seems a little harsh, but the comments are all very useful nonetheless.",
                "This is a very strong class and its highly interactive sessions (with student presentations and dialogues) were very helpful in reviewing our readings."

                "If you are premed, this course should be a requirementthere's no excuse for going into medicine without knowing about the history of the system you're stepping yourself into and the ways in which that system has harmed and continues to harm women and minorities. Even if you're premed, you should take the class anyways because Marcia is an incredible professor who cares deeply about the students and about the material she teaches.",
