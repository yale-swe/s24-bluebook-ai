                "STRENGTHS: Professor Soles' Hamlet reading. The syllabus. WEAKNESSES: Professor Soles is a genius, but sometimes seminar felt more like lecture than seminar. Sometimes he came in with a particular sections we would close read which made reading the whole text seem like an unnecessary task (particular to Milton). I think Soles could give the students a bit more speaking times, and allow us to lead the seminar vibe. Also feedback was incredibly extensive and more comprehensive than any other DS track, but it took many, many weeks to receive it.",
                "The reading is somewhat onerous, and, from time to time, it will detract from your ability to interact with and fully grasp the texts. Otherwise, DS is flawless.",
                "Strengths: essay writing, feedback, clear interest in students, office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions can feel fake, pretentions, sometimes it feels like Professor Soles is only looking for one right answer even though discussions about literature should not have only one right answer.",
                "Overall very good, Professor could work to appear more genuine",
                "The themes of imagination, desire, and freedom were coherent throughout the whole course, which was an incredible framing of otherwise disparate texts. Some texts, particularly Hadji Murat, Omeros, and Raisin, were not contextualised enough.",
                "I enjoyed class discussion and discussion posts.",
                "Strengths of this course lie in discussions with classmates who read the text from all different perspectives, and the seminars teach you to advance your critical thinking. The structure of seminar is really important to creating a learning environment conducive to conversation that involves the majority of the class rather than just a few individuals speaking for most of the time, and I think that could be improved upon.",
                "Strengths: wonderful seminar, probably the best out of the three DS courses\r\nWeakness: Book selections were sometimes strange, like Raisin on the Sun and Petrarch"

Now I see the world through literature. Also WOOLF AND PROUST!!!!!!!! Please trust the process and take second sem DS. For Soles' semianr, I wrote some stuff in the strengths and weaknesses section.",
                "How can you leave Yale satisfied, as a first-year, if you didn't take DS? The answer is simple: you cannot. DS is a personally fulfilling, academically thrilling, emotionally trying, and radically life-altering program. It will push you past your limits and unleash what was previously undiscovered potential. Do it. Take the leap of faith. Trust the program to guide you through your first year. You will not regret it. (And if you do regret it, which you won't, you can always drop second semester).",
                "I would recommend prof. Soles to students who want to not only read the DS texts, but also learn about the nature of writing literature. Also take this class if you are looking for a very personal approach.",
                "Yes - Soles style can be very off putting but he is a smart and passionate professor from whom you will learn a lot",

                "Yes",
                "Yes! I personally really enjoyed reading the more modern texts, and I think that this course does a great job building a literary foundation to situate each work in. A lot of the course is up to how much you want to put in to reading and discussing the works, and I think that the literature track can be more personally moving than the other tracks.",
