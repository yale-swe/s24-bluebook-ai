   "comments": [
    "Prof. Chang is a huge strength. He is very good at explaining concepts even though they are very difficult. He is a wonderful person and always is willing to help in and out of class. He really cares about all the students. Another strength are the psets. They get pretty hard at the end of the semester but I think they are relevant to what we learn in class and also to what appears on exams.",
    "The content!! I genuinely feel like I developed a deeper and more sophisticated understandings of the idea of statistical analysis through this class. Also Professor Chang writes such detailed solutions and notes, which really help with learning the material. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor Chang is absolutely lovely and super knowledgeable but in my opinion not the most engaging lecturer",
    "Content was very interesting; learned how to use pretty powerful tools for analysis. Challenging course though, especially in the earlier parts if calculus skills are a bit rusty",
    "This is a great course! It covers many relevant topics to Bayesian statistics and provides a solid basis in R. I don't think there's anything that needs to be improved in the course itself.",
    "Strengths: Joe Chang is a sweetie. He really cares about this course (he wrote his own textbook for it!), always posts lecture notes and is a pretty good lecturer himself. Learning statistics from a Bayesian framework was also pretty cool, and it's a great intro class for people with some math background. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures go pretty slow, and lots of times we spent like 40 minutes breaking down 50 lines of code. The end of the course also felt a little messy, and I wish we could've covered some of the things he mentioned in more depth.",
    "Strengths: Syllabus is great, learn a lot of stuff and can actually use all of it. Seeing the final at the beginning would have been extremely intimidating, but we could actually do it by the end\r\n\r\nStrengh\/weakness depending on how you look at it: My engagement in the class was one of my lowest at Yale. I never went to lecture, just looked at the slides and notes. Those were very good, so it wasn't difficult to keep up with the material",
    "I learned most of the information through office hours, so having more office hours earlier in the week would be fantastic. I enjoyed lectures but often wasn't the most engaged during them.",
    "This class is fine. The lectures cover what they need to; the homework has some entertaining questions.",
    "Unclear lecture slides",
    "Strengths: Well-structured and taught, good support system with TAs\r\nWeaknesses: Slightly fast towards the end",
    "Strengths: 2nd half is awesome. Learning about Monte Carlo Simulation and a couple of ways to execute it (both in theory and in R) is really, really cool and not something I'd learned in other stats courses. With this, I really feel as though I have a tool I can use in summer and post grad jobs that relate to field of statistics. Also provides a really great explanation of Bayesian Statistics and what exactly that means (Prof Chang's frog model is really awesome in that regard and it remains a constant throughout the semester)\r\nWeaknesses: 1st half. We whip through some intro probability and some miscellaneous stats concepts (like counting problems) which don't have a ton of relation to the second half. We go through these very fast, so you don't really get an true understanding. If you really want to learn probability take SDS241. I think most of the first half should be taken out so we can focus on Bayes and Monte Carlo, and then add in some other more advanced, related topic(s).",
    "Joe Chang is a lovely guy who makes excellent lecture notes. My main criticism is that class lectures were mostly spent intensively covering simple theoretical concepts, while the toughest part of this course is applying those concepts to practical problems and scenarios. That means that psets were largely tougher than they needed to be, but you do walk away from this course with a lot of knowledge.",
    "Strengths - all notes are posted online and the class notes are good. Material is well structured and taught well.",
    "While I really appreciated the content of this course, when it came to problem sets and exams I felt incapable of completing them without a lot of help from TA's and copying the notes, and I know a lot of other students were in the same boat. It made me feel like I was being taught the material at a much simpler level than I actually needed to know and understand it.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Chang is a great professor. His course notes are amazing and are the only resource I really needed to get through the class. Psets were actually pretty fun, although I only really understood them weeks after I had done them. Grading was very fair (and very generous) and many resources were provided to study for the tests. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a bit dull and most\/all of the material seemed to be in the course notes already. I appreciated this though because it meant I could get more exposure to the material.",
    "I think this is a great course. However, I do think it can be marketed as more challenging than it is. The class does not have any statistics prerequisites, which I think is fine, but I think students who have not taken a previous statistics class should be seriously discouraged from taking this class. This class was the first statistics class I had ever taken, and I found it quite challenging and ended up taking it Credit\/D\/Fail because of it's unexpected rigor.",
    "Strength is material but weakness is explaination of material and how difficult the psets are",
    "Strength of the course was in the professor and the textbook (which he wrote). Professor Chang is really nice and seems to care about his students (go to his office hours!). His lecture slides and textbook are also written very clearly and provide good ways for explaining the concepts outside of class. I really underestimated how much work the problem sets would be though, and I think that having 9 problem sets + take-home exam at the end was really exhausting. Maybe the length of the assignments could be cut down for future iterations of this class. Alternatively, if the length of the assignments are to remain the same, I think that the weight of the problem sets on the overall grade needs to be increased (i.e. maybe 30%).",
    "I didn't personally connect with Professor Chang's teaching style, but he provide plenty of opportunities for students to boost our understanding outside of class. The problem sets were generally very difficult. I could only complete them with a lot of help. I would suggest providing some more simple practice problems so students can understand basic concepts before moving on to the hard stuff. His notes document was great, tests were fair, and problem sets did aid learning. I liked the use of gradescope for grading problem sets as well because it gave us individualized, clear feedback.",
    "The course was designed to teach basic R computation in conjunction with statistical theory. Both parts complemented each other well, and Prof Changs textbook is absolutely well-written. However, it is definitely much much harder for a person with completely no computing background, so I thought extra computing help earlier on in the course might have been helpful.",
    "Good teacher (Prof. Chang) and interesting although challenging PSETs.",
    "While the course material is interesting, it was taught in a very confusing manner that made it extremely difficult to understand the material without significant work outside of class.",
    "This course was challenging but I felt that I learned a lot in terms of how to perform methods by hand. I think that we could have had better instruction in the R stuff, especially with JAGS.",
    "The course is extremely well-structured. Although the material is pretty challenging, there is a ton of resources available for additional help."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I slightly hesitate to recommend this class because it is very difficult (in my opinion). Prof. Chang does as best as he can to explain topics well and the class notes he provides are fantastic, but it is still quite confusing at times. The midterm was especially difficult. After having taken the class I do feel that I have a better understanding of what statistics is and how it is used in the real world, but I don't necessarily feel confident that I can apply what I learned outside of class. Nonetheless, this class is required for a few majors and is usually an alternative to S&DS 241. If you haven't done S&DS 230, then 238 is a great choice because there is a lot of emphasis on R as well as probability theory.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to students in the social sciences who are serious about performing careful, justified statistical analysis. It's so easy to just focus on the output that you've been told you should be looking at; understanding how exactly the whole inference process works gives me a lot more confidence in things like model selection.",
    "Learned a lot of useful and applicable statistical analysis skills. Also was interesting to learn from the Bayesian point of view",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in statistics with an emphasis on probability! This was my first calculus-based stats class ever, and I thought the material was very digestible and interesting. I do think it is good to have some sort of background in programming, because the course doesn't go into the basics of it, so students are expected to understand what are different variables, how to implement different loops, and how to use logic operators.",
    "Yep! A great class for STEM people looking for some stats to fill out their schedule. It's not too much work, there's more than just a retread of intro stats and I feel comfortable using R now. A good deal if I've ever seen one.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn the material nothing wrong with it",
    "Make no mistake, this class is hard. But it can also be rewarding. I personally would have liked to learn more techniques for data analysis, BUT I understand that's not quite the point of this class, and there are other courses at Yale to take for that. If you're more interesting in computing\/R, as I was, then maybe this isn't the perfect fit for you. But I'm still glad that I got a chance to learn statistical theory.",
    "I would recommend this course to any statistics student interested in dabbling in algorithms and the computing aspects of probability. I learned a lot of practical information from 238.",
    "Absolutely great if you take Cr\/D. If you're looking for a good stats class that will give you practical skills that you may use in a STEM-related field, absolutely take this class. It's not an insane amount of work and the pay-off for that resume is good.",
    "Yes. It is a good introductory course that allows one to dabble into data analysis and statistical\/probability theory.",
    "Overall yes, even though first half really isn't good.",
    "If you want the real deal on probability theory and statistics, you will get it in this class. 241 is certainly easier and fulfills some of the same requirements for certain students, but 238 applies probability theory to statistical concepts in the second half of the course, which is interesting, cool, and something you don't get out of 241. Honestly, for any students even vaguely interested in the subject I'd say it's worth it. The psets can be tough since Joe Chang spends class covering theoretical concepts instead of how to apply them, but office hours are useful. Also, I would recommend knowing some R (or any coding language really) before doing this course -- most people do know some R, and the psets are significantly harder without it.",
    "Would recommend as an introductory stats\/probability course.",
    "Despite the fun challenge of the material, I found it hard to remain engaged throughout the semester  it's a big lecture, and lecture tends to be much more rudimentary than the problem-sets, which can be frustrating. I also found that I underestimated the amount of time that each pset would take me to do. I \/would\/ recommend this course to someone, but only if they have a truly motivating reason to take it (like: curiosity, research, desire for challenge, love for statistics, ...). Ultimately, I was a put-out by how many peers seemed to rely on getting answers in office hours to do psets, but I am happy with the new perspectives and understanding that I've gotten out of the course.",
    "Yes. Great class to learn about Bayesian statistics. Very useful stuff for nearly every field of study.",
    "This course was very interesting and really changed the way I look at probability and statistics. I feel like the concepts are very widely applicable and I will build upon them in the future. It was also nice that it was combined with computational application so that we could visualize and contextualize the purpose of these concepts. However, the problem sets were very difficult and required a lot of time each week, both just thinking and in office hours.",
    "Yes!! This class is a great introduction to a variety of statistical concepts, and I think if anyone wants to learn about probability\/statistics in one class, this one is probably it. I feel that I learned a lot. You'll also get to use R for simulations, etc. Joe Chang is a great professor as well. I'm glad that I chose this class over 241 because I think I'll be more prepared for other S&DS classes.",
    "I would only recommend this course if the student is seriously interested in the Bayesian analysis offered by this class and is ready to work quite hard every week to complete the psets.",
    "Yes. Definitely need to keep up with work and learn throughout the year rather than cramming.",
    "It really depends on the student. I somewhat wished I had taken 241 instead just because I underestimated how much work this class would be. There are 9 problem sets + the take-home exam, which is a lot in my opinion. The psets alone take 7 - 10 hours on average, and they all required me to go to multiple office hour sessions throughout each week in order to complete them. I found the midterm exam to be pretty hard, even with studying a lot for it and going over practice exams. I thought that the final exam was a little easier, but I also studied a lot for it. The material in general is certainly not easy to understand, and it requires you to really spend time with it outside of class in order to get a grasp on everything. This class definitely drained me, but if you are willing to put in a lot of time to understand everything and do the assignments, I think it is pretty rewarding, as I certainly feel like I learned a good amount about what Bayesian statistics entails. Professor Chang is also great, and he was a deciding factor that convinced me to stay in the course. All in all, I think that the course is good, and I would recommend taking it as long as you are fully aware of the work that you are getting yourself into.",
    "Definitely! If you are interested in statistics beyond the intro level, you should take this course.",
    "I would recommend it as an introduction to R and statistics, but I also think any student thinking of taking this course should manage expectations. Although its touted as suitable for people with no prior background, the learning curve is certainly steep and work must be put in to really do well and grasp the concepts.",
    "Yesvery interesting material in my opinion.",
    "No, there was a very brief overview of a lot of topics that didn't really make sense",
    "It was engaging fairly well taught but very challenging - psets took me at least 5 hours each week.",
    "Yes. Professor Chang is simply amazing. I very much enjoyed every lecture and all the problem sets-extremely well-written and not redundant at all."
