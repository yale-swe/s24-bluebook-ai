                "Strengths: good intro, all around course\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes unclear & slow",
                "I liked how the labs were adapted for a virtual environment, lectures were very relaxed\r\n\r\nI tend to like learning from a textbook and this course didn't have that so it would have been nice to have some more organized lecture slides\/notes uploaded to Canvas for the second half of the course",
                "The course explained all fundamental areas with equal importance and drew connections which helped me understand them better.",

                "If you take MENG 280, the second two-thirds of the course is just a general review. In the first third of the course, we went over everything too quickly.",
                "The labs in this course were very engaging and the assignments were interesting but not overly-long, which I appreciated. I felt like this course was taught at a pace that expected us to have some experience with material properties, but I came in having none and it took me a little while to get comfortable with the topic because of that.",
                "The course is a little bit scattered but that is given as a warning in the beginning. The way it was separated into 3 different modules was helpful though to keep it organized.",
                "Keep it like it is! Loved professor Dollar and Vatsal!",
                "Strengths of this course include the labs which were engaging and generally covered the real world applications showing how the class applied to everyday objects. Some weaknesses of the course include the lectures with example problems. These lectures were generally more freeform and occasionally the example problems would be skipped or the steps would be drawn live virtually so the lecture slides when looked back upon didn't show the work. A way to improve this could be having a solution plan in mind or pre-written on the slides so there's not as confusing of an example."

What could be improved are the example problems in the lectures which were hard to follow as they were drawn on the Zoom whiteboard.",

That said, the course content is a little dry and the professor does not seem to care much about teaching it.
