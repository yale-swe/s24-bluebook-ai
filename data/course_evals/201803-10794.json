I learned the emphasis of relative status in the polite\/humble forms of speech, and the in-group out-group concept. I am able to fluently write the hiragana and katakana scripts, and have learned the 75 kanji required for this course.",

    "not much",
    "This course provides the structures and vocabulary needed for basic Japanese fluency. I have interacted with fluent Japanese speakers and been able to simply express my ideas in Japanese. I was surprised at how relevant every word and form we learned was for basic conversation.\r\nUnfortunately, this class moves very quickly, and even though I was committed, I did not have the time to fully learn all the material presented. I picked up most of the key points, but I was not able to spend time doing speaking drills or additional listening practice simply because there was so much.",
    "It is very fast paced and having a heavy schedule can pull away attention that needs to be dedicated towards the class for success.",
    "Very demanding but not necessarily a bad thing. Wish was infrastructure in place that would make missing a class feasible. For example, had I fallen sick last semester, I STILL would've gone to Japanese because the thought of missing this class was frightening.",
    "I felt it was quite fast-paced in terms of learning the lessons. I also felt that concepts could have been ingrained more."
