    "Good guidance by TAs.",
    "The sheer number of post laboratory assignments, and the crunched time frame made it difficult to devote the necessary time to the actual organic chemistry class that accompanies this laboratory course. With that said, the setup--the experiments, the course packet descriptions, etc. were great.",
    "Clearer feedback on reports.",
    "The only weakness is that the procedures were sometimes vague. This was a minor issue, because most of the procedures were very well laid out. Overall, the class took a difficult subject and made it understandable."
