We talked a little about good style and form for writing but I think it was mainly just more practice. I really enjoyed the discussions that we had in class and because of the small size, it was a very comfortable environment to speak up.",

It's a great introduction to college essay writing in a low-pressure environment, with topics that are genuinely interesting to learn about and a professor that will be really patient and encouraging with you and your writing. The workload is completely manageable, and the seminar-style makes for really fun discussions and a warm atmosphere that you can look forward to every day.",
