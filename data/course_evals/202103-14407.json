                "Learned about neoliberalism which was definitely something I was unfamiliar with before.",
                "learned about reproductive politics, expanding reproduction discourse outside of abortion and sex",
                "I learned how to be a better reader of nonfiction and a better analyst of primary sources. I developed different ways to synthesize information that work for different learning styles. I developed a clear timeline of the rise of neoliberalism, as well as of different movements and phenomena related to reproduction in Latin-America, and an understanding of how those two concept are intertwined.",
                "I gained insight and knowledge about the history of nation building in Latin America through a lens of reproductive politics.",
                "This is a great course if you are interested in womens right and reproductive justice. Professor Egger included incredibly interesting material on the syllabus, including discussion on abortion, eugenics, and reproductive rights movements in Latin America. I would 100% recommend this course to history and non-history majors, as Professor Egger made discussions extremely approachable and fascinating.",
                "I learned so much about Global Health and neoliberalism. I learned how to",
                "I had never learned about neoliberalism nor reproductive politics, and I hadnt had the opportunity to take any course focused on Latin America since the past several semesters the few seminars usually offered had been cancelled or limited to upperclassmen. This class was thus especially valuable to me. I learned about all the different repercussions of the neoliberal world order and how it came to be. I also began to make connections between such seemingly disparate historical events and themes from eugenics to present-day forced sterilization against Indigenous women in Peru, to the politics of transnational child adoption, to NAFTA in Mexico, etc. I really appreciate how interconnected and diverse the courses topics were."

                "Strengths\r\n- The academic readings provided and the way that the Professor put them into conversation with each other \r\n- The professor gave detailed feedback everything we submitted, which was very helpful when attempting to improve my academic work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- The in-class discussions were often quiet and I think that students took advantage of the more relaxed nature of the class to not participate as much, or maybe even to not do all the readings. The discussions could have been facilitated in a different way, so that students participated more.",
                "Weakness: a lot of readings, and discussion wasnt really encouraged or guided well in the class. The Professor mainly just asked a bunch of questions about the reading and it felt like a test of whether we did the readings. \r\n\r\nStrengths: very interesting topics and it was great to see how different people in the class could draw on their personal experiences to add to class discussion or questions.",
                "This courses biggest strength is Professor Egger. She put together a syllabus that manages to build a solid foundation of knowledge in a quick, digestible way to make room for very specific cases and examples throughout the course, which means we left the class with not only broad, big-picture concepts, but with many detailed case studies of how these concepts have actually played out.",
                "The readings on the syllabus were incredible and informative, and the content was a major strength of the course. The course could have been improved by incorporating different modes of learning (movies, open discussion, etc.) to facilitate more discussion.",
                "Professor Egger did a fantastic job at helping her students with their writing. We were given small assignments that were designed to help us write our final research paper throughout the semester. This allowed for the final paper to be less daunting when it came time to write it. She was so eager to meet with us during office hours, and she explained the research paper process in a way that many history professors fail to adequately do. She is an incredible teacher and mentor, and I am so grateful for her willingness to engage meaningfully with her students!",
                "Professor Egger chose very thoughtful readings.",
                "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?\r\n\r\nThe main strength of this course was definitely Emilie, the instructor, and how she designed this syllabus and led our insightful discussions. She also challenged us to connect that weeks conversation to previous weeks in order to begin to see the broader themes and patterns. The writing experience in the seminar could be improved by doing peer revisions in class or presenting our final paper proposals so we could learn more about each others interests."

If youre interested in reproductive health, there are many other classes at Yale that might give you more of what youre looking for.",

                "I would 100% recommend this class to any history or non-history student!! Professor Egger is a fantastic teacher, mentor, and facilitator of meaningful discussions. I learned so much from her course and left each discussion feeling engaged and eager to learn more. The readings are fascinating and the assignments are not too difficult - just the right amount of challenge to facilitate meaningful learning.",
                "Yes, especially if they are interested in the content.",
                "Absolutely! This class improved my critical thinking, research, and writing skills immensely. Ive incorporated readings and discussion points from the course into my research with other professors and my other courses. I will also now be writing my senior thesis on a topic related to the course that I had previously never known about."
