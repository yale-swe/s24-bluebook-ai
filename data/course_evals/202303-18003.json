I woke up wanting to learn Polish at 9:25am. The professor knows how to TEACH too. I have multiple friends in other L1 classes such as Arabic, French, and Japanese. They're all DROWNING in work and do not understand what's going on because of how fast paced and work heavy those classes are... meanwhile, I'm balling out in Polish."
