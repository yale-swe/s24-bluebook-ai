    "The course gives you a good survey of revolutionary European history from the French Revolution onwards. Due to the short length of YSS, the content is not delved into in depth though.",
    "I had studied the revolutions talked aobut in this class before, but this class allowed me to consider them within a revolutionary context, interconnected to each other. I also learned a lot about revolutionary theory and common practices."

   "comments": [
    "The course was structured into two 3 hour 15 minute Zoom classes a week, where the professor started with a lecture, then discussion, then a shorter lecture on relevant media. \r\nWhile I enjoyed all the content and the professor was very knowledgeable about the content material, the long run time of the class made it pretty difficult to focus, even with a 10 minute break in between. I felt that the lecture material could also have been assigned as reading to extend the amount of time we had for discussion instead."
