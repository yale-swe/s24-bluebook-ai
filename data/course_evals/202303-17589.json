                "Worked on my historical analysis skills, especially on the final essay. It was structured in a manner i had not done before: he assigned new readings that were not done for class that we could choose between (each were organized into ~70 page excerpts) that we would read and analyze on our own. We never discussed these in class or lecture -- forcing us to think about the arguments offered without allowing our TA or Professor Semmel's analysis to affect our own. Further, each piece was comprised of multiple different authors arguing different perspectives about an idea central to the class, taksing us to make sense of the implications of the argumentative relations between their different lines of thinking. This essay was challenging but I felt immensely rewarding, and was one of the more thought-intensive essays I've written so far.",

It gave me a much better sense of what the empire truly was, and how it functioned both domestically in Britain, as well as abroad, along with how politicians, thinkers, and ordinary British people conceptualized it over time."

I might say that the structure of having the lectures be nonstop through the entire period, while allowing us to cover a great deal of material over the course of the semester meant that in class itself we weren't really able to stop and ask questions. Though, we were definitely able to do so during sections which I appreciated.",

                "I think I would recommend this class to another student, if they have a preexisting interest in the course material. I think it's helpful to know this class was fairly self selecting, with most students taking it having some sort of strong affinity to the material taught, either from a scholarly or personal perspective. If you don't find yourself particularly within this category, you are 100% able to take this course -- the material is taught so that it is incredibly easy to understand, even as it covers specifics of history you may not have heard of before, and both Professor Semmel and the class' TA always went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating -- however, I believe you would really have to find your own reason or a deeper meaning in what we're studying. It is not offered to you. This is a class that really mires itself in the data and factual information of history, using it to chronicle the importance of the shifts in the British empire, but for a regime that held such an immense impact upon broad swathes of world development and the lives of people, the class appeared to omit a clear connection to an overarching significance upon the greater course of history. I only mention this because I felt many other prominent course offer a key mode of thinking or perspective to be gained from your time within the course; here the focus seems certainly on your ability to analyze and synthesize as a historian, but beyond a route (and in depth, nuanced) chronology of the arc of British imperial history, I felt what we were meant to take from this was largely in our hands. But in terms of a class itself, the readings were well picked and manageable, assignments were fair, Professor Semmel's lectures were nice, and sections were truly a delight. If you already have an interest in the information offered, you will certainly enjoy this class.",
                "absolutely, a very fun course looking at something so important to understanding the modern world, but that a lot of americans might know nothing about.",
                "Yes! This course teaches very important global histories that will be important for your understanding of the world today.  Professor Semmel also cares about students' experiences, listens to our suggestions and needs, and tries to make exams as accessible as possible."
