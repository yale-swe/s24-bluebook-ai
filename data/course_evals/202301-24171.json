                "I gained a pretty broad survey of Haitian literature and literature related to the Haitian Revolution, starting from revolutionary thought in France with Rousseau to independence poetry of the Civil War era Louisiana. I also developed my skills of frequently asking close reading questions, consulting various types of sources, including maps, constitutions, novels, and poetry. I also gained more insight into the connections between the countries of the Atlantic World as a consequence of colonialism.",
                "I learned SO MUCh from this course. It was one of those courses that was outside of my focus of study; however, it ended up being one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nI developed the skills to write long French essays and communicate ideas more clearly and backing them up with evidence (easier done in English, but when you're writing in French everything is just more difficult, especially if you are not a native speaker like me or fluent). \r\n\r\nI developed insights about the Haitian Revolution and its significance to the history of revolutions. I also developed a strong understanding of the writers of this time -- for example, I would have never known the complexity of his story and his stance on slavery and revolutions were it not for this course. I didn't even know that his father was a general while his mother was a slave. Before this, I would have simply known him for Monti Cristo or the Three Musketeers. In addition, there are other very interesting readings by lesser known authors as well.\r\n\r\nI also developed the ability to tell between a good translation and a poor one, and strengthened my ability to read a work analytically and critically, and sharing that during class discussion.",
                "This course is a wonderful survey on Francophone literature in the Age of Revolutions. My French critical writing skills improved as well as my historical reasoning skills, and I was exposed to a lot of otherwise-understudied literature, especially surrounding the Haitian Revolution.",
                "I don't believe I developed any new skills, but I gained insight into the different trends in writing surrounding Haiti during its early history."

                "Strengths: really enjoyed how we spent around half of the seminar discussing the questions we posed, Prof. Daut is a very engaging and knowledgeable instructor, interesting to consult a variety of sources and literature, discussions in English but still able practice reading and writing in French\r\n\r\nAreas of improvement: the lectures felt a little disorganized and I sometimes felt the content of the lecture didn't match up super closely to the reading, it was difficult to get a sense of the chronology of events, final exam ended up being longer than many final papers I've written for other courses despite only being open for about 3-4 days",
                "Strength: Professor Daut is an amazing teacher, and the relevance of the topics covered in this class is astounding -- something everyone should learn about\r\nWeakness: none",
                "The seminar-like quality of this course was really rewarding. I liked how we did the readings, then had a brief lecture on the background, and then were able to discuss with the class. It was very functional for learning and absorbing the material and then forming our own opinions about it.",
                "Strengths: Interesting and often overlooked subject matter; the readings allow you to learn elements of French, American, British, and obviously Haitian history. The readings themselves are interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course couldn't seem to decide whether it was a history or literature course. It's listed as \"Francophone Romanticism\" but we didn't discuss the aesthetics of the Romantic movement nor did we analyze how these features were present in the readings. We discussed Haitian history at length but in a way that seemed to have no organization (we didn't progress chronologically, for instance, we kind of just bounced around depending on the period of the reading). What's more, the slideshows were clearly taken from a different course the professor had taught and contained far more information than was relevant to the course, which confused me. Also, in the syllabus, it was written that we would study Louisiana, and we only spent one class talking about it (this was the reason I took the course, so I was disappointed). The course structure was also a little strange. It was essentially a lecture with 30 minutes of discussion at the end, which felt very monotonous. Also the final was based entirely on a type of analysis that we had never practiced in the text. \r\n\r\nWays to improve: Either decide you want this to be a literature course and focus on the features of the literature or decide it's a history course and rename the course. Remake the slideshows so that they fit the course. I think changing the course layout to be chronological would allow us to better see the progression of the literature of Haiti. I would consider restructuring class time so that the course is more interactive and you focus on material that is relevant to the goal of the course (i.e. the literature instead of just the history). I would also rename the course so that it is truer to its content; it is more \"Romanticism in Haiti and France\" or \"Narratives of Revolutionary Haiti\" or something along those lines. I would also remake the final so that it evaluates skills developed in the course instead of requiring students to learn a new type of analysis on the fly."

                "I would recommend this course to any students who are interested in the Francophone world but want a view that doesn't put France at the center of everything and to students who enjoy contributing in class and sharing their thoughts. Prof. Daut was always encouraging of any questions and thoughts, even ones that aren't fully developed, so I felt very comfortable with vocalizing my ideas. However, since this class is taught in seminar style, you have to be willing to participate to get knowledge out of it.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone (you can take it without the French components), as I think this is a topic that everyone should learn more about.",
                "Yes! Prof. Daut is very engaging and offers great feedback that facilitates learning. We got to read texts that I otherwise never would have had the opportunity to explore.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Whether you are a French major, someone who speaks French, or an African American Studies major, or just someone interested in history, this class is both approachable and rewarding. Only one session a week so it's not too time-consuming, and you will get to read some fantastic works of fiction and non-fiction.",
                "I don't think I would. Though the professor was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable, and I am thankful I had the opportunity to learn about Haitian history, I don't think I came away from the course with new skills or a sufficient depth of knowledge on the subject to justify taking it. I would recommend it if I knew that the course had been restructured."
