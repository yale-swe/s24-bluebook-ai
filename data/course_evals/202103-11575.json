                "The course was definitely very well thought out and the readings and subject areas showed an attention to detail and awareness of the material that made the class feel very impactful and focused. I think the course lacked enough structure to help clarify class discussions, but the professor attempted to remedy this fact more later on by giving discussion questions. I think it might be better to limit the readings to allow for more specificity in the kinds of class conversations that take place, and allowing students to guide the discussion more might also help. However, I recognize that this dimension of the course depends a lot on the atmosphere of the room and the nature of those willing to discuss.",
                "I think overall, it was a really cool class. Discussions were good and we also each did a short presentation on something related to the class which I thought was interesting. Readings were a little up and down. Most of the readings we did were really interesting but there were some that were quite dense and a few that overlapped a lot. I feel like some weeks could've been balanced more with maybe one legal/dense reading and one article that was easier to read.",

I think overall, the course does an incredible amount to expand one's view of queer organizing and its history in several cultural and geographic contexts.",
                "I would! It was more narrow in focus than some of my other WGSS classes, which I think is good to know for someone considering the class. It was very interesting though. Professor Reid would sometimes get very excited about a topic and it would be slightly less discussion but that's okay.",
                "I highly recommend taking this course! It was by far one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The professor has an extensive background in LGBTQ+ advocacy and shares valuable insights during class. If you're passionate and/or interested in gender, sexuality, and their global dimensions, take this course!",
