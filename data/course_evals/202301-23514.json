I learned just how important it is to approach the analysis of systems through an interdisciplinary approach. In the case of carceral systems in particular I found that it was important to take on a philosophical, historical, sociological lens (among others) when studying them. One of my biggest general takeaways from this class has been that when living in and crafting institutions people do not situate themselves into a historical context that can help them evaluate their situations faster and potentially prevent tragedies from taking place.",

                "such an engaging class! readings and discussions were very interesting and i learned and wrote a lot. just wish there had been a class on present day united states prison system and professors were a bit more accessible",
                "This was a phenomenal course. The reading load is pretty high (though not as high as it was in the first iteration of the class), but it's an amount appropriate for a graduate course. The syllabus is well-structured and well-selected. I found that Professors Stanley and Snyder's teaching styles complimented each other well, and class discussions were challenging and engaging. I think the biggest weakness of this class stems from the relative disorganization and business of Stanley and Snyder, though that should be expected for anyone who knows them. For an undergraduate, the class can sometimes feel overwhelming given the limited guidance that the professors give about grading and assignments. That said, those logistical things are just kind of the price you pay to take this class.",
                "The syllabus was well designed and took us in a number of useful and interesting directions. I enjoyed the rapport between the professors, as well. At times, it felt difficult to contribute to class discussions and I didn't always feel like it was an encouraging environment. Still, I found the readings and course material fascinating.",
                "I think there could be increased communication from the instructors and less reading per week.",
                "Strengths are the professors and the interesting readings. Weakness was that the course felt a little disorganized at times. We never talked about the major assignments until the week before the assignments were due and due dates were never really clarified. Also, the reading load is really really heavy, so I'd just be prepared to become an insanely speedy skim reader who still retains information.",
                "Strengths: the syllabus readings. The discussions were all very fruitful. \r\nWeaknesses: I don't think we have explored enough diverse experiences of the Soviet Union and of the US. In my personal opinion, I think there were too many philosophy and philosophical concepts discussed in class.",
                "The discussions in this course were very rich and engaging and pushed me to stay on top of the material and get involved with it deeply. Professors are great during seminar, but are slightly challenging to get in touch with, so having clearer feedback on assignments would be helpful.",

                "yes! everyone should learn about our prison society",
                "YES, if you are serious about it. I devoted an average of 6 hours per week to the readings for this course, not including the three eight-page writing assignments. I think that level of engagement (or whatever if comparable for you given your learning style) is in many ways necessary for engaging with this course at the level that Snyder and Stanley expect from their students. The reading list is absolutely awesome, and even as someone with zero background in Russian/Soviet history, that portion of the class was manageable. I think that it's important that you're at least a little interested in both the USSR and the United States and not just one or the other; I found that some of the graduate students who just did Russian history, for example, only talked about fifty percent of the classes, on days that engaged with USSR-related materials. The comparative nature of this class is part of what makes it so exciting, so students should be prepared to engage with both sides. The assignments are very doable (three 2000-word papers) and fun in many ways, especially for history majors like myself. Because the course is taught by a philosopher *and* a historian, expectations for the papers are very flexible. This is a challenging class taught by two potentially-polarizing professors, but if you're prepared to take it on, you will absolutely love it.",
                "Yes. This course broadened my horizons and encouraged me to think about systems beyond mass incarceration in various parts of the world.",
                "Yes, if you are willing to do a lot of reading.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about political theory and Eastern European history!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in any part of the teachings of this course. The discussions are very engaging, and I was very motivated to get involved with the readings because there was a wide variety of type of material presented to me.",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend. The rapport between the Professors was really great and the diversity of their backgrounds really helped."
