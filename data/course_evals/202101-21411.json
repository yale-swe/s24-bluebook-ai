                "This course was a good introduction to cultural anthropology as I was able to learn about methodology, thick description, and research. I enjoyed the readings and Professor Harms' introduction to well-known anthropologists.",
                "I practiced a new way of understanding and approaching our world. I learned definitions to ideas and broad-based issues that blanket societies and learned about an anthropologist's role in modern society.",
                "The ability to observe and analyze cultures and think critically about what the observations mean for the culture rather than for me (the anthropologist in question).",
                "I developed lots of skills useful for ethnography and anthropological research, and I learned a ton of concepts helpful to looking at the field from both a constructive and critical lens.",
                "I developed a nuanced perspective of what culture is and how humans come together, and also improved my writing and interviewing skills through the fun ethnographic assignments",
                "I learned a lot about anthropology.",
                "I learned to question and think critically about the systems in every culture that perpetuate structures of power.  Learned about symbols, rituals, kinship systems, structural violence, theories of anthropology, race, ethnicity, and so much more.  Great overview to social cultural anthropology and really makes you think deeply about the cultural systems you live and work in.",
                "I learned a lot. Specifically I learned about different Anthropologists and their modes of thought, as well as why certain societal practices are the way that they are.",
                "A deeper understanding of different cultures and communities, and how they are affected by other social factors such as tourists.",
                "Anthropological theory and famous theorists; what is/how to do ethnography, key concepts like structural violence and kinship, and also insight on what you can do with an anthropology degree, even if you don't go into academia!",
                "I learned about anthropology, and how to apply anthropological concepts to the real world.",
                "A very solid introduction to social and cultural anthropology, and a new way of thinking and observing the world, that I have actually started incorporating in my every day life",
                "I learned basic anthropological concepts (anthropological theories, ideas, vocabulary, famous anthropologists, etc.) I also learned how to view the world from an anthropological lens.",
                "I learned the basics of anthropological thinking and theory, including cultural relativism (and its pitfalls), structuralism, functionalism, structural-functionalism, Marxist anthropology, and more. I also learned how to properly conduct qualitative research through the short ethnography projects, which were incredibly engaging and helped me to apply the things we learned in class and through readings.",
                "I gained a comprehensive review of the themes and topics of cultural anthropology as well as some hands-on experience with the different sorts of studies carried out by cultural anthropologists.",
                "I learned a lot about culture and how I ought to approach it. The ethnographic writings were a different kind of writing than I was used to, so learning how to observe and write from experience rather than from a text was helpful to expand my writing techniques.",
                "I learned a lot about the discipline of Anthropology. I've gained a lot of insight into what it means to be an anthropologist, and what it looks like for an anthropologist to conduct fieldwork. I learned different theories of imagining society, of nuances ways of conceiving different cultures. I learned how anthropologists in the modern era face and attempt to address the fundamental flaws with the discipline. I learned about some classic anthropologists who founded the modern disciple in the 20s and 30s in addition to reading modern anthropological works.",
                "It was an introduction to the different modes of sociocultural anthropology, and the different ideas and strategies that have been developed in the study.",
                "tools and methods for analyzing and understanding cultures, humans, and understanding the social structures related to them.",
                "I gained better critical reasoning skills as well as had an opportunity to better my writing skills, when it comes to conveying complex topics in the social sciences.",
                "So much about the world of anthropology, its application in the real world and in academic settings, etc.",
                "In this introductory course to socio-cultural anthropology, you will take a journey across the globe and engage with materials of important figures in anthropology. The course will make you think about your own engagement with your community and how different cultures interact. Even the subject itself is a matter of discourse in class, providing students avenues to use self-critiques to improve one's work.",
                "I gained an introductory understanding of what sociocultural anthropology is, with a particular focus on ethnography. I gained introductory skills on performing ethnographies, conducting interviews, and performing analysis on recorded \"interactions with the unknown\". I was exposed to many very important works of literature in the sociocultural anthropology sphere.",
                "I learned how to become an anthropologist; to notice things that used to fly right over my head, like the true meaning of work, and the importance of cultural relativism, and all of the key things that separate the anthropologist from the average individual.",
                "Learned reading and analytical skills in order to read various academic texts and ethnographies. Also learned the methods in which to preform my own ethnography including observations, interviews and surveys.",
                "Coming into this class, I didn't even know what Anthropology was. I learned a lot about the field and its methods.",
                "Anthropology has given me a new worldview. It fundamentally changed the way I see my surroundings. When I attended my sister's college graduation this past weekend, for instance, I began thinking about graduation ceremonies as a ritual process, as we discussed in our course. It has become a sort of hobby for me to analyze my world from an anthropological perspective, questioning what systems and values I can discern from the grocery store, the doctor's office, and beyond. Anthropology heightened my observation and critical thinking skills in this way, and it taught me a whole new form of writing: ethnography. As a prospective history major, ethnography is a new and exciting tool which I hope to use in my research from now on."

            "comments": [
                "I believe the breadth of readings for this course was definitely a strength. I also thought the exams were well thought out and an accurate test of my knowledge.",
                "This course brought students around the world to provide examples of societal phenomenons and issues that are applicable to multiple societies. I wish that we read or learned more about native anthropologists, or read more texts that did not come from a eurocentric colonialist view, even though historically the socio-cultural anthropology field consisted predominantly of white men.",
                "This course was fantastically taught by Prof. Harms and the TA's. They were always welcoming and able to help, and they assigned projects that were helpful for understanding the material but also enjoyable. I wish some of the readings were cut short. For a class that seemed to be an overview of a wide range of anthropological topics, some readings went in depth to the point where it felt like a lot of the material was simply unneeded, which cut time away from actual analysis/thinking I could've done.",
                "Professor Harms is very funny and kind. One potential weakness is that the readings are sometimes not discussed enough in lecture/section",
                "Strengths: The readings were very interesting and engaging.  Lectures were super fun and came in a multi-media format (listened to some songs, saw videos and a couple movies, class participation and storytelling, etc.).  The professor was very engaging and the choice of topics was diverse; we got a good taste of everything.  I enjoyed attending discussion sections.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I wished the assignments were not so Covid-centered.  Overall amazing course!",
                "The strengths was the professor who was very knowledgeable and also the very clearly structured course. I cant think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Very understanding professor and engaging assignments and sections.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of weekly reading that is hard to keep up with in addition to other classes.",
                "Really engaging and informative lectures and concepts, professor Harms and all the TAs are super nice and helpful. The ethnographic assignments were also really interesting to do!",
                "Professor Harms is an amazing person, and his passion for anthropology comes out whenever he teaches. He takes great care with words, and breaks down concepts in a way that is understandable.The readings were interesting and tied in with what was taught in the lectures, and that continuity was really nice.",
                "Professor Harms is a gem! He's an incredibly good lecturer, is deeply passionate about anthropology, and truly makes you care about the subject. The assignments are also quite fun, since they involve talking to and observing people. The readings are very interesting, though often lengthy. No real weaknesses imo, perhaps the timed exam that was a bit stressful, but Professor Harms is very understanding and tried to relieve lots of the stress.",
                "This course was very structured around student learning which was a major strength",
                "Section was most definitely needed in this course. I feel like it could have been even more discussion-based.",
                "The main strength of this course is that the assignments due are all hands-on projects that allow students to actually experience the kinds of things that a cultural anthropologist does. The class has less of an emphasis on rote memorization and more of an emphasis on actually experiencing things.",
                "Professor Harms and the TFs were wonderful. They understood that this semester was incredibly difficult for students and were so kind and empathetic. Their flexibility made the class and by extension my learning more enjoyable.",
                "The readings that professor Harms picks are fantastic and always are worth reading. Even when I was strapped for time, I never regretted taking the time to look through the readings before class because they are either quality ethnographies that challenge problematic anthropological norms, or they are critical texts which also present interesting critiques of ethnographic research. I feel like this could be a strength or a weakness, but the class feels very broad and unfocused at times. There is a lot of theory and sometimes feels devoid of tangible application. However, these moments are rare for the most part and Harms does a good job connecting the theory to the real world and telling us what all the theory he is telling us about really means in a practical sense. But it is an intro class so there is less ethnography and more theory about it.",
                "The lectures and sections were very engaging. I enjoyed being able to discuss with the professors and TAs after the lecture and section.",
                "I think the course was very engaging and in some ways always related to us either as students or humans. One thing I think could be improved would be to make the selection of readings and examples more well-rounded and global, as most of it was related to Asia. this is understandable considering professor Harms' expertise but it could benefit from other examples from Africa or Latin America as those backgrounds make up a population of students , as well.",
                "The course was so thoughtfully planned, and also adapted well to talk about different real-world events that were going on at the time.  Immaculate planning.",
                "The course has meaningful assignments that incorporate lecture content, readings, and fieldwork experiences. The professor provides clear expectations for each assignment and extremely detailed instructions. One improvement for the course is to remind students of an upcoming written assignment deadline during lecture. This reminder could just be a slide at the beginning of the PowerPoint, or on the side of the title slide, that students can see (10 seconds is all).",
                "Strengths of this course include the professor. He was absolutely brilliant and extremely understanding in a time that demanded some compassion. Weaknesses of the course would be how abstract it is. This might just be the nature of Anthropology itself, but there were many abstract concepts that all seemed very scattered and difficult to understand, and we spent more time on examples than the concepts themselves.",
                "I think one of the strengths is that we get to read, analyze, and learn about various ethnographies and cultures, which I found very interesting and always kept me engaged. I think a little more time could have been spent on the key ideas such as structuralism and structural functionalism.",
                "I found some of the earlier concepts, readings, and lectures to be a bit pedantic. It was kind of hard thinking about anthropology in the abstract. But when we started discussing real-world applications of anthropology (Investment bankers, homeless drug users, Prof. Harms experiences in Vietnam) in the latter half of the course, I got much more engaged.",
                "The strengths of this course were its curriculum and the wonderful teaching team. Every lecture was so carefully thought out and respectful toward its subject matter. Professor Harms and the teaching team were the same, guiding us with empathy through complex material in a difficult semester. The weaknesses of the course were that, sometimes, Professor Harms didn't always explain the assignment during class, leading to some confusion on guidelines and due dates throughout the semester. But these were minor concerns in an overall great semester!"

                "I think the virtual lectures and discussion sections were very successful as I was able to take the course at my own pace. Professor Harms did an excellent job of adjusting course material according to various challenges that came up during the semester.",
                "Professor Harms' cognizance of the trials of learning online during the pandemic and adjusting the syllabus as necessary was an extremely helpful. His attempt to recognize the difficulties of learning online and welcoming nature at the beginning of lecture made me enjoy the course a lot.",
                "I feel like the class successful overall, but the discussion sections were more difficult to engage in because they were online.",
                "I liked the lecture and section format, and I very much enjoyed Prof. Harms engaging us during lecture with some interactivity. I enjoyed how a lot of our ethnographic assignments surrounded COVID-19, but I felt like some of them were very Yale/student-life-centric and were therefore difficult for remote students.",
                "The course was as engaging as it could be virtually",
                "It was good that the professor encouraged the class to turn their cameras on at the beginning of class, but I think more people would if he continued this practice even at the end of the semester.  No other suggestions-- my most engaging class this semester!",
                "Wish section was in person as the sections were on the smaller side. However, we were still able to have an engaging discussion and class over Zoom.",
                "Discussion sections were really helpful for being able to meet others in the class in small groups, with video on.",
                "Posting the lectures and lecture slides on canvas was really helpful when it came to studying for the midterm and final, because I was able to go back and check to see what material I might not have written down initially.",
                "To reduce stress and workload, the professor made the final paper that was due in addition to a sit-down final optional. The professor and TFs were also incredibly engaging and understanding, and even encouraged students to unpack their feelings and understandings of the pandemic independently and in small groups throughout the course. It not only allowed students to feel more welcome in the virtual environment, but it also allowed us to understand our perceptions of the pandemic from an anthropological perpsective.",
                "I felt that the decision to base all the assignments around the pandemic was a poor one because it felt hard to connect some of the concepts to my experiences of the pandemic. The pandemic is also not even complete, so how can we get a sense of what it means for society before its fully solved and we can see how everything has changed? \r\n\r\nHarms was good about using the chat to get student engagement, especially towards the end of the semester. It was a good way for us to contribute without too much commitment.",
                "Having most projects focus on the study of life during COVID helped tie in ideas to the rapidly changing world we live in.",
                "I benefited from our weekly seminar sessions, but the twice a week virtual lectures were sometimes very hard to keep up on and remain present for. It's not so much about the content of the lectures but rather being on an online platform. it could have been more engaging.",
                "Everything was amazing.  I appreciated the amount of engagement there was between the professor and class, even though it was a lecture and on Zoom.",
                "As students in the college faced various crises throughout the term, Professor Harms acknowledged these events and provided accommodations to students with assignments. Often academics believe they are insulated from the world and act without compassion, but Professor Harms took steps to allow students to pause and reflect on the pandemic and injustices occurring around us.",
                "Practices that succeeded included his use of Google Earth. It was easier to recall the stories when we were able to look at its geographical location and talk about it through that. Practices that could be improved could be student participation - there was one point where we split into breakout rooms to discuss one of the readings we did, more of that would be really cool.",
                "I thought professor Harms did a fairly good job of keeping lecture engaging even though it was online, however there were times were I found it extremely hard to pay attention.",
                "The lectures in this course were perfectly suited toward online learning. They transferred well onto Zoom, and Professor Harms and the teaching team recorded them in order to allow students from a myriad of time zones to view them on their schedule if need be. They also offered a variety of discussion section slots for this same reason. The only weakness of the course from a COVID perspective was that, occasionally, it was difficult to conduct ethnographic study and gather the scope of data that we would have liked due to COVID restraints. Nevertheless, the teaching team brainstormed creative new means of data collection during the pandemic, from taping Zoom interviews, to conducting ethnography over email, and beyond."

                "Yes, it is nice to learn about the importance of perceptions and how to stay accountable. The professor was also very understanding and willing to work with a student with their problems.",
                "Definitely. Prof. Harms is such a joy not only as a teacher, but as a person, and all the TAs are fantastic. Anthropology is extremely useful in tons of other fields of thought as well, so if you're looking for a good all-around beginner's course, you can't go wrong here.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in understanding a variety of anthropological techniques as well as developing a strong understanding of the pros and cons of cultural relativism",
                "I would only recommend if they were interested in anthropology. This was an okay course but not really interesting unless you just love anthropology.",
                "100% would recommend for any and every student.  Every person who lives in a society/culture would benefit from taking this course.  Essential!",
                "Yes!! This is a great course to get yourself thinking about life and culture. Definitely a must take.",
                "Yes, especially if you are looking to gain a better understanding of the cultural and social anthropology.",
                "Definitely! Especially if you're interested in culture, humans, or anything adjacent; super great introductory course if you're not sure if you're interested in Anthropology too. All around wonderful class and I really think it covers some important matters that are especially relevant now (race, money, cultural difference, etc.).",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Yes!! It's a great introduction to the anthropology and is challenging enough so that you have to think but that thinking doesn't completely wreck your brain. The TAs are also super helpful with going over concepts and trying to make sure that you really grasp the material.",
                "Absolutely, I already have! This is undoubtedly one of the best courses I've taken at Yale so far, and I think these are topics everyone should be familiar with. It really makes you think of the world differently, I've found the anthropological perspective to be incredibly insightful in my every day life.",
                "YES. Professor Harms is EXCELLENT, passionate, kind, compassionate, knowledgable, and extremely accessible. The course is well-structured, interesting, and presents difficult concepts in an easy-to-grasp manner. I didn't know anything about anthropology and took this class on a whim, and I'm really glad I did! Even though I won't be furthering my studies in anthropology, having the tools to see the world and society from a fresh perspective has been really helpful to me personally.",
                "Absolutely, this course is an excellent intro to anthropology and its worth it for Professor Harms",
                "Yes! Anthropology can often get the short end of the stick from other academics, but what I really learned throughout this course was that anthropological modes of thinking are really the basis of all humanities-based thinking. I know I will continue to use the skills and vocabulary I've gained from this class throughout the rest of my Yale career and beyond. Seriously, it is so, so helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student because it allows you to understand the people around you in a different way, which is a useful perspective to bring to other classes in any other subject. It also provides a refreshing variation in the type of workload, as you will be required to do actual activities which are much different from typical homework assignments.",
                "I would recommend this course for people who are interested in international studies or have a general interest in anthropology. It defines a lot of terms that seemed foreign to me, and I got a great overview of some basic anthropological and sociological perspectives that I did not know before.",
                "YES",
                "I'd recommend this class to someone who has never studied anthropology at all and wants to get a sense of what anthropologists do and what their work contributes to understandings of the world. Professor Harms is super knowledgeable, engaging and kind, so taking a class with him is definitely worth it.",
                "Yes. It is a great introduction to the topic and provides experience in what it might be like to be an anthropologist.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! It's a great introduction to a new type of thinking about cultures and humans that changes your perspective on the world.",
                "fun intro class with minimal work, good way to knock out a social sciences credit",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone looking for a strong foundation in the social sciences or for those interested in an amazing introduction to anthropology.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Yes! Even if you are not an anthropology major, I think this course is great for any student. As a social science major, I engaged with familiar topics, such as globalization, neoliberalism, and culture, through different lenses. A liberal arts education requires engagement across disciplines, and I think this course makes anthropology accessible to non-major students. After learning about the ethical requirements for field work, the student conducts observations of their own in their surroundings.",
                "Yes, I am a self professed stem person, and this course was rather challenging for me to understand for several weeks - but when it started to click, it was extremely satisfying to start understanding the content and applying the skills of analysis to experiences in day to day life.",
                "Yeah, I'd definitely recommend this course to another student, the professor is amazing and the course teaches interesting skillsets that could be helpful in the future.",
                "Yeah I'd recommend this class. It is really interesting, and you get to learn a lot about various cultures and practices, that I had didn't really know much about. Furthermore, you learn good reading comprehension and analytical skills on top of being able to get practice doing your own ethnographies and observations. The work load isn't too bad and is mostly readings.",
                "Yes! Prof. Harms is great. He's kind of a Head Of College Type guy, if that makes sense. Especially this year, he made more of an effort to connect with us and make sure we were all doing ok. As a STEM person, this class was a nice foray into the humanities.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Anthropology is an exciting, challenging, complex, and fulfilling subject about which to learn. It teaches you to see the world in a new way, and, as Professor Harms pointed out throughout the semester, it is a self-correcting discipline, which strives to solve the very problems that, oftentimes, it historically had a hand in creating. By its very nature, anthropology is one of the most empathetic disciplines I've ever come across--and the most empathetic department. If nothing else, you must take this course for the teaching team. They are among the kindest, most thoughtful, and most passionate instructors I've ever had the pleasure to work with here at Yale. The subject matter, as well as the lessons I learned throughout the course, have continued to stay with me, shaping the way I view my surroundings every day."
