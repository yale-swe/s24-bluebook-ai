                "I learned a lot about the landscape of antiracist teaching and how to create curriculum.",
                "I learned how to apply the concepts that I had learned in previous classes (including Race, Politics, and the Law) to curriculum. I gained a whole lot from working with my teacher partner (in a math class) and learned about the multi-pronged approach that one should take when teaching math in an anti-racist way (folding practices into lesson plans, classroom management, and more). \r\n\r\nI also developed better discipline -- in terms of having the right priorities in work/school and staying accountable to my peers, my student partner, and my teacher partner. I became a better communicator, writer, and thinker.",
                "I learned about what antiracist education actually means across subjects and this plays out realistically in schools. Also learned more about what it's like ot be an educator at this specific moment in time.",
                "I gained more substantive knowledge in this course than in many other Yale courses. I learned about anti-racist teaching strategies, practice, and advocacy, as well as more technical skills of curriculum design and pedagogy development.",
                "We were really challenged to think about the different modes that constitute anti-racist teaching and to put that into practice in partnerships with real educators."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: guest speakers were very insightful; teacher partnership project was meaningful and rewarding; readings assigned were short and to the point\r\nWeaknesses: class felt very rushed sometimes because of the number of activities packed into class",
                "too much reading, would be helpful if we had more time built into the class to meet with our teacher partners/work on our projects\r\na lot of speakers",
                "I think a focus on people who are interested in actually pursuing education could be helpful, because then there would be more of an opportunity to learn about actual curriculum development. I guess this may just be an issue with Yale, but something about people who are working at Goldman Sachs next year helping create anti-racist curriculum feels really off to me.",
                "Strengths: My view is that this is one of the best classes (in terms of instruction and learning) at Yale. Unlike other classes, which teach you the theory (but leave it up to you to put the theory into practice), you learn a lot of anti-racist theory but are ALWAYS putting it into practice simultaneously. The class also brings in really fantastic guest speakers (teachers, educators, and organizers) who will transform the way that you view the world and the toolkit that you have to work on issues of anti-racism. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I was frankly disappointed in the engagement of my peers at times. We had excellent and inspiring guest speakers, but a large number of students in the class were not paying attention (which Professor HoSang and Micah noticed, and something that was perhaps even more obvious to someone sitting among the students). I think that there should be even firmer expectations laid out in the beginning of the course next year or more stringent policies about electronics and attendance. (I am typically not a fan of electronics bans in classrooms, but I thought that electronic use in non-class related ways was unusually egregious in this class). \r\n\r\nI also understand that we all had a lot going on this semester, but I wish that our conversations were more robust and that we had a little more reading required each week. It seemed like not a lot of people were doing the readings in the first place (and the instructor response was to cut back on readings) but I just felt like there was a lot of untapped potential in this class for learning (on top of the huge amount of learning that had already occurred) that could have been achieved with firmer expectations for students.",
                "I think that the course would have worked better with a bit of a smaller class size, as students could not all fit around the table which didn't help with fostering community or discussion. I particularly enjoyed meeting with educators weekly, and I loved that the class was project-based so it felt like I left with something tangible that I contributed. I wish that the syllabus was more solid, as the weekly changes meant that I sometimes worked ahead because of my schedule and then read an entire week's worth of material that was changed, but I found the readings interesting so this was okay.",
                "Overall, this course was well-organized, substantive, and enriching. There were a few points during the semester where assignment expectations were a little bit unclear, partially due to week-to-week inconsistency and a lack of grading transparency throughout the semester.",
                "The guest speakers were really insightful and helpful in sharing different perspectives as people actually currently working in education, either as classroom teachers or organizers. The syllabus also had a great range of readings and other materials that showcased a broad range of possibilities for making curriculum and classroom practice anti-racist. I do think that the class size needs to be smaller, though, since it can be hard to stay focused and engaged with such a big group.",
                "Strengths - incredible guest speakers/interviewees, excellent final project that was flexible but good hard work and required collaboration\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - prof didn't make enough of an effort to get the class to meet/know each other. this stinted our conversations every day because it was clear some people weren't comfortable, where to find assignments/due dates was SO CONFUSING!! They used a google doc and canvas and word of mouth and they just need to standardize it."

                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in education! Learning about anti-racist curricular and pedagogical practices is important, especially if you are interested in becoming a teacher. This class allowed students to contribute meaningfully to the New Haven community through the teacher partnership project. Because it's a semester-long project, the work is evenly distributed so it's not overwhelming. I appreciated the guest speakers because they were very insightful about the realities of being a teacher and of engaging in anti-racist work.",
                "no",
                "Yes! I would hope more people interested in education will take this class in the future.",
                "Yes -- one of the best, most instructive, and most fulfilling classes that I've taken at Yale. You won't find a class like this that puts anti-racism into practice in this way, and it's a privilege to do work in the New Haven public schools.",
                "If they're interested in ani-racist education, yes, though I did not always feel like the class was one that worked for people interested in field adjacent to education. I would have loved more readings that talked about how other fields could lend themselves to these discussions. I also would have loved more readings that pushed back on the concepts we discussed in class or otherwise added more nuance- it often felt like every reading said the exact same thing, just worded slightly differently, which sometimes made discussion and the readings feel repetitive.",
                "I would! I took the course later in my Yale career and was really grateful for the opportunity to reflect on my learning and contribute to others' learning. I was able to bring some of the knowledge I gained in other AFAM and ER&M courses to curriculum development for my teacher partnership. You might want to have some understanding of anti-racism and/or education practice going in, but the seminar environment is amenable to gaps in knowledge. Professor HoSang is also a must-take professor, so I strongly recommend taking one of his courses before you graduate.",
                "Yes!!!! It was an incredible course! I loved the structure of the course, the course readings, the people I took it with, the course project, class discussion, and the instructional team of Professor HoSang, the TF, and the undergrad pedagogical partner! It felt like one of the most productive and worthwhile courses I have taken thus far at Yale. The semester long teacher-partner project was an incredible and enriching experience, I felt like I was actually using what I had learned in a course and producing something practical, useful, and meaningful.",
                "Yes! It is a lot of work and can be intimidating because of the practice component in partnerships with educators. However, if you are considering a career in education, it has really important theoretical and practical concepts. We receive a lot of guidance and opportunities to collaborate, which makes the process more enriching.",
                "It definitely changed my perceptions on education and gave me some tools I can use in the classroom as a teacher."
