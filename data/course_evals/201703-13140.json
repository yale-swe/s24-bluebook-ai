    "Good preparation and guidance for writing the year-long thesis.",
    "This course, the first half of the year-long American Studies thesis, was very helpful in directing students in the beginnings of research and developing a narrow topic for a thesis. It teaches how to do certain kinds of research and the type of planning needed for working on an intensive thesis. It also provides you with a mentor who can offer advice on the process and suggestions."

    "We all found a surprising level of investment in each others' projects.",
    "Very chill group. Jorge and classmates were very very very helpful. Jorge is really great at giving feedback. Could be more clear earlier in advance about what is due when.",
    "The schedule of the class was not organized. We were supposed to meet every other week but we really didn't have a schedule.",
    "The course was helpful to keep students on track for research and thesis outlining. Overall, the independent thesis is an individual task, but it was good to have a weekly check in. It might be helpful to have more group sessions in the library or work sessions, at least towards the beginning of the semester before students start workshopping everyone's material."

    "Do the year-long thesis!",
    "Worth it. You get to know the other American Studies majors, get a lot of guidance with your project, and learn what American Studies even is.",
    "While a year-long thesis is definitely a lot of work, it is extremely rewarding and allows students to follow specific topics they're passionate about."
