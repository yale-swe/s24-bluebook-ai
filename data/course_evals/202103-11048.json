There's a lot of reading involved (one book per week), and each week in class you discuss the previous week's readings. I really liked our discussions, but the reading was sometimes a lot.",
                "The material is so interesting and conversations were so rich! Such a great class! This course could be improved with even more background history/etymology/those sorts of things--more context for the authors and their work.",
                "Professor Connolly is extremely kind and understanding, the readings are wonderful and discussions fascinating.\r\nI wish female poets were included. Also, there was not enough class time per week (wish there were two classes a week at least) and I wish there was more guidance in literary analysis for the short essays. Readings were often very long too.",
                "All strengths!! All of the readings were great, the feedback on assignments was very helpful, and the tutors (Normaliens) were brilliant as well. Sometimes there was just more reading than I could handle in a week, but that was fine I did what I could."
