Professor Yienpruksawan interrogates the natural world from a decidedly multidisciplinary approach that is skeptical of Western retrospectives and manages to find room for romance. A masterclass in literary and cultural analysis!",

                "This is an absolutely comprehensive course on the history, construction, and continued legacies of all the types of gardens in Kyoto. If you like nature, and you love Japan and its cultural aesthetics, you will enjoy this course. If you like readings that are fun and quirky, but equally informative and mind bending, you should certainly take this course. Mimi can teach a masterclass on compassionate and comprehensive teaching through visual language.",
                "We learned a lot of garden aesthetics and the history of specific temples/ their construction. Developed a deeper insight into the philosophy of karesansui and Zen gardens, as well as how East Asian tradition dictates the aesthetics of these gardens."

I think the course could be improved by having it split into two days instead of one and some more video exercises, maybe just optional films and documentaries about Japanese culture and artists! I'd also be interested to see more of the everyday objects that are used in a garden by people ie. rakes, tea cups, etc.",
                "Strengths: Mimi is great! Also, the course content is really interesting-- I've never taken a class like this, ever!\r\nI think something that could be improved is collaboration-- learning about these gardens can be hard to fully grasp unless discussing with another person, and it would be cool to do more group projects or small group discussions."

                "YES!!!! Immediately and resolutely. Mimi is so fantastic, and the course content will actually change your life. I know a lot more about gardens, nature, and philosophy now, and you'd be surprised how often you find yourself encountering the Zen garden. They're somehow all over the place."
