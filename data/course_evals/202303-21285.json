Even while writing this, I can describe a number of events and their respective documentations by heart due to overall class engagement.",
                "I gained extensive insight into the understanding of mesoamerican codices. I learned about how they were made along with why were they made. In class we were shown the historical importance of these artifacts.",
                "I learned so much in this class about the history, cultural uses, structure, and materials of Mexican Codices. It strengthened my visual analysis skills and also understanding of indigenous knowledge and Mesoamerican history from a focused and specific framework.",

                "The major strength is that this course is extremely thorough in answering students questions regarding the thought process and conclusions drawn from both pre-colonial and colonial codices. The only weakness I can find is that the information taught is NOT readily available on any other platform, including the web. So, it could be stressful if you're the type to not attend lecture\/study last minute as the slides oftentimes only show images with annotations.",
                "I love this class and only wished Yale university had access to more hands on material so we can take more of a hands on look with the material we study.",
                "The lectures are highly structured, the material is fascinating, and the readings match up nicely with what we do in class. I also felt that as I was doing the assignments, both creative and formal, I was actively engaging with what I was being taught in class and affirming that I had learned this information.  There were also many fun hands-on trips to the Beinecke and the farm that gave us more insight into what we were learning.",
                "I think the professor was a very strong teacher and very clear explanations. I also think that the pacing of the material covered was very well done. Went through material slowly enough to absorb the information, but fast enough that it wasn't stale. I do think the course would benefit from required discussion posts to increase some of the student interaction."

I initially approached it as a gut, but the material turned out to be extremely interesting and engaging to the point where there wasn't a moment I wasn't taking detailed notes\/ actively participating by asking questions.",
                "Yes! The material is so fascinatingespecially if you are at all interested in art, history, or Mesoamericaand the course was well structured!",
                "I would enthusiastically recommend this course to another student. The professor is polite and knowledgable. The course itself is well organized and paced. The workload is very manageable that does not deter students.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student! It is great for anyone interested in colonial history, materiality, and indigenous forms of art making. I would also recommend it to anyone interested in literature and history. It is a super fun and engaging course that taught me a lot!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I thought the material was new and interesting. It changed the way I analyze visual art.",
                "yes I would",
                "Yes, Professor Caplan is a wonderful teacher and I did not expect to learn so much from this class."
