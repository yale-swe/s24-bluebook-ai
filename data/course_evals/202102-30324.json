                "I developed a general understanding of the way Congress is supposed to work in theory and the way it works in reality.",
                "I learned about how Congress functions and interacts with the other branches of government. I also learned about the founders intent when creating the US government.",

                "I gained a wide breadth of knowledge of the workings of the U.S. Congress and the interplay between that branch and the other branches of government. The course was mainly discussion based with assignments being writing focused. I continued practicing with researching archival data and implementing it into my writing."

                "Great course! The \"discussion leaders\" component of the participation grade was great for encouraging class participation and full understanding of the concepts. Paper topics were interesting and engaging.",

                "Absolutely no weaknesses, and multiple strengths. Through a plethora of interactive discussion sections, communication skills as well as eloquence in public speaking significantly improved among all the students",
                "I really like the format of watching recorded lectures before class time and using class time to discuss the lecture amongst peers. I think the course could be improved with a more active involvement of the professor or TA in the class discussion. Sometimes discussions could be lacking and stagnate without clear direction from the professor.",
                "Throughout this course, I would have liked to engage with the professor a little more. It could be frustrating to spend the entire course (including every class session) just engaging in discussion led by your peers. Although this did allow for SO much engagement, I might have liked the professor to lead for half of every class, and then let students lead for the rest."

You will know congress inside out by the end of the class, but I do have to say that students that already know a lot about the functioning of the US government may find this class redundant.",

                "Yes I would recommend this class. The content is very interesting and generally good for anyone just looking to try out some political science. Some parts were a little dull, but overall the course was engaging. The workload is very manageable, and grading is fair.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. For anyone interested in learning about Congress, this course is ideal. The readings and lectures were super interesting, which made the in-class discussion super engaging. I really enjoyed taking this class.",
                "Absolutely! A great course for polisci beginners and experts alike, as you learn a lot of the basics and also extend into debate about the topics learned.",
                "Yes, this is a great intro level course with very interesting subject matter, good professor, and low workload.",
                "Yes! Professor Fairdosi was very knowledgeable and engaging. Grading was fair and the readings were doable.",
                "Absolutely!! As a STEM major I would never have thought a class in political science would fascinate me as much as this one did. I was able to gain some knowledge into what our founders intended for this nation's federal government to consist of and apply this knowledge to how it actually looks today. This new interest also has me thinking about how I can apply policy to astronomic research which is allocated and funded by Congress. Wonderful wonderful class",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who was not a political science major and/or had very little knowledge on the U.S. government to begin with. I think some of the lectures can be pretty basic for someone more adept in the subject area. But otherwise it was a versus interesting course and I think a good starting point for learning about Congress."
