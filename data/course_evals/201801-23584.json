    "Creation of art from literally any type of material possible, wood sculpting, how to use power tools, how to perceive and critique 3D art, how to make concrete and plaster casts, how to make molds, how to create ephemeral art, and how to create site specific art.",
    "I learned to deal with and love all the issues attached to making art in 3D space. In a very concrete way, I also learned new skills such as pouring cement and concrete, cutting foam with a hot knife and working a variety of saws in the wood shop."

   "comments": [
    "The final project was a little too time pressured and left me feeling a little shortchanged by the class following a semester's worth of really engaging material I didn't feel there was sufficient time to put it into practice.",
    "The course was very fun and lighthearted, which allowed me to feel comfortable exploring ideas an techniques. It was encouraged to try things outside of your comfort zone and use new techniques that we learned in class. We didn't have a ton of class time to work on our projects, which I didn't love, but we rather spent time learning new techniques or studying other artists.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing!! This course's biggest strength was the course's instructor, Sandra. She was always patient, helpful, encouraging, and incredibly insightful. The course is great the way it is!",
    "I think the class did a great job of giving us the freedom to explore different aspects of sculpture and make artworks that were truly our own. I think that an improvement to the class would be if we learned more techniques like carving or woodworking.",
    "I wish this course had one more assignment so that the working pace would be less on and off.",
    "The course provides students with as much freedom and as much guidance as they desire, Sandra and the TAs always being available for productive consultation and always being willing to humor even the most outlandish ideas. The work is very self-directed. My only suggestion would be to somehow fit in a fourth project, possibly by making the first found-object sculpture more of a one or two class warm up assignment."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It made me view sculpture and art and the arts differently and gave me ample opportunity to experiment and connect different parts of my life and creativity. What you get out of the course definitely depends on how you approach it, but you don't necessarily have to put in tons of hours to get a lot out of it. Sandra is thoughtful and awesome and she and the TAs showed us cool and diverse art across mediums that spurred ideas. This was a fun, worthwhile course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! I really enjoyed working with the TAs and with Sandra!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody! This has been one of the best courses I have taken at Yale!!",
    "Take this class! Sandra is such a wonderful and generous teacher, perfect for all skill\/interest levels in sculpture\/art making.",
    "Sculpture Basics with Sandra Burns is a great introductory course. My one problem with the course is its pace. I wish there was one more assignment, as there was not much class content beyond the assignments and materials demonstrations.",
    "Yes! It's as much work as you make it, and the payoff stands to be enormous. Sandra gives you so much freedom and has a seemingly endless reservoir of incredible artists in here head that she supplies for your inspiration."
