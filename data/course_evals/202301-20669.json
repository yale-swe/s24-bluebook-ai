                "I think the strengths are that Professor Kenyon was very enthusiastic, kind, and a great professor. The weaknesses are that sometimes the homework was long and repetitive.",
                "great job, but more discussion about things like SU(2) and SO(3) would have been better",
                "Strengths: Kenyon was very sweet and chill, and I liked that he got to know us individually as students. Some of the material was really cool (graph representations of different groups)\r\nWeakness: Kenyon didn't seem prepared for the lectures, and would spend a long time proving small things and gloss over important things. The homework were also really variable. Some were four questions and others 10-12. A lot of the homework was also very repetitive and uninteresting (no, I don't want to prove something is a group/subgroup/ring six times in a row). They also didn't reflect the material from class very well, which made it hard to know what to study for exams. The psets were also out of very few points, so when the graders took off for minor errors, it meant a pretty big deduction overall. I was overall a little disappointed, and feel I have a lot of holes in a really foundational subject in math.",
                "The curriculum and pace of the class were great, there were a lot of examples to help us understand more abstract concepts. The class could have gone more into detail and left more time for rings towards the end of the semester",
                "I think mostly the content is just not what I'm most interested in. Abstract algebra is certainly abstract, and maybe just too abstract for me. The further into the course I went the less I cared about what we were learning, which was bad because the difficulty also ramps up hard. I can't really bash the course to much, more so I just don't think it was for me, and it may not be for you. That being said, its pretty foundational for a lot of math, so if you are thinking about taking it, you will probably have to anyways.",
                "The course is extensive in that it covers a lot of material. To me that is a good quality, especially when the subsequent pure math courses that heavily rely on the principles built and learned in this course.",
                "The course covered a variety of interesting topics. It started as very easy and then became quite challenging.",
                "Strengths: Both the homework and exams were of reasonable length and difficulty. I really appreciated that in a class with a historically overwhelming workload, Kenyon made it much more manageable.\r\nWeaknesses: The content of this course was sometimes taught slightly out of order, and often theorems and content that would appear heavily on the homework would be glossed over in class. It sometimes felt that class was more of a supplement to reading the textbook than the  other way around.",
                "The course has a reasonable workload. The problem sets and exams are very reasonable. Also, Professor Kenyon remembers the names of people who attend the lecturers, which is super nice. The main weakness is that some of the lectures could have been better organized and prepared.",
                "The introduction to rings at the end of the course felt very definition-heavy and not as satisfying as some other courses, especially because there are so many more rich areas of group theory that are, in my opinion, more interesting.",
                "The class was well taught but harshly graded: there was little to no partial credit awarded and problem sets were a little too short, making small mistakes hurt your grade more than necessary. Otherwise, weekly psets and exams were both well administered and well-designed, although I do wish there were fewer computational questions.",
                "Professor Kenyon was the great strength of this course. His incredibly clear and concise teaching style allowed us to dive deep into complex topics, turning intricate proofs and technical derivations into straightforward concepts we could intuitively replicate. The problem sets are a fantastic complement to the material covered in class; Professor Kenyon has selected an artful combination of challenging questions about each topic, so that after every problem set we feel like we have mastered the material in that section.",
                "Strengths: Kenyon is a very good lecturer and makes the class interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: As a smaller class, it is a bit less organized, as there were no lecture notes which made it difficult to catch up when I missed a class.",
                "The lectures were great. The homeworks were of good length. It would have been nice if Prof. Kenyon had published class notes."

The course builds upon itself and basically snowballs definitions and theorems up to very complicated results so if you fall behind it will take a lot of time and work to catch up",

Professor Kenyons inspiring, encouraging nature will constantly challenge you to be the sharpest mathematician you can. I cant wait to take Math 310 with Professor Kenyon in the fall; he is a natural teacher who I feel lucky to have the opportunity to learn from.",
