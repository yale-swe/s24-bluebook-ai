                "- Thought about questions I hadn't considered before: what is a public? what is criticism for? does criticism have a political function, and if so, what is it? etc. \r\n- By reading writers in conversation / disagreement with one another, I think I learned how to trace the dimensions of an argument & became a better reader generally \r\n- Got a better sense of what's at stake in public writing, what it risks, what it can do",
                "I found this course to be one of the most fascinating I've taken at Yale. The biggest takeaway for me was definitely the readings, of which there were many and a wide variety of topics and depth. It's difficult to make people motivated to do such dense readings over and over again, yet somehow there I was. I think I had a more solid foundation in the political essay than I did when the course began.",
                "This course helped me immensely in improving my ability to read theory alongside my ability to read larger quantities of information for seminars. I believe that I became a better reader. Outside just the quantity of work, this course was an intellectual challenge in that each seminar asked me to be willing to reimagine the world.",
                "I read and developed a strong understanding of the writing of various critics and public intellectuals. It was a wonderful opportunity to engage with writers I've wanted to learn about for a long time: Marx, Engels, Said, Jameson, etc. Fundamentally, though, I learned how to analyze (i.e., write an English paper) literary works that are primarily argumentative, which was a departure for me as I usually am writing about novels, poetry, and plays in my English classes. It was a challenging, fun departure and a skill I'll take with me to other classes.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Cleary is an absolute gem. He leads really insightful class discussions and is just really nice. Plus the works on the syllabus are well picked, so classroom discussion is very lively and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe syllabus was just too loaded. Sooo much reading. Some days you could tell people were burnt out and hadn't fully done the reading.",
                "The texts were not easy, but they were very rewarding to read. The weekly reading responses is somewhat stressful to write, but they helped me engage much more closely with the texts as I read and thought about them. The connections between the texts weren't obvious at the beginning, but by the end of the course, the selection of the readings did make sense. Prof. Cleary facilitated productive discussions and stepped in whenever necessary. Maybe cross-list this course with HUMS/LITR? There weren't many texts of literature for this course, but the theories I read did help me understand history and the contemporary world.",
                "strengths: \r\n- Professor Cleary is an amazing educator: he evidently cares so much about making school meaningful for us, and about helping us to get the most out of his class. Our class discussions were consistently great; there was a good balance of direction / focus & openness to new ideas. I received super helpful feedback on my assignments -- think *pages* of notes for a ~15 page paper!! \r\n- The content was sooo interesting. The syllabus was really thoughtfully constructed, so we were able to put quite different writers / ideas in conversation with one another. We covered a ton of ground, while managing to keep alive & develop a few threads / themes throughout the semester, which was really exciting. \r\n- Somehow, the class really bonded -- we'd walk out still talking about the readings for the week; a few of us had lunch together most weeks; and on one day that class was cancelled, we had a group brunch. I've never had this experience in a seminar, and it made this course so much more meaningful. I think it speaks to the nature of the readings & our discussions, and the kind of classroom environment Professor Cleary creates. \r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- Heavy workload! It's 100% worth the effort if you have the time, but if you're looking for a chill Junior seminar this is not the class for you lol",
                "Strengths - Firstly, any chance to take a class with Professor Cleary is a gift. He does a great job of guiding the class through dense, complex readings. He does not patronize you; he holds you to the standards that he holds himself, which means that you have to do the readings. This meant that nearly everyone came prepared, and our discussions often felt like they had real stakes (an experience hard to find in an English class). Secondly, most of the readings were really provocative and fulfilling to read. I would never think to put Hannah Arendt with Barbara Ehrenreich and Frank Wilderson III in one semester, but these books enhanced one another. Many of the supplementary essays from scholars like Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, and Francis Fukuyama were so great and I never would have read them otherwise. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The readings for this course were **dense** and the workload could be overwhelming. The original syllabus had to be cut down because we could not keep up with the pace of readings assigned to us. Moreover, despite Cleary's best efforts, there was not an obvious sense of direction to the material itself, which I think could have sustained us through some of our more intensive weeks of reading. I guess the theme could be \"polemic\" or \"public intellectual,\" and we sometimes tethered our discussion to these books around these words. Often, however, it was either more necessary or engaging to discuss the content of the readings themselves, that discussions about style or broader questions of polemic seemed less relevant, or more peripheral to where the heart of our discussion lay. There were some quirks to the syllabus, too, that confused me...for example, we spent a lot of time reading William Blake, which didn't seem like the most obvious choice for a polemic poet across history / Western canon (i.e. contemporary American poets like Terrance Hayes' \"American Sonnets,\" Claudia Rankine's \"Citizen\", WWII modernist poets like Ezra Pound). It also felt like a strange way to start the semester off, considering we read little poetry beyond it, besides Shelley's \"Mask of Anarchy\" and Lord Byron's \"Age of Bronze\" (which did not have the bang for its buck). Generally, the readings during the second half of the semester were much more diverse and exciting than those during the first half of the semester.",
                "The strengths are the readings themselves, and their diverse slate of backgrounds and goals. In addition, as a writer, being in a small class with a collection of similarly dedicated writers was very impactful on me throughout the semester. I learned as much from my peers as I did the course.\r\nA weakness of the course is that the intellectual path of this class was somewhat disjointed at times, and the connection between readings week to week was sometimes hard to follow. But the strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses.",
                "The course was difficult. Although I knew coming in that as a junior seminar it would be rigorous, there were times that the quantity of information covered made it difficult to grasp the nuances of pieces. For example, I would have preferred to have spent an entire week on reading all of Afropessimism and cut the section on Chartism. \r\n\r\nThe strengths of the course are many: a wonderful group of thoughtful individuals in the seminar, Cleary is both compassionate and expects a high quality of work, and the span of works read were all fascinating!",
                "Prof. Cleary leads fantastic discussion, and I think he did a wonderful job of selecting the texts for this course. All of the readings are interesting and make for lively discussion. Speaking of which, our class developed a strong sense of community as the semester progressed, and I think that made for richer conversations and an academic space where we were all invested in each other's success. The space in general felt very warm and welcoming. As for areas of improvement, I sometimes wish certain books had more time dedicated to them. This course is fast-paced, and sometimes I came away feeling like we hadn't fully discussed some interesting parts of the texts, though that's really a minor issue.",
                "the course is full of stuff you should read in college, but always felt current and urgent. one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale. if there are any weaknesses, I would say that sometimes the reading load is heavy, and the canvas responses actually require thought and time. this was a good thing broadly (helped stimulate deep, rather than superficial class discussion, helped develop ideas for papers, and prof cleary offered an option to compile responses into a porfolio to be reflected on instead of writing a final paper), but sometimes it felt like a lot of work.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed this course, as it was a fascinating collection of works that demanded close attention, which almost always resulting in great in-class discussions. I thought the Canvas posting format was actually applied well in this class, as it helped clarify my thoughts on the readings. I sometimes felt like the assigned readings put a strain on my workload, though, and our discussions could sometimes not do the work justice as students only had time to do a quick scan of the reading in time for class."

                "Yes yes yes yes yes. It's hard. There's so much reading. And the reading is really dense. But it is SOOOO worth it. Professor Cleary is an absolute treasure. Combining the difficulty of the content with how interesting it was made everyone in the seminar pretty close. We all worked through the difficult texts together, and Professor Cleary does a great job of guiding discussion. I'm so sad that this class is over, and I hope he offers it again for future students.",
                "Yes! Non-literature texts were hard to read, but they made me a better reader (because of the sheer volume of the readings and the intricate arguments of the texts) and a more thoughtful English student. I'm a prospective creative writing concentrator, and this non-literature English class pushed me beyond merely enjoying the process of writing and helped me reflect on what I would want to achieve with my own writing in terms of themes and ideas. Besides, this course seriously considers controversial ideas such as Marxism and the End of History, and it is beneficial to move beyond making jokes with these ideas and consider the reasons and sentiments behind the rise of these ideas. Be prepared to have your fundamental beliefs and world views challenged.",
                "Absolutely!! I can't recommend it enough, this was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale",
                "Yes, with the caveat that the syllabus should be adjusted!",
                "I would recommend this course only to people who are certain they want to build a career as a writer. There are a LOT of readings and there is a really high expectation on the quality of the essays, so this is not a course for someone wanting to get a casual writing credit. But for writers, this course is essential! I loved it.",
                "Yes! For a student wanting to challenge themselves and read a combination of theory and interventionist literature, the course is wonderful.",
                "Absolutely! The readings are excellent, Prof. Cleary is fantastic, and the work of this course will make you a better reader and writer. It's definitely challenging, but worth it.",
                "yes. honestly changed how I think about the role of thw writer in the world and what I want to do with my life.",
                "I would recommend this course, but would warn that prospective students should be prepared for a strong, if rewarding, intellectual challenge. The readings were lengthy and often difficult, and the weekly Canvas posts are expected to be of a higher caliber than most classes. Having said that, I absolutely loved the class (the readings, the class discussions, and the ideas and subjects covered) and felt truly challenged in the most rewarding way. It was certainly one of the best English classes I've taken at Yale. If you're up for the task, take it!"
