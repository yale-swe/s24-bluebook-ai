                "Very broad coverage of the material, more insightful than ECON117; definitely retained more information too. Course had a structure and flow that made sense.",
                "Strengths: The willingness of Prof. Meghir and Kan, the TA, to help students was really great, as these concepts are quite difficult to learn quickly and internalize. The greatest strength is that at the end of the course, you will truly have a deep understanding of the importance of econometrics and how vital it is to understand these various shortcomings in different econometric approaches to analyzing a problem of interest. The ability to apply the knowledge we learned in class to a data set through the projects was also really beneficial.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The first project for the course was quite vague in its instructions, and I think given the fact that the workload for this course is quite high, it would be much nicer if there was only one project. The problem sets were also much harder than the exams were, but I think they were good preparation. We were not able to get through all of the planned course content.",
                "The class was taught very well. Professor Meghir was very responsive to class feedback and ensured that all students were engaged and learning. The material could be a bit confusing at times, especially with the mathematical proofs, but overall the class was very well-structured.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Meghir, course organization, applications of theory throughout including Prof's own research made concepts much more interesting and engaging\r\nWeaknesses: none - required a bit of work but so worth it in the end",
                "I think that this was one of the best Econ courses I have taken. I would not change anything.",
                "The material may appear theoretical but is actually highly relevant to real data analysis. No weaknesses",
                "I think having an organized calendar with assignment due dates would have been helpful.",
                "This course strengths lie in Professor Meghir's attention to and care about his students. He did a good job keeping the course organized and was a great lecturer who was always willing to provide additional help to anyone who needed it. The amount of work we had felt unnecessary at times, as I felt we could've done with only one project and with some shorter assignments, as I sometimes found myself losing engagement with the longer ones due to redundancy in content and the increased work time.",
                "Professor Costas is one of the best professors I have ever had. He explain concepts so crisply and clearly. He really makes things click. He is an expert in the subject and has a true passion for economics research that is infectious. More than that, he deeply cares about his students and their individual successes. He makes time to talk with any student if they ask, even if it's a weekend, even if it's late in the evening or early in the morning. For the final, he met with me individually to review concepts, and I know he met with several other students one-on-one and in groups, all on his own time and out of his own desire to help students. Despite the zoom format, he made class engaging and enjoyable every day and was always so happy to see us. He took our feedback seriously, and really tried to tailor the class to us. I've never had a professor who is so genuinely investing in his students and his work as a professor and economics academic. While econometrics itself may not be the most riveting subject for all, Costas makes the class all worth it, and you learn a ton that is extremely helpful if you're interested in any empirical research. The class is a good amount of work, but I think it is designed really well as to leverage the strength of both theory and application. Through lectures, problem sets and the projects, you get to learn the theory of econometric models, but then also have the opportunity to apply them and understand their worth and use in research, which is pretty awesome. This really brought the class to life. You essentially get to do two mini research projects through the two projects. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading schedule. The TA uploaded our psets in two chunks, so I had no clue how I was doing in the class most of the semester, which made it difficult to gague how well I understood the material. The psets are pretty constant, so watch out. I also wish that the course had more opportunities for students to engage with each other outside of the lecture...a virtual study hall would have been really, really nice in order to have a space to work on psets. I don't know what I would have done had I not known one other girl in the class. It was only really at the end of the course that I was able to reach out to more students to collaborate. \r\n\r\nThere is no option to drop a pset. I think that this should be changed and is a reasonable request, as sometimes there are just rough weeks for students where they really need a moment to breathe.",
                "For the strengths, I think this course covers important economics topics that are widely used in fields like Randomized Control Trials and Difference in Differences. Professor Meghir did a good job at weaving in real-world applications of what we were learning throughout the course. Further, the 2 projects we did offer an opportunity to dive into economic research more. Some weaknesses may be its complete focus on the lectures. I like to learn through lectures and textbook reading and this course had no assigned readings or additional materials outside of the lectures to follow along with (though if you look on youtube you can find some good econometric videos). Also, the sections sometimes felt redundant and unnecessary, and wish they covered a little more of the practical side of things (i.e. reading\/interpretating research papers).",
                "Strengths: Even though at times I did not necessarily want to turn on my camera, everyone having to have their camera on did help to have a better learning environment; the projects were a good way to take the information that we were learning and apply them to real life data. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish the class was a bit more flexible in the midst of the pandemic\r\n\r\nImprovement: I wish that there were practice problems to try to review the concepts we learned",
                "Strengths: Prof. Meghir and Kan's (our TA) willingness to offer help when needed, the syllabus (we learned a lot of different analytical techniques and got substantial experience using them through problem sets and projects), Prof. Meghir's engaging lecturing style, the fairness of the exams. Weaknesses: the problem sets felt overly mathematical and challenging and didn't add to my understanding of the topics we discussed, and the slides were too dense and long.",
                "Small class. Getting help on assignments was difficult initially.",
                "Strengths: Overall, Professor Costas is very good at explaining the econometric concepts and his slides are pretty comprehensive. I also think the general flow of lecture was very understandable. The exams are fair (maybe bordering easy) and straightforward and grading is pretty generous.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nFirst, there's a lot of work in this class -- imo there's too much to the point where it feels like I'm not learning anything and I'm just grinding away at the weekly homework or just trying to come up with some answer so that I can submit and just be done with it rather than having the time to really try and think through the questions. Tbh I think most of my learning from the psets came after the answer keys were posted, as opposed to while I was doing the psets which is suboptimal.\r\n\r\nSecond, pacing of work in the class is terrible. There was a week that initially had a pset, project, and midterm all due (i.e. due dates Sun, Mon, Wed) and that's just way too much.\r\n\r\nHowever, the BIGGEST weakness by far in my opinion is the motivation of students for taking this course. This course follows Econ 117, and since only one econometrics class is required for the Econ major, the majority (probably close to all) of students taking this course are trying to write a senior thesis. Furthermore, most of the students are also seniors in the fall trying to take this course concurrently with writing their thesis. And so you have a significant (if not majority) chunk of students who legitimately don't care about this course at all and are just trying to get the requirement out of the way, and I think it makes for a terrible learning experience. Furthermore, the methods covered in the class aren't even relevant to a lot of thesis topics or are too basic to be of use for thesis analysis (and even if there was a particular method that was relevant to your thesis, the class will only spend 15 minutes on it anyways). As someone who was only 50% interested in the material, I felt like I was already one of the \"most\" interested students in the class and that's downright depressing, but I also can't really blame the students \/ seniors who have other things they're (rightly) more worried about. It's pretty sad when Professor Costas asks a really simple question (e.g. \"Does anyone have any thoughts why we might have gotten this result?\") and it's just silence for 5 minutes, punctuated by Professor Costas's occasional pleading for someone \/ anyone to just say anything until someone answers.\r\n\r\nImho, the Econ department should just remove Econ 123 as a requirement for writing the thesis since it doesn't contribute any knowledge to the thesis writing experience and the differing incentives of students taking the class just overall make for an extremely subpar learning experience. That way, only people who are actually interested in the methods (which can be interesting!) will take the course instead of this hodge podge of students who don't want to be there \/ are just trying to complete their requirement."

                "They did a great job of ensuring adequate support for students was available through the professor and TF.",
                "I really liked that Professor Costas used a pen on the screen. For me, as a visual learned, seeing things written on the board and having equations expanded live is extremely helpful and makes the class a lot more engaging than just seeing the expansion directly in the slides. I also really appreciated the recording aspect of the class. While I acknowledge there may also be some disincentives associated with recordings, for me, I still paid attention every class live because it allowed me to ask questions and I really loved being able to go back to the recordings while studying for an exam or working on a problem set because the way Professor Costas explained things always helped the most, and the recordings are a lot more rich than just the lecture slides, although those were extremely detailed and helpful as well in this class.",
                "I think the live office hours were incredibly useful for me. Professor Meghir was very flexible and open to meeting outside of class, which made asking questions and reviewing problem sets very accessible and easy. Some other Professors only offered office hours for one period the entire week, which made it tough if that time did not work with your schedule, or if you have questions ahead of a big project. However, the openness and flexibility of this course was immensely helpful!\r\n\r\nAlso, the flexibility with assignments and due dates created a healthy work schedule. For example, a couple of times we had assignments\/projects due back to back, but the instructor\/TF ended up adjusting one deadline back, allowing us some breathing room to continue thoroughly learning the material while also completing our assignments on time.",
                "I think there's not much that could be done and given the situation, I thought Professor Meghir tried his best. Initially, he would cold call people but apparently some in the class didn't like that (even though the answers were right on the slide and you could easily say I don't know and he would call someone else), so that pretty much ruined any possible virtual engagement (not the Professor's fault -- imo more on the students who just didn't want to participate)."

This course is difficult conceptually, but the resources are there for you to succeed and while I did struggle many times, by the end I am thrilled by how much I learned. Prof. Meghir was excellent at providing support and explaining econometrics in an intuitive fashion something that previous econometrics courses and professors failed to do. If you are hesitating to take this course, know that while it is a lot of hard work, it will also be very rewarding to complete the work, but only take it if you really want to delve into the mathematical and theoretical aspects of econometrics and learn about research methods and techniques.",

                "Definitely. Its a must take to understand various types of data analysis",
                "I would recommend this class to quant oriented people that are interested in statistics.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're doing to the thesis or have a genuine strong interest in econometrics. It's a lot of work, so you have to be committed to it for one reason or another.",
                "Yes, absolutely, especially if you're interested in research or writing a senior economics thesis. The class is extremely helpful in teaching you research methods and the theory behind causal inference. If the class is taught by Professor Costas, I would absolutely recommend it just to have him as a professor. He truly cares about the student, and trust me, that is the most important thing in any college class - the professor. Professor Costas makes this class. You will have to put in the work, but it will all be worth it, and you'll learn an extraordinary amount, and be inspired in your research.",
                "I was not expecting it (because dude, it's econometrics), but I loved this class. Loved it. Listen, econometrics is challenging and not always the most riveting subject in the world, but Professor Meghir made it so concrete and interesting. We had the opportunity to replicate a study of his using our own code, we got to really think critically about how to set up RCTs and other intervention techniques, and Prof Meghir was very intentional in going deep into derivations and the core, core elements behind econ-based stats. I feel so much more confident in my analytical and technical skills having taken this class. I would recommend this course to any student who realized (like me) that we would be kidding ourselves if we thought SDS 230 or Intro Econometrics was enough to even remotely (and responsibly!) engage with stats in the real world. Fantastic, fantastic course.",
                "Yes, if you want to enhance your econometric and research-based knowledge, definitely take this course! Though it is not perfect (no course is), it has a good blend of empirical and theoretical concepts that make the course challenging yet practical.",
                "Take this class if you have to. It expands upon the concepts you learned in Econ 117 but if you struggled in that do not take this class",
                "Absolutely. What we learn in this class is the backbone of modern economic research, and even though it's challenging, it's an excellent learning experience. Before taking this class, even after taking ECON 117, I was not confident in my data analysis skills. Now, I am confident that I can economically explore analyze any dataset thrown at me.",
                "Not if it's not required for your major.",
                "No\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the incentives for students to take this course are just not aligned with good educational outcomes. Most are just taking this course to knock out the thesis requirement, and especially since many (if not most) are seniors, it just makes for a really unmotivated group of students that kills the interest of the few students who are interested in what's happening."
