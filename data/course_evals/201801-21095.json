    "This lab provided a very hands-on learning experience using fossils and specimens from the Peabody museum.  It perfectly complements G&G125  I feel I got much more out of the lecture from also taking the lab.",
    "I know how to interpret fossils, basically.",
    "Being able to see what fossilization actually looks like",
    "This course is a good overview of the history of major classes of life.  The material focuses mostly on animals and is based on the incredibly strong teaching collections of the Peabody Museum.",
    "How to identify and discuss fossils, and how to apply the knowledge from the lecture class",
    "its definitely a lot easier to feel like you know how to identify fossilized organisms if you actually look at a few. Taking the lab makes the actual class a breeze too",
    "I had a great time in this lab.  It was incredibly interesting, and I learned a lot about fossil preservation and identification."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the lab that involved sorting the foraminifera into our own species names and arranging them in a phylogeny.  I think this was an excellent exercise for us to test our understanding of the presented concepts.  I would have loved more of these \"application of our understanding\" sort of activities throughout the semester.",
    "This course often seemed to be harder or easier from week to week.  It would be nice to see lab exercises that are organized more consistently on a weekly basis.  If each lab followed the same basic format it would be easier to study and to see the great organization of the tree of life.  \r\nThe course is taught by professors and grad students with an incredible knowledge base and ability to answer questions.  Most of the time in class is spent in conversation with the profs\/TAs.  This is the biggest strength of the course.",
    "Strengths: labs were a good length, they tested a wide breadth of knowledge and were reasonably fun to complete\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps assumed a bit too much knowledge",
    "If youre new to paleontology youll be quite out of your depth for much of the lab. I found we answered a lot of the lab questions by just asking the professor for the answers.",
    "This course had no weaknesses!  It was incredibly interesting and informative."

    "Highly recommend a very hands-on learning experience using fossils and specimens from the Peabody museum.  It perfectly complements G&G125  I feel I got much more out of the lecture class from also taking the lab.  Not a lot of work outside attending weekly lab, I definitely learned a lot!",
    "This is a great introductory course to fossils and the evolution of life on Earth.  This course covers a variety of forms of evidence and an incredible look into the vast collections of the Yale Peabody Museum.  The course is taught by professors and TAs who are experts in their field.  There are many different grad students who rotate through in order to teach their own specialty.  This course is great for students who don't like a lecture.  It's very hands-on and up-to-date.  The course is best taken in accompaniment with G&G125 \"History of Life.\"  Together they provide a great introduction to the origins of life.  s",
    "I would recommend History of Lab life as an accompaniment to the history of life lecture class. it expands on many of the themes and allows more place for asking questions and going into more depth. It is reasonably chill - there is no work outside of class, just labs in class and a final exam.",
    "If youre taking the actual class its fun to be able to actually look at some of the things you talk about. Yale has an amazing collection and its awesome to be able to actually handle it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.  It was very interesting and informative."
