                "How to develop characters and create a story world in order to write a TV series document and pilot!",
                "This course teaches so much about tv writing, but also writing and storytelling generally. I learned about character development, scene writing, how to build a show, and more. Couldnt recommend more!",
                "I learned so much about the process of writing a script, developing a character, and creating effective dialogue. This class taught me a lot about how to write a convincing story in which characters are believable.  In addition, I learned a lot about the conventions of writing a script for TV.",
                "Before this course, I had only taken introductory English courses, so I'd never had the chance to take a class that taught a specialized form of writing. In this class, I learned how to write for TV and how this differs from novel or narrative writing. I learned about the form and content of a good script and how to create conflict, develop characters, write interesing dialogue, and use action lines effectively. I learned the importance of the planning and development process to writing a good script and had the chance to collaborate with peers in a writers's room setting."

            "comments": [
                "This class has a lot of strengths. Reading scripts and talking about how they relate to our own work when creating stories is great. It's also really fun to read scripts of shows we've already seen, because you see these behind-the-scenes nuggets. \r\nProfessor Green's feedback is also a great strength of the class. He really helps you come up with your idea and work on it! \r\nI think the class could be improved by having us write a bit more, but I understand that this was basically the \"intro\" class to TV writing. I would have liked a few more writing exercises that would bring us toward better story structure etc.",
                "Strengths: Professor Green is phenomenal. He knows so much about this subject and is super passionate about it. He really eases you in to writing scenes and building up to a whole series document and beginning of a pilot. Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: Professor Green; He was super great, always left encouraging/helpful comments and his lectures were engaging too! The other students in the class are also amazing, especially when it came time for workshop. Really cool to see what other people were working on. Also, there was a lot of time to work on the final project, even if you didn't necessarily come into the class knowing what you wanted to write about. I wrote all of my weekly assignments on other ideas before turning to the one that ultimately became my final idea after the midterm.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quick turnarounds for the weekly assignments in the beginning (assigned wednesday/thursday and due friday). He was pretty flexible with deadlines, so if you wanted an extension, you definitely got one. It was just sometimes kinda frustrating to have to wait for an assignment to be posted and then have it due almost immediately.",
                "This course does an incredible job of having each week build on the last. Professor Green is full of insight and allows students to develop their own work while also building the core skills needed for tv writing. No real weaknesses.",
                "The class was clearly laid out and the syllabus was flexible to allow for more time to work on certain assignments. Overall the only thing I would say that could be improved was the timeline of workshopping. Due to the schedule this year we had a lot more people workshopping in one sitting (3-4) which was sometimes overwhelming amount of material to read a truly comment on, but it was still manageable.",
                "Strengths: the class is accessible to those without experience and doesn't assume prior knowledge of TV writing, but also seemed to challenge and engage students with prior experience writing plays or tv scripts. I fall into the former category, and felt welcomed into the classroom and fully supported and encouraged. The workshops were a great aspect of the course and provided phenomenal feedback . Professor Green's teaching is super engaging and fun, and he does a great job breaking things down into actionable steps and key takeaways."

                "Absolutely! Absolutely worth it and lives up to the hype. I'm very glad I got in and feel lucky :) It's a great way to learn about TV writing. I definitely recommend to anyone who's interested in this kind of storytelling.",
                "Definitely! This course is a blast and you learn a lot. Even though the course is about TV drama, I feel the skills learned here are so applicable to any genre of writing.",
                "Yes! I think Professor Green does a really good job of trying to get a group of students that come from different academic backgrounds. If you're worried that you won't be the only English or humanities students, that's definitely not an issue, and I never really found it a barrier (as someone who never wrote creatively in an academic setting before this). \r\n\r\nAlso, obviously the content of the course is pretty amazing and interesting. It was really cool to learn more about an industry and creative process that feels elusive from someone who clearly has a lot of experience. Having a real working idea of your own TV pilot (you only really need to write a pitch pages and teaser, act 1, and act 2; a full pilot was not required) at the end of the course was so fulfilling. I'm really, really glad I took this class!",
                "Absolutely! One of my favorite courses Ive taken! The class is well-structured for student learning with each week building on the last. I gained tangible skills not only for tv writing but writing in general. Couldnt recommend more!",
                "ABSOLUTELY!! This has been one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. This course is a great chance to work with a phenomenal professor and learn about a unique, engaging topic. This class gave me such a wonderful creative outlet, improved my writing for TV and otherwise, and offered really cool insight into the TV writing process."
