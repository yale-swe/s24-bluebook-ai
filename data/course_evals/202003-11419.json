You really get to learn how to close read readings and analyze movies and photos. My writing because so well structured and I think my thought process for writing has improved a lot. You're really given a great introduction to college writing which is applicable to all classes that succeed this one.",

The long research paper was also a tremendous learning experience. Sarah walked us through all phases of the writing and revising processes, and I feel more comfortable now approaching any future paper.",

This was an incredibly helpful class to take in my first semester at Yale.",

All the readings were so interesting and the environment that Sarah created in class made me feel super comfortable with sharing my ideas during discussion. She was always willing to meet with students to discuss papers, readings, or anything. Even though class time was long, it never felt long. I really felt like I was learning and I was never stressed about assignments in this course.",

It was also fascinating reading material, that lent itself to discussion. The timeline of ENGL114 is slightly demanding as a freshman, which was good in that it pushed us, however providing more leniency could improve the course.",

The readings selected were also interesting and feedback for each paper was helpful in finding areas of improvement. \r\nThere were no weaknesses in particular.",

                "There were many different course practices that allowed for virtual engagement. We mostly had discussions in class, so the Zoom format worked fine. We also had a movie screening in class where the professor shared her screen and audio. With student presentations, we shared each of our screens\/slides\/videos and presented. While we couldnt visit the Beinecke or the YUAG in person, we visited the collections online and picked artworks related to the course theme to present in class. All these methods were effective in encouraging virtual engagement.",

I was never even interested in anything else besides STEM but this course was so eye opening and made me really fall in love with writing. Even if the readings are a bit long at times, they are all so so interesting which made them fun to read. The movies we got to watch were also really great to, and analyzing them was really enjoyable.",

This particular section of \"Ghosts, Spies, Shadows\" is particularly interesting, as in my opinion it covers the most pertinent subject matter with the most interesting array of primary and secondary sources.",
                "Very strongly recommend to any students.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course itself is a great introduction to college writing, but what makes it better is Sarah. She is incredible. Throughout the course, she was passionate about what she was teaching, and I could tell she cared about each student. After each paper, she gave lengthy and helpful feedback on how I could improve my writing. She also led each discussion well, so everyone was comfortable speaking up (the small course size probably contributed to this as well). This was easily my favorite course for the fall semester, and I am so glad I took it.",
