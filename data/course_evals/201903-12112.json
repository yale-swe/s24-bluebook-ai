   "comments": [
    "Strengths: fairview was the only good part about this course\r\nWeaknesses: this class attracted reactionary people, I feel like discussions focused on whatever people were mad about that week, which led to discussion becoming disorganized and not focused in the material. The material also didn't focus on whiteness, nor did it talk about the intersections of whiteness and class, which was extremely disappointing. This class was unfulfilling.",
    "Strengths: engaging class conversation; interesting readings; salon classes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: could have used better feedback",
    "I think the readings and organization of the class were excellent - the only complaint I have about the class is that discussion would sometimes stall out on a single topic in an unproductive way. However, I think this had more to do with the personalities in the room than with the class or professor. Aaron did an admirable job of trying to move us forward when this happened, but it's a hard thing to do without talking over or silencing students.",
    "collaborative, communicative, amazing \r\n meets only once a week!!! i wanted to meet more often!!",
    "The structure is perfect--with good balance between student freedom and essential texts. The one suggestion I would have is a more laid out class time (i.e. some more structure for in-class discussions).",
    "Strengths of the course are the freedom of discussion. Everyone's voice was valued and I learned from my peers as much as my professor. Weakness is how off topic the conversations could get sometimes because of the freedom of conversation."

   "comments": [
    "No. It's probably an easy A but it's not worth it. The readings are vague and uninteresting, and honestly, half of the time they don't correlate to what the topic is on the syllabus. Nothing pushed me intellectually in this class, none of my beliefs were challenged, I feel like I learned nothing. I didn't learn about whiteness in America, I don't even know if this class was about whiteness in the end",
    "Yes, this class has interesting readings which facilitate engaging class discussions. Although some unfamiliar concepts and theories of race were introduced during the course, Id say that the most significant thing I drew from the course is how to learn and develop my own methods of approaching race and race relations during my everyday life.",
    "Yes!",
    "yes!!! if you want to learn about the foundations of racism, and how it has changed throughout history",
    "Certainly. It is one of the most life-changing courses I have taken at any level and one that I would consider essential for everyone at Yale.",
    "Yeah, it is a good opportunity to discuss contemporary issues in an academic setting"
