                "This class was really fascinating and well done. I learned how to think about things in such different ways and Igor is an amazing professor.",
                "This class is a great way to learn more about Michel Foucault and his impacts on Queer Studies. I find that Foucault is a dense and opaque writer at sometimes, lucid and funny in others, so it's rewarding to read his books with a class. This felt very foundational to a lot of queer\/sexuality critique I've read but sometimes felt disconnected from.",
                "Critical engagement with Foucauldean theories of discursive power, discipline, resistance, and embodiment. Gained a much more comprehensive understanding of Foucaults arguments and reactions to them from queer theorists like Leo Bersani and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. Encouraged to apply these ideas to everyday life and to my specific topics of interest in weekly discussions and papers.",
                "In this class I learned how to think out of the box. The ideas we considered challenge societal norms in such important ways. I particularly appreciated the openness of dialogue in Igors classroom  it is rare to come by and Igor does it so well."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths were definitely discussions and Igor's very interesting lectures and discussion leading. A way to make the conversation more generative though would be to have reading reflections all the time or at least sometimes to ensure we do the reading.",
                "The readings for this course are really great and there's an opportunity towards the end of the semester to have a class dedicated to something that the seminar is particularly interested in exploring that wasn't already in the syllabus. Not always a weakness probably, but my class's seminar discussions could be dry because of a lack of meaningful participation at times. This left it with a more heavy, lecture-y feel.",
                "Strengths: I really liked how discussion-driven this course was: it felt like the group operated as a scholarly community where people were encouraged to bring in their intellectual and extracurricular interests for group analysis. I also think it gives you a very good foundation in Foucauldean thought, which is important for anyone who wants to engage with sexuality on a theoretical level. The papers were super manageable and Igors enthusiasm for the discipline and general affability made for an enjoyable facilitation experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The additional readings could feel a bit randomly-assembled, and were sometimes quite difficult to get through. I know some students (at moments, myself included,) felt that the grading in this class was based less on strength of argument as much as whether the professor agreed with it, though I found that the extensive comments I received reflected a deep level of engagement with everything I wrote. In addition, discussion could drag sometimes, and there were moments when a greater degree of structure could have been beneficial to the class."

                "Yes, if you are interested in sexuality, psychology, or Foucault, definitely take this course! I came in with zero knowledge about Foucault and ended up learning so much about his works, even though we only read the history of sexuality and some of his interviews. Even if you have no experience with any of the material, Prof de Souza is a wonderful person to talk to about the material and you will learn a lot from just listening to him speak.",
                "Yes definitely, this class was fascinating and I would recommend it to any student interested in matters of sex and sexuality.",
                "Yes, if youre legitimately interested in Foucault and his ideas. Your experience in this course is predicated on your ability and willingness to closely engage with texts that are often difficult conceptually and on a sentence-to-sentence level. If youre not doing the readings to at least some extent, thatll be a LONG two hours, but I found that the weeks that I put more energy into the readings, I had a lot of fun. Igor is a facilitator who is as entertaining as he is adept in this discipline, and I learned a lot from listening to him speak and discussing with him.",
                "Yes, absolutely! I urge you to take this course especially if you do NOT have a background of taking WGSS courses. The class took me out of my comfort zone with so much room to think for myself. I learned so much from Igor.",
                "Yes, the course was very engaging!"
