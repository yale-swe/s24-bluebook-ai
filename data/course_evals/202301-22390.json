While the papers did not emphasize the literature, they did help me to practice philosophical thought more generally, in how to sketch an argument and raise and respond to objections.",

                "The seminars were fantastic; the instructor led productive, thoughtful, and enjoyable discussions. They were the strongest part of the course. The readings were also generally strong. My greatest disappointment was with the assignments: the prompts were so vague that instructions were unclear, and students are actively discouraged from engaging with the literature, with the instructor arguing that we ought to learn to philosophize for ourselves. While I understand the rationale, for students who want to go further into the field or understand the field better, the assignments did little to help them in that regard.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is the in class discussion. These discussions are lively and rarely interrupted by Shelly. Shellys office hours are also a great opportunity to learn how to defend your arguments. The biggest weakness of this course is that the grading is absurd. Shelly thinks that he is constructing a more accurate and fair grading scheme by being harsher on papers.  What he is actually doing is disincentivizing students from engaging to the fullest extent in the course by incentivizing them to credit\/d\/fail the class.",
                "This course is a tremendous asset. Professor Kagan connects students with the material by aligning the form of his philosophy seminar with its content. Rather than rely on airtight citations and secondary literature, Professor Kagan encourages students to think for themselves, developing positive arguments on ethical issues and defending them against counterexamples. \r\n\r\nOne way the course could be improved, however, would be by incorporating some kind of mandatory revision of either the first or second paper. In his handout, \"How to Write a Philosophy Paper,\" Professor Kagan rightly notes that the best way to improve one's writing is by rewriting, oftentimes by scratch. That being said, I think that an opportunity for students to rewrite an essay to clarify their theses and address objections raised by Professor Kagan's comments could be extremely meaningful, especially as it is often the case that the author only gets straight on what they wanted to say in the first place through the process of trying to write it down.",
                "Grading is pretty brutal.",
                "This course is incredible because it's pure philosophyit's just about the ideas and fundamental questions about how one should act, and not about text and parsing individual sentences.",

                "I would recommend this course, but exclusively as a pass\/fail or credit\/no credit course. The readings and discussions are more than worthwhile, but the professor's draconian method of grading and vague prompts for the assignments mean that grades will be harsher than you expect. While the professor claims he is merely following Yale's guidelines (so assignments he finds to be satisfactory he gives a \"C\" with no hesitation), since virtually no other professor at the school grades in this way, this rationale is ludicrous, and does nothing but unduly hurt his students' chances for later graduate or professional school opportunities. Therefore, it's a great course if you want to take normative ethics, but don't accidentally sacrifice your GPA for it.",
                "I would recommend that they take this course if they are prepared to credit to fail the course or prepared to receive a bad grade.",
                "Absolutely! I am grateful not only to have developed a sense of my own moral beliefs, but also to have, upon completing the course, amassed a philosophical toolkit for arguing for my positions in clear terms.",
                "Absolutely recommend on the other side, but it can be a psychologically taxing journey through it..",
                "Yesif you're willing to really put in the time for papers, your efforts will be rewarded with the privilege of having your ideas be taken seriously by an incredible philosopher. Shelly's comments will humble you but also allow you to become a better thinker and writer. I've never felt that thoughts from my brain have been so seriously toyed with (and dismantled) by someone else and then relayed back so cogently.",
