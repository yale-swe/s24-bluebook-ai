We had very productive classes where we completed exercises and conversed with one another. However, I would have preferred that we receive some more consistent homework, which could even be watching episodes of a show in Portuguese. I think, as a class, this would have made us progress faster.",
                "The strengths of this course were the relaxed and accommodating nature of how the course was taught. The professor always allowed students to take extra time if needed for an assignment while keeping everyone learning well. One drawback was the experiential learning credits hours, as they were limited.",
                "Very fun and engaging seminars. Lots of interesting opportunities to interact with TAs and professor outside of class that were helpful as well."

I encourage Spanish speakers to not be afraid to use their Spanish as a tool in this. Rafael is very kind, patient, and overall a great teacher who created a low-stakes environment for us to learn.",
                "Yes absolutely. I felt I learned much more than i had initially expected to and am very satisfied with my experience.",
                "Yes! Portuguese is a beautiful language and learning about the countries in which it is spoken is always fun and enriching. Not at all what I expected from a college language course bc I was actually able to learn from experience\r\nand not memorization!",
                "Definitely. Portuguese is a relatively easy and useful second language for English-speakers and especially for other Romance-language speakers, granting access to nearly 300 million speakers and workplace advantages in Brazil, Portugal, and significant parts of Africa."
