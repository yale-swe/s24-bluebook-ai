A course that focuses entirely on the work of one writer is something that should happen more often at Yale. Being able to read Baldwin from the beginning of his career to the end really puts his work and framework into perspective in a way that would not be possible in another course. Baldwin's writing coupled with Professor Goldsby's guidance makes this the best course at Yale!",
