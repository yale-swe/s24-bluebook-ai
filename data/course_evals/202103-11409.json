A combination of reading, writing, listening, and speaking exercises allowed me to develop each skill equally, and combined with sufficient vocabulary studying, I have the confidence that this course has prepared me for L2 German and has developed my language skills at a pace appropriate for a non-intensive course.",
                "My level of comfort with the German language has increased significantly since I began this course. I now feel comfortable expressing myself conversationally in German, and would say that I have developed a strong foundation on which I can build."

                "I thought overall that this was an extremely well taught and engaging intro language course. Previously I have taken courses (L3 and L4) in the Spanish department, and I would say that this course is a little more time-consuming than what I experienced in the other department. The greatest strengths of this course for me were the complete immersion and focus on speaking and listening in class. The activities were engaging and did not just consist of translating English but learning in German. The greatest weaknesses for me for the class was how much structured work was given outside of class and the intense attendance rules. I would have appreciated fewer activities and more free time so that I could have focused on aspects of the class that I felt weak in and could study more on hard/difficult topics. The amount of work and class was so overwhelming at times that I simply had no drive to do anything but complete the bare minimum of what was asked. Being given more free time would have allowed me to run flashcards, read/write in German, memorize conjugations, etc.",
                "I'm firmly of the view that the strengths and weaknesses of a language course are determined almost exclusively by the strengths and weaknesses of the instructor teaching it. I had Professorin Sippel -- an absolutely amazing instructor -- and as a result the course went extremely well. In terms of the course content itself I think the course weighs each skill appropriately: the in-person learning focuses on speaking, the asynchronous days focus on grammar, and vocabulary is expected to be developed independently (i.e. study it at home rather than wasting time going over it during class -- only pronunciation is worked on during class). Some of the course's components -- such as listening and reading -- are \"trial by fire,\" but that is to be expected for an L1 course. I liked the asynchronous days as they gave a good break from the daily routine, although I might prefer that they be moved to Friday since that'd allow students without other Friday classes to have a free day. Overall, I think the course is extremely well-organized and well-taught, and it was my favorite course of the semester."

                "Yes I would",
                "Absolutely. I've now taken courses in both German and Spanish at Yale, and I'm 100% of the view that if you want to learn a language effectively, Yale is one of the best places to do it. I had learned Spanish, to some extent, almost every year up until 9th grade, and my command of the language then was nowhere near where my command of German is now after just one semester of taking it at Yale. I used to view foreign language classes as a waste of time, but now I take them for fun because they're extremely well-taught here. Everyone considering learning German, and everyone who doesn't know what language to take but has some degree of interest in science and/or music, should strongly consider learning German, particularly if Professorin Sippel is teaching it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is well-structured and well-taught, and regardless of your level of enthusiasm for learning German, I believe you would get something out of this class."
