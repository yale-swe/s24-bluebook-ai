The TAs and Professor Wells were wonderful--some of the best I've had at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports were pretty time consuming. The workload outside of class was very high--especially for a half credit course."

                "The split between zoom and in person was great- sometimes if in person I didn't catch something, knowing that it was available online as well was helpful.",
                "The teaching team put in a lot of effort to make the course accessible to both in person and remote students, and I really appreciated that. However, the hybrid set-up of this course (having some students in person and some students remote) was very challenging at times. There were often technical difficulties (camera problems, audio problems, etc.) on the teaching team's end, and this made it difficult for me to engage with the course as a remote student. I think it would have been very helpful if the teaching team had taken some time at the beginning of the semester to practice using the camera and to work out the technical elements required for the class, so that these difficulties wouldn't have come up so many times over the course of the semester. Additionally, it took quite a long time to receive feedback on any of the lab reports. By the time the first one was graded, we had already handed in almost half of our assignments -- the lack of intermittent feedback made it difficult for me to make adjustments \/ improvements on my subsequent reports.",
