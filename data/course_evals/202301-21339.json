                "I better understood the history of English and debates around the status of English today. Learned about the grammar and spelling of Englishes throughout history and the sociopolitical contexts under which they were created and spoken. Also discussed language more existentially  who creates it, and what it means to speak it in a \"right\" or \"wrong\" manner.",
                "Learned about old english, middle English, and more !!! And how to do text analyses",
                "I learned how the English language developed and changed over time",
                "I developed a general overview of the change in the English language over the past thousand years, and a sense of the issues around language pedagogy.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of the English language, about grammar as well.",
                "I learned so much about the English language! This course dives into the formation of the language, what influenced it over time, and how it has changed throughout history. One of my biggest takeaways is that language is not constant.",
                "We learned how to examine texts critically through a linguists eye. Because the class was such a broad survey of the English language, we learned how to identify periods of English based on linguistic form, function, and meaning, as well as the historical events that characterized each period. We also spent a good amount of time on English grammar.",
                "Five main takeaways:\r\n1. English is constantly changing; when old norms leave the language, new ones swoop in\r\n2. Language doesn't change independently-- people change language, often with sociocultural motives or implications\r\n3. Dialectical variations have been around since the start of English. Judging people's status or credibility based on their speech habits is not a new practice\r\n4. Singular people (Webster, I'm talking to you!) have had monumental effects on the development of English \r\n5. Examining the influx of loan words to English is a unique way to trace historical contact. Depending on the types of words people picked up, you can hypothesize how close and impactful contact was.",
                "This course taught me how to approach text analyses and older texts methodically, showing me how to find meaning in them when taking context into consideration. I became acquainted with the numerous differences that exist between each period of the English language as well as the role that the English language has had in history.",
                "I learned about the history of the English language, how to date a text, how to differentiate between Old English, Middle English, Early Modern English, and Modern English, and about some of the current debates about linguistic equity.",
                "I learned the defining features of Old English, Middle English, and Early Modern English. I learned about the historical and social factors that shape language and our perception of language. I learned about the need for social justice in English and the acceptance of dialects.",
                "A general awareness of the evolution of the English language, from Old English to Middle English to present day."

                "I think it's a really interesting course filled with some fascinating information and a very thoughtful approach to language more generally. I genuinely learned a lot, and i think that the exercises and assignments helped me retain and understand the information. I did sometimes feel like the class was a lecture or structured more like a class I would have taken in high school than a seminar. I would have liked if we could have spent more time on discussion.",
                "Peter grund is an amazing lecturer while also smartly involving students!! Very kind and understanding too without being too personal or overstepping. The content is in a more flipped classroom vibe so it is confusing at first but then good because there is always time to look back at readings later and figure out how to apply thing. Textbook is a little expensive and ran out at first, rent it soon. Good medieval credit!! Feels like a pset class at times. No collaboration allowed",
                "Strengths: I loved the structure of the course! It was great having a seminar-sized group where we could discuss, work together, and freely ask questions. The assignments were challenging but doable if you put in the work, and Peter was always available to help guide you in the right direction. The content of the course was also super interesting! Peter did an incredible job making everything seem relevant. \r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "The course was much more detail-oriented than I expected.",
                "Professor Grund was a huge strength for this class",
                "Loved this course! It was different from any English class I had ever taken, and the group energy was fantastic. Strengths: Professor Grund is wonderful, kind, and passionate. He was very organized when it came to assignments and always willing to make time during office hours. Weaknesses: if you're looking for a classic seminar, this is not for you! It feels a bit more like an intimate lecture with discussion mixed in.",
                "This course was really well structured and organized, so we always knew what to expect in terms of work and assignments. Professor Grund was always enthusiastic and well-prepared in class, ready to clarify any questions or doubts and sharing his extensive knowledge of linguistics and the history of the English language with us.",
                "Overall this course was wonderfully designed. I would suggest cutting down some of the daily assignments, however--it was hard to deeply engage with each of them, and maybe having one assignment due per week instead of one per class might streamline things a bit.",
                "Strengths: Peter's kindness, enthusiasm, and warmth. He loves his subject area and wants us to love it, too! Lots of freedom in creating the final project was a plus. He was also very helpful in suggesting documents for the final project and offering us help and structure if we needed it. Very interesting subject matter.\r\nWeaknesses: The assignments and text analyses could feel like busy work at times; high workload. I would have preferred more literary\/interpretive work rather than technically focused work."

                "If they're interested in learning about the history of English or have an interest in linguistics, absolutely. It was quite a bit of work  I consistently had a large assignment due, and the readings were often paired with additional exercises that meant that I invested a lot of time into this class.",
                "Yes! Good medieval rec and good environment. Can feel like a lot at first but really you have all the tools and support to succeed and it can feel rewarding and Peter grund responds to emails very quickly",
                "Yes!! It's such a unique, interesting course. Definitely not easy, but you'll get so much out of it if you put in the time and work.",
                "I would, but only if you're willing to get into linguistic weeds!",
                "Yes! Especially for English majors looking to fulfill historical requirements",
                "If you are interested at all in the English language (or need a Medieval credit) then definitely!",
                "This is a great way to get any of your major requirements, and Professor Grund is great! I think I would advise taking this only if you have an interest in linguistics- word construction and language properties rather than literature. This isnt a literature course but it is really interesting!! I enjoyed it a lot.",
                "YES! I learned so much and truly reframed my understanding of the sociopolitical consequences of English.",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite classes this semester! Professor Grund is a gem and makes learning so engaging, from the occasional fun facts to in-depth answers to any and every student question. The assignments are built to help you develop skills throughout the semester, and Professor Grund is incredibly helpful throughout the process. You also receive detailed feedback on each assignment so you know where you can improve.",
                "This course is a good way to fulfill the Medieval requirement for the English major. It is an interesting, niche class and I feel like I have left this semester with a lot of knowledge and context regarding the English language. Students should be aware of the high workload within the class and the challenging nature of the text analyses\/assignments. With practice, the assignments will become less challenging but the first few were more challenging as they have a different format that most of the assignments in other English classes.",
                "Yes! I learned so much, and Professor Grund was amazing.",
                "Definitely! I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in how English evolved into the language we speak today and who is interested in issues of linguistic justice. This is much more a linguistics class than an English literature class, so I would warn a student who thought this was a literary survey course away from this class. The course summary on YCS said that we would work with authors such as Milton, Shakespeare, Austen, and Cardi B, but really we just worked from textbooks.",
                "One thing to know is that the class is too big to be a discussion-based seminar, but too small to be a pure lecture, so the class ends up functioning and feeling like a high school class. A good medieval credit for the English major."
