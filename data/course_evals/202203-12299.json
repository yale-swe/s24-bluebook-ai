Setting up conferences each week was a bit of a hassle, so it would be nice if we could've gone in person and chatted with Louise rather than through phone. I wish that there were fewer, but longer reading responses; perhaps three or four. I felt as though I was pumping out one after another each week, and ended up not being attached to many of them.",
                "This course was a great workshop course. The strengths were small class size, intense personal attention and comments, and the willingness of Professor Gluck to give critical feedback on the poems. The level to which we dug into / reworked / scrapped poems was not something I had done before, and I found it incredibly generative, instructive, and freeing. The classes where we met in person were by far the best, because you can see how others' poems are being workshopped, which gets you out of the groove of your own work and somewhere else. Hearing these comments were also just helpful. The weekly phone calls were also helpful, but certainly not as much as the class time. The mailing / week-to-week assignments were a bit difficult to keep track of, so perhaps some more streamlining / refining here would be good."

I have learned so much about my own writing process, how to edit well, and how to speak about the poems I love so much better over the course of this semester. The class was both an opportunity to deep-dive and incredibly expansive experience in terms of my own work / the process of workshopping / reading and speaking about poetry."
