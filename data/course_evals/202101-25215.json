                "This course is a great introduction to ethnography as a mode as well as what it means for an ethnography to be queer and feminist. The variety of different subjects covered in the books really encourage different ways of thinking. Im positive any student could find something transformative to take away from both the readings and the discussion.",
                "I learned to think critically about how the language and vernacular I use in my writing reflects my personal biases and how it is perceived y myself versus outsiders. I learned writing skills and literary analysis.",
                "I gained a greater understanding of feminist and queer ethnography as a genre and as critical analytical framework. Additionally, I also gained considerable insight into the literature of feminist and queer ethnography by reading several ethnographies through the lens of dystopia and disaster, which in turn gave me the analytical skillset to analyze topics related to extinction, climate change, and how they intersect with settler colonialism and transnational economic systems.",
                "I think this class was so helpful in learning about different perspectives and ways of imagining the world. Also, helping us establish critical skills in how to engage with the material and the traps of global capitalism (including methods like statecraft).",
                "I learned broadly about the practice of ethnography through feminist and queer theory lenses. We read a text a week and discussed the themes, methods, and analyses in both small and big groups. We discussed the moral and ethical implications of doing anthropology in the wake of the violence on which the field is predicated. We also focused on dystopian realities and the alternatives in the midst of the constant end of the world.",
                "Exposure to ethnographic texts, how to approach and study such texts, discuss difficult thematic topics in the content and think critically about anthropological work.",
                "The course was divided into three units, each of which included a set of ethnographies that we used as occasions for hazarding answers to those questions that headlined each unit. The first unit, \"Epistemologies,\" asked what kinds of forms of knowledge production are both responsible for the perpetual catastrophes in which we find ourselves, as well as inquired into the kinds of epistemologies that might resist it. The second unit, \"Etiologies,\" asked how we might understand the varied causes of the various dystopias, catastrophes, and extinctions that the ethnographies we were reading depicted. The third unit, \"Methodologies,\" asked about what kinds of methodologies are appropriate for ethnographers who are looking to conjure up speculative fabulations for a \"world to come.\" The ethnographies we read covered subjects ranging from hunger in Brazil to US border policy to orangutan rehabilitation and so much more. \r\n\r\nBeyond these broad divisions, I learned so much from our collective readings and interpretations of each ethnography. Getting to read a full book per week instead of just selected chapters gave us the opportunity to really dissect what the ethnographies we were reading were trying to do, and how they succeeded or failed to achieve their goals. Professor Pepi also was able to get several of the ethnographers to come speak to our class, which was such a special experience."

                "strengths: the professor! she creates such a great class environment (even over zoom) where students can feel comfortable even when we have differing opinions about the books. another strength is the setup of reading a book per week. before starting the class, it felt daunting, but i feel like i really gained a lot from having read entire books rather than just parts of them. also having some of the authors come for Q&As was such an incredible experience.\r\nweaknesses: none!",
                "I appreciated that the professor was flexible and understanding. The professor encouraged students to make this course personal and she encouraged collaboration between students. The daily \"check-ins\" were one of the key things that made this online discussion\/seminar not feel like a waste of time, because we knew that she cared. The course was well thought out, and the assignments encouraged us to think critically about the pieces.",
                "This was a well-developed course that would only have benefitted from a Spring Break, which is unfortunately outside the control of the professor.",
                "I know the book-a-week format can be really intimidating but Professor Pepi chooses really engaging books and getting the entire scope of an ethnography was a major benefit of the class and helped facilitate a lot of our discussions. Professor Pepi was a major asset to this class and helped create an open class environment while providing such insights for us. She's so dedicated to her teaching and being accessible to her students. Her work in getting authors to come visit the class was amazing and the author visits allowed us to interact with the material in an even deeper way and gave us an insight into the ethnographic process.",
                "This course was awesome! I loved most of the readings and liked the mix of small and big group discussions. I also liked the suggested films and the daily check-ins.",
                "I wouldnt say there are many weaknesses to improve upon. Strengths include a very knowledgeable professor, wonderfully rich readings, and an intimate class setting.",
                "Strengths: the readings, which were all absolutely incredible; the students, whose camaraderie and ability to engage such challenging (both intellectually and emotionally) material with attentiveness and care made the class so amazing; and, of course, Professor Pepi! \r\nWeaknesses: I truly cannot think of a thing to say."

Professor Pepi facilitates a really great discussion in the course and. Professor Pepi and her dedication to the materials and providing background was wonderful. This was one of my favorite classes this semester hand-down and I always looked forward to discussing the ethnographies in class.",

It will challenge your sense of historical progress. It will force you to reckon with the legacies of slavery, settler colonialism, racial capitalism, and indigenous dispossession. It will help you see why a feminist and queer approach should be absolutely central to any empirical engagement with the world at hand."
