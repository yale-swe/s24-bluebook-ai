                "My writing skills have vastly improved. I also went from knowing quite literally nothing about Central Asia to understanding many of its cultural and historical nuances. In this class, I filled in a hole in my understanding of the world. I also became comfortable with college seminars, and made a lot of close freshmen friends.",
                "I gained a lot of insight into Central Asia, which is a mostly obscure place that not a lot of people see as an individual section of the world. Rather, many people, including myself, connect Central Asia with East Asia, which takes away from its individuality and identity. I think this course does a great job countering these stereotypes and preconceptions.",
                "I learned a lot about Central Asia and I loved the structure of this class.",
                "This course helped me a lot with my writing. I learned how to write persuasively through the writing workshops that prof. Roosien incorporated in the class. I also learned how to read academic papers through the assigned readings.",
                "Taking this course has given me an extraordinarily broad insight into Central Asian societies. It has also allowed me to hone my writing skills.",
                "I learned a lot about the history, cultures, and components of everyday life in Central Asia. I also practiced my paper-writing skills and laid foundations for research skills.",
                "I gained so much knowledge of Central Asian culture, an area that was extremely overlooked by my high school curriculum. I also learned how to properly write a research paper which is something I was very weak at previously.",
                "Improved my ability to write college papers and read scholarly articles",
                "I learned a lot not only about Central Asia but also about reading academic papers efficiently and navigating academic journals and resources."

                "Strengths: Very well organized course, great professor, really cool field trip\r\nWeaknesses: Readings are quite dense. As someone with zero prior knowledge in Central Asia, the content was hard to keep up with sometimes.",
                "This course is an amazing introduction to seminars and humanities courses at Yale. Our professor is amazing, the field trip to New York and visit by Uyghur activists were extremely informative, and the book we read was great. Every class was interesting and focused on something new about Central Asia. I cannot think of weaknesses about this course at the moment  it was pretty ideal.",
                "Strength: Very interactive, discussion-led class. Prof Roosien creates a nice balance between lecture and discussions. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The pre-midterm materials very very straighforward. However, after the city part, I was sometimes unsure about the takeaways of the class. A clear recap\/organization to clarify learning materials may be helpful.",
                "I didn't particularly like the emphasis on music and the textbook that we used, because the reading with the textbook MOCA requires musical background to really understand the significance of the reading and instruments. I did like that we had a field trip to Queens to visit the Bukharan Jewish community and our in-person meeting with Uyghur activists because it gave me a firsthand account of their experiences and history.",
                "I love how the class was so discussion based.",
                "This class was amazing because of the small group and how prof. Roosien facilitated the discussions. There weren't any weaknesses.",
                "This course excels at being engaging and keeping the material interesting. I think it would be better supplemented with less analysis, and more historical background information. Furthermore, the amount of readings can be exhausting, especially when they're supposed to be interpreted rather than informative.",
                "very broad and at times boring but different topic that Ive never learned about",
                "Strengths: very interesting content and Professor Roosien was very accessible for office hours. Weaknesses: at times feedback was unclear, making papers difficult to improve.",
                "Strengths - Professor Roosien is extremely knowledgeable in her field and you can tell that from the way she designed the course. I learned so much! Weaknesses - Some of the readings were a bit dry (although there were plenty that weren't!) and I sometimes wish there was more time spent discussing a specific topic over the course of multiple days.",
                "Strengths: Very organized and interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeakness: Readings were a bit long",

            "comments": [
                "If you're interested in history, the Soviet Union, or Central Asia, this is probably a really wonderful class. However, if you aren't, this course can be really challenging for a first-year seminar since, to me, it felt like it assumed quite a lot of background knowledge. This class definitely isn't easy for a first-year seminar and requires you to put in a lot of work although the professor is super supportative. Professor Roosien really pushes you to think deeper about the readings and Central Asia which is great but can become slightly overwhelming at times. The essay assignment topics were not personally my favorite and were challenging. I did enjoy how reflective this class was, though, despite it not being directly related to my major and interests.",
                "I recommend this course to all freshmen, who are interested in anything. The students in my class had a wide range of interests and prospective majors, and we all enjoyed the course. What tied us all together is that we had a genuine interest in learning more about a part of the world which we knew nothing about.",
                "yes, it is a great first year seminar.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The class was well taught and informed me about histories that I would not have otherwise explored.",
                "Yes, this was my favorite class this semester.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their academic interests! I think this course is one of those hidden gem classes at Yale.",
                "if they are interested in the topic and broad discussions",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning more about Central Asia and building their research skills.",
                "If you are even remotely interested in Central Asia, yes! The course works well as a first-year seminar and was a good introduction to how things work in college\/Yale.",
                "Yes I would. Great first year class and introduction to college-style writing.",
                "I would 100% recommend it. Professor Roosien is amazing and the subject matter is fascinating."
