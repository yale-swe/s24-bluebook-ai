                "I learned new ways of engaging with the objects that make up the world around me in this class. Instead of taking the ceramics in the dining halls and wooden desks in our dorms for granted, I now have a deeper appreciation for how these objects are made and why they look and operate the way they do. Before this class, I had never considered how the pattern on my scarf came to end up on my scarf or why blue porcelains are so ubiquitous. It was fascinating to learn about the global cross-talk that influences the objects that are a part of our day-to-day lives.",
                "Gained deeper appreciation for everyday objects",
                "This class was quite different from other art history classes in that we stepped away from the \"fine\" arts and spent time looking at things that might otherwise be excluded. I learned a lot about material literacy and how to approach objects.",
                "basic subject knowledge about ceramics, textile, wood, and metals; how to close read an object; how to write a good museum label; how to critically evaluate what is displayed in museums and how and what is not; how to be curious and humble",
                "The ability to observe and analyze objects up close. The class made me think about the origin, making, function, and circulation of the objects. Such an incredible course.",
                "This is a class that teaches you to think beyond the confines of the perceptions of art works and museum etiquettes. First of all, I've learned more about what can be classified as art: art is not just the Renaissance art, impressionist art that we think of, but it can be and is the thing that surrounds us. I've learned so much about materials that I would otherwise not take a second look at: take the grooves of the wooden table as an example. I've learned so much about the purpose of an object, the deliberate choice of the maker, and how these things make an object meaningful.",
                "It should be noted that this course focuses on decorative arts, or objects that are often in everyday life. This is in contrast to fine art, like paintings or sculptures. In the first half of the course, I learned about four types of materials in the first half of the course. The second half of the course introduced important concepts in art history, like the impact of trade nodes, the distinctions between necessities and luxuries.",
                "I learned about materials within the categories of ceramic, wood, metal, and textiles. I learned about different technologies, decoration, and fabrication techniques within these categories.",
                "Good survey course on decorative arts.",
                "A broad knowledge of different techniques for making textiles, ceramics, woodworking, and metalworking. I learned how to do things like identify a lot of different techniques and materials by sight\/touch, see signs of different techniques, and about the history of techniques\/patterns\/etc.",
                "I learned to understand an object simply by holding it in my hands. I learned the intricacies of global trade, why we value what we value, and the power of touch.",
                "Ive develop an appreciation of the object arts.",
                "So many! I feel like I truly understand the importance of objects in our everyday world.",
                "How to analyze decorative objects and their origins",
                "The making process of objects, which is so rarely mentioned now in the industrial world, our relationship with objects, and the cultural interchange behind the circulation of objects. Everything taught in this class is very relatable to our daily life.",
                "This was a great course since Professor Cooke is simply encyclopedic. I learned a great deal about materials and this is certainly a class for those interested in the experience of art and\/or handcraft people.",
                "I become more conscious about my material environment and I learnt many professional vocabulary to analyze the movement and exchange of objects",
                "I learned how to investigate the fabrication and decoration techniques of different objects. I have a richer understanding of materials and their history, and the way objects play into various colonial dynamics and trade networks.",
                "I learned the basics of art about objects and their production process such as materiality and labor!",
                "I developed really valuable skills in comprehending objects, from those I see in museums to those I interact with on a day-to-day basis. The emphasis on touch and exploration through handling objects through the Yale Art Gallery was insightful. I learned how to write art history essays and object labels and actually got a lot of feedback on my writing, more than in my English class!",
                "This course focused on building viewing skills and a basic knowledge of global decorative art forms + materials.",

                "I gained the ability to look at objects from the \"inside out.\" I also learned an eloquent vocabulary on how to talk about objects' make, decoration, etc. This class also gave me an appreciation for the decorative arts and museum curation, guiding me in an interest in studying art history at Yale.",
                "I learned about how different decorative arts were made and about the materials they were made from in the first half of the semester, and then about interchange and cultural significance of them.",
                "Developing the vocabulary to discuss methods of craftsmanship, how to identify techniques and historical contexts of ubiquitous trends in decorative arts, considering the curation practices of museums and the history of galleries",
                "I developed the ability to look closely at objects and analyze their materials, workmanship, and decoration, thinking more critically about the ways objects and their histories have been shaped through cross-cultural interchange."

            "comments": [
                "I enjoyed the flipped classroom approach to the course this semester. I liked that I could watch the lectures in my own time (using 1.5x speed when in a rush) and that in-person classes were intended to be engaging and conversational. Professor Cooke did a great job of eliciting interesting responses to questions in our open forums, and I really enjoyed having the extra chance to handle objects in our Thursday classes. The highlight of this class were the section meetings in the art gallery. Touching and handling objects was so cool and something I never thought I would have the chance to try. If I were to change anything, I would ask that fewer readings or smaller chunks of readings be assigned for the second half of the course. Some weeks there was just so much reading that I didn't know what to focus in on.",
                "Enjoyed sections at YUAG",
                "I did not like the recorded lecture and open forum format taken this semester. It increased the workload outside of class and made going to lecture unnecessary unless we had specific questions to ask. I would have preferred that the in-person lectures were recorded so we would have the flexibility of learning the material outside of class if needed but could also learn the material during scheduled lectures.",
                "Strengths - The biggest strength of the course (and the reason I took it) was the sections in the YUAG object study room. Being able to handle the objects greatly helped my understanding of the course material, and it wouldn't have been the same experience otherwise. I also enjoyed the museum label assignments throughout the semester as they were good short exercises in art history writing. Weaknesses - I don't think we spent enough time learning how to write in the art history field, outside of the short museum labels. I felt greatly underprepared for the final exam as we had never written more than 200 words for an assignment, outside of the midterm exam's essay which was also difficult.",
                "strengths: weekly sections in the yale art gallery where we got to handle objects and look at them closely; professor Cooke is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the course materials which makes the experience exciting; TFs are well-prepared to lead informed and organized sections; lectures, readings, professor, sections, museum labels, making exercise all equipped me with material literacy and changed the way I see and analyze the world \r\nweaknesses: none",
                "The required workload is light. There are a lot of additional readings but they are all optional and very interesting.\r\nThe pre-recorded lectures can be confusing sometimes but that could be a special circumstance due to Covid.",
                "I really liked our weekly sections in the Art Gallery, and how close my section has gotten; shout out to Friday 1:30 Section!! Some small things that can be improved: I think there could've been more organization with the reading assignments and an easier way for students to submit questions for the open forum class, but I really liked the format of the class with online lectures, and in person discussion.",
                "Strengths: Professor Cooke was very knowledgeable about everything we talked about in class, section in the art gallery was amazing\r\nWeaknesses: The outside lectures we had to watch were pretty dense and sometimes would be a little redundant to what we had in class. I wish we could have just had those lectures in class. Although, I did like being able to pause, take notes, and go back to the recorded lectures when I needed to review. I also thought the final was a bit much. We had to write ~2000 words in 24 hours which was pretty stressful since we didn't have too much guidance on what was going to be on the final.",
                "I like that the course was so hands-on! I looked forward to having section in the object study classroom each week, and felt that this hands-on component allowed me to engage with the class material in a way that I hadn't before in other art history classes.",
                "Strengths-- I personally found the material interesting, although I can see how others might find it slightly dry. Its very specific, and some aspects are memorization focused, which I think leaves you with a lot of meaningful knowledge from the class, but this was directly connected to my major. The assignments are all light (150 word paragraphs are several of them) and generally interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-- I did not like the flipped classroom setup where you listen to lectures at home then go into class and just ask questions or look at objects. Looking at objects was fine (although we already did this every week in section, in more depth and in a much more applied way) but the sections where we just were expected to come in with questions were quite useless. Plus, having to watch recorded lectures at home PLUS having expected readings made the class way more heavy than it should be.",
                "The museum discussion sections are great. You have an opportunity to touch objects that you would normally only get to see behind glass. It definitely opens your eyes more to thinking about how everyday objects are made.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a good idea in theory, the recorded lectures can be hard to keep up with.",
                "This course was my favorite Yale course I've ever taken. Professor Cooke teaches so we learn, not so he can brag about how difficult his class is. The class videos can be a little tedious, but if you watch them one by one (as you're supposed to) they're easy to get through. My TA was super kind and attentive. Would take this course again on the flip of a dime. It has inspired me to pursue art history.",
                "I really enjoyed section at the YUAG.",
                "I feel like the combination of video lectures and in-person lectures was a bit too much.",
                "The first half was great and interesting, but the second half of the course was less organized than the first, and class time was repetitive. For the second half of the course, I think we should have had readings for homework and then had real lectures in class instead of the recorded lectures.",
                "Working with the objects is a must in this class. It was awesome.",
                "Strength: We meet in the YUAG study room for section, observe the objects in person and more importantly, get to touch the objects to experience the haptic quality. This is so rare to have the opportunity touching objects in a museum.",
                "The course is structured really well and most of the TAs were great. I really enjoyed the lecture, open forum and then section format because it really got information to me. There were definitely some weeks that couldve done with more section time in the gallery than open forum, but that was a rare happening.",
                "Listening to recorded lectures is not extremely engaging",
                "The strengths of this course are that we get to interact with objects in the YUAG during section. This was a very unique aspect of the class that I have not seen in any other course I have enrolled in at Yale. I learned a lot through this hands on learning. However, sometimes the sections went long, and we were held late. I found the in-person lectures to be uninformative. They related to the content in the recorded lectures, but did not feel necessary to the course. I would have liked to have the material in the recorded lectures taught in person.",
                "The organization did not make a lot of sense, because students watch hours of class video lectures outside of class, and have section in person, and then spend just as much time in class as if one had not already watched the videos. It seems that returning to a more traditional lecture format would make a lot more sense, because the class days were required, but not very helpful for learning.",
                "strengths: the sections, TA, and hands-on learning\r\nweakness: the format of lectures and live discussions didn't seem to be too helpful for the course",
                "The beginning of the course was quite simple and the online lectures were not the most stimulating or engaging. I wished I had taken advantage of everything the course had, since Professor Cooke is so knowledgable, including the readings and everything but I thought they were just additional until it was too late. Small thing, but the mob scene around the object table at the end of the in-person classes was really aggravating and made me feel claustrophobic; I eventually started skipping that part of class.",
                "long lectures online and in person-- could have been condensed, perhaps not had the online ones. liked the open forum and case study ideas though.",
                "I think that the structure of this class was ideal in laying out the information - the lectures for homework, supplemented with the in-person discussions with Professor Cooke and the handling of the objects in section. Although the assignments were intellectually stimulating, I think we could have had one longer essay on an object (this would have also prepared us for the final exam).",
                "There were two types of lectures we had to watch, in person and recorded lectures, which would repeat information.",
                "My favorite parts of the course were the sections because they provided a unique opportunity to touch exhibit objects. Through this tactile experience, I think I gained a better understanding of the weight, decoration, and utilitarian use of the objects. While I understand in hindsight the emphasis on terminology during the first half of the class, I think that the midterm itself was overwhelming. I think implementing a way to further reinforce terminology in the future would make the midterm less stressful.",
                "This course was very strong for visual and tactile learners. Between the course lectures, in person class with objects brought in by Professor Cooke that could be viewed \/ handled after class, and the object study sessions in the art gallery, I felt like my learning was supported. The TFs are really great and want you to succeed, providing ample opportunities for help. A weakness might be the length of the asynchronous lectures which could be a bit dry at time, but dont let that deter you from taking this course because they provide foundational knowledge as well."

You also will never look at a dinner set or shawl the same way after taking this class. The world of objects is so much more interesting and complex than I ever would have expected. Also, this class assumes no background knowledge, yet is still fascinating if you do have background knowledge; this is the perfect course whether you are a STEM major seeking that last humanities credit or an art history major.",
                "This is a really fascinating, fairly low workload course. You can choose to go in as much depth as you want into the materials and\/or more sociocultural aspects of objects. The lecture videos really made for some very interesting Wikipedia rabbit holes.",
                "Yes. Course material was very interesting and applicable",
                "I would recommend this class to any art history major or those interested in art.",
                "YES! It was the dark horse of my semester. I found myself touching and looking at things in my daily life (socks, wooden chairs, coffee mugs etc) I would have normally overlooked. Amazing professor who is knowledgeable and passionate about the history of art and global decorative arts; TFs who are well-prepared to lead sections; discussion sections in the art gallery where we get to touch and close read objects; I will say, this class is what you make out of it: I can totally see how this class could be a gut humanities credit for a stem major given its interesting material and light workload, BUT if you really spend time thinking and reflecting about the materials and follow up with prof Cooke about your questions and interests you will gain so much more from this class",
                "Definitely! A very fun humanity credit that actually lets you learn something. This course got me looking at things in a whole new light",
                "Yes, this is one of the few classes that will allow you to have section in the Yale University Art Gallery and allow you to TOUCH the objects. It is also a super interesting course, which explores a wide diversity of objects in terms of its origin (from Gujarat, India to China to Japan to West Africa to Mesoamerica). This class has allowed me to understand an object more deeply, and almost treats the investigation of an object like a puzzle. I really like the idea of thinking about how an object is made, the deliberate decisions of the maker, and how that has attributed the object to be in the state that it is. We also talk a lot about exchange, and how the migration of artisans and trade has affected the meaning of an object.",
                "Yes, it is a very interesting course, for both art history majors and those who are not!",
                "I would recommend this course because you gain a lot of cool perspectives on the materials around you, you get to spend time in the art galley, and the workload isn't too bad",
                "Yes! Great course for majors and non-majors.",
                "Probably yes, if they are interested in the content. This isn't quite a gut considering that the midterm exam was quite difficult, and the sections require real knowledge, even though the rest of the assignments are not very difficult and the course material is interesting.",

My TA, Isabella, was awesome and Professor Cooke was really knowledgable and I wished that I'd asked more questions and took the course a little more seriously. Regardless, I learned so much and my outlook on life and the objects that we interact with has changed completely.

                "I would recommend this course to another student - it was hands-on learning in an intro-level class, it provided me a completely different and new set of knowledge, and through section I was able to talk about and apply the knowledge I was learning to specific objects.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Please take this course no matter what your major is. The hands-on (literally, we were able to study the objects from the museum with our hands) approach to this course made it memorable. I really enjoyed writing the museum labels and papers for this class, it was a creative assignment that completely changed the way I interact with museums.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student with a vested interest in decorative arts and a background loosely related to this field. If you are not really interested in decorative arts, I think the first part of this class (which focuses on terminology) can be slightly overwhelming. Often I felt as though I needed to have weaved or made ceramics before to understand the actual process of some of the terminology we used. However, the sections where you can touch museum exhibit objects are really interesting and the second part of the class, which focuses on object use and analysis, is more interesting. Be prepared to dedicate time to the midterm!!",
                "Definitely take this class!!! Professor Cooke is really great and always stays after class to answer questions. If you want to be able to go into art museums and have a better understanding of the objects, furniture, and ceramics etc that you see and how they were made \/ how interchange has affected patterns of workmanship and imagery throughout the world, this class is a must."
