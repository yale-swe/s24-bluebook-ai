                "This class was one of the most useful class that I've taken. So much of this world makes sense after learning about the markets, competition, and behavior of people within the economy. I honestly apply what I've learned to everyday life.",

Besides knowledge specific to economics, I think some of the techniques we learned like marginal analysis is applicable to problems in other subjects as well. It connected very well with what we learned in MATH 120, and the economics helped me to get a more intuitive grasp of the math.",

But they would rather be teaching advanced topics and not basic algebra to 500 students. If you have done AP, IB, or read a textbook on micro, don't do 115.",
                "I gained a good understanding for the basic mechanics of microeconomics in terms of supply and demand, cost-benefit analysis, production functions, as well as their real-world applications. The first part of the course was heavily centered around the idea of the \"perfectly competitive\" market and how it functions in a hypothetical sense, while the second part focused much more on how the markets are in reality (ex: monopolies, oligopolies, externalities) and how certain permutations of the market can result in different outcomes for the producer and consumer.",

Learned about supply & demand; the effect of excise taxes; the production function; monopolies; oligopolies; externalities; risk and present value; substitution and income effect; etc. I couldn't list everything out, but I feel like I have a much more critical eye when I choose to analyze a situation from a detached point of view.",

I felt like I learned how to do that well. The course focused primarily on positive analysis (undisputable facts about how things do\/don't work), which helped to develop the economist line of thinking. When we did look at normative analysis (right\/wrong, moral questions about how things should\/shouldn't work), it was particularly interesting to see how the idea of \"thinking like an economist\" transferred over to those types of questions.",

            "comments": [
                "Strenghts- a lot of opportunities besides the main lecture to learn concepts - games, special activities, discussion sections, review sessions. Fair grading and assignments. Engaging lectures. Incredible professors and TA'S.\r\nNo weakness.",
                "Practice for midterms did not always properly reflect the actual tests themselves",
                "The peer tutors are amazing!!! There is always Office Hours going on which was super helpful!",
                "The strengths are that the teachers are great. The content itself is a little difficult and abstract at times, but they did a good job of navigating us through it. I would say the weaknesses are that the TA's were not always on the same page as what was being taught since they did not attend lectures. Some of them are grad students who are certainly qualified to help us, but they may explain it in a way that we did not learn which can almost make things confusing to be told two different methods about the same topic.",
                "I loved professor Berry and Polak. They are the best!",
                "Professors are excellent at lecturing, the content is relatively accessible.",
                "The classes are way too long!! Could be condensed and this would improve engagement as well!",
                "Strengths: Lots of office hours, review sessions, etc; able to drop 2 problem sets, weekly homework not too overloaded. \r\nWeaknesses: Weird grading. For both of the midterms, which are 1\/2 the class grade, the score is \"curved\", but not really. An approximate point range was sent out for each letter grade (like less than 35\/75 = C, 35-55 out of = B, 55+ = A), but the actual grades weren't assigned specific grades or reflected in Canvas. If you're anxious or like to know your exact amount of points, it can be confusing.",
                "I think this course gives many resources to succeed! A weakness could be that it goes through a lot of material quickly.",
                "The production quality of the lectures and the availability of office hours was a huge positive for this course. The professors were fantastic and had great perspectives on everything from the course content, to being a student at Yale, to real-world events. \r\n\r\nThe pace of the lectures felt very slow at times, while on other occasions a topic that ended up being on exams was scarcely covered. This was most noticeable on the second midterm, where most of the class performed very poorly because it felt like the exam content was much different and much more difficult than the class content.",
                "Strengths: the content is very well organized throughout the semester; the problem sets are well designed and help reinforce what was learned in class; the professors are very experienced; many concepts that we learned were explained using both graphs and algebra.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures could be a bit slow at times (although this may be the result of the virtual format); one or two problem sets took significantly longer than the others to complete because of the length of the questions.",
                "The organization of this course was a strength. The class did a good job of teaching essential knowledge for microeconomics. However, some exam questions felt unnecessarily difficult and were not directly covered by the course. Besides that, everything else was good.",
                "Strengths: relatively simple information if you are good at math\/logical reasoning. I'm not.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lots of information, not very interesting if you don't really enjoy Economics, curve is killer.",
                "A strength is that it covers many interesting topics and goes into some depth about how the concepts we are learning show up in real life (i.e. the discussion about examples of price discrimination).\r\n\r\nA slight weakness would be the large amount of students can make it difficult to be heard, but that issue is largely alleviated by office hours and discussion sections.",
                "It didn't feel as if the problem sets were comparable in terms of difficulty to many of the problems present on the midterm exams and final.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course are its asynchronous nature, the focus on how to use the concepts learned to come to our own conclusions, and the extra activities created by the professors on Mondays and Fridays (Mon-an extra session to go over 1 problem in the pset, Fri-an extra session for extensions and applications of the concepts learned that week, i.e. a focus on COVID).  The biggest weakness was the lack of connectivity between the oldest concepts and the newest. It would have been helpful to have an extra session or something, not necessarily for review, but just to get the big picture of the concepts we learned and how some of them connect.",
                "Lectures were disorganised and rambling. Class held outside of scheduled hours. Professors unresponsive to student concerns. Discussion sections pointless. No feedback given on any exams or problem sets.",
                "Strengths is that everything was recorded and posted. They did a great job accommodating to the pandemic by answering questions in the P-Set and giving extra lectures and so much study material.\r\nWeaknesses was that this years lectures were way harder then the previous years but they are curved so it doesn't matter much.",
                "The lectures done over Zoom were very good. They were engaging and were just as effective as a large in-person lecture.",
                "It can be very easy to feel lost and alone throughout the course. The peer tutoring sessions, however, help you find a community and people to work with.",
                "The number of staff members involved with this course is phenomenal. Not only did we have Steve and Ben in lecture, but the TA's and section leaders' office hours were in no short supply.",
                "It's hard to say given the COVID-19 situation, which makes it so that the Fall 2020 course format will likely not be repeated in future years. I personally enjoyed Professor Berry's and Professor Polak's high level of enthusiasm. It was somewhat contagious and helped keep me engaged even though it was an online lecture course.",
                "This course is a good introduction to microeconomics for someone who has essentially no background in economics at all. However, it it taught at a math level that is too low for someone who has a strong mathematics background. As someone who expected an introductory microeconomics class to consider at least the basics of calculus (e.g. derivatives), I was disappointed when I learned (from the syllabus and the first lecture) that we would not be doing any math beyond algebra. While I understand that that is necessary for the least math-experienced student understand what is happening, the class was not very engaging for me as a result. As a follow-up to that comment, much of the math in economics seemed \"hand-wavy\" (for lack of a better expression) because of this absence of harder mathematics. We did not need to go into partial derivatives of multivariable functions, and even non-linear functions are not often used. Again, Economics 115 is a good introductory course for someone who is interested in Economics and does not have a strong mathematics background, but it is lacking in the rigor necessary to keep more advanced mathematics students interested. I understand certain things \"have to be saved for Intermediate\" microeconomics, but I think this course saves a little too much.",
                "Lectures often left me dazed and confused. It was only until sections, PSETS, and activities that I began making the connections and concepts that lectures laid out.",
                "There are a wealth of resources, OHs, sections, peer tutor hours, and recordings provided by the teaching team and all of these were very helpful.",
                "The course has great professors and a great team overall, including TFs and the other faculty that helped organize the course. Also, being a very large lecture class, it was very easy to work together with other students. However, it was too easy to become disengaged with the class because of its large class size, and even more easy to become disengaged this semester because the class was on Zoom. That's not a weakness of the class, but more of a comment on myself that I prefer smaller seminar-style classes as opposed to large lectures (usually).",
                "Great professor and pretty interesting material.",
                "The class provides a solid basis for future studies in economics. The course is very refined, and there is little room for improvement.",
                "This class's lectures were overall fantastic, although a few topics were, in my opinion, explained a bit less than they should've been. I very much appreciate how the course seemed to build over time, using old material on new concepts, and I also appreciate all of the help provided to us through study groups, sections, flipped classrooms, etc. My biggest wish would honestly just be for more immersive lectures, but I'm sure that's simply a Zoom issue, since the professors themselves were amazing.",
                "A strength of the course was the very experienced faculty. A weakness was the curse's size, which made it very difficult to know our professors peronally.",
                "I think this course is a very good introduction to microeconomics as it provides a broad overview of the subjects. Additionally, there was not that much math involved so I think this is a very easily accessible course to take and understand the material for it. Similarly, the problem sets were always manageable and the exams were not too difficult.",
                "The lecture was very long, with little engagement because it's such a large class. Definitely one of the harder obstacles to overcome in this online era. However, the special activity, flipped session, and discussion sections really helped with that.",
                "Strengths - professors kept zoom classes lively and were clearly actually interested in the information they taught us. All the information was presented in a comprehensive manner, and I never  felt like I was drowning in too much new information. Especially with all the office hours available throughout the week, if I ever didn't understand something there were ample resources to ask questions and clarify. \r\nWeakness - Honestly nothing super in particular.",
                "Strengths are the problem sets to learn how to apply lecture material to questions. Weaknesses are the lack of question like material in lectures.",
                "Strengths-\r\nPeer Tutor Joe Ribaudo!!!!!!!\r\nBen Polak, \r\ninteresting material, nice professors, organized\r\nWeakness-\r\nExams extremely hard; curve was astronomical (30% exam scores became B's)\r\nStudying felt pointless\r\nThe large lecture makes engagement difficult",
                "The content covered in the course was interesting, and there were many opportunities to engage with the material.",
                "Strengths - Lots of TAs and help. PSETS were thorough and good practice for exams. \r\nWeaknesses - Large class size and mixing kids of different econ backgrounds made learning harder. With over 400 kids in one class, half of the class was extremely knowledgeable about economics while the other half severely struggled. Because of this, many important concepts in lecture were skimmed or brushed over because it was supposed to be an intuitive topic derived from something else already discussed. Ex. Subsidy from Pigouvian Tax. However, these are not concepts that people who struggled would have ever been able to derive without serious study and careful explanation. This gap made an uncomfortable mesh between reviewing concepts for the top and explaining things slowly for those who struggled. I think it was okay overall, but I remember wanting to review concepts in the recordings, only to find out that the professor had skipped those slides in presentation.",
                "I don't think there were many weaknesses, I liked the professors and my TF. I think the one part that could be improved was that we didn't always cover the material from the readings in class, so possibly more coordination between the assigned readings and lecture material, but I also took the assigned readings from a syllabus draft so it might've been outdated.",
                "Strengths are that it is one of the largest undergraduate courses at Yale, so most first-years were enrolled and taking the class. The professors are stellar, especially Ben Polak and Steve Barry, and it is well-organized. The material in lecture was not always relevant to the actual application on problem sets and exams, so if that bridge could be more clear it would be much a better experience.",
                "The virtual lecture style was not conducive to a very engaging class",
                "Strengths: Professor Barry and Professor Polak are amazing. They're enthusiastic, funny, explain material clearly, and very well organized. Workload was also low (one problem set per week that didn't take too long), material was important and generally interesting (although dull in nature at times), and exams were fair with plenty of study materials provided. I don't think the course had any major weaknesses.",
                "It didn't hold students accountable for learning the material which is a very abrupt transition since most students are first years. It'll be better to make discussion sections a requirement.",
                "strengths - good teaching staff, effective communicators, i like the virtual form of notes\r\n\r\nweaknesses - let the other professor teach more",
                "Strengths: Broad exposure to a lot of topics, while also keeping some consistent themes.\r\nWeaknesses: Very lecture heavy so disengaging sometimes.",
                "Approximately 400 kids on a zoom call doesn't really work. If Professor Berry and Professor Polak taught at separate times, the class would probably be slightly more engaging. A strength is definitely the amount of review material they provide because you get to do a lot of practice before your exams.",
                "I felt like the information we learned in lecture wasn't what ended up being asked on psets or exams; there was a lot of help available though if you had questions. Also, I felt like the Friday sessions were a waste of time. Two classes a week, plus the Monday flipped classroom activity (which was helpful), plus the discussion section, plus the Friday activity was just too much. Most of it at least felt useful, except the Friday activity.",
                "It is very hard to engage hundreds of students over zoom. I appreciated the polls and other interjections to offer variations to the learning.",
                "it was really engaging and intriguing",
                "class was good and straightforward",
                "Strengths - Great Profs\r\nWeaknesses - Few study resources, papers or interactions",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging, overall structure was well-organized, and the professors did their best to relate the information back to real-world situations and ways in which to conceptualize often complex ideas; Weaknesses: practice problems for certain mathematical ideas were scarce (suggest implementing more), and certain concepts were often explained mathematically rather than in broader economic terms (which was detrimental for p-sets and exams, where the questions often required the latter)",
                "I found the subject matter to be rather tedious, but the professors did a good job of breathing some life into it. Joe Ribaudo was a stellar TF, too.",
                "I feel that the lectures could be more entertaining. More visuals and graphics.",
                "Strengths: the expectations are clear and the Canvas site is well organized. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find a support network (of both fellow students and teachers) in such a large class over Zoom. I think more groups should have been created, especially this year, to help students work through the material with other students.",
                "The strengths were that there were two professors to clarify parts that I could not understand.",
                "The lectures were very long. Since they were conducted on Zoom, rather than in-person as usual, it was hard to remain focused for all 1 hour 15 minutes. I sometimes would skip the lecture and watch the recorded portion so as to fully understand what is happening. Due to the size of the class, also, it might seem intimidating to ask a question in front of the entire class, or to even slow the progress of the class, seeing there are over 500 enrolled students each lecture.",
                "Strengths: lots of academic support with the material, including some (very idealized) applications to real life\r\nWeaknesses: the course was crudely technocratic and technical (i.e. boiling down very complex and nuanced issues to a few equations and idealized concepts) at times and could be seen as boring or mundane or incomplete in this respect.",
                "Very good course! Awesome professors",
                "Strengths: Great, informative lectures with 2 unique economists' perspectives\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion section was very fast-paced and basically just review of questions similar to the p-set, which was helpful, but not in understanding the material",
                "The class taught the material very well and offered a lot of resources to help you succeed throughout the course.",
                "I loved how just about everything was recorded; it made it a lot easier to go back and review parts that I didn't understand right away. Also, the peer tutors were amazing. Shout out in particular to Joseph for his weekly office hours and midterm\/final reviews. In terms of weaknesses, the exams often felt significantly more difficult than the material we were provided in psets and past exams. Also, outside of Joseph's review sessions, the other scheduled review sessions were not that helpful since they would just go through old exam questions rather than reviewing the conceptual ideas covered in lectures.",
                "I appreciate that section attendance was not mandatory. I found the TAs' review materials for the exams very helpful. I think the teaching team could have been more clear about what the final curve might look like.",
                "Strengths: Dynamic duo of Ben Polak and Steven Berry. Micro is not an exciting course at times, but these two made it fun.\r\nWeaknesses: Those exams are extremely difficult. Is a 54% average actually what they were going for? If so, no worries but I feel like that was unintentionally challenging.",
                "Strengths: format (recorded lecture), resources, TFs\r\nWeakness: not requiring a basic level of calculus. Everything could have been explained in a much easier way if calculus were used.",
                "Strengths: tried and true, no surprises, Berry is a great instructor. \r\nWeaknesses: the class is huge and completely anonymous, finding practice materials beyond the provided practice exams (generally 3 per exam) and problem sets is difficult.",
                "I found discussion sections to be very useful as they helped better grasp the content being explained in the lectures and office hours helped a lot. I also found that the instructors managed to make the class quite interactive (for a 400+ people lecture) by asking questions to students or through Professor Polak's polls.",
                "The Professor was great; he presented all of the concepts effectively and provided many real world examples. There are also so many resources to enhance your learning like office hours and old exams. I think it would have been helpful if we were told which section in the textbook correspond to particular lectures.",
                "Strengths: all the resources they offer to students. I genuinely think the difficulty of this course is exaggerated; they provide so many resources (TA office hours, discussion sections, peer tutor office hours, office hours w\/ Professor Polak or Berry) that it's impossible to fail if you reach out for help.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think they encouraged students to reach out if they needed help, especially at the start of the course. The course doesn't start out too difficult, so a lot of students (myself included) attended section but not office hours. When the course got more difficult, I had to take it upon myself to look through the Canvas calendar and figure out which office hours I could go to. Towards the end of the course, a lot more people used office hours, so by then I think many students have figured out the course can get difficult. Also, lectures feel really long, even if they're only 75 minutes. This might be an effect of staring at a Zoom screen for too long though.",
                "The strengths of the course include the organization structure of material, the quality and depth of material provided, and the multiple TAs and peer tutors that were available for assistance.",
                "Strengths: It was so nice having so many zoom office hours available to go to. Often times I would either be studying for a test or completing a homework assignment and I could find a zoom meeting to join the same day if I had a question. I really liked having the smaller sections as well. \r\nWeaknesses: I tests were hard for sure.",
                "I felt that the exams were MUCH more difficult than any of the material we learned or the practice exams from earlier years.",
                "Strengths: Excellent professors. Their teaching methods were generally pretty effective, and you could tell they cared a lot about the class, even though this was very basic economics knowledge that didn't always relate to their areas of research. The curve seems pretty generous too. It's hard to get an A, but not nearly as hard to get a B+ or an A-. And it's pretty hard to get a C or to outright fail.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Since there were so many students, it was hard to get to know the professors very well, unless you went to office hours all the time.",
                "The course moves very quickly and the smaller discussion sessions were not very helpful.",
                "I think the class moves a little slowly and spends too much time explaining very basic things.",
                "Strengths: Professors Berry and Polak are absolute gems. They are good teachers and really care about the class. They made the lectures more fun than might be expected. \r\nWeaknesses: The class is so big and poorly organized its hard to get good feedback and know who to talk to. I constantly got contesting information from my TF and the course director, and it felt like no one would take responsibility. Definitely give students more feedback and attention.",
                "The lectures were very informative, and the psets were good, but it might have helped to have some more practice problems during lecture that were more like the pset questions.",
                "Strength: very engaging professors. Weekly discussion sections are very helpful. I like the slides. There were many practice problems available, but I wish there were more. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt that there were too many zooms that we had to attend in addition to the weekly lectures, for example there is the flipped activity on Monday and there is a special activity on Friday. Both of which are optional, but it is best to attend them. Also the class was scheduled for 1pm, which did not help with learning because I just get really sleepy and can't listen, so I end up re-watching the recorded sessions.",
                "easier tests",
                "I appreciated that this course was recorded and had additional sessions to help give all students access to the course materials while reviewing (or if class sessions were missed). The professors and section leaders in this course are undoubtedly super knowledgable and very informed on microecon. However, this sometimes meant that the pacing of the class was too quick and not detailed enough for a first-year student that has never taken an econ course before. Often, the course material and problem sets were significantly less challenging than the material in the midterms, which was frustrating. Instead of harshly curving the testing, I wish they would have made the exams more practical.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it offers multiple opportunities to engage with the material and get support. In addition to the lectures, there were Monday problem set review sessions and Friday special extension activities in addition to many discussion sections and office hours available throughout the week that anybody could attend. I think a big weakness of the course is the fact that the lectures moved at a really fast pace and did not go in depth with any of the concepts. In other words, we were given brief overviews of the concepts, but it was up to us to figure out how to actually use and apply them on problem sets and exams. I think having some example practice problems in the lectures would be a small but helpful way to improve instruction. Also, I felt that the exams, especially the midterms, did not allow us to best demonstrate our knowledge and skills. They were significantly more difficult than midterms from past semesters that we were given as practice, it was always a challenge to finish in time, and given the fact that we were learning all of the material virtually, the exam level\/difficulty definitely could have been made more accessible.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professors Polak and Berry are superb lecturers that were able to break down concepts very well\r\n- There were plenty of resources for extra help, ranging from office hours to tutors to discussion sections to math workshops\r\n- Incorporates some theories from other social sciences (political science, sociology), making the course especially beneficial if taken concurrently with these classes\r\n- Optional activities were interesting and engaging, focusing on practical applications of what we learned in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Probably an unpopular opinion, but I felt the class suffered from a lack of calculus; it was very obvious where basic calculus could be used to simplify problems\/concepts, and I think this should have been addressed for the whole class in order to enhance understanding of these topics\r\n- Lectures would get very stale; some more interaction with the class (e.g. more interactive polls) would have been appreciated\r\n- PSETs were graded very generously, with few comments or nitpicks, which did not match the grading system of exams at all\r\n- Not even necessarily a weakness, but the class is primarily focused on theory rather than data; I think incorporating more of the latter would have made for a better experience",
                "Strengths: professors and TAs both worked really hard to help provide as much support to the students as possible; I can definitely see their passion. \r\nWeaknesses: some discussion sections had TAs that didn't really seem to know too much how to teach (though it is not really their fault given our time\/circumstances)",
                "Strengths: Covers the basics of microeconomics very well. There are a ton of office hours from a lot of different TAs so if you were ever confused there was definitely someone available to help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures themselves were kind of slow. The professor did a great job staying cheery, but over an hour of online lecture will unavoidably get dull sometimes. The large class size also made it really hard to ask questions in the middle of lecture.",
                "Strengths: This is a huge lecture course so you can meet a lot of friends through this class, working on psets with friends made this class better, the TAs are very responsive. Weaknesses: The content is pretty dry. The questions on exams are always worded in a really confusing way and they are always looking for really specific answers so a lot of times you will get points taken off for not explaining something exactly as they word it. Also, lectures move really fast and the content you learn in class doesn't exactly prepare you for the psets (we never go over how to solve the types of problems that we encounter on psets in lecture and the content in discussion sections is usually limited (we only get to a few problems each week).",
                "The strengths of this course are having the professor do problems during lecture to provide students with examples. Another strength is having professor Polak teach an additional Monday session that walks students through one problem on the problem set - this was very helpful. Also, this course has many office hours, which allow students to ask additional questions. \r\n\r\nRegarding weaknesses, the discussion sections can be clearer. In my discussion section, my TA rushed through the problems without giving students time to ask questions about those problems. The discussion sections can be more focused and less time constrained so as to give students a better understanding of the material. Moreover, the professor could make the notes more structured and the lecture slides easier to follow.",
                "Strengths: the teaching was excellent and very engaging, and the peer tutors were extremely helpful.",
                "This course was difficult but I think that it would have been much better in person.",
                "The professors were a major strength of the class, and made the lectures engaging and fun to watch. The biggest weakness was the constant tiptoeing around calculus, which can be frustrating for those with a more advanced mathematical background. It's a good idea to create an intro course that anyone can take, but I think an alternative intro course (or even multiple) should be offered with varying levels of mathematical rigor (no calculus, single variable, multivariable, etc). This would best serve the most students.",
                "This course is very well organized--all of the ingredients for a student's success are there.",
                "I would say the biggest strength of the course was the teaching team -- Professor Berry and Professor Polak did a FANTASTIC job introducing me to microeconomics. They were extremely clear, responsive, funny, and they obviously cared a lot about their students. Professor Polak did an extension & application session every Friday afternoon, which helped me develop a better understanding of some of the key economic concepts. He also walked us through a problem from each week's problem set in his weekly flipped classroom sessions, which were incredibly helpful. The workload was very manageable, around 2 hours per week on average.",
                "The activities of this course didn't engage me, and I would suggest incorporating more games throughout the lectures to keep the students' attention.",
                "Strengths:\r\nI found the content of the class engaging. I liked that the professors summarized the material succinctly on the slides and provided examples. I also enjoyed going to office hours, and I think going over the material again -- such as reading the textbook or reviewing with a peer tutor -- helped greatly.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nSince this was a large lecture class, I disliked the online format, and I got distracted frequently during class. In addition, it was difficult to ask questions while the lecture was going on. I also didn't find the discussion section to be very helpful, and I would often skip the live section and review the section materials individually later in my own time.",
                "There was a slight lack of specificity to midterm exam material which made it difficult to know exactly which concepts to apply",
                "Strengths-- recorded lectures allow me to go back and rewatch and catch things i missed the first time around. The professors are also very engaging and interesting on the zooms, which really helped me stay focused, motivated and engaged.",
                "the strengths are the peer tutors, who are extremely helpful. I think the lectures could go at a slower pace",
                "I feel if this course was separated into different sections rather than one big lecture, student engagement would be higher. Also, making this mandatory would help students hold themselves accountable. Despite this, I think that Prof Berry and Polak were great teachers, and I truly learned a lot in this class. It covers many aspects of economics that I didn't learn in high school and I know this will prepare me well for future classes.",
                "The professors were great. They made the most of the virtual semester, offering plenty of resources and help. It was really well-organized and a great course to take virtually.",
                "A strength is the discussion sections. The problems during section are very helpful in applying what we learn from lecture.",
                "I didn't like the discussion sessions.",
                "Professors Berry and Polak were superb teachers.",
                "strengths: great teachers, peer tutors hosted a lot of review sessions for help with exams\/psets, lots of real world applications\r\n\r\nweaknesses: profs would occasionally go on tangents, TA wasn't very helpful in discussion section, not much feedback on assignments",
                "The bi-weekly lectures were very organized and there was a wide variety of topics covered throughout the semester. The course was a good introduction and starting point for anyone interested in continuing economics. I would have liked to see more feedback and engagement with the material.",
                "Doing a few practice problems during class would have been more helpful.",
                "Not a high workload, very doable",
                "There were great instructors, but the class was very large and made it hard for it to be personal.",
                "I think there could have been options to have more rigorous examples to play around with, without having to worry about grades, which couldve been cool for students looking for some challenging examples",
                "The professors are very engaging.",
                "I liked the teaching and thought the professors really did a good job explaining things. I also think the homework was good at teaching the concepts. I can't complain, except that I thought it would have been fun for the math to have been more detailed, but I doubt that's an opinion shared by most.",
                "The weekly discussion sections were really helpful, but during the lectures I felt there was some less relevant information and examples.",
                "Strengths are that I feel like the material was pretty comprehensive and gave me a good foundation in economics. Lectures were also good. Weaknesses are that I feel that it could have been a little more mathematical and I wish we could have done more practice problems.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, engaging lectures by prof berry and polak, relevant assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: varying degrees of competency between TAs",
                "Very engaging class.",
                "The course was very good at getting all of the information across. One of the weaknesses was engagement, which is not surprising given that it is a lecture of over 400 students.",
                "I thought it was a great course!",
                "strengths: lots of TAs and help with Psets\r\nweaknesses: studying for the midterm was a waste of time considering nothing on the review sessions mirror the midterms; tough if you don't have background econ knowledge",
                "The information reviewed was hit or miss in terms of being relevant for exams which was unfortunate. Sometimes I felt the review materials\/resources were super helpful and relevant and sometimes I felt like all the hours I spent taking advantage of the resources had absolutely no effect on the outcome of my exam and wasnt relevant at all.",
                "strengths: engaging lecture, plenty of office hours",
                "the course was great, the only thing was the exams were worded a bit unclearly",
                "Strengths: Steve and Ben are AMAZING professors. I called them the \"Abbott and Costello of economics\" because they always managed to incorporate some comedy into their lectures, and boy do they know their stuff. It's also relatively low maintenance and has a very manageable workload, which makes it super accessible for everyone at Yale to take it (as I believe they should).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any major ones to be honest, this was a great class overall. My one small gripe was the ranging difficulty of the practice exams compared to the actual thing, but no one comes to Yale to get spoon-fed through reading period\/midterm season lol.",
                "One strength of this course were the plentiful opportunities to reach out for help when I didn't understand something. These included discussion sections, ample office hours, and review sessions before exams. I think that the lectures were also well structured, with material gradually building upon itself as we progressed through the semester. One improvement that could be made would be to include more problem-solving examples in lecture. For example, some more time could have been spent on solving monopoly price-discrimination questions.",
                "The strengths were the recorded lectures so I could go back and view them as I pleased. The weaknesses were that the math wasnt taught well in the lectures and I had to learn them on my own",
                "One of the strengths was the  abundency of  practice problems that  were  made  available to study with. A weakness was  the fact that the lectures were sometimes not as engaging as they could  have been.",
                "I liked the extra Friday session that showed us the real-world applications of micro. One weakness is that I wish the sections had been a little more organized. For example, I would have liked to prep for them and work through the problems we didn't understand.",
                "Excellent instructors",
                "This course was good except some of the material was really glossed over. I know its an introductory course but a lot of concepts were left without explanation. TAs were very helpful!! Peer tutor was amazing.",
                "Really didn't like the discussion sections... Convoluted and confusing. The material was very hard to learn",
                "It was hard to focus with the remote classes.",
                "Professors were amazing at trying to keep the students engaged with the content even though it was through zoom.",
                "Thorough introduction to a variety of different microeconomics concepts, helped link practical applications to theories discussed in class, encouraged critical thought in completing course assignments. Would have enjoyed more opportunities to apply lessons we learned in lectures via projects or other assignments, alongside the weekly problem sets and exams.",
                "The review sessions are okay. The lectures were awful",
                "Though the lectures were engaging, I didn't feel a need to attend my discussion section -- which seemed less helpful.",
                "The lecture format was really clear and TA's were always available to answer questions. There were so many review sessions and each TA taught in different style so everyone was able to find one method of teaching that worked for them. However, due to the zoom format and tests being open notes all of the practice exams and problem sets were much easier then the actual exams. This made it very difficult to study.",
                "The strengths of this course include the ability to access materials, review sessions, activities, and extra help. The lecture was very informative and clear and discussion sections were helpful. There were no real weaknesses besides the obvious fact that it was quite a large lecture so dialogue with the main lecturer was quite difficult.",
                "This course was a good pace and had a good progression of information. Not sure how it could be improved.",
                "The Strengths are that the instructors for the course are passionate and enthusiastic about the material; I actually enjoyed the lectures, even though they were on Zoom because of COVID.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses were that it could be hard to get help on more conceptual topics that may not be directly related to a pset question.",
                "I think this class was really great about generally explaining everything. I wish there was more interaction with the textbook just in case more in depth studying is needed.",
                "I think the strengths were that the concepts were applied to real life examples. I think for some of the lectures, they could improve by being more clear of how the lecture applied to which problems we were engaging.",
                "The course was great and I loved the style of teaching. Very relaxed so I always felt it was a class I could show up to no matter what mood I was in.",
                "This course was very good because it offered a lot of resources and catered to a lot of different learning styles. I think the homework was also structured well and helped with understanding without being overwhelming. I think that this course could be improved by doing more practice problems during lectures, but discussion sections and peer tutoring were a great alternative.",
                "The virtual lectures can be draining; however, this is very much a zoom issue not a course problem.",
                "Strengths: the professors are phenomenal and lectures are very engaging. Sections are very helpful to address questions and for additional practice. It is rather a huge lecture though, though I would not say that is necessarily a weakness.",
                "I enjoyed the weekly problem sets and the Monday Flipped Classroom activity as it gave us the chance to regularly practice and go over the topics that were studied throughout the weeks. I also really enjoyed the discussion sections as being in a smaller group really propels one's involvement in an online lesson.",
                "lectures were engaging and discussion sections are helpful",
                "Strength: fulfills role as introductory course and provides good starting points for application\r\nWeaknesses: if the lectures corresponded better with the textbook",
                "Strengths: Basic introductory microeconomics course taught by two very good professors, lectures are recorded allowing for us to refer back to them\r\nSuggestions: More practice problems would be nice",
                "There were so many people in the class it's easy to feel lost among the crowd. They try to make it more personal with discussions but that is a little discouraging. One of the greatest strengths is also the vast number of people in the class so you can truly talk to it about friends.",
                "The professors did a great job making the material engaging and interesting.",
                "Strengths: many opportunities to discuss the material, lectures recorded to be viewed at a slower pace later, many TAs available for help\r\nWeaknesses: fast-paced course, disorganization amongst professors and TAs",
                "The strengths of this course are how many resources there are between extra activities on Friday, peer tutor hours, office hours, flipped problem set work, and discussion sections. Having so many resources for help and clarification definitely helps bridge any gaps left from lecture. A weakness of this class: the jump from the first midterm to the second midterm felt a bit abrupt.",
                "The strengths are the fantastic professors--Steve Berry and Ben Polak are incredibly helpful and effectively explain the concepts. The weakness is that this is a virtual class, which is no fault of the professors, for they tried as hard as possible to make class enjoyable",
                "I thoroughly appreciated the teaching staff. The material was presented in a very clear and helpful manner.",
                "Thought real-world application was always very interesting but was somewhat disinterested by theory; more real-world applications tied into lectures or psets would be intriguing",
                "Rather impersonal because of the massive size of the course.",
                "I believe this course served its' purpose as a course meant to introduce microeconomic principles while challenging quantitative reasoning skills . The course problem sets were a good measure of my knowledge on the course concepts. The most frustrating thing about the course was the second midterm: the material tested in a very different way compared to problem sets and lectures.",
                "A huge weakness was the way exams were conducted. Completing an exam over zoom while on camera was extremely anxiety-provoking for me. We do not need to be all on zoom. With some people not muting themselves combined with this feeling that I was being watched all made me anxious and distracted.\r\nI was distracted by knowing that my face was on screen and feeling as if my every move was being watched. At best, I felt it unnecessary to be on zoom for open note exam and at worse I was completely distracting in a way that worsened my performance.\r\nFor future years, I highly suggest doing what many other courses do of using the timer feature on canvas so that the exam is only open for the amount of time permitted by instructors. Then, if there are pressing questions, a TF or instructor can be in a zoom room for questions if students have logistical questions about the exam that need answering. This solution would greatly improve my experience in Econ 115 online.",
                "Strength: STEVE BERRY is a WONDERUL professor! \r\nJOE IS THE BEST PEER TUTOR!!!!! Could not have done this class without him. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Why does the comment on Zoom have to be locked? It would be great to be able to text friends in class for more interaction. I do Not think it is a distraction. In fact, it helps with learning too, to be able to text in Zoom chat!",
                "Concepts within lectures were at times confusing. More worked out examples of particular concepts could perhaps be given and explained.",
                "The professors are excellent, although the material can sometimes be dry. I thought the TAs were not always super helpful, and I usually opted to approach peer tutors with any questions I had. I liked the format of the course, but I sometimes found the Zoom format disengaging.",
                "i studied very hard and worked very hard to do well in this course, but I simply don't think my mind is suited to the thought processes of economics. great class, just maybe not my forte in general.",
                "I think that the course was very strong. I appreciated that the lectures were both live and recorded so one could watch and take notes the first time and if they missed anything, it could be supplemented by rewatching the lectures or attending the discussion section. I think the course may have gone a little too quickly, so if the professor offered some real-world examples or example questions during or after the lectures that were separate from the P-SET, that would have helped the information not seem too overwhelming.",
                "This course was comprehensive in teaching its students the fundamentals of basic microeconomics. However, I leave the class still with no knowledge of how the economy works in real-life situations. It would have been fascinating to have investigated the coronavirus recession or other related economic booms\/failures.",
                "this was a good course overall I thought the pace was a bit fast when it came to material covered in lectures",
                "I believe that the course is quite well structured but the content is covered a bit too slowly.",
                "I think the course is well taught, and I appreciated the flipped classroom sessions.  It was also helpful for review purposes to have recordings of lectures and review sessions.  It would have been nice to have recordings of the sections each week as well, but I understand that in a normal year we might not get recordings of anything, and that is a minor critique.",
                "More personal connection with professors",
                "strengths: teaching, availability of teaching fellows and faculty for office hours, review sessions, extra help\r\nweaknesses: practice questions, exam practice",
                "Strengths: energy of professors was very great and always found different explanations in relation to real life situations.\r\nWeaknesses: spoke very fast at times and more participation from class would be nice.",
                "I learned a lot over the course of the semester but because it was recorded, it was very hands-off and students often had to learn or master concepts on their own",
                "This course was great! The recorded lectures meant that if I got a headache from too much screen time, I had a backup I could watch. Also, I appreciated the extra supplementary sessions.",
                "The flipped classrooms and activities are helpful",
                "Great duo of Berry and Polak. Had trouble keeping motivation to stay focused on giant zoom lectures.",
                "The strengths of this class were the enthusiasm of the teachers for the subject and the peer tutors. I felt that the teachers really loved the material and on top of this for any material that I did not understand from them, peer tutors were readily available to help explain the material.",
                "Very organized overall. Could be more engaging during lectures.",
                "I believe there could be more of an emphasis on examples during the lecture, possibly.",
                "The recorded lectures are helpful to go back to but I also think it decreased class attendance.",
                "It could be improved by including more real world connectionsfocusing on concepts that extend beyond just the problem sets",
                "great course overall",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe professors taught the course in an engaging story-like manner where specific life examples of certain topics were brought up such as the lake that burned by Steven Berry's hometown due to the lack of care of assessing the pollution problem. This example helped me develop an understanding of the difference between the selfish optimal maximum quantity and price a company can set vs their social optimal price and quantity which affects everyone that doesn't necessarily interact with the market\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe course was helpful in building my understanding of certain economic concepts and models yet I found myself writing more notes than I needed to because of the repetitive nature of the slides on some of the powerpoints.",
                "Exams are stressful and not very positive environments to be working in. Having our cameras on is a stretch.",
                "The professor teaches too fast so I have to screenshot the power-point presentation as well as rush to write down important points that he says. There isn't enough time for doing midterms and they are really different from psets, lectures, and review sessions.",
                "The strengths are that there is ample resources to guide students, the weakness is that, at times, the course feels as if it is moving through material at a very fast pace, and therefore some understanding is lost.",
                "I greatly enjoyed the discussion sections, but I noticed that attendance was poor. I think that these sections should be required since they were a valuable resource and provided a great opportunity to ask questions.",
                "Strengths: brilliant professors.\r\nImprovement: more continuous feedback.",
                "strengths are the material and the instructors. weakness is the large 400 person lecture style over zoom in which asking questions is exceedingly difficult.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The course is structured to have many different modes of engagement,\r\n-The peer tutors are always available and extremely helpful\r\n-The pre-exam review sessions were very thorough\r\n-Problem sets are well-composed, and do a good job of strengthening student understanding of the week's material\r\n-Lots of resources (such as old problem sets and exams from previous semesters) are available for pre-exam preparation.\r\n-Professors Berry and Polak are exceptionally skilled lecturers, who manage to be engaging even on zoom.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-The course could lean more upon the calculus foundations of some topics",
                "pay attention more",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging, and pre-exam review sessions were awesome (thank you Tolga and Joe). Weaknesses: discussion section wasn't always engaging: it felt like we went through things slowly and never got through all of the content.",
                "Strengths of the class were how the professors encouraged group learning through the problem sets as well as the abundance of office hours for the professors, TFs and peer tutors. Biggest weakness would be how only one or two TFs\/peer tutors would go over information in a way that properly anticipated the types of questions that would be on the exams. This lead to hundreds of people going to these specific review sessions. I feel that if more of the TFs\/peer tutors organized their review sessions like the ones the overwhelming majority of people would attend, they would have been more effective resources.",
                "The discussion sections were very beneficial. They allowed us to do problems with a TF before having to do the PSETS by ourselves and the questions were similar to the types of questions on exams too. It really ensured that I could apply what we were learning in class to questions. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was because it was such a large class, there was less interaction. There was a lot more lecturing than student responses etc, but that may also be due to the virtual setting.",
                "flexible, detailed, lots of activities\r\nweakness: not friendly for students from another time zone",
                "Learning the material was difficult because the course was extremely fast paced. It was also difficult because we were never shown applications to the concepts we learned in class.",
                "The lectures were great and informative, and the problem sets were helpful and challenging. However, the types of problems that appeared on the problem sets and assessments were overall similar and repetitive, which doesn't help me learn and absorb as much material.",
                "Not many weaknesses, loved the availability of office hours.",
                "There were so many people in the class and it moved so fast. I really enjoyed learning, but I never felt like I learned how to actually answer the exam questions.",
                "Strengths: lectures were recorded and topics were explained well. Questions were encouraged in office hours. \r\nWeaknesses: lectures were slow at times but that was expected with an intro course",
                "The combination of professors made this course thoroughly engaging. However, it may be a struggle to interact with the class topics outside of lecture. For me, discussion section every week was not particularly helpful. I think if the discussion section covered questions on previous exams on similar or the same topics, then students may make connections between the topics in lecture and the exams more clearly.",
                "Strengths: Professors were fantastic!\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked better engagement with the textbook. It was difficult to study on my own time because of this, and I felt reliant on the sessions & lectures. The exam feedback and grading was also very hard to go over and understand where I made my mistakes.",
                "This course moved incredibly fast. Now, this must be taken into account with the fact that I am a first year and this was in the middle of an incredibly rough year, both nationally and personally. But I still had a certain grappling on my other courses that I just didn't have with this one. I felt like not enough time was spent on certain concepts that didn't make sense, and at one point, I gave up taking notes on in-person lectures, because the lecture moved too quickly for me to even write things down. The workload was minimal, but the midterms gave me an incredible amount of anxiety, only because the course revolved around the recorded lectures that went too fast and didn't go into depth when needed.",
                "One strength of this course was the inclusion of two instructors, Professor Berry and Professor Polak. Professor Berry was very conceptual, whereas Professor Polak was very precise. In fact, I would have liked to have seen Professor Polak teach a little more of the course. \r\n\r\nProfessor Berry did a very good job keeping students engaged, particularly given the challenges that arise from virtual learning platforms. He was very animated, and made sure to incorporate many real-world examples of the concepts we were using. \r\n\r\nOther strengths of the course include the discussion section format and the flipped p-set activities. The smaller group settings, in which students could ask questions, was very helpful.",
                "This course was pretty much perfect in all honesty. There were always TA's and TF's available for office hours, recitations, and general questions. Every lecture was recorded, so this was also incredibly useful!",
                "One of the course's strengths was the wide variety of places to learn and get help. Besides the live lectures, there was a weekly Friday activity session where we could learn more about real-world applications. There was also a weekly problem set session where the professor went over the solutions for one of the problem set questions. There were also weekly discussion sections to go over example problems and a lot of peer tutor\/office hour sessions that people could go to seemingly at any time. I think one of the weaknesses of the course (and this is kind of inherent given that it is an introductory course) is that we had to skim over a lot of topics, and the course sometimes felt rushed because it focused on breadth rather than depth. Again, however, this is probably very much because of the introductory-level of the course.",
                "I think the professors tried to make their explanations clear, but lectures can be confusing and fast paced. I often had to rewatch parts of the lecture many times in order to semi-understand a concept. Also, I think we spent too much time on real-world examples and on getting people to raise their hand over Zoom to answer questions. Since there were so many students and due to the Zoom semester, I did feel very disengaged and detached from the professors and the rest of the class. However, section and office hours were great and made the class feel more personal.",
                "The course was extremely well organized, and Professors Berry and Polak are phenomenal lecturers. No particular weaknesses come to mind.",
                "The large size of the class, ECON 115, made it difficult to connect with my professors during class to clarify the material. Overall, I felt it was convenient that each class is recorded; however, I did not feel properly prepared for the midterms or final exam.",

                "All the additional sessions (review, special activity, games etc) were very helpful and successful.",
                "Live lectures had very high production value.",
                "Everything having to do with helping us during COVID was fine. I loved how lectures were recorded, I think every class should do that rather than thinking not recording lectures incentivizes us not to come to class. It is not so much that we do not want to come to class, it is just that sometimes people have things they need to take care of and it is nice to fall back on the thought that we can always watch them later. I believe it is Yale's job to help us in every way, and I think this class did just that.",
                "The polls and separate classes were helpful.",
                "I liked the optional flipped class and application lectures. They really spiced up the course and added some variety to our learning. Virtual office hours were also really helpful.",
                "The Poll Everywhere activities were really successful and engaging, and the intro\/outro music was great! On the other hand, normal lecture sometimes gets dry because everything is happening on a screen.",
                "The lecture-style and discussion sections succeeded.",
                "The instructors made great changes to the course in order to facilitate virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, they made good use of the technology to incorporate activities and polls into the lecture in order to facilitate engagement with the material being covered.",
                "Recorded lectures were especially helpful for later studying, multiple optional sessions throughout the week helped with comprehension, and scanning the problem sets into Gradescan was also very easy and helpful.",
                "I really appreciated the recordings of almost everything in this class. I also appreciated the extra sessions. It is harder to get the extra help during this time but I think, aside from office hours, these sessions really helped cement the concepts in my mind.",
                "The recorded lectures were great, as well as the extra p set help and the extra activities. The P-sets were sometimes very long however they could be shortened.",
                "There were many available resources from instructor office hours, TF office hours, to peer tutor office hours. The discussion section added each week was also helpful because it provided guided practice with problems.",
                "The discussions sections could have been more engaging.",
                "Virtual sections worked very well, even though I felt quite aloof from the other students in my section.",
                "The pre-recorded lecture system and the assemblage of an \"all-star team\" helped add uniformity to the course. I don't have any further insights\/recommendations regarding the COVID-19 course practices.",
                "The testing was exceptionally difficult, and sometimes felt like it didn't align with what we learned in class. It's understandable that open-book tests need to be harder than your regular tests, but they felt excessively so.",
                "Monday's flipped classroom and Friday's special activities made the course engaging. The use of poll everywhere, moreover, kept lectures, which could get tiresome, engaging.",
                "The Monday review sessions were very helpful .",
                "The optional lectures on Fridays were great!",
                "The adaptation of the course to COVID-19 was successful. Lectures were recorded, and the online format was confortable.",
                "Flipped classrooms and other Zoom activities, especially using polling and the \"raise hand\" feature, were fantastic. I wish lectures were a bit more immersive in that, when we had audience participation and discussion, things felt a lot more interesting and important than when we just heard a professor talk for an hour. However, I'm sure this is simply a Zoom issue.",
                "I liked that the exams were open-note as it motivated me to maintain good notes and alleviated some of the stress of test-taking.",
                "succeeded -- they did a really good job of learning how to use ipads and zoom etc to make us be able to see the \"board\" and the professor who was talking. They clearly practiced\/prepared a lot for zoom and I really appreciated this !!!",
                "I liked how the lectures were recorded to rewatch if you missed anything or needed to get a better understanding.",
                "Having additional Friday sessions for engagement was nice.",
                "The addition of optional activities on Monday and Friday was helpful.",
                "Recorded lectures who very helpful and uploading the slides afterwards as well. I think uploading slides beforehand would allow students to interact and focus on what is being taught rather than focusing on copying. Overall, it was not hard to be engaged if you chose to be engaged and I preferred this course's adaptation to the pandemic over my other classes.",
                "I thought this course was pretty engaging, which is impressive especially because it's mostly lectures. I enjoyed it!",
                "An entire team of professors and teaching assistants, including Ben Polak, were added to the team that oversaw ECON 115, which made it feel much more supported.",
                "The virtual lecture format really did not capture my attention",
                "they did the most they could tbh\r\n\r\nI never did PollEverywhere (a platform where u take a poll and the prof connects it to course material) but it seemed like a cool thing to do to stimulate engagement",
                "Recorded lectures were amazing for me since I could rewatch parts if I lost focus and most importantly, could watch it sped up. Sections were not very helpful in my case perhaps because of my TA so I stopped going halfway through the semester.",
                "The lectures being recorded definitely helped because it allowed me to get lunch. Again, a massive online lecture does not keep you engaged at all.",
                "The smaller sections were helpful. Even so, it was hard to engage students when the sections were optional and many had their mic and camera off.",
                "Lectures were recorded and accessible and review sessions were very helpful.",
                "office hours were a great way to ask questions",
                "The course was pretty well-designed with regard to virtual engagement and was effective",
                "More interactive sessions, more notes, more practice, BETTER EXAMS - giving us more time for longer exams doesn't help",
                "While the virtual lecture-based learning style was about what I expected for a class during the pandemic, and the professors did their best to engage students as much as possible, the biggest let down was the discussion sections. Oftentimes, when I sought out more detailed explanations for concepts that were taught in class, I was given the same regurgitated overview from the lecture. Although I went to almost every meeting, the virtual discussion did not help me process the information, and I often left section with little to no more clarity over the course material for that week. I'd highly recommend that discussion sections moving forward should not focus around practice problems or extensions of knowledge from lecture, but rather more of an office-hours type structure where the teaching fellow tries to actively meet the student\/group's needs. In essence, discussion often felt like a second virtual lecture when it should be a back-and-forth to see where students are struggling.",
                "Polls seemed like a waste of time",
                "The formatting of the exams were relatively successful. The discussions were also very helpful.",
                "Recording the lectures was very helpful and allowed students to rewatch them. \r\n\r\nThe use of breakout rooms in discussion sections was sometimes not that productive because many people turned their cameras off. I think discussion sections could have been more helpful if TA's worked to create a community of trust at the beginning so that students felt comfortable sharing their ideas in a Zoom format.",
                "I believe the flipped classroom sessions were very helpful.",
                "The activities and additional office hours are certainly of great assistance to students; however, I felt that with the demanding schedule of Yale students, it was almost impossible for me to attend the flipped classroom or friday activities on time, and had to instead watch the recordings, which make it seem more like Khan Academy and less like an actual class.",
                "Very funny and fun class to be in, no improvments",
                "The extra sessions on Friday were great. It was nice to have more informal but relevant time with the professors.",
                "The lectures were sometimes hard to engage with as 75 minutes can be a long time to just listen to someone talk at you.",
                "Having everything be recorded was really really helpful.",
                "Successful virtual lectures and recordings.",
                "Did the best they could!",
                "The recording of the lectures was very helpful.",
                "I found the virtual lecture format perfectly fine and suitable for such a large class. Discussion sections were not as productive as they could have been, mostly since students were uncooperative.",
                "I think that taking this course during a pandemic was not all too bad as we had the possibility of going through the recordings of lectures if we missed something or if we didn't fully grasp an idea or topic. I don't think there is something I would have improved.",
                "The office hours and review sessions were very helpful. I also appreciated that most of the live session were recorded.",
                "I think everything adapted really nicely to a virtual format. The screensharing and whiteboards in Zoom were some of the best features. I did feel like the course was lacking a sense of community or interaction among students or between students and teachers. This might be a COVID-era specific phenomenon though.",
                "The virtual lectures as well as the virtual discussion sections held every week were very effective. The office hours through zoom held by TAs and peer tutors were also very helpful.",
                "It would have been nice if more students had on their cameras. I thought the teachers did an excellent job teaching through Zoom. I liked how Professor Polak had an extra session to go over a problem set problem on Monday and how on Fridays Professor Polak and Professor Berry did special activities.",
                "I really appreciated the fact that the lectures were recorded!",
                "Zoom worked well",
                "I think it was really helpful that everything was recorded! Not having the added stress of showing up to activities and things which could be on exams or help with problem sets was essential.",
                "It was a lecture so there isn't much engagement -- they did use the app Poll Everywhere to engage us and that was interesting because we got to build real econ models out of sample student data.",
                "The discussion sections definitely allowed for more virtual engagement.",
                "more time in class to go over important topics",
                "I appreciated that all course lectures and activity sessions were recorded, given the Zoom fatigue of this semester. Also, the activity sessions were helpful in applying and elaborating on material covered in the lectures. I also think the method of proctoring exams and allowing them to be open note was very helpful and necessary this semester. I wish there was increased one-on-one support, as the sections were very distant and not super personal or interactive.",
                "The usage of iPads to maintain the in-person lecture type-feel was great, much better than simply reading off of slides.",
                "The teaching team designed the course in a way that there were always many opportunities to get support with the material, including multiple discussion sections, office hours, peer tutoring sessions, etc. Also, the team did a really good job with quickly uploading recordings and other materials. I personally found the timings of the Monday and Friday activities not to be the best, but I also understand it's difficult to find times that work for everyone.",
                "I think everything worked pretty well thus far, and I don't think there's too much to improve on given our limited resources in this time.",
                "One practice in this course geared toward learning during the pandemic was professor Ben Polak teaching Monday sessions that walked through a difficult problem on the problem set. This was very helpful and gave insight into how to approach specific types of problems. \r\nAnother course practice was having students do polls about the course material during live lecture. This was an effective way to increase student engagement; however, this was done only a couple of times throughout the semester, so these can be improved on by increasing their frequency.",
                "Honestly, the best thing was making the lectures as engaging as possible. The Friday sessions also provided additional content for interested students, which was definitely a good thing. The discussions were not as engaging, and were not mandatory, so there was little motivation for students to attend. (That's not necessarily a problem though- students should have the choice).",
                "All succeeded",
                "Ben's Friday activity sessions and Monday flipped classroooms were super helpful! I didn't always have time to participate live but watched all of the recordings.",
                "I really liked the Monday special activity! I also wish we could add an activity where the Professors would work through different practice problems for students to understand how the problem(s) relate to the work we are given.",
                "I liked that the lectures were recorded so that I could look back on the material and review it if necessary. However, I think the lectures overall could have been more engaging and fast-paced, and included more examples. I found that the lectures covered more of the conceptual material, but when working on the psets I would struggle because I hadn't solved problems in class.",
                "Recorded lectures were conducted smoothly.",
                "I think access to past problems\/exams was very helpful. perhaps uploading lectures\/slides at a regular time each week would be helpful",
                "As I mentioned above, making sections mandatory would help. Overall, I think there were plenty of opportunities to get help through peer tutoring, discussion sections, and office hours, which really helped during times like these.",
                "I went to alot of peer tutors.",
                "Found the interactive polling activities to be helpful in engagement.",
                "I really appreciated how every lecture and additional sessions were all recorded and available on the Canvas site. I would have also appreciated for some discussion section material and review sessions to be recorded. Overall, I think the course succeeded in adapting to the virtual format.",
                "The recorded lectures were nice, because I was able to go back and watch them if I was confused on anything.",
                "Recorded lectures were good, sections were not that organized or helpful",
                "The recording of the lectures and activities was nice. No complaints there.",
                "Sections we not very engaging. The ability to watch recorded lectures was good.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures, and the fact that we didn't have to attend things that didn't help us. Again, I can't complain.",
                "I like how the lectures were recorded and could be watched at my convenience.",
                "This class adapted to covid very well. The online review sessions were extremely helpful!",
                "Lectures were good and it was nice having them posted online. Not much virtual engagement though.",
                "The review sessions were set up well and the lectures were engaging.",
                "The polling was fun and interesting, so I think it was a success.",
                "I think having extra activities for the class was somewhat useful, but it also made me feel like I just spent endless amounts of time on econ each week. There were two lectures, two extra activities, discussion section, and the pset. I tried to do all of it but had to bail on the extra activities after a bit because it was just too much time. I appreciate the thought and effort, but it was too much time on zoom for econ.",
                "It was hard to stare at a computer for the whole lecture but I think they did a great job given the circumstances",
                "I liked the live polls done in class.",
                "success: Zoom",
                "office hours was amazing, especially Joe, he literally made the class make sense. in terms of covid the method of having access to both live and recorded lectures was great",
                "Steve had hands down the best virtual lecture format I had this term: he clearly had mastered the nuances of Zoom lectures, and was able to alternate between slides, his face, and both showing up on the screen while also being able to write on the slides. No other professor of mine had all of these traits. I think his lectures should be viewed as the gold standard for Zoom teaching at Yale. Also shoutout to Ben's flipped classrooms and Friday special activities because these made it so much easier to feel engaged with the course in its entirely online format.",
                "I appreciated the recorded lectures and review sessions.  The recordings allowed me to go over concepts that I didn't fully understand the first time around until I finally had a better grasp on them. The lectures themselves worked quite well online. On occasion, the lecture slides would become blurry or graphs would not appear, but these were minor technical difficulties.",
                "The discussion sections were key. What could be improved is the teaching of the math",
                "I think  that the recorded  lectures  worked well because If one missed a lecture for whatever reason, it was possible to go back and watch what  was missed.  Surveys that were used  in lecture improved virtual  engagement because one had to participate in the surveys. There was not however that much variety in lecture and that limited engagement.",
                "Discussion sections, office hours, and rapid responses during lectures helped a lot.",
                "I liked the recordings. I can watch the lectures at my own pace and rewind if I needed to review something.",
                "I thought the instructors dealt with COVID challenges very well",
                "Perhaps explaining the concepts differently would help",
                "It was very good that all lectures were posted. I think that they should try to post them more quickly.",
                "Recording the lectures was immensely helpful! More student questions during the lectures would help with our understanding of the material.",
                "The format was okay",
                "The lectures translated exceptionally well to an online format. I enjoyed being able to watch the recordings in the days after the lecture itself",
                "Review sessions for the exams were very helpful as well as being able to attend any discussion section. I liked how all the lectures were recorded so you can go back and rewatch to review concepts. However, with the zoom set up the instructors introduced a lot of extra sessions such as Friday Applications and Monday Math reviews. While these were helpful at times, they were also outside of scheduled class hours which made them difficult to attend. Sometimes applications from these sessions were on the exam which made you go back and watch all these extra sessions when they were supposed to be optional.",
                "The activities that expanded on class material as well as extra review and practice sessions succeeded. The lecture also over zoom was still engaging. Obviously in-person would be preferred, but this class did a pretty good job making virtual learning interesting.",
                "The polling element was a positive, and I liked the optional lectures that were recorded.",
                "I enjoyed the PollEv, which allowed the professors to take live polls of students in lecture. It was cool to see professor Barry use those to prove economic points among other things. What could be improved is actual engagement between students; I feel like there wasn't much of a chance to talk to other students about ideas during lecture. Maybe utilize breakout rooms?",
                "I think this course did as well as could be done. Participation was always encouraged through various forms which really helped with class engagement.",
                "I think the recording of the lectures and review sessions helped since it allowed us to look back on stuff if we didn't understand it or missed something.",
                "I think recorded lectures were very helpful. Zoom lectures were less engaging than usual but I don't know how it could be improved.",
                "75 minute lectures can be difficult on Zoom, but shorter sessions with Ben were much more engaging. Perhaps class contains a break or meets more frequently, just for shorter durations.",
                "Zoom was convenient since there are no caps to the amount of students who can take the class. Efforts were made to form study groups, which were well appreciated!",
                "Given the pandemic we find ourselves in, I believe that the conditions that were created for this class were as successful as possible. Live lessons were impossible, so I'd say the learning practices went pretty well.",
                "TA sessions could have been more structured to enrich",
                "Succeeded: Virtual office hours offered by multiple TA's as opposed to having a queue system allowed for lots of questions and practice to occur. Recorded lectures allowing us to refer to back to notes discussed during lecture time.",
                "The discussion sections were nice because they were smaller but surprisingly the fact that they were optional never allowed a true group feeling. Overall the lectures were interesting and I would recommend taking this during a pandemic because you can truly just work hard and get a pretty good grade.",
                "The virtual lectures were very helpful, as they could be viewed later on if I needed clarification. It was difficult to be motivated to go to virtual discussion section, or the special activities, since they were recorded.",
                "I think the flipped problem sets were a really helpful COVID resource over the course of the term. These sessions were like being able to attend a study group and review a certain problem in person - but over zoom. Professors Berry and Polak also made the lectures engaging between having an intro and outro song and some light hearted UK versus US banter so even after having other zooms lectures did not induce too much zoom fatigue.",
                "Lecture was compelling when attending live; it was great that they gave the option to watch lectures recorded, but perhaps if they had not, we would have had even more engagement",
                "Thought recording everything for watching afterwards was helpful if needed",
                "This course ended up being about the same as I imagine it would have been in a normal year because either way it is a huge impersonal lecture that just teaches you basically what you need to know and leaves most of it up to you.",
                "Overall the course did a solid job of reacting to the pandemic. Although the course material was apparently more difficult to years' past (evident by the prior years' exams posted on Canvas), sections and review sessions were consistently helpful.",
                "Please consider improving the manner exams are conducted so that hundreds of students are not required to have their faces on zoom at all times. Zoom adds a layer of intense anxiety for me. I found myself checking and rechecking (over and over) that my audio was muted, that I didnt miss any huge announcements in the chat, and that my internet was still connected & didnt kick me off. The compulsive task checking that comes with Zoom caused me to take significant time from dedicated allocations of completing my exam to now ensuring that my zoom was working smoothly. It hurt my performance, so please (I beg you) consider asynchronous exams!",
                "Open the zoom chat up! \r\n\r\nALSO, Give us PSET answers before PSET deadline. Because I NEVER look back at my PSET after turning it in. When I was given the answer, I try and then learn from the answer key. Since answer is always given AFTER I turn it in, I NEVER learned from the PSET. IT was just extra work. This apply for EVERY class. !",
                "The option to watch lectures asynchronously was very helpful for adapting to a new schedule with COVID",
                "I thought the Zoom discussion sections did not really work. I found that we rarely \"discussed\" anything. It was more of another lecture session (at least with the TA I had). I feel like this could have been improved with more breakout rooms or some other more engaging format. I imagine the lectures on Zoom were not all that different than they would be in real life, although I did find myself \"checking out\" at times. I thought the online exams and homework did work well.",
                "professors did a great job maneuvering the transfer and the accompanying technical difficulties.",
                "The combination of live lectures that were recorded with weekly virtual discussion sections was incredibly helpful. It was very evident that the professors cared about the performance of their students,  and made learning opportunities regularly available through the Monday virtual help session on the weekly p-sets and the Friday activity on real-world applications of the concepts we were learning in class.",
                "The virtual nature of this course was well designed and clearly thought out thoroughly.",
                "I believe that the accessibility of the course's content with a mixture of lectures and discussion sessions was good. However, the gigantic zoom call made it nearly impossible to participate.",
                "I though all the live lectures and other events worked well, and I liked the way the exams were administered.  It was also very helpful to have recordings of lectures and review sessions.  It would have been nice to have had them for sections as well, but I recognize that we may not get recordings of anything in a normal semester.",
                "More connection with professors",
                "extra Zoom sessions were great and so helpful!",
                "they were all pretty solid considering the conditions",
                "The recorded lectures were very helpful!",
                "Flipped classrooms and activities and polls",
                "Friday activities were great but interfered with my Friday seminar. Music before and after each class was also enjoyable.",
                "I felt the virtual seminar base learning was effective, but more than this I thought review session and office hours held by peer tutors really helped fully cement ideas and concepts in the class. The only thing that could be improved is the layout of the lecture as sometimes the class going for an hour and fifteen minutes straight can lead to students spacing out.",
                "The special activity that was a flipped classroom worked best.",
                "The virtual lecture definitely succeeded. The professors were able to keep students engaged by switching up methods of teaching, between professors and material that they were sharing.",
                "I think that the recording of the sessions was very helpful as a resource for review and also to allow myself to pace the lectures in a way that was best for me.",
                "it was as good as it could have been",
                "The in-class polls, Friday Zoom activities outside the course content, and the Monday Pset problem review sessions with Ben Polak succeeded in helping me gain a deeper understanding of why Microeconomics is important in making decisions in my everyday life. These sessions also simplified the course content so I could be ready for the exams.\r\n\r\nImprovement can be made in the lecture structure. I believe the lectures are too long for there to be 2 lectures only in the first 3 days of the week. I believe that the lectures should be spread over three days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 50 minutes sessions so course material can be absorbed easier by students",
                "Zoom lectured were very good. I think our discussion section could stay more on topic and interactive rather than focusing on one student and their strengths.",
                "Personal attention and help succeeded, as the resources provided (including tutors and TA's were very responsive and helpful).",
                "succeeded in having flipped classrooms which broke down material and better explained problems. failed with the discussion sections which could have been better utilized.",
                "-The Friday activities (real-world applications of the week's concepts) and Monday flipped problem-set sessions were extremely helpful\r\n-The sheer number of resources available: office hours with multiple professors, TFs and peer tutors as well as two weekly activities made it possible for us -The randomly assigned study groups were also helpful for some\r\n-The fact that lectures were recorded made it \r\n-\r\n-The only improvement I might suggest would be to permit students to use zoom chat to interact with each other during lecture",
                "the virtual review sessions were helpful but the in person class was kind of boring",
                "I appreciated that they added more people to the staff, and some of the in-lecture activities were fun. Overall though, I didn't feel like that many activities were covid-specific.",
                "I feel that the course was organized the best it could have been virtually given the circumstances.",
                "Similar to the strengths and weaknesses, the smaller discussion sections were helpful and they could spend more time getting in class interaction through the polling software.",
                "need be improved: engagement for students in another time zone",
                "Although I was not able to attend, the Friday fun activity sessions were helpful the times I could go.",
                "Virtual lectures and assessments were run smoothly.",
                "Try to keep more engagement instead of the Professor talking the whole time!",
                "The recorded lectures were nice and the exam sittings went relatively smoothly. I think more student interaction would make the lectures more engaging.",
                "The afternoon classrooms by Professor Polak, the examples and songs throughout the lectures by Professor Berry, and the other inputs by the other professors of this course made this course particularly engaging.",
                "The review sessions were great! Discussions... not so much.",
                "The polls really really helped - the graphs made by the choices of my classmates and I helped much more than any arbitrary graphs from Google Images would have. I also really loved the discussion sections - it condensed the class into a few kids, making it easier to ask questions. As for improvement, we need an easier way to ask questions. Perhaps a forum type thing, where students can dump questions and the professors and TAs can monitor it and answer any questions needed.",
                "Overall, the course was very well adjusted to the virtual learning format. The twice weekly lectures could sometimes be difficult to get through, mostly because the size of the class meant that there was minimal interaction. However, the instructors frequently posed questions to the class at large, and also used class polls, to keep the class engaged. The weekly discussion section format was incredibly helpful for me, as it allowed me to pose the questions that had accrued over the week. \r\n\r\nI would have appreciated a smaller course size, so that students could more freely pose questions (or respond to the instructors' questions) during the lecture itself, but I understand that the constraints posed by virtual learning may have prohibited this.",
                "It was pretty good",
                "This course is how most other courses should be Moselle after in terms of remote learning",
                "The course didn't seem to do anything particularly special compared to other courses. The professors held live lectures that were recorded and could be watched later. Multiple virtual office hours were held per week as well as virtual discussion sections. The testing over Zoom felt somewhat dubious, but there wasn't really much they could do about that. Overall, I feel like the course adapted well to the virtual environment.",
                "There were a lot of really helpful tools thanks to online learning, like the accessibility of office hours and the recorded lectures and sessions. Generally, the lecture was really hard to watch live on Zoom. I couldn't stay focused for such a long time.",
                "The Zoom lectures were organized very well and incorporated presentation slides seamlessly. Even with a very large class size, the Zoom chat was used and moderated well for asking questions during classes. Poll Everywhere was used effectively to add an interactive element to the lectures.",
                "The professors managed to effectively teach the course virtually. However, the discussion sections were a mixed bag. Sometimes they were useful, other times they felt like wasted time. I completely believe this to be due to the virtual environment. If we were in person, I feel like the discussions would have been much more productive."

                "Yes! Provides you with a knowledge base useful for all econ and non-econ majors!",
                "Yes, it is a good QR credit and manageable even if you never took Econ before",
                "Yes. I just think it is good to have a basic foundation of economics, even if you do not major in economics. A lot of what we learned is practical in the real world.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! A pretty easy class but you learn so much and gain a completely new way of looking at the world.",
                "I would definitely recommend that all first years take this class at some point, whether it be first or second semester. The information contained in the class gives students a crucial understanding of the fundamentals of consumer\/producer relations and how certain markets work within the economy.",
                "Yes! Everyone should take an Econ class no matter what you're majoring in. It is going to be super helpful throughout life.",
                "It's a major course; take it if you need it and don't if you don't. It's good to take just in case if you're interested in economics, global affairs, etc.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! It is a great introduction to microeconomics.",
                "Econ 115 lets you get a good feel for large lecture classes at Yale. I would recommend this course only to a student who is willing to go to the optional activities and engage with the materialit can be a fun course when done correctly. Being graded on a curve isn't a great experience but if you're interested in Econ, this course will be as great as you make it.",
                "Yes! This is a great class to take to get exposure to economics, and some of the ideas can also be applied or connected to other subjects. The professors are very experienced and present the material in a very well-organized way. The problem sets are usually decently short, but they nonetheless help you to practice the material.",
                "Unless Econ115 is required for your major, avoid this class.",
                "no unless they are economics major",
                "Yes. The course provides fundamental knowledge of economics that will be useful if you pursue economics in the future.",
                "Not unless you want to be an Economics major or enjoy the subject. There are easier ways to get a QR and ones that may make you less miserable about studying for. A good course, but often felt like a chore.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Thinking like an economist is a wonderful skill to have, and this course sets you off on that journey.",
                "It's a hard world out there for those of us desperately trying to get a QR credit to graduate. This class was fine. If you put in the work, you can pass it. Is it interesting? Not really. But the professors are kind and the format is clear.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in econ or who wants a low effort QR credit.",
                "Yes! I would recommend this course to another student. Even if you don't plan on majoring in economics or any related fields, the concepts are pretty basic and good to know in life. Aside from that, it was not too stressful in the day to day work, other than the typical stress of any class during midterms and finals. And the professors were engaging during lectures in my opinion.",
                "You haven't really got a choice. Don't take it for fun, or if you do Cr\/D it.",
                "Yes especially for covid. This was one of my only classes were you could tell they cared about the students and took every measure to increase their learning.",
                "Yes, I think it would be helpful to everyone to take economics and get that base line understanding of how the economy operates.",
                "Yes, since it will help you figure out if economics is for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, if not just for the care with which it is taught.",
                "I would. I think ECON 115 is one of those introductory classes that is necessary regardless of what major you intend to pursue.",
                "I would recommend Economics 115 to any student who (1) thinks they are interested in Economics\/Finance or (2) needs a Social Science credit for their requirements. If you are more STEM-focused and know a lot of math, you may find it boring to do the same things repeatedly without the rigor of a traditional math class, but, then again, you may not find it boring.",
                "If this is a require course, by all means take it. Otherwise, I doubt many would get joy out of taking this class.",
                "Yes. Engaging and comprehensive course that teaches you about economics--very understanding of the varying math ability.",
                "Yes because this course teaches valuable skills for the real world",
                "I would recommend this course to a student as a good introduction to economics and microeconomics. However, in order to succeed in the class and get good benefit out of the class, you need to be on top of things and always looking to do more than just the minimum. And, you have to be willing to put time in to really understand the material. There are tons of office hours at your disposal to help you. I did not utilize those as much as I should have, which made the class more difficult for me than it did for others. Additionally, there are so many students in the class, so you can work together with them as well. The worst thing to do in this class is go through the entire semester \"hiding\" from the professors, TFs, and other students. It's much better when you work together with all the people in the class with you. \r\n\r\nIn other words, the class is good, but it's pretty heavily on you to make sure that you make the most of it.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, this course offers a solid foundation for the futures studies of economics.",
                "Recommended to anyone who enjoys maths (nothing too complex, high school algebra) and wants to learn more about economics. This course is no easy social science credit, it takes consistent work and organization. However, its  very doable if you follow along regularly.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone. While someone might not have an interest in how the economy works, so many concepts from this class can be applied to so many other disciplines and subjects. Out of all of the introductory QR courses Yale offers, I firmly believe this is one not to miss.",
                "Yes. You will gain very important knowledge about econ from top rate professors.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Even if you are not an Econ major (which I wasn't), I thought the topics presented were interesting and it's helped me view the world just a little bit differently and appreciate the complexity of how markets function.",
                "Yes, I think it's a good introductory course to take, but I would definitely prefer it in person.",
                "Yes! great introduction to what people mean when they say \"economics\" and although the information was certainly geared towards economics, there were concepts we learned that just generally apply to life itself and making decisions. And the professors kept class interesting despite being a big lecture!",
                "Yes because you learn about how the world and economic politics work.",
                "Yes because its required and the information is interesting and important. No because it was so hard.",
                "I would recommend this course because the lectures were engaging, and I learned a lot from the course.",
                "I would recommend this course since it can be applied as a pre-req or required course for many majors. If you dislike it, credit d and the workload is not too much to worry about. If you attend to take this class as a grade and do not have a strong econ\/math background, I would recommend setting time aside to study and ultimately learn how to accept a lower grade than you anticipated.",
                "Yes! I enjoyed it and I think the concepts we learned about are very relevant.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants an introduction to microeconomics.",
                "Yes, I believe that every student should have a basic understanding of the concepts covered in this course.",
                "Yes! This probably won't be the best course you've taken at Yale but the material is important to know and well-presented.",
                "Yes, it is a good class to take because it makes you more responsible. If you are not that responsible, it teaches you a lesson.",
                "Yes, but take advantage of study groups\/checking Psets together, discussion section and office hours",
                "Yes 100%, there is so much valuable information to know even if you don't plan on majoring in economics.",
                "I mean, it's a class that the majority of students take, so sure, why not? A little econ never hurt nobody.",
                "Yes, even if you have taken AP Micro in high school but feel shaky on your foundation because this class is very thorough and develops economic intuition, which is really important.",
                "If you are good at algebra, this class is really easy. It's a prerequisite for a lot of majors, so you will probably take it anyways. However, if you are stuck between this and a seminar, I would definitely take the seminar.",
                "Yep, it's a great course especially for those thinking of majoring in Economics.",
                "absolutely because it really makes you understand how economics is applied to the real world",
                "Yes, it's useful to take at some point in your Yale career. It's not particularly challenging either, so should definitely take at some point.",
                "If you have no econ background - maybe\r\nDo not let this be your only exposure to econ please - there is more to econ than algebra. \r\nIf you have an econ background - dont do it, do intermediate - I regret wasting my time on this class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to those students who are either interested in economics or public policy. Despite the fact that I didn't particularly enjoy the course as much as others, I did find that many of the concepts from the course have since popped up in my daily life as I pursue extracurriculars, listen to podcasts, or read the news. The material is certainly applicable to the broader world, and as the most foundational course in its department, this class is important for those who wish to pursue degrees where economics are involved.",
                "I really didn't appreciate how the class was curved. The sense that I was competing against my peers makes me a bit hesitant to take future Econ classes.",
                "Yes, this introduction course introduces normative and positive ideas essential for making wise economic choices.",
                "If this student is interested in a field related to economics, then I would recommend this course. Otherwise, I might encourage the student to take another course because this one dives into the theoretical and nitty-gritty parts of microeconomics, which may not be as applicable as lessons learned in another class like macroeconomics.",
                "Yes, the course is interactive and greatly enjoyed the course.",
                "Absolutely. This course does not even need me to recommend it; it is taken by 500 students in the Fall, and I don't know how many in the Spring, but that makes it possibly the most popular course for Yale students, regardless of their major or area of interest.",
                "Yes, but only if you're genuinely interested in the technocratic process of microeconomic analysis \/ willing to deal with the very technical, sometimes boring and detached (from nuance and other sociological perspectives) nature of this course. If you're just looking for a mathematical introduction to how consumers and producers interact in a capitalist market then this is the course for you. If you want a better understanding of how microeconomics intersects with other areas of study (sociology, political science, psychology, history, anthropology, etc.) or other modes of analysis (analysis of consumerism and mass consumption, management, capitalism, power relations, public policy, etc.) then you might be better off reading a book (or several) that takes real-world economic issues (like gentrification or insurance markets, for instance) and dissects it through multiple sociological lenses, including the microeconomic aspect of course.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, if you're interested in economics",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because everyone, not only econ majors, get something beneficial out of the course.",
                "Yes. It helps you think about the world in an analytical way.",
                "I would recommend this course to other Yale students as it is a fun class to get a strong economic foundation. Hopefully, it is a little more engaging in person.",
                "The concepts introduced in this course are so important and connect to lots of other areas of study as well; every student at Yale would benefit from taking this course at some point. There is a lot of help if you need it but be warned that the exams can be difficult. Since everything was open book this semester, the exams were longer and harder than previous years, so even though you may have done practice problems from past years to prepare, the exams felt like a significant step up in regards to difficulty.",
                "Yes, what you learn is very useful. Plus, it's a prerequisite for everything.",
                "Yes. It's an introductory microeconomics course after all. If you intend to major in ECON, you have no choice but to take it (unless you studied Econ in high school). And if you don't, it's good to gain some insight into markets and how they operate.",
                "This is probably the biggest class at Yale. If you don't need this class to satisfy a major requirement, it's a pretty good QR credit and is part of a well-rounded education.",
                "It's really easy if you have taken multivariable calculus. Strongly recommend for people with strong background in math who wants an easy Social Sciences credit.",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student! The lectures were made very interesting thanks to the two amazing Instructors: Professor Steve Berry and Professor Ben Polak. Everything we learn in this class is extremely useful for people intending to major in Economics but also for all types of students as it provides a base of economics that is needed for a variety of disciplines. I truly believe every student at Yale should take this course as it will become useful at some point in their Yale career or even in the future.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. Everyone should take intro micro the things you learn through the course are applicable to any line of work.",
                "Yes, take it! Even if you're not an Economics major or remotely interested in Economics, it's really eye-opening to think about what actually happens behind so many buzz words (I'm thinking: taxes) in our society. I think it's one of the courses you've got to take at Yale, and it's also one of those courses that gives you something in common with a huge pool of classmates. I can imagine that, once on campus, the community built by those taking ECON 115 is expansive and could help students meet new people they wouldn't otherwise come in contact with.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about how firms and individuals make choices regarding consumption and production. Much of the material is very applicable in every-day life, and it serves as a great introductory course for more advanced economics courses. Additionally, the discussion sections were beneficial in reinforcing knowledge and gaining more practice solving problems.",
                "yes its a good intro",
                "Yes, I came into this course with very little econ experience and did fine. I was initially nervous about my math background (having only take ap calc ab in highschool), but there is literally no calc used.",
                "Yes! Very informative and Steve and Ben explained things in a fun, clear way.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course, for a few reasons. First, it teaches basic economics knowledge that is very helpful to know, both for school and also for life in general. Second, I thought the professors were great. They explained concepts well, they were actually kind of funny, and you could tell that they cared about the class, even tho it covered very basic material. (Also they had a little friendship going on that was absolutely adorable to watch). Third, the workload is very manageable (p-sets are graded pretty easily too), and fourth, the grading system as a whole isn't too scary. It's hard to get an A, but not as difficult to get an A- or B+, and it's pretty unlikely that you'll get a C or something.",
                "No, because it moves very fast and I personally think that it does not fit the course description.",
                "Yes. I think economics is a goo thing to learn. I think the course was taught decently well.",
                "If you need it for a requirement or find economics interesting then yes I would recommend!",
                "Yes, everyone should have basic understanding of economics.",
                "I wouldn't recommend the online format; it wasn't as engaging as I imagine in-person would be. I recommend shopping (especially if you need it as a prerequisite), and then survey if it's really for you with the new format.",
                "I'd recommend it 1) if you want to be an econ major, of course, and 2) if you are interested in learning about how people make decisions in the world, how markets work, or just looking for cool applications of the math you know.",
                "Yes it is super fun! Plus all Econ professors are really engaging.",
                "Very difficult so only to students pursuing economics",
                "Honestly, if the student was interested in pursuing an Econ, EP&E, or Global Affairs major, this is an introductory course that is pretty unavoidable, so I would encourage students to take it to get started on the econ track. If not, I wouldn't encourage other students to take it, because it is pretty challenging and requires a lot of outside work to be successful, and wouldn't be worth it for a non-major.",
                "Although it definitely wasn't my favorite course I've taken at Yale, I would ultimately still recommend the course. Firstly, it's a prereq for a number of majors, so obviously for many students it is a required course. Even if it isn't, though, I think understanding economic principles is important for anybody in any field of study, including political science, history, and even in STEM and healthcare professions. Especially if you didn't take any economics courses in high school, I think this class is an important one to take. It's not anything groundbreaking, but it will introduce you to some really important ideas, theories, and concepts that will be useful across all academic disciplines.",
                "Absolutely. I think this is one of the staple Yale courses that should be taken to commiserate with half the campus, if nothing else. I genuinely enjoyed the class though, and as someone with no background in economics, I found that it was easy to succeed, while being difficult enough to push me to learn more. I think most of the reports of the course's difficulty are vastly overstated  you will need to study materials as you go if you are unfamiliar with them, but there are plenty of opportunities to seek additional help if you are struggling with anything. The professors were amazing, and the TAs were very knowledgable and eager to assist students. Additionally, from a policy standpoint, I found that the professors did exceedingly well at taking a middle-ground approach, presenting the arguments for and against different economic systems without ever asserting that one was better than the other, and emphasizing the need to be \"good economic citizens\" no matter our personal beliefs.",
                "Yes, for anyone who is interested in getting their \"foot\" in the door for introductory economics, this class is great.",
                "If you want to learn the basics of economics, yes.",
                "I would only recommend it if it is required for your major, otherwise, it is a really painful course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested to learn a general, yet difficult, overview of markets and their numerous subcategories. That being said, students should go to office hours weekly to not fall behind on the material (even though it is a large time commitment).",
                "Yes -- the workload was reasonable, and the concepts covered were interesting.",
                "Yes, I would. I'm not an econ major, so I basically took this to get a basic understanding of economics (and get a social sciences credit). I definitely got out of it what I hoped for, and it wasn't that much work, which was also a plus.",
                "Many students must take this course for prereqs, but I took it in order to fulfill the QR requirement and because I thought it would be interesting and fairly easy. I would counsel someone like me to think hard about why they want to take this class and what will motivate them to fully engage with it. I did not do this. When I did engage with the material, I found it rewarding, but I did not engage enough. Only take this course if you are confident that you will be motivated to engage with it. It is not that easy.",
                "Yes! I don't know who will be teaching this course in future semesters, but if you can take it with either Steve or Ben then definitely do it! The course also teaches you super useful economic concepts which every Yale student should have under their belt. The workload was super manageable -- I spent around 2 hours each week outside of lectures and did well in the class. The midterms can be a bit of a time crunch but they are always curved. Overall an excellent class!",
                "Yup!",
                "If you are not interested in economics, I wouldn't suggest taking this course. It might prove better to attend Econ 108 or Econ 110 if you are interested in gaining a foundation in economics without any prior knowledge.",
                "Yes, if you want a basic introduction to microeconomics. The class is time-consuming, and I would advise that you create a study group and review the material a lot -- solve a lot of problems and also make sure that you understand everything conceptually. I liked learning economics, so I enjoyed this class.",
                "Yes, This is an amazing introductory course for economics and in general how large lecture courses operate. Economics is a fundamental tool everyone should have at least some knowledge in. This course is tricky because there is a curve and it has a competitive feel. Personally, I enjoyed the competitive feel because this motivated me to do even better.",
                "I think this class will challenge you to think critically about the information that you learn",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. When I came into Yale, I received a 5 on the AP Microeconomics test, but due to COVID, we weren't allowed to skip the class. After talking to several upperclassmen, they reassured me that taking this intro course was okay, in fact it was very necessary. I heard through some people that those who skip intro micro have trouble in intermediate classes because what we learned at Yale was completely different from what we learned in high school. I feel that no one should be allowed to skip this intro course because it is SO important. Basically everything was so much more in depth and more difficult than high school.",
                "I would recommend the course to a student who is genuinely interested in economics as it serves as a great introduction. Granted, because of the sheer number of students who take economics in their first semester and the fact that most have taken some form of economics at some point in high school, there needs to be a corrective factor. Many times during the course I felt like I was at an inherent disadvantage because I went to a school that did not offer economics, especially as the professors seemingly made the tests intentionally more difficult to compensate for them being made open-notebook.",
                "A straightforward SO, engaging, and not too workload intensive. If you have Berry and Polak I would 100% recommend them.",
                "Yes I would recommend it for anyone looking to take an introduction microeconomics course. The class itself was challenging but if you put in the work it is a very rewarding experience.",
                "Possibly.",
                "Yes, I think this class provides a great overview of economics that all students should have.",
                "Yes, for anyone interested in economics as a major or just to enhance knowlege! It is very applicable and there's a lot of support from TAs and Peer Tutors.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It is a good introduction to economics, and even if you aren't going to major in economics, I think it is important to have a basic understanding of the field.",
                "Yes, this class is a great way to get an understanding of economics.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, because it provides an excellent foundation for understanding how the world works.",
                "Yes, but if youve taken econ before, just take intermediate imo",
                "Yes. Wonderful insights, especially to those new to economics, that can be applied elsewhere. Professors and TFs are spectacular. Learning becomes so much easier after a while.",
                "I would definitely recommend it, as it's a good skill to know as well as a Yale Hallmark.",
                "If youre even somewhat interested in Economics, this is a great course to take and youll definitely gain valuable knowledge regardless of what majors or career goals you have",
                "Yes, it is good fundamental knowledge for how the world works.",
                "Yes, I would recommend. It's easy and fun.",
                "Yes, this is a good introductory microeconomics course.",
                "Yes this course was a good introduction to microeconomics taught in a thorough and fun manner.",
                "Yes if they are interested in economics it is pretty essential.",
                "Yes. I think this course is a great way to understand how to think in an economic like way.",
                "Yes. It was a very interesting course that touched on a lot of important topics, and the workload was not too bad.",
                "Yes, nice class to take in your first year.",
                "If you've already taken AP micro, this course will be mostly review and not especially difficult, especially if you didn't struggle through your previous econ class. However, there were a few terms that seemed to be, for lack of a better phrase, made up. They aren't always hard to understand, but it drove me a little batty that they would define those terms which aren't findable anywhere else a couple different ways, and always they would spend the least amount of time on those random terms, and then they'd show up in the PSETs and I'd go back to the recorded lecture and not find a clear definition. It's not that big of a deal, but it drove me crazy .",
                "Yes I thought it was interesting and a great foundation for future Econ courses",
                "yes, if you would like to learn basic economics",
                "yes, good to establish a foundation in economics",
                "Yes I think it is a good introductory course that requires a little extra work",
                "yes necessary for basic understanding of economics",
                "YES - everyone at Yale should take economics in my opinion, and this class both engages those who are interested and is extremely accessible to those who are not. As Ben Polak said in an August office hours: \"why the hell would you not take introductory economics?\". Learning how to think like an economist is essential to understanding how people make decisions, and by extension how the world works. Obviously this class isn't going to turn you straight into an economist: the workload is extremely manageable to accommodate as many students as possible, and the math used isn't difficult at all, but the conceptual material is more than enough to be able to think like an economist going forward and give you enough information to decide whether economics is something you want to pursue further. And if you need any more convincing: Steve and Ben flawlessly combine really good, informative lectures with hilarious comedy bits (often directed towards each other) and a mastery of Zoom teaching (complete with pop songs before and after the lectures!), so if nothing else take this class for the joy you'll get from a semester of lectures with them.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who wants a solid foundation for the future study of economics.",
                "Yes this was a very good class to be apart of to learn economics",
                "I would recommend this  course because it teaches fundamental concepts that are necessary for so many other areas of study. I also provides a good  foundation in economic concepts.",
                "Yes, everything about this course is meant to encourage student engagement and learning.",
                "Yes. It was a good intro to a Yale QR course.",
                "I would certainly recommend this class to any Yale student, even those who are not economics as a main field of study. This class provides a great deal of intuition for economic thinking that could come in handy in anyones life.",
                "Yes if they can commit the time",
                "I would recommend it as a good introduction to economics, very centered in mathematics.",
                "Yes, it is a course that can help students decide if they want to pursue economics.",
                "Absolutely! This is a fantastic introductory course for students regardless of their intended major. If you haven't taken an economics course in the past, it's truly a class that relies on a new way of thinking and methodology, especially with its use of math as a means of logic between more abstract theory and actual application. I learned an enormous amount of material, and this class has motivated me to pursue further studies in economics.",
                "Absolutely not. It was painful.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to better understand markets in the real world. If students aren't interested in economics at all, they may not feel the course is engaging. Otherwise, this course is helpful.",
                "Yes. It is a fantastic introduction to economics at Yale and the professors are great.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it teaches the basics of various economic concepts that are useful in life.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I believe understanding these concepts is important to many life paths that other students will take.",
                "Definitely. I think--regardless of your intended major--this is a must-take course that will be very manageable and also teach you some pretty cool things!",
                "I would because I think it is a great general layout of important information when it comes to finances. It is stuff I'm very glad I know now and it also allows you to make more informed decisions on many things.",
                "Yes. It was great and I learned a lot not just about economics but about society.",
                "I believe this course should be taken regardless of major because of how many dots it can connect if you really understand the content.",
                "Yes because I think that the professors were all very good and knowledgeable about the subject. I also don't think that the homework load was too much, so it was overall a very rewarding class.",
                "Absolutely, great introduction to economics.",
                "Yes!! Absolutely take this! Even if you might not be interested in economics, you can learn so much about markets and incentives and it's just great as an intro class to explore! Try it out!",
                "Absolutely, great profs, content not bad. Overall great course.",
                "I definitely would. The course offers students a different perspective on how to analyze different real-life occurrences with economic theory, and adds to the student's repertoire of how to take on life.",
                "yes if they want an intro econ course",
                "Yes - good intro for any future Econ classes, got me interested in the field",
                "Yes. If taught by Polak and Berry, two more than solid professors that will teach you some good foundational stuff you'll need for future Economics study.",
                "If someone wants to learn about microeconomics then I would. If you put in work, you will be able to do pretty well. It isn't the most fun class but it does give you a good overview of economics.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The content is very interesting, and it provides a good foundation for the topics of microeconomics without being overwhelming.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone, as I think the basic economic concepts taught are useful for any student.",
                "I would recommend this class to someone looking for a comprehensive intro to econ course, someone looking for a QR credit, or someone who intends to major in economics. I entered the course without having taken an econ or stats course and I felt I was able to keep up with the workload. Professors Berry and Polak made the lectures interesting with jokes, banter, and music so although sometimes the lectures felt long they had light hearted moments. I'd definitely recommend being wary of the second midterm because it felt a lot more difficult than the first, which is natural, but just a personal note to anyone considering the course.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any Yale College student. If you attend lecture regularly and put in a solid few hours before each exam, you will do well. Everything you learn is incredibly useful and helps shape an economic and optimized way of thinking. Most of what we learn is not esoteric, and the bits that are are interesting in themselves. This is a great introduction to microeconomics.",
                "Yes, I would, because I took Economics in high school but this class was much more comprehensive and extensive. It was one of my favorite classes this semester.",
                "Overall, I enjoyed it. Didnt mind showing up to class, so Id recommend it",
                "I think intro micro is a valuable course for anybody to take and the skills and concepts learned are applicable to a lot of other classes I will likely take in the future and to a lot of things in life. However, the course itself is not particularly rewarding.",
                "I would recommend this course as a means to gain more basic understanding about economic principles that are very relevant in real life.",
                "Yes. Good class!",
                "Yes. I feel like some economics background is useful in the real world, and this class certainly gave me that.",
                "yes, i think intro to micro is a great exercise in concept application and practical insights",
                "Yes! However, I would warn them that it seems as though many of the students already have a background in economics, and that can be a HUGE advantage. For those who have never taken economics before, remember the class is graded on a curve and you might have to work a little harder than those who have.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a student who needs it to fulfill major requirements. I took this course as a non-econ major hoping to gain an appreciation for the complexity of our economy, but I come out having learned much information in the absence of context\/real-world examples. The class itself is not particularly interesting nor enlightening; it feels like a stepping stone necessary to completing more advanced requirements.",
                "yes its a good intro econ course but definitely takes real effort when it comes to exams",
                "Yes, this course provides a good although surface level understanding of a variety of topics in microeconomics. This is not too much of a strain on the individual.",
                "Maybe.  I think a basic understanding of economics is valuable, but I think the assumptions made for many concepts render them of limited use, even when the assumptions are pointed out.  I would certainly recommend it to a student who knows they want to take more economics after this.",
                "Yes strong basic skills",
                "Yes! Great introduction to microeconomics -- particularly liked the moral discussions on the free market, and political nuance.",
                "Yes this class is very interesting and opens a whole new perspective on the approach of life and how the economy works.",
                "I think this is a good course for anyone interested in microeconomics or economics in general",
                "yes its an interesting course and i believe its useful for a wide range of reasons",
                "Yes for all majors who would like a taste of Econ in college",
                "Yes, Berry and Polak are both amazing instructors and great at explaining difficult concepts.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student as although it is a good amount of work, the teachers love the material and it is important base for any Econ class to be taken in the futute.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it explains the principles of microeconomics very well.",
                "Yes, the professors are amazing. I feel so lucky to have been taught by them. They have opened my mind to many economic theories at Yale and in the world as a whole.",
                "I would only recommend because it is a necessary stepping stone to many of the more interesting political science, ep&e, Econ, and global affairs courses.",
                "yes, learned a lot even without great grades",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course when taught by Ben Polak and Steven Berry. They are engaging and passionate about Microeconomics. This student will learn why it is important to value the decisions he makes by thinking about the impact of those decisions. Furthermore, this person can use this decision making skill to their advantage when it comes to negotiating a deal since they can prove where the socially optimal point would be for both or as many parties as there are involved",
                "Yes because it is very important to learn about economics as it is the foundation of manny disciplines and has many relevant applications to the real world.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student that has good time management and really wants to put in effort.",
                "I would recommend this course. The topics were all clearly explained and related back to real-world issues.",
                "Yes. I believe, every Yale College student should take it for a basic understanding of Microeconomics.",
                "if they want to study the material yes. must be aware that high school and college econ are different.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, even if you're not an economics major. The principles taught in this course, as well as the way it trains you to think about problems, are applicable to the broader world. The workload is manageable and the content engaging, so there's little downside. I personally had an economics background from high school, but the material is taught from absolute first principles and can easily be picked up.",
                "Yes, great to know the basics of micro.",
                "in person yes, but not virtually",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you aren't interested in the major, you learn a lot about decision making and broader skills.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course, the exams can be difficult but the class is very enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great introduction to microeconomic policy, it's a great mix of simple and more in-depth concepts and the professors were great.",
                "Yes. necessary intro course",
                "I wouldnt simply because it was too stressful for me to take as I never understood any of the concepts and was constantly struggling",
                "Yes, every student should take intro microeconomics at some point to at least get introduced to the subject, and the material is directly applicable to everyday life.",
                "Yes, a great intro to economics and a great way to see where ones interests are.",
                "Yes, because economics is an important concept to learn.",
                "If you are looking to learn about mico econ this is a great place to start. I took it to fulfill a requirement but a student in a different discipline could also find benefit from taking it. Also, the exams were not that difficult if the time was put in.",
                "I think this course is great to understand the very beginning of economics and experience a lecture course at Yale, so I would definitely recommend.",
                "Yes, it is important foundational knowledge that every student should know, not just those in Econ. The professors do a great job at grounding theory in reality, and thus keeping the class engaged with the material.",
                "I would, because economics is a stunning subject and the professors clearly have a depth of knowledge and a passion for improving student understanding, but I'd caution them. I'd tell the student that they need to be auditory learners and they need to keep continual touch with their TA, asking questions whenever they arise.",
                "I would recommend this class to other students, largely because the instructors are mindful that economics is not only useful for economics or politics majors, but rather for everyone. It can sometimes be difficult to see how the models we learn in class can be directly applied to our own lives, but at the very least the course taught us to apply quantitative reasoning to concepts and trends that we observe in everyday life.",
                "Yes, a very good intro into econ",
                "YES! Take this course regardless of your major or prerequisites or whatever. First, its an incredibly fun course that is tight extremely well. Second, it is a very broad course, meaning that concepts from it are sure to pop up in your other courses at some point. And finally, Steves morning music playings are pretty awesome, you wouldn't want to miss out on it!",
                "I think this course is a very good course to take as a first-year especially. Given that it is an introductory level course, it covers a wide variety of topics and does a good job of diving into what kinds of thinking you have to learn to learn economics further. While some of the topics may be more challenging for those who don't enjoy QR\/econ courses as much, the wide accessibility of office hours\/peer tutor makes it relatively easy to get help.",
                "Yes, it is necessary to advance to higher-level econ classes. It also helps in life to have these skills and to be familiar with economics. I would recommend watching lectures recorded, though. You don't get much out of attending live. Additionally, students should attend section, as it's a really good opportunity to ask all your questions and get practice examples.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is even slightly interested in economics. The class is very well organized and is an excellent introduction to economics, and I think it is an interesting and worthwhile class to take, regardless of major.",
                "Great introductory course for economics",
                "depending on their major",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The class is interesting and engaging with the presentation of the information. If you are interested in economics, this is a great course to start in!",
                "If you are interested in the course material, definitely."
