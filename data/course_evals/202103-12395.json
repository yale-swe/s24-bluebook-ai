                "The strengths are the material that is covered because it is interesting and applicable however having only two exams to sum of everything you've learned is very difficult because of the extensive material involved. I believe that this grading system is not best in allowing students to fully learn the concepts. In addition I think that their should be more practice material provided for preparation for the exams, relying on two psets is not enough.",
                "This class allows students who might not have a strong math background to gain a deep, conceptual understanding of microeconomics.",
                "Strengths: the course is structured in a way where if you miss in-person lecture, you can go online and view the lecture there, which is great especially during covid times, additionally, the exams are very much so based on the psets, which is helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the PSET material was not taught in class, meaning you HAD to go to office hours, which wasn't always great especially since I had another class during his office hours. Additionally, sometimes, the material in class does not align with what is being expected on the exams and the psets.",
                "Strengths: Considerate workload and available resources. \r\nWeaknesses: Class organization; in-class lectures sometimes did not match up to all textbook chapters. Also, there was a lack of practice problems. Yes, we had PSETs but that only helped us solve one practice problem per chapter. This made it difficult to track my understanding.",
                "I think how the psets are organized (4 over the whole semester) is a main strength of the course since it allows the students to truly understand the content of each problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, a weakness was that there were very few office hours (only three slots per week) and the professor didn't check his email very often so it was relatively hard get help and the office hours were packed the week psets were due.",
                "strengths: engaging in class, understood basics of micro\r\n\r\nweakness: some of the tested subjects felt elevated from the coursework, poor communication about expectations"

                "I would and I wouldn't I think that the benefits of a small seminar version of Econ are greater than the cons as it provides you a more intimate understanding of economics. However, I think that this course lacks a bit of outside of class resources, like office hours and teacher assistants.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to anyone whos looking to understand microeconomics on a deeply conceptual level. This is perfect for students who are looking to avoid calculus while taking Econ. I strongly suggest that you watch the videos that Professor Koker puts out (if not read the textbook itself) before each class because he can teach at a very fast pace. Professor Koker will make you fall in love with the subject, especially with his many stories and real world examples that elevate the class! He also has a one of a kind personality. Take the class for him, even if you dont like Econ. You will not regret it!",
                "I would recommend it to a student who needs to take an intro to econ class for the major, or even to those who just need to fulfill a QR requirement.",
                "Yes! This class gave a great overview of our American economy. With everything going on (COVID, inflation, etc), this class nicely broke complex concepts down into easy to understand material.",
                "If you want to grasp the main concepts in microeconomics and economy in general, this course does the job excellently while keeping you engaged. There was not a single class were I felt that what I was learning was useless; the professor did a great job of connecting challenging economic concepts to out day to day and why we should care. Amazing course overall!",
                "Yes. Enjoyed the smaller learning environment. Tolga is a very good teacher. One thing I recommend to future students: Watch the lecture videos on Canvas for every chapter right before you start learning that chapter in class. It helps to familiarize yourself with the content before Tolga explains it further.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students as I felt the topics of discussion were interesting and invigorated our interests in economics. I would also explain to them that this was a very challenging course, and mostly made for auditory learners."
