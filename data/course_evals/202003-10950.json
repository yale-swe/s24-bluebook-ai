                "The course textbook was not super helpful... It was pretty dense and it took a lot of rereadings to understand what certain chapters were trying to say. Overall, I felt like some of the material was covered very quickly and we were expected to know it after only going over it for a few minutes. It felt like we immediately jumped into advanced application problems, so a few basic examples of how to deal with certain types of semantic problems would have been really helpful. Practice problems and example problems would have really been helpful, especially with assignments.",
                "The topics of the course speak for themselves and are incredibly intriguing, and the textbook choice was excellent.  The problem sets were impressively engaging and effectively facilitate student learning and exploration.  The professor and TF kept the Canvas and Gradescope sites very well organized.  The professor created extremely beneficial handouts for each course topic. Moreover, the professor not only provided detailed solutions for each assignment, but she also carefully looked through our assignments and collected the common mistakes students made, which was very helpful for student learning.",
                "I thought this course was done very well. The lectures were very engaging. I felt one weakness was the connection between the readings and the content in the lectures. While related, I felt some more explicit discussion of the connection might have been helpful, or a discussion of the articles in the lecture rather than just in the TA section.",
                "I thought that the problem sets in this course were highly effective. There was a nice mix of problems we had looked in class and problems that required us to venture into new territory. I thought that the balance between textbook readings and articles also worked well; I feel well set up for further coursework in the subject. I enjoyed having handouts for each uni. They nicely complemented the lectures.\r\n\r\nMy main problem with the course was that I wasn't always sure why we were employing certain tools. We started with big picture discussions about the goal of semantics, but after the first unit, I felt that I had to concentrate on the acquisition of highly specific skills and thus wasn't able to really put things together until the end of the course. Perhaps providing some kind of road-map handout at the beginning of the course would be useful.",
                "Strengths: I liked Prof. Dayal's teaching methods - though strict at a first glance, she allows so much room for free thought and response, but does instill the necessary sense of formality\/formalism needed in a semanticist. I also liked that our deadlines were pretty strict and clear, and the format of the course (75% of the grade on evenly distributed assignments both temporally and by weight, 25% on a final exam that is cumulative but application-based). It made me stay active and alert in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many I could think of. I feel like I learned everything that was taught to me, and if I missed some nuances, it was because they were nuances.",
                "In my opinion the greatest strength of LING263 was its problem sets. The questions were always fun and exciting, and often walked us through the lines of reasoning behind important concepts.\r\nOne weakness of the class was the lack of lecture recordings. None were ever available on canvas. Also, I think lectures would have been far more effective if they involved slide shows rather than each student pulling up the same file in a dual screen (i.e. going over handouts).",
                "Veneeta is one of the best professors I've had. She's extremely kind and entertaining, and she really encourages student participation by asking questions in class. I felt like any time I wanted to talk about something but didn't quite have the terminology to do so, she was very receptive and responded to my ideas -- I never felt afraid to say what I thought even though I lacked experience. She has an excellent sense of pacing and keeps her lectures engaging by enhancing the fundamental concepts with discussions of other interesting phenomena. This course is ambitious, and covers a wide range of content. This is rewarding, but it also means that to learn all the material and get everything out of it, you have to work pretty hard. There were a number of readings assigned outside of class that appeared on assignments and were only rarely discussed in class. I thought they served an important purpose to introduce content that couldn't be covered in class and give us a sense of the wider picture of the development of semantics and its important counterpart, pragmatics, but it did take a lot of work to read and synthesize the articles in order to answer the reading questions. I did appreciate the reading questions because although it was sometimes tedious to summarize what I had just read, the reading questions kept my reading focused and made it clear what the most important parts of the article were for our purposes. The course content combines well with Syntax I. In fact, I don't think I would have gotten as much out of Syntax I without having taken Semantics I concurrently."

I thought that the PowerPoints and handouts worked out well, though I did notice that after October the PowerPoints were not updated on Canvas. Participating was sometimes a little wonky; I think things went well when we had discussions, rather than using different Zoom functions.",
                "Prof. Dayal asked for live attendance online, I'm pretty sure they kept track of it as well, and kept the deadlines rather strict\/with little leeway. With the content and structure of the course, this was beneficial, and I don't think that being more lenient on such things would have benefitted any student that didn't really need those kinds of accommodations. Those who did need accommodations were provided them, and I think that even with everything said, Prof. Dayal and Josh were very open minded and supportive.",
                "I would say that the use of digital handouts during lectures was not a success, and (as mentioned above) lectures would be improved if they were over a slide show. Veneeta encouraged discussion in class, which was an effective way to keep us tuned in.",
                "At first things were a little rough because Veneeta likes to ask questions to lead students through the material and students were a little hesitant to answer questions over Zoom, but once people started participating more, I thought it was a lot better."

                "Important Info: The class says it has no prerequisites, but you absolutely must have taken Syntax I (or be concurrently taking Syntax I) in order to understand the majority of what is taught. The material presumes that you have a good knowledge of syntax, and it's possible for you to take the class without knowing syntax, but be prepared to do a lot of catching up. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I would recommend the course ... If you are a linguistics major, this might be the best way for you to get your QR requirement out of the way. Keep in mind that this class is pretty difficult. I am fairly good at math and logic, but I felt lost most of the time in lecture and when doing my homework. The workload is also really high. One of the p-sets took me more than 20 hours to complete. It's a huge time investment, and I'm not absolutely sure it's worth it if you don't have to take the class. Keep in mind that semantics is basically a human construct. If you need to learn things that are tangible and non-abstract, this class is not for you. If you enjoy philosophy though, you'll have a lot of fun. It just depends on your tastes.",
                "Yes - awesome for an early linguistics class with a more quantitative approach",
                "I would recommend this course to a friend. I thought it was a very interesting course, even with no experience in linguistics. I find myself thinking about a lot of the topics discussed when I speak now.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in language, with the caveat that a background in math, linguistics, computer science, or logic would certainly be advantageous. I'd never taken a linguistics course before so it was a bit challenging to have to learn completely new systems of notation, etc. I found the problem sets very time-consuming but worthwhile. I wouldn't recommend this course as a fifth or sixth class in a difficult term, though if you are able to devote enough time to Semantics I, you will learn a lot! The way I think about language has fundamentally changed as a result of this course. I have noticed the effects of this transformation in my humanities coursework. I write essays and construct arguments differently now; I am more attuned to logic and context.",
                "Yes!! Semantics is fun, and certainly opens up new ways of thinking for those who had not previously been exposed to them. And the course was fun to take - never felt pressured or stressed by the content or structure. Overall good times.",
                "Yes! Especially for LING majors, but also if you like applying math to language. Helpful to have a background in formal logic.",
                "Semantics I with Veneeta was amazing. I liked logic to a certain extent when I studied it in high school, but applying it to natural language in order to formalize meaning made me appreciate it a lot more. Semantics is really cool because it gives you a completely new way to understand language. It asks questions that seem nearly impossible to answer, like \"How is meaning built up in a sentence?\" \"What is the meaning of the word 'the'?\" and then offers sophisticated ways to answer those questions. Veneeta focuses on the main content of the course in class, but offers many side-notes on other interesting phenomena, and assigns important articles from the history of semantics, pragmatics, and the philosophy of language to be read outside of class. It felt like I was learning both particular theories of language and how to develop theories myself."
