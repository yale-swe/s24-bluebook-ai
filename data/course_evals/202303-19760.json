                "This was a wonderful course that really went through so much material in only a semester, but was a supportive environment at the same time. I was hesitant as a student who has never taken a filmmaking or art class so far at Yale, nor had really done anything with the equipment or video-editing software. Many classes at Yale are \"introductory,\" but really come with a lot of presumptions about what students should already know, but this was not one of those courses despite how complex making a film can be. I felt like we really started from the beginning and touched on all the basics so that by the end, everyone had something to celebrate. There are also a lot of opportunities for feedback and improvement throughout the semester.",
                "I loved the course, I thought the pacing of the assignments was very well done and allowed for the finished products to be well thought out and not rushed. I enjoyed the film-watching aspects of this course as well and my only critique is the emphasis on that dwindled as the final project became the focus."

                "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in the subject matter, especially if they already have an idea of what they might want to do for the final project. I think this is also a great class whether you'd just like to try out filmmaking or continue doing further projects or classes.  The time commitment for this class is rather high given the assignments and the class length, so someone would have to be prepared to fit the work into their schedule.",
                "If you have any interest in film or documentary film this class of course is where to look. I loved it. In classes like these with such large final products it really feels like the time you spend is worth while."
