The workload is very heavy, but it is really because of the constant practice that you can see how consistently you improve. The TA sessions and other outside of class opportunities help you further your learning, but it is ultimately to help you really grasp the basics.",
                "Chinese greetings and introductions, hobbies, weekend activities, writing letters in chinese, visiting a friend, discussing winter break plans in chinese, shopping in chinese, classroom vocabulary and many more topics in chinese. I learned how to read some chinese characters, correct pronunciation, and a bit of chinese culture.",

            "comments": [
                "It's very fast, there were 10 chapters and we completed one per week. Each chapter had two units. A big strength is that tests are online, alleviating stress surrounding memorizing how to write characters. There are also oral presentations every week, which are basically just matters of memorization. I didn't like that we had to make a video for our final project rather than taking a test for the last chapters of the textbook.",
                "It is a very fast-paced class, but if you have a good support system around you with Chinese learning, in addition to taking time each day to do the work, you will love it! It is an amazing way to get an introduction to Chinese and I wouldn't recommend it enough.",
                "Strengths: Wang Laoshi was absolutely incredible! She made it a point to vary her instruction across lessons, so we weren't doing the same kind of practice every time. She was very attentive to everyone in our section, and her understanding of the content made it easier for us to understand it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Incredibly fast-paced course, and you really have to be able to put in the time for it.",
                "The course was good and very fun. The only set back was the huge workload that came with it. In that sense, it was truly immersive but Chinese took up all my time which made it hard to focus on anything else. Furthermore, the course was almost too fast paced to be enjoyable. Little to no time was left for things to sink in and sometimes I felt like I was genuinely not even learning and just going ahead with the flow of the course. The grading system made it was harder to learn a language as near the end I found myself doing the necessary to get an A even if I wasn't learning anything. It became more about getting answers correct and meeting those incessant 9 am deadlines than actually learning to speak Chinese.",
                "Strengths: If you want to learn Chinese and put in effort you *will* learn Chinese. Really strong department and resources that will shove Chinese down your throat. Wang Laoshi is wonderful and extremely supportive and thats honestly what made me show up to class every morning even when it was extremely difficult. If you happen to find yourself with nice people in your section then its also easy to make close friends because youre forced to see them every morning and also when you have group presentations and the optional Chinese activities. The tutoring system is also really helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It takes over your life. An hour of class every day, an hour of homework every day, an hour of self-studying every day, a quiz every day, a presentation every week, four midterms, two oral tests, and a final project. Idk why the reviews never warned me.",
                "strength: wang laoshi (who will be very missed ;\/) was an absolute precious gem, the textbook is really great, there are several online resources (like quizlets and videos) that mirror the class textbook so use these!! also i liked the weekly oral presentations. in addition to memorizing a bunch of 10 sentence long chinese narratives it has helped me improve my pronunciation for several mandarin words!\r\n\r\nweakness: i honestly would have preferred some emphasis on character writing. like dont make it mandatory (eww dictation) but perhaps prep some bonus points for those nailing them. good incentive to learn the characters. also i saw some kid cheat using google translate DURING the exam and i was like bruh. i just didnt feel the online exam format made it quite super fair for everyone",
                "Better planning would be appreciated; at times it felt like assessment details were agreed upon almost at the same day we were assessed. Course components\/dates\/syllabus were not always updated in a timely manner."

                "Yes. Work per day took about 20-60 minutes depending, but it wasn't hard, just practice and review of what happened in class. I struggled the most with oral presentations and speaking without a script or practicing beforehand.",
                "Of course! Learning Chinese is a journey, but I think it has been extremely fulfilling. I cannot wait to take L2 next semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend it! It is hard work, but at the end of the semester it feels very rewarding to know that you've been able to gain language skills in just one semester.",
                "I would recommend this to someone taking 3 credits, one because of the gargantuan workload, two so that they can actually focus on learning Chinese.",
                "If youre a humanities major taking mostly guts and you are committed to learning Chinese, yeah why not? Or if your family speaks Chinese or you yourself speak Japanese or Korean and want to learn another East Asian language.\r\n\r\nIf youre a STEM major or have a high workload semester, absolutely not. L1 Chinese crushed me and destroyed me. I think the language requirement is a scam and I should have just done L5 of one of the many languages I already speak instead of torturing myself with Chinese because even if you do all 8 semesters + summer abroad + a semester\/year with Light Fellowship\/ISA there will be another native Chinese person who speaks miles better than you and might also be better at your other skillset that youre trying to use by working in China. I think its not worth it at all.",
                "Yes, if you're prepared to put in the daily work for the class. It's easy to fall behind if you don't review the characters and do all of the homework, but if you stay on top of it, you really do learn a ton in a short time and it's incredibly rewarding!",
                "ABSUHLOOTLEEEEEE!!!! of course the class is not a joke. you get out of it what u put in. look to other places if u j wanna goof around. but if ur here to TAKE YOUR CHINESE FROM ZERO TO HERO, WHY YA HESITATING????",
                "Yes! Good to not only get some decent background in the language but also find a community, immerse yourself in the culture."
