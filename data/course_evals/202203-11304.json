                "Strengths: Hanwen is super passionate and knowledgeable about linear algebra. The psets weren't killers. They were genuinely great ways to practice the material at the level expected for the exams. Basically, these acted as practice problems. Easy to understand the textbook. The ULAs were great too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Organization of the required assignments, lack of review sessions, lack of practice problems for exams, and slow grading. \r\n\r\nSometimes psets would not be posted until three days before they were due. The project, which we were supposed to have a semester to work on, was only given expectations with two weeks left in the semester (they did make the assignment requirements less because of this, but still). For the midterm, there was one review session, and it was not run by a professor or with any organization. Also, there were no practice problems given for the midterm.\r\nFor the final, we were given some practice problems, but there was no answer key to any of them. Also, half of the problems weren't even on the material we covered. And because more than half the psets had not been graded going into the final, I had no idea what concepts I had down and which ones I didn't understand.",
                "The course follows the textbook really closely, so it was helpful whenever lectures are confusing. The class also focuses heavily on computations, so sometimes it can be hard to grasp the geometric interpretations. Overall, the course is pretty well organized with a manageable workload.",
                "I think its really hard to make linear algebra interesting, but the group project assignment was a good step in the direction of interesting.",
                "The lectures were quite boring and I quickly stopped going. The textbook is fantastic and the assignments are well planned to teach the content.",
                "Strengths: Learn about different algorithms and linear algebra concepts\r\nWeakness: There is a lot of calculation done by hand for psets and exams that a computer can do in less than a second. They don't take many points off in exams due to calculation errors, but most of the time it feels like I spend more time doing multiplications and divisions than linear algebra. I believe the course would be much more interesting if it taught Matlab and computational applications"

                "I would recommend this course because you do learn a lot of transferrable skills, and the workload is fair. They did remodel this course this semester, and I think the profs are decent. However, be warned that the course is not well organized, and you have to take the time to self-assess what you know and don't know often.",
                "If you like linear then yes",
                "Yes if you need the credit, its much easier than 225. Its a great fifth credit but the lectures were not interesting.",
