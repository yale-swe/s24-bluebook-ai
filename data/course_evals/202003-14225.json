                "This course was really great overall! No real complaints. The final project at the end was a little rushed just because there were a lot of steps involved, but it was mostly okay. Even though homework was due the night after lecture, it was manageable and not a rush.",

                "Great course. I think going over some living coding in class (like 15 min) could have definitely helped, or posting hw solutions possibly a week after the hw is due so we could see how you would write the code",
                "The course material was very interesting, and I had great discussions with the professor and the other students, who were all very passionate and engaged. The course material provided a comprehensive understanding of how computational models are created and used in psychological research. The course was also structured well, since it allowed us to build our knowledge of models. One way this course can be improved is by suggesting additional resources to learn MATLAB, since the class does not teach how to use MATLAB extensively. Additionally, this course could be improved by making the problem sets due later in the week, since some problem sets were difficult to do in the time given.",

This course was a lot of fun, Professor Rutledge was really amazing and helpful, I got to know my peers, and I can say that I've learned a lot through the whole thing. The final project at the end of the semester required a lot of thought and applying what we learned through the semester, but I enjoyed the whole thing.",
                "Yes if you like coding and are curious about using computational models for research. Its not an advanced machine learning course as its focused on highly interpretable theory-driven models. Was overall quite hard for undergrads but Rutledge is very fair and supportive. Matlab is the programming language which was easy to use but not very popular outside of scientific research.",

This class teaches you how to think critically about models and how best to approach and analyze behavioral data to answer interesting questions about human behavior.",
