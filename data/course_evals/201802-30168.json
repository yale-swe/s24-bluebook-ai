    "This course taught me a foundational level of conversational fluency and developed my grammar at the same time as I was acquiring large amounts of vocabulary and conversation skills through immersion.",
    "I learned Kauli ya Kutendea, Kutendesha, Kutendwa, Amba relative pronouns, commands, and plenty of other grammar concepts. In the course I wrote and presented final reports which tested my ability to read, write, and speak in Kiswahili.",
    "READING, WRITING AND VOCAB",

   "comments": [
    "The course being in Tanzania the whole time is a huge strength, as opposed to many Yale study abroad programs that are at Yale for half the time. The immersion was the most important part. The staying with a Tanzanian host family was very important as well. One weakness is that I think we could have delved deeper into Swahili grammar during class time.",
    "It would be nice to have more outings at the end of this course.",
    "Strengths--\r\nWell-organized materials, highly-accessible instructors, constant feedback in the form of oral-critiques on assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses--\r\nCourse could have been more rigorous in terms of compelling students to speak Kiswahili unprompted.  Often we devoted too much class time to reading aloud written assignments when perhaps it would have been more challenging\/beneficial to devote more of class time to engaging with large questions and having discussion."

   "comments": [
    "Swahili classes are my favorite classes at Yale, which is saying something. If you are interested in acquiring the language and engaging in the Swahili culture, I give it a hard recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. The farther you get with a language, the more rewarding it is.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  There simply is no substitute for an immersive language program for anyone wanting to learn a language, and my Kiswahili improved ten-fold, honestly."
