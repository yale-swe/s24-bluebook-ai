                "I learned to think about Blood in a less literal sense, and more in a metaphorical one.",
                "I developed a wider sense of the intersections between science and the humanities, and also improved my comparison skills.",
                "I was very interested in the subject matter, and I really learned how to dive deep into the singular concept of blood and look at it through so many different lenses.",
                "I loved the course and really enjoyed learning to think from both perspectives (humanities and sciences).",
                "I learned a lot about how metaphors of blood work and what they tell us about how we see and interact with blood. I learned about blood in multiple contexts: vampires, Roman sacrifice, Christianity, racial identity, blood types and transfusion, and menstruation.",
                "I learned about the different ways that blood has been conceptualized throughout history, from Galen and the four humors to race politics to menstruation and Christianity. I also learned about vampires and the various cultural myths surrounding them, including their connections to Jewish people, Eastern Europeans, and queer people. Lastly, I learned about the components of blood (plasma, white blood cells, Rh factors) and diseases/scientific phenomena associated with blood (porphyria, rabies, hemolytic shock from Rh incompatibility).",
                "I really felt that I gained a better understanding of how to approach a topic from an interdisciplinary mindset. Coming from a STEM background, I was initially nervous and intimidated by the CompLit members of the class, but I soon learned that the sentiment was shared in the other direction too. We were able to learn how the others thought and combine our differential approaches to the topic. It truly felt that for this class, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.",
                "I developed an ability to evaluate literature more deeply and to manage a larger workload of readings that I could before this class. I also developed an ability to think critically and in an interdisciplinary way about blood.",
                "I learned about Blood, metaphor, and the fragile truths of our reality. This course was a rollercoaster - at times very straightforward and science based, but equally confusing and provocative with concepts, language, theories and thought. \r\nOne of the biggest takeaways I got from this course was that day-to-day language, science, and \"scientific\" thought are very much drowning in metaphor. It's impossible(or maybe just very difficult) to describe blood without metaphor. The place \"blood\" has - in discussion about bodily health, race, vampires, etc. - is a fascinating thing to bear witness too, and I became more aware of \"blood\" because of this course.",
                "The various cultural understandings surrounding blood.",
                "I learned how to have more interdisciplinary conversations and read scientific articles, novels, folklore encyclopedias, and popular articles critically. I was also able to watch films I otherwise wouldnt have, and I learned how to put the films in conversation with the readings. Finally, I also learned how blood is ripe with metaphors, myths, scientific experiments, and artworks, making it a compelling lens through which to learn about racism, feminism, eugenics, Roman mythology, etc.",
                "I learned about the various different metaphors surrounding blood from a both a scientists and humanists lens.",
                "I improved my ability to make connections across multiple disciplines.",
                "The value of an interdisciplinary framework between the humanities and science and how that helps to learn about blood.",
                "How to write, read efficiently, and in general more about interdisciplinary aspects of blood, science, and language.",
                "First, and perhaps most obviously, I learned a lot about blood! I feel that I am now much more aware of the biological, metaphorical, and cultural importance of blood, and I plan to build upon what I have learned and pursue further knowledge because of the intense interest this class sparked.\r\n\r\nI learned so much about the intersection of medicine and the humanities, and the ways that those things might be combined in research. This has pushed me to seek out research opportunities and other classes that will provide intersections like this.\r\n\r\nI also feel that my writing skills significantly improved, thanks to the consistent practice and the feedback I received from the teaching team. I find that I'm able to express my thoughts in a more nuanced and thoughtful way.\r\n\r\nThis class was my introduction to the anthropology department at Yale, and it has encouraged me to explore other classes within the department.",
                "This course truly taught me to think across disciplines and find connections within different fields. I loved being able to use multiple lenses in this class.",
                "I learned so much about tools in the humanities, history of the \"Western\" world, and blood. I learned so much about blood.",
                "I learned so much in this class it's absurd. The teaching team for this class was so involved and came from so many backgrounds that I felt like each class was so balanced in terms of the perspectives brought up. They really challenged my writing abilities and I feel like I definitely developed more of my humanities skills. Every lecture and discussion section I left with so many new ideas to think about.",
                "I learned to view blood from multiple perspectives: scientific, literary, historically, literally, metaphorically."

            "comments": [
                "The expectations for this course were not made clear in the beginning. It was also not very well organized.",
                "It was not very well organized, but the excitement and energy of the class was more than enough to make up for it. I think the nature of this class as a new and kind of experimental course both helped and hurt it-- a lot of students were confused the majority of the time, but we had fun while doing so.",
                "The course and assignment descriptions could have been organized better. More class discussion, less guest lecturers.",
                "I really enjoyed having a discussion section and movie screenings available. There is a lot of time that one must spend on the course, but it is well worth it. I think more organization in terms of assignments would be helpful, but honestly there aren't really any weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: really interesting material that covers a variety of cool topics and Moira and Claudia are great!; Weaknesses: this was the first time the course was taught, so some things needed to be ironed out. The assignments and the \"expected submission dates\" were a bit misleading. Also sometimes they would give us so much information to prepare for each class that it felt like we were all on different pages during discussion. The class was marketed as an interdisciplinary class, but most of the weeks heavily favored the humanities. It would've been nice to have more weeks that struck a good balance between STEM and humanities, like the weeks on vampires and menstruation.",
                "This class introduced us to a wide breadth of topics on something as rife with meaning as blood and brought in guest speakers who were very knowledgeable about niche concepts surrounding blood. I also loved the moments when the class was truly interdisciplinary, such as our vampire unit and menstruation unit, since we got to explore both the scientific and the cultural/societal aspects of the concept. In fact, talking at length about vampires in an academic setting has low-key been a dream of mine, so I'm really glad it happened. Some weaknesses of this class included the assignments (which were either redundant or required a lot more time than would potentially be feasible for a student dealing with lots of other classes and time commitments) and the amount of readings at times (which was a lot). Another weakness I found was that the middle of the semester, although very interesting, leaned heavily toward the cultural/humanities side of the class and not enough on the scientific aspects. That resulted in only one professor dominating the conversation while the other often had very little to say.",
                "The teaching team was an enormous strength to this course. Every member was engaged, incredibly supportive, and genuinely an interesting person who brought a unique perspective to the class. I think for the first time teaching this course and as a fairly experimental course it was a huge success. \r\n\r\nThe team I'm sure is aware of some of the weaknesses in the flexibility of the assignment submission. I think that having a window of submission may be more helpful than a suggested time. By giving 2-3 days of wiggle room, one may be able to corral the submissions more successfully while still giving the flexibility that was intended. I personally was incredibly grateful for the flexibility and knowing that I could submit an assignment even a day or two late really helped to reduce the stress of this class.",
                "The strength of this course was the interest of the instructors and the entire teaching team to carefully choose readings and craft assignments, and the seminars. A weakness of this course is the lack of clarity surrounding expectations for the course and for the assignments.",
                "The strength is in the material, professors, TAs, lecturers- they all gave so much to this class, in their knowledge and insight. Their lectures were meaningful, the points they made were provocative, and they were very receptive to questions and conversations on their respective units.  In discussion sections, everyone gave a presentation on a blood topic of their choice, and it was equally fantastic. The class aims to be digestible for both STEM and humanities students, and I think it succeeds.  Cross Disciplinary said, \"Who's killing it?\" and ANTH 467 said \"Pardon me, I'm slaying.\" This is 85% of the class, and it is absolutely wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is the scheduling and logistics. In almost every 50 min discussion section, we took 10 minutes or more to talk about logistics, which wasn't always helpful, especially when the TA wasn't really able to answer questions about assignments like \"When will they be released?\" or \"What will be the prompt?\". The course  would have benefitted if an exact schedule for the assignments had been uploaded at the beginning of the semester.\r\nThe assignments themselves were not long, but they had slightly confusing prompts(looking at you Critique #2). The first assignment was 1 page(double spaced) - and required citations from 6 sources! \r\nIt would have been helpful if the assignments had been spread evenly over the course of the semester, and if the assignments had less lofty requirements(i.e. 6 citations/ sources before the 1800s/spend \"hours\" at the library), but equally intriguing prompts.\r\nThat said, these \"weaknesses\" only account for maybe 15% of the course, and I can work with them in the face of how absolutely amazing the other 85% of the course was.",
                "Very good overview of a variety of topics, but there wasn't as much focus on the biological aspect as I had hoped.",
                "One of the strengths is that theres opportunities for engagement regardless of discipline, including the film screenings, discussion posts, sections, and guest speaker presentations. The course could be improved by having less assignments-and no deadline of any kind during spring break-so that students have enough time to get feedback before the following assignment is due.",
                "The material in this class was very engaging, and the guest speakers were all very enlightening. This course could be a bit more organized in terms of assignment expectations and lecture structure, but community we built in the class was so nice that these issues were only minor. Overall, this was a really great class, and Im super grateful for all of the good times Ive shared with my classmates in it.",
                "The course was very interesting and the professors were lenient on all matters. The level of feedback and opportunity for improvement was also great. However, it would have been nice if the course was more clearly organized from the start, since the deadlines for the various assignments were uncertain for a long time.",
                "Professor valeggia and Claudia were very understanding and encouraging of our learning in the path we chose to take bases on what interested us most. However the experimental aspect of the course made me feel a little lost sometimes in terms of what I was supposed to be extracting the most from readings or class discussions. Nevertheless I still learned a lot and felt like all was valuable.",
                "Very great course, but I feel that it could definitely be more improved with a rigid plan and more feedback given to students to improve writing.",
                "I loved the variety of course materials, and the teaching staff was wonderful. I personally liked the flexible deadlines, but it also seemed to cause issues.",
                "Instead of fully open submission deadlines for assignments, perhaps submission windows! Or have TFs set a deadline calendar with each student to keep the individual aspect alive. Was a good format but could certainly be improved.",
                "This course's strength is definitely its multidisciplinary style. I also think the way we started out with fundamental theoretical terms (metaphor, myth, pharmakon) and then saw how they applied through the language of blood in a number of different circumstances was really helpful to gaining humanities tools. The layout of the material also ended up providing a good introduction to \"Western\" history. \r\n\r\nFor weaknesses, the pedagogical role of some of the assignments was a little questionable to me. I thought both Critiques were really useful and felt like pieces where I was able to learn and grow. The Assignments (1 and 2) though felt less useful to me.",
                "The interdisciplinary nature of the course was a huge strength. The professors were very open with the fact that they were learning from each other as much as they were teaching and that really created a comfortable classroom environment. The topics each week were really well thought out and the readings and lectures were all really fascinating. There were also a lot of guest lectures from some really talented researchers/speakers. I was very academically challenged and inspired by this class---I left every week deep in conversation with my friends. In terms of weaknesses I think the reading load was very high. They understood that we might not finish the readings but there was still a lot of expected work. The grading was also quite harsh/in-depth so even though I felt like I got a lot of good feedback on my writing it was a little frustrating to feel so engaged with this class and yet also stressed about grading.",
                "The course has a lot of very small assignments, and it was difficult to keep track of them throughout the semester. I liked the flexible due date system, but it was difficult to get a head start on assignments because they would not be published until a week before the suggested due date. So, if I had a busy week, I ended up pushing the assignment later. This wasn't a problem for me, except that it may have been harder on the teaching staff. Unfortunately, I felt condescended by Moira's discussion of this issue during the last week of the class. She criticized the class's tardiness on the assignments as procrastination but failed to consider that under a flexible system like they had set up, it is a perfectly acceptable strategy to delay turning in an assignment in order to focus on a previous one or an assignment for another class. Perhaps in future the professors can divide the course into halves and offer flexibility up until the midterm and then another period of flexibility up until the final. In general, I learned a lot from this class. Claudia is an amazing science communicator and has an engaging style in the classroom. I do wish the class had been smaller because many of our questions could have become excellent discussions had we not been in such a big group. But I also appreciated the opportunity to bring many different voices to the table.",
                "The lectures and speakers were very engaging! Definitely the best part of the course. I enjoyed how the professors sought to hear everyone's voices. Because so many topics were explored, however, the course sometimes felt too broad. I wonder if it could be improved if there was more specificity for the topics and readings. While I enjoyed all the topics we explored, it was sometimes frustrating to only briefly touch on each."

                "If this class was taught again, incorporating the feedback and lessons learned throughout the semester, I would. I genuinely did learn a lot about blood and will see blood in a whole new way. Also the Jesus lecture was MIND BLOWING, especially as someone who was raised Catholic, so I would recommend the class for that lecture alone honestly.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested in blood, whether that be because of the health aspects of blood, the cultural myths, the scientific aspects, or simply because of vampires (not going to lie, that's why I joined this class). You'll meet a very eclectic teaching staff who is very excited to teach this course and build intimate relationships with each of the students. It's a fun class regardless of whether you consider yourself a STEM person, humanities person, both, or neither.",
                "Absolutely. This class was one of the highlights of my time at Yale. I truly think it was because of the teaching team. While blood is an incredibly interesting topic, I feel that this team could create the same level of engagement with any topic because of how much they truly care about the classroom environment. Any classes taught by members of the teaching team, I would highly recommend to another student.",

If you have a way of thinking about the world, this course will challenge it! \r\nIf you love vampires, while it's technically only our first 2 weeks, they never really left our discussions. Twilight has academic and cultural significance!\r\nIf you love society(or hate it, I won't judge) examine the ways our society has built itself on the concepts associated with blood!\r\nIf you love science, prepare to be very confused about the Wikipedia article on metaphors, but also really enjoy the history of sciences around blood and contemporary studies of blood!",

The diverse range of perspectives and ideas that I encountered made this a fantastic learning experience, and I encourage any student who has the chance to take it to do so.

There's a lot of reading, especially at the beginning, but if you commit to putting the work in then it can be an amazing class to grow as a thinker while learning about such an interesting topic. This class has made me feel like I'm growing more as an intellectual than any other class I've taken at Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I learned SO much and it really transformed the way I think about metaphors, blood, mythology, and the ways in which science impacts culture and vice versa.
