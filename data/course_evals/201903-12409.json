    "Yes I would recommend it! Prof Karr is so nice and funny and genuine. She will be tough on you at times, but only to help you succeed. I learned a great deal in this class about how to write Times-worthy pieces. She fosters a fun class environment and is super chill (but also you need to make sure you do the readings and hand in essays on time!)."
