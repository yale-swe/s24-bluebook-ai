    "Ability to estimate distances to and sizes of stars and planets\r\nBasic exposure to debates and controversies in astronomy",
    "I learned a ton about the formation of stars, planets, solar systems, and black holes. I gained insights about the likelihood of extraterrestrial life and the implications of discovering it.",
    "Basic knowledge of how stuff works in outer space, along with some algebra refreshment. Also learned how many seniors put off their science requirements.",
    "I learned about the origins of our universe, where our universe stands now, and the stellar environment in which we currently are. This course built upon the things that I previously learned in Galaxies and the Universe and taught me more specifically about things close to Earth such as planets, exoplanets, and the possibility of intelligent life \"near\" us.",
    "Understanding of star and planet formation, distanced to different objects in the interstellar space and our galaxy, connection between spectrum and elements.",
    "General introductory concepts about planets, stars, astrophysics, and why astronomy matters.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of astronomy and our solar system.",
    "Basic astronomy: properties and evolution of stars and planets, some laws of celestial motion",
    "Learned about our solar system and the galaxies beyond ours",
    "I learned about the evolutionary processes behind planets and stars",
    "I learned about basic astronomy and how the solar system works.",
    "I look how to approach problems analytically, apply my knowledge to new problems, and to think in astronomically large numbers!",
    "I learned awesome facts about stars and outer space.",
    "None",
    "I learned the basics of astronomy, how to collaborate in a group setting, and the theory behind how we know what we know about celestial bodies.",
    "I received an overview of knowledge about stars and planets, how they formed, what they are, and gained a much better grip of a sense of measurement for the universe. I cant say the math will stick with me- it was tricky for someone who only got up to pre calc in high school.",
    "I gained a much better idea of what scientists actually KNOW about space and how they have come to know it. I have a better idea of measuring the size of planets and the distances between them. I have a much better idea of the characteristics of planets and stars in our galaxy.",
    "This course allowed me to gain greater understanding of just how vast the universe is, and how and why space appears the way it does from Earth. It not only taught me information about the sun, moon, stars, and other galaxies, but it also informed me about ideological fallacies, which I thought were an interesting part of the course that was quite applicable to this field of study. A skill I gained from this course is the ability to look through telescopes and identify characteristics of stars and categorize and differentiate extraterrestrial beings.",
    "I learned basic astronomy.",
    "Good review of basic quantitative reasoning skills, learned a lot about how to measure both observable and intrinsic characteristics of planets and stars, and some insight on extraterrestrial life.",
    "I learned both quantitative and critical thinking skills.",
    "The course title is pretty self explanatory. I learned about planets and stars.",
    "In Planets and Stars I gained an in-depth understanding of astronomical objects and their formation, as well as a basic understanding of the Earth in relation to our Galaxy. Additionally, the lecture videos and in-class discussion cleared up a number of misconceptions I held involving the field of Astronomy.",
    "This course taught me all about planet formation, star formation, properties of stars\/planets, methods of calculating these properties, and how to calculate distances to some of these object. Most importantly, this course helped me realize how small we are in this universe.",
    "I learned a whole lot about astronomy, specifically the creation of the universe and the life cycle of stars.",
    "As someone that is very unfamiliar with advanced STEM courses, but incredibly fascinated by the mind-blowing reality of astronomy, this course proved to be one of my favorites at Yale. I developed the perfect mix of essential arithmetic and an understanding of where we are\/how we are here.",
    "An understanding of how astronomers get creative with the limited data available to figure out as much as possible about the universe around us. Also learnt some facts about the solar system and star formation.",
    "I learned techniques for determining the distances to objects such as stars in space, stellar evolution and characteristics, and planetary evolution. I learned how to use this information practically in qualitative and quantitative scenarios, which gave me a greater grasp of how the knowledge is important to astronomers.",
    "I learned a lot about outer space (and some about earth) -- how to measure distances to stars and planets as well as other characteristics, how they form, what their life cycle is like.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about space, the universe, and astronomical sciences. In fact, the amount of information I now know after only one semester is surprising to myself and the family members who have to endure the astronomy fun facts that I can't stop interjecting into conversation.\r\nThis course not only taught information on astronomy and the universe, it also taught mathematical methods for finding data in astronomical sciences. There is also an observing exercise that allows students to put their knowledge towards practical applications, as well as utilize the observatory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Faison is a thoughtful teacher who clearly puts time and effort into his lesson planning\r\nHowever, his grading on exams can be somewhat arbitrary, making it difficult to estimate one's achievement in the class",
    "strengths\r\nwatch lecture vids before and then practice concepts together in class both at the table and on the board\r\nobservation exercise gave us direct access to concepts we learned in class\r\n\r\nweakness\r\nunclear syllabus (didnt list final exam time or date and said 10 PSETs but we were assigned 12)",
    "The content is pretty interesting and easy to digest. Flipped classroom means it's easy to go back and learn things again. I wish the lecture slides from class were made available as they have a lot of great practice problems that would've been useful when studying for exams.",
    "Strengths: not too hard, interesting, Faison is nice\r\nWeaknesses: flipped classroom (watching lecture videos before each class) is annoying",
    "I like the flipped nature of the course, but I feel that some class time is wasted going over things we are supposed to have already learned in the videos. There is some new material proposed in class, but there is also a lot of repetition of things talked about in the videos. Personally, I think the class could do without the videos and Professor Faison just teaching us everything in class, as I think there would still be time to break out into groups and complete workshop questions.",
    "The lecture videos are kind of annoying because we go over the same items in physical lecture so it almost feels like double the amount of time for the same information. The ability to work in groups in class though was really nice.",
    "This course gives a nice introduction to astronomy for both astro majors and just students interested in it. Nicely organised canvas page and engaging PSets, where professor want you to apply your knowledge to different situations not just plug in formulas.",
    "In the beginning, I really hated the flipped classroom format, but by the end I somewhat adjusted to it. It's nice to have lectures to look back on when studying for midterms\/finals, but the lectures and the readings AND the classroom lectures\/problems are somewhat redundant. Furthermore, some of the lecture videos, especially in the beginning, aren't super good at explaining the concepts (the early ones and the math ones in particular). The reading can be much better for that, so I think it would be good to assign strictly lectures over readings and provide the textbook if needed. Secondly, in class material can be really dry as well, but I think it started getting interesting towards the last third of the course. One highlight of the class is the observing session, I really enjoyed it!",
    "Interesting information, don't like the reverse classroom style",
    "The strength of the course is the myriad of activities that the professor uses to teach the class (online, txbk, group activities, and in-class questions). It can be improved by using more material from the textbook, to give more structure.",
    "Its hard to stay engaged.",
    "This class is so cool. No changes.",
    "Prof. Faison does a great job keeping the lectures engaging. He really performs and creates a fun energy in the room. That allowed me to become friends with the other people at my table, and certainly by the end I was looking forward to class every week.\r\nI liked the reverse classroom structure, whereby we learned the content ahead of time in lecture videos and then came to review and practice in class. It worked well for me.",
    "strengths: reversed classroom.\r\nweakness: reversed classroom. \r\n\r\nwhy a weakness: if you don't like the reversed classroom setting because you'll have to watch the videos for homework, don't do it. the professor can apparently tell if you've watched the video or not before class, and it counts into participation. \r\n\r\nwhy a strength: but if you don't mind having 1 pset per week and some videos to watch before class for homework, then take the class. you also just have to click on the video and play it on 2x speed, and then do your other homework if you're busy. if you're lost on the pset, go to the ta sessions and form a study group.",
    "This class is atrocious. It is not organized in a way to promote learning, but rather for a way for the professor and a few students to lead bizarre questions for the entire class period, which, given the mandatory attendance, are not even slightly avoidable",
    "The course is simplistic and easy to grasp, even with no prior knowledge on the topic. Even if your end goal is not to pursue astronomy as a major, the class is interesting enough to take as a science class. The class seems to be a little fast-paced, picking up in speed within the first two days. I felt as though the online lectures were okay, but not enough time was spent in class refining our understanding of the concepts, focusing more on applying the lesson, regardless of how well it was understood.",
    "This felt like a high school class- in a fun way! The group table structure and at-home teaching via lectures were nice in that they gave students time to learn at their own pace, since everyone is at a very different place mathematically and in terms of astronomy. \r\nThe main weakness of the course for me was the math. If I actually worked to understand it all, it would have been too much of a time commitment with my other classes, especially since Im not in STEM. I did not like working at the white board because it was almost always one kid who knew how to do the math and not explaining it very well to the others. I would suggest Professor Faison breaking down the math more clearly in lectures and in class.",
    "Strengths\r\n- Professor Faison clearly loves what he teaches and is a very good lecturer. He is really good at explaining tricky concepts with simple, real-world analogies that make the concepts easier to understand.\r\n- The class is structured very well to maintain participation even in a big lecture, so if you are someone that normally drops off in attendance and effort in bigger classes, this is a good lecture class that will keep you engaged.\r\n- It is definitely a doable challenge for non-math\/science people who want a science\/QR credit. It's not a full on gut, but it is definitely easy to succeed in the class if you use the resources and take advantage of the structure Professor Faison sets up.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Lectures are completely online, and you are responsible for watching them on your own time. Classes are mainly group problems about the online lectures assigned from the night before. If you don't really understand something from the lecture videos or fall behind, it isn't gone over that extensively in class.\r\n- Sometimes it felt like 1-2 of the Psets were redundant and assigned just to make sure we had a weekly assignment due. I think the work could have been condensed from 12 Psets to 10.",
    "A strength of this course is the interactive aspect of the lessons that the professor creates through the observing exercise and the occasional telescope, rock, or beam of light that he shows to the class during lectures. I always found the subject of the course fascinating, so, when the professor brought in concrete items to show how the information we are learning is occurring in the real world, it made the course even more interesting. Another strength of this course is the professor teaches through multiple mediums, so there is always a way to learn more or review the material. This can also be a weakness, however, because there is a lot of information on canvas, and at times the professor doesn't quite cover everything in the lecture that we need to finish the problem sets which presents a problem to students attempting to submit it.",
    "While I liked the reverse classroom setting, I think having the example problems used in class being saved somewhere on Canvas for later viewing would've been helpful. Furthermore, I think better communication between the TAs and the professor would've been beneficial given that since the TAs didn't have any idea what the midterm looked like, their midterm review sessions were lackluster.",
    "Strengths: multifaceted ways of teaching the material (reverse classroom), classes were really fun since it encouraged group work and reviewed material from the video lectures, engaging lecturer, good ways used to measure participation\r\n\r\nRoom for improvement: sometimes there were questions from group work that I did not catch or fully understood, so I would've liked it if the Professor posted the in-class questions and answer solution so that I could later review what I missed. I also didn't like that the midterm and final had so few questions, because there was so much to study and only a few of the concepts would be tested on it.",
    "This course could you use a better textbook.",
    "The inverted lecture style is painful. Discussions and whiteboard exercises very forced and contrived",
    "Very boring, long lectures and in class work was not like the problem sets",
    "Tardiness policy: This inflexibility is actually ableist and doesnt really take into account disabilities, getting sick (or being human!)",
    "The lecture videos, in-class discussion and work in small groups complemented one another very nicely. The lecture videos covered a wide range of material related to a specific aspect of Astronomy, then in class we focused on only the key aspects and mathematical calculations.  \r\n\r\nOne addition that I think would benefit the class would be to integrate an online poll or other technological method as an additional means to consider the discussion questions we worked through in class. Sometimes my table group would finish our discussion quickly, and would stop talking entirely, and I think that some means to see what the rest of the class is thinking would be beneficial.",
    "I think a strength of the course is the time it takes to build some fundamental methods that become the cornerstone for the rest of the course. I think a potential weakness is how quickly the second half of the course is kind of breezed by.",
    "Practice problems in class weren't helpful - no explanation was given for the answer, and if your group was stuck, no help was offered to help you puzzle through. Reading assignments were also irrelevant to the exams and problem sets.",
    "I enjoyed the structure and activities such as the observing exercise. I wish we spent a little more time going over key concepts in class, but the online lectures were very helpful when it came time to study for exams.",
    "Strengths: Dr.Faison is a great lecturer and very committed to making sure everyone learns and appreciates astronomy better. The subject matter itself is interesting if you want to learn more about the world beyond the confines of the earth, and how we are able to learn about these things in the first place.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The QR portion of the course is pretty limited in scope, and solving problems using the small-angle formula gets repetitive after a while. Considering that a large majority of people admitted to Yale score over 700 on the math portion of the SAT, I'm sure there's room to introduce more interesting and tougher math problems.",
    "The structure of the course was very helpful in facilitating learning - video lectures to be watched before every class, textbook (which is free!) readings, and simulations provided on Canvas gave many different types of resources for understanding new material. The course has a flipped classroom structure, which is a pro and a con. While Dr. Faison was great with giving us resources to learn, the in-class time spent on problems seemed unhelpful at times. Having multiple TFs float around and discuss problems we were given was a big help. The TFs also held weekly, optional \"discussion sections\" which were really just P-set workshops. Communication between Dr. Faison and students (and even TFs at times) was another small problem with the course- when asked questions about due dates or required assignments, he would usually joke about it in a very ambiguous way that would not really indicate a clear answer.",
    "Strengths: material is pretty interesting, and a lot is covered without it being overwhelming.\r\nWeaknesses: lecture can feel a bit unproductive, since we often just cover what was gone over in the lecture videos we watched outside of class.",
    "Strengths: A ton of information out that is very interesting and engaging to students, experiential learning that includes using the observatory, and practical application of the information learned. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The mathematical portion was difficult to follow, as it often involved doing practice problems on whiteboards around the classroom,. This was often confusing and unclear, since it's a lecture-sized class, and the solution and how to get there were not clearly reviewed before going on to the next question. Class time was not always used in the most practical way, so the videos for homework provided the most information."

    "Yes, as a solid science credit for non-STEM majors",
    "I think Yale has a problem about having relevant and accessible classes for non-STEM majors (i.e. there needs to be lower-level classes that aren't sequence classes); I thought this was the best of bad options for me to fulfill my QR requirement, which is not this class's fault.",
    "Yes!! This course is really fascinating and makes you confront the grand scale of the universe. It's also not very challenging so you won't have to spend much time on it, apart from watching the lecture videos (since it's a flipped classroom). I really enjoyed learning about the universe and Professor Faison was very passionate and a good teacher.",
    "If you need an easy science credit, go for it, but weekly problem sets get annoying",
    "This class is most certainly not a gut and requires a decent amount of effort. If you are confident in your algebra and are curious about the universe, this class is perfect for you.",
    "I would not say this class is easy or a gut given the time required for problem sets, but certainly do not take this course unless you have a pre-existing or budding interest in astronomy.",
    "If math isn't your strongest asset, beware before deciding on this QR credit, especially if you're only looking for science. It's definitely not a gut as some people like to call it. There's a pretty fair amount of work you have to put in to do decent.",
    "YES! great course for QR or science credit which is both very interesting and engaging, but does not have that big workload.",
    "If you have any casual interest in astronomy then this is a good course to take. It is also relatively easy for humanities majors looking for a science or QR credit.",
    "It's a pretty basic course and you don't need to know any advanced science\/math for it. You do need to put in some work if you want to do well on the final and the midterm\/PSETs (it's not an automatic A, but it is not difficult to get an A if you put in work). Also, don't go to the review sessions unless you have questions prepared because otherwise, they are useless.",
    "It is a good science\/QR class for students who are not planning to be STEM majors. Not too hard to understand, not a huge workload, and fairly interesting content.",
    "Yes if you are interested in astronomy",
    "No, it was a decent amount of work and the exam was graded very specifically. You needed to have every detail that they were looking for.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with any level of interest in astronomy or even just some interest in math.",
    "Yes. Good science class for a non-STEM major.",
    "No",
    "Yes! This course is by far one of the most interesting I have ever taken at Yale. This course is a must-take for every student. Learning about the universe is the most humbling, exciting, and thrilling experience. Every young adult should learn about the universe, its potential and its limits, particularly in the context increasing changes on planet earth.",
    "Definitely a fascinating science credit. If you have any romantic childish wonderment left about outer space, and the sight of numbers doesn't send you off screaming, then this course is great. Content is exciting and the work is easy.",
    "yes. this is atronomy 110, and it's an introductory level course. it's still pretty difficult, but here's some tips. if you're not comfortable with watching videos, and actually trying to watch them, and reading through the textbook, then don't take this course. but that's like, every course, so, you know...\r\n\r\nhow to study: 1) watching the videos will really help you on the pset. the textbook also helps a bit, but the videos more. 2) the math you're really doing in this course, at least for the first half, is small angle formula, scale models, and unit conversions. It just seems more complicated because the units are those you use in astronomy. 3) read the textbook. skim through each part and take note of things like \"oh so this star became like this because of some factor.\" or \"oh this star is brighter because of this phenomenon.\" or \"this planet is made of more gas because of this.\" note the trends in the textbook. 4) the psets are math, the videos have some math and concepts. your two exams (midterm, final) are conceptual, with maybe one problem that involves math. and he gives you the formulas. the exams aren't the most difficult, but since it's conceptual, as long as you know the concepts and have watched the videos and looked through the textbook, it'll be okay.",
    "Not at all. While the material is interesting, the structure of the class made it impossible to enjoy or to focus on",
    "If you're looking for a science credit and are okay with spending a few hours every week working on problem sets, this class is great for anyone, regardless of background knowledge or science\/math ability.",
    "Id recommend it- would probably be easy for those who understand math. The astronomy aspect is so fascinating and taught clearly. If you take this knowing you suck at math- make sure you have a friend in class to work on PSETS with or youre going to have a hard time.",
    "Absolutely! I'm NOT a math person at all, so I agonized over how to get my second QR credit in a painless, interesting way. Think of this course as a must-take if you are a non-stem major that is interested in space. The math is all basic algebra, and it's more concept oriented. The PSETS are half math, half conceptual, writing-based questions. It's a lot of fun; I had a great time in this class. You can't get an A by doing absolutely nothing, but it's also definitely easy to succeed when you engage in the course like you should.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed what I learned in this course, and the workload was quite low as long as one kept up with the pace of the lectures and other materials. It is also challenging, but not mathematics heavy to the point that the average person cannot succeed in the course. It is always fun for me personally to learn about the things that are in the outside world, and it is more fulfilling if the information I learn in the classroom can be applied in real life.",
    "Yes! Really great science or QR credit. The content that you learn is interesting, and the QR is not so difficult.",
    "Yes,",
    "No it is not a good science credit for non-stem majors",
    "Dont take as a gut unless you need to. Interesting scientific\/ cosmic concepts, but most of the work youll be doing is (basic) math & physicsthis isnt at all hidden (its a QR!) but if youre just looking for the Sc or an interesting qualitative intro to Astro, look elsewhere. \r\n\r\nIf youre fine with that, the course is *alright*. Some of it is challenging, some boringI didnt love the flipped classroom but maybe I wouldve if we worked on questions relevant to problem sets\/ those questions themselves at least one day of the two per week. If you havent really taken math and physics\/ chemistry since high school like me, youll have to be committed to doing some catching up and attending the optional discussion sections every week to have a chance at getting it.\r\n\r\nBe prepared to do a (often tough) problem set each week! Deadlines are Friday nights which is unfortunate if think you might leave things til then but if youre cool with that, great. Late work is only accepted for one day and at a large penaltyonly excusable with Deans Excuse which Prof. seems to think can be attained for having a bad cold etc.  \r\n\r\nAlso: may sound silly, but do consider topics that are overwhelming to you\/ mental health\/ what youre prepared to get into! Learning about the universe can be beautiful and for some it can also be an ordeal if you overthink things\/ think you may spiral into existentialist woes lol.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to any student that is interested in Astronomy or wants to take an interesting class to fulfill their science requirement. I found most of the material we covered to be genuinely interesting despite the fact that I dont consider science courses to be an area of strength for me. The math in the course was manageable, and to me mostly required envisioning the scenarios described in the problem and using general knowledge of Astronomy rather than specific formulas.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was fun to understand the processes going on around me as I looked up at the sky and it was all interesting stuff.",
    "I'm not sure... the information is good to know as a citizen of earth but not terribly relevant, and the course is not structured well to help students who are struggling with the material (too anonymous).",
    "I would--given that the student is someone interested in astronomy, but not necessarily a STEM student. The course was the perfect mix of challenging problems and interesting topics.",
    "If you are interested in gaining a basic overview of how astronomers make the most of our limited tools and data to learn about the universe, then do take this course. The workload is reasonable and lectures are fun to attend, with lots of participation. If you already have a strong mathematics and physics background, you are better off taking a higher level astronomy course.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you have an interest in general astronomy. One of my hobbies is to watch those fun Vsauce or Kurzgesagt videos on YouTube about space topics, but never really learned some of the basic material about planets and stars\/mathematical concepts that we learned in class. Getting a more basic grasp of that knowledge helped feed my casual interest in the topic. While the class is math heavy, it does not go beyond basic algebra\/geometry for the most part, and all formulas are given on exams. If you are more comfortable with numbers, it makes the class all the more enjoyable.",
    "If you need a science or QR credit, this class will be fine. It's not too hard as long as you're okay with some math -- there's not a ton of memorization to do. The material is interesting, it's just not taught in the most engaging way."
