This class also really improved my writing organization, clarity, and brevity. I also honed my critical thinking and research skills. His class also developed the regular practice of writing with regular Discussion posts about the short stories we read. He also encouraged developing constructive peer review practices. Danny also provides excellent constructive feedback, and provides it in a manner that, while constructive, is not discouraging (and he always seems enthusiastic to read what you've written)!"

                "The focus on short stories allowed the reading and writing topics to approach depths of complexity without requiring volumes of reading. The essay formats challenge writers to think in different ways about texts and to maintain strong writing practices regardless of the style of argument.",
                "strengths:\r\n- the readings (reading short stories is rarely terribly time consuming, so we were able to sample dozens of different authors, which was lovely)\r\n- DANNY! Danny was easily the best English teacher Ive ever had. He is very good at facilitating discussion, and even better at asking the class hard questions to move the discussion along.",
                "The course moved at a good pace and did a great job blending critical reading\/analytical writing. I liked the discussion formats, but sometimes the discussions felt like they could have been a little less structuredi.e. we could have been given more freedom to structure the conversation according to our own thoughts about the stories. But on the whole, the course was quite well organized and executed.",
                "The readings for the course were really great, and the class discussions were always engaging. I think one weakness was that we didn't have any time to workshop our final short story, so more feedback throughout that writing process would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: only relevant (and interesting) readings were assigned and everyone was engaged and participated in class, allowing for an in-depth discussion of each text.\r\nWeaknesses: the only minor weakness was that more time could have been spent explaining the structure and writing style needed for each different essay type.",
                "The top strength of this section of ENGL 115 is the Professor, Daniel Diaz de la Rocha! Each week, he selected engaging short stories to read to stimulate our personal critical viewpoints, thoughtful literary analysis, engaging class discussions, and thoughtful peer reviews. Danny also provides excellent constructive feedback, and provides it in a manner that, while constructive, is not discouraging (and he always seems enthusiastic to read what you've written)! (Another strength was the amazing classmates I had this semestera group that became surprisingly close and tight-knit throughout the semester! We genuinely looked forward to reading each other's Discussion posts and final short stories!)"

You get to read a ton of incredible short stories, and by the end of the class it feels like you are familiar with a bunch of writers and different styles and structures of storytelling. The feedback I got throughout the semester improved my essays significantly, and the whole class made me want to try more English and creative writing courses in the future.",
                "I would highly recommend this course with Danny - the short stories are all very fun to read and Danny is an excellent instructor. Getting to write your own short story at the end was also a great way to conclude the course.",
                "Definitely! It's a unique literature seminar in that it's focused on the art of the short story instead of through the lens of long novels. I learned a lot about what makes a story either work or not work. This class also really improved my writing organization, clarity, and brevity. I also honed my critical thinking and research skills.
