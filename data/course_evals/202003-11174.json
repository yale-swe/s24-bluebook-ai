This class was very engaging, and the environment was very ideal for learning a new language. I think of the weaknesses was that writing characters was not an emphasized part of the course as much as the other parts, which may have been due to the changes made to the course due to COVID-19. I think making the \"writing\" portion of the test mandatory for every test would be more beneficial in ensuring students learn the characters."

In other classes, I had longer and less frequent ones, which when combined with the classes being virtual, made it really easy for me to fall behind.",

The content is overwhelming at first; however, the language gets easier to pronounce as the more it's learned. This is also a great way to challenge academic discipline when it comes to homework and work load.",
