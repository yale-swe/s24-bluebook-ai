   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about transgender theory and feminism from high-profile scholars in these areas of study. This class focused on trans theory for most of the semester which was really interesting.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester by far. I learned so many things that Im finding it difficult to capture the extent of what I learned in this response. This course (and professor, importantly) refined my writing abilities and prepared me to take more advanced writing courses. I learned how to think analytically about texts, especially in the realm of close reading. Essentially, I learned how to write a college-level essay in terms of structure and evidence. The course topic was gender and I gained insights about gender that Ive never even known were considerations. In other words, this class is where I began to think at a truly critical level about the role\/construction of gender in our society. I was exposed to a new and widely diverse range of perspectives about gender.",
    "It was a great introduction to writing at Yale, especially as a first-year. The material was extremely engaging and helping widen and change my understanding of gender in a way that was helpful, personal, and is something I will take with me well beyond college even though I'm not a WGSS major.",
    "It was my first introduction to queer academics, so while I sharpened my writing skills, I also left the class knowing a lot more about queer theory than I expected to.",
    "I learned how to think about gender in a theoretical framework and how it applies to contemporary issues."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the readings were pretty long and it was a little frustrating when we wouldn't talk about them in class. Other than that, the class was organized very well and made for some great discussions.",
    "This course is appropriate for anybody regardless of what kind of background knowledge they have on understanding gender issues. I see that as a huge strength of the coursethe syllabus covers some fundamental, or well-established, queer theory all the way to the most recent developments in the field. Everything is contextualized in the modern day too, which is important in our volatile sociopolitical climate. The only weakness of the course is that there wasnt enough time to deeply explore all the material we were exposed to, by virtue of this being an English 114 as well as an introduction to WGSS. But thats also just because everything we read was so thought-provoking.",
    "I know the focus of the class is on the student writing as an Engl 114, but I would've liked more time to engage with certain readings.",
    "The selection of readings were a strength of the course. They were diverse and always engaging. When one was too complicated, we spent ample time in class dissecting it until it was comprehendible. My one complaint is that the first half of the semester feels very rushed, while the second half was very relaxed. I would prefer a happy medium."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Sam Huber is a wonderful professor and this topic is so riveting. The discussions we had in class were great. The papers weren't bad at all; they are spaced out appropriately and really go well with what you're learning in class. The final paper was very open-ended, and I really enjoyed writing it.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. Like I said, anybody could benefit from the discourse that this course and professor fostered, regardless of their pre-existing understanding of gender. The course readings are just so interesting. Its safe to say that most students have not been exposed to these queer theorists\/figures before. I feel like my own understanding of gender has been complicated in the best way possible and I want other people to have this experience too.",
    "Yes! Especially to students looking for a great Engl 114 or who have some interest in WGSS, but not little about queer and trans theory.",
    "Yes! First and foremost, Sam was an amazing instructor. If you have the chance to take any class with him, you should. Secondly, if you want to take a course that assumes no prior knowledge, this is for you. I was relieved and happy to find that each author and theorist was completely introduced, and the new information was not overwhelming.",
    "Yes! This class definitely made me think about gender in a more constructive and analytical manner."
