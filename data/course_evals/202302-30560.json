I have come out of this class feeling very comfortable having day-to-day conversations with Native Speakers and roughly understanding late elementary school reading-level books in German. That is a HUGE accomplishment. This course probably marked the biggest leap in my German knowledge so far. I highly recommend taking it in Berlin/Germany if you can.",

It also feels like there's not much you can do to prepare except go over the grammar and vocabulary. Overall, excellent course!",
