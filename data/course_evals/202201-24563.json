Whether you have a connection to Latin America or not, I feel like this course does a great job at dealing with sensitive topics and material, and having the opportunity to learn under Prof. Aguilar is such a privilege which makes the overall course a great academic experience.",

We also learned about the Inter-American human rights framework and the marginalization of Indigenous peoples across the region, particularly in Guatemala.",
                "I developed a profound knowledge of violence in Latin America under different dictatorships. I also learned about the direct influence Western society had on the violence that continues to happen in Latin America today.",

                "Very little",

                "Well-developed course with interesting reading and a wonderful Professor. Feedback for written assignments could be more prompt.",
                "Professor Aguilar was an amazing professor to take this class with; I learned so much and while the content was heavy, Professor Aguilar handled it with grace and the nuance and complexity that it needed to be handled. She really cared about both the material and her students and it showed.",
                "Everything about this class from the syllabus to how the class was structured was a strength. A major strength is that she gives you a variety of assignments so you are never doing the same thing twice. We were assigned weekly readings, one 1-2 page primary source analysis paper, one 1-page film reflection, one presentation for a week you can select, a write up of what you hope your final project to be during the midterm, then a quick 5-min presentation that does not have to be presentation slides about your final, and then your final. I think this course could be improved if the students who are presenting that week had more of an opportunity to guide the discussion that day, but other than that, the class was incredibly in every way.",
                "The course could have clearer instructions for assignments. Also, I wish wed gotten feedback on assignments. Other than that it was very strong.",
                "I greatly appreciated how this seminar wasn't just a discussion of class readings. Instead, Professor Aguilar would provide background information that often included analyzing primary sources such as declassified documents and secondary sources such as documentaries and media on historical events. I don't think this course has any weaknesses.",
                "It was great all around.",
                "This course was perfectly organized, from the clear list of readings and films (and where to view them) to the consistent communication via Canvas announcements about assignments. The topics we covered each built on the previous week's themes and exposed us to other countries' dictatorships, films many of us hadn't seen before, and speakers working on human rights issues in the U.S. and abroad.",
                "I loved the seminar setting and the use of documentaries as assigned homework.",
                "Excellent course, no improvements.",
                "The main weakness was the extremely shallow level of critical thinking. Also the communist sentiment",
                "The strengths of this class were Professor Aguilar, and also the readings/viewings and discussions. Prof Aguilar began each session with a well-structured and informative lecture, and the second half of the class was discussion about the readings. Because the topics we were looking at were so important, I felt like everyone was very invested in the material -- partially also because of the environment Prof Aguilar developed. It was a very safe and supportive space! And the class caters towards people who actually care about the material -- so the class environment was excellent."

I think that the histories covered in this course are oftentimes downplayed or ignored by the media, and I think that they are extremely important to understand not only Latin America, but the role the US has played in the region. I would recommend it to anyone who is slightly interested in Latin America, I swear this course will make you passionate about the region.",
                "Absolutley!",

                "Yes! The history taught in this class is something everyone should know.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. Hands down, this is the most meaningful class I have taken at Yale. The class is structured perfectly. We are given weekly readings with no required reading responses, so we really have time to focus on the readings and to read thoroughly and deeply because we do not have to stress about submitting a response by a deadline. Professor Aguilar also knows how to create a powerful, beautiful, necessary syllabus. We were assigned various forms of literature and various forms of media and I really appreciated the opportunity to learn from and engage with different media. If you are Central American, 1000% take this class!",

                "Yes! Honestly this class was amazing -- not too much work but people still do the readings and viewings because its very well-curated material everyone cares about! Professor Aguilar is a gem and you should take any class with her if you get the chance!!"
