                "I would not recommend this course. To be honest, most of the time it felt like a waste of a credit. The classes taught by Professor Weiss were repetitive, boring, difficult to follow, relatively uninformative, and sometimes downright uncomfortable. Most of the time was spent listening to him ask questions (which could have led to interesting discussions, had he encouraged students to actually answer them) that he then answered himself, usually in long, disjointed rambles. The way he talked about the material was extraordinarily disorganized and made it a challenge to even stay on the same page as him. After guest lectures, which were much more well-organized and enjoyable, Professor Weiss spent the next class mainly just talking smack about the guests and what they did or didn't include in their presentations, which was frankly a disturbing and discouraging thing to see in what should be a constructive, collaborative field. While I don't doubt his experience and contributions as an archaeologist, and I think his ideas regarding civilization genesis and collapse are well-crafted, he was simply not an enjoyable lecturer. The course materials were in complete disarray, with an unorganized Canvas file scheme cluttered with dozens of files from previous years that we didn't even touch. The final essay was more-or-less unrelated to anything we had engaged with in class up to that point, centered on a reading that he didn't post on Canvas, and he didn't post the prompt on Canvas either, so I wasn't even entirely sure what I was meant to write about. Overall, while the readings could be interesting, that was more or less the only positive attribute of the class. I would avoid this course unless you thrive on chaos."
