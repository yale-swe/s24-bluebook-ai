                "I liked the low pressure regarding grades. Professor Korie really pushed the class to improve, but did not threaten our grades. This helped me completely focus on the skill instead of just maintaining the grade in the class.",
                "Strengths: lots of exposure to musical theatre, great opportunities to work with others, lots of chances to write and produce a lot of work!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you're looking for a lot of structure, this is probably not the course for you. Assignments are done independently and you're never required to share your work, so you definitely get out of this class what you put into it."

            "comments": [
                "Yes! Take it if youre interested in lyrics for musical theater, but also in songwriting more broadly or theater in general. As someone looking to direct and produce, getting to try the creative aspect of collaboration firsthand was not only incredibly fun, but I am certain it has made me a stronger collaborator since I will have a better understanding of what my creative colleagues need to be supported in their process.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It is a great way to get to work with other creative students and hone a skill that you may not have tried without this class.",
                "Heres the deal. Lyric writing is an easy A as long as you do the work. However, because the course doesnt have a lot of minor assignments or tangible expectations from you, its easy to skate by and not actually take away anything. If youre actually interested in the craft of lyric writing, make sure youre always working on something because unlike Musical Theater Composition, there is no write a song a week requirement, and otherwise, youll leave the semester going, did I even write anything?. Im glad I took the course as a TAPS major who has a particular interest in writing musical theater, but if youre not actually interested in the topic and are just looking for the easy A, youll probably find it, but youll be bored. If youre passionate about writing musical theatre and the grade isnt the reason youre taking the class, it can be a bit disheartening when Korie criticizes your work harshly, but its also useful exposure to harsh criticism that doesnt actually reflect in your grade, which I found refreshing. Rarely when a professor says they dont believe in grading creativity do they actually follow through, but I give Korie credit- he actually grades purely on participation and his critiques are purely for your own self-edification.",
                "Definitely! If you're interesting in song-writing, musical theatre or otherwise, this is a great class to introduce you to the basics, give you opportunities to write, and expose you to other students who have similar interests."
