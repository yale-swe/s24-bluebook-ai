                "I learned a lot about Creative Embedded Systems (the course is appropriately named)! Learning about ESP32s, servos, steppers, motors, wireless communication, buttons, switches, processing analog & digital I/O, and various ideas about creativity. It was a phenomenal way to become introduced to the world of embedded systems, especially for someone with limited experience entering the class. Scott definitely challenges and guides individuals at any skill level, and ensures that students leave the class with a significantly greater knowledge than they had entering. The projects also teach lots of group collaboration skills--while many of my other classes have had group projects, the intense planning and availability that goes into this class & its projects requires a new level of collaboration skills. The intensity of the group projects also makes them fun! Students become friends with the other students in the class, especially their project group partners.",
                "How to apply a RaspberryPi and an ESP32 creatively based on their limitations. Also learned a whole bunch of random languages like Java, JavaScript (p5.js and Processing), Python, C++. Also learned how to use Github",
                "I learned quite a lot about how to incorporate hardware (like switches, buttons, lights, motors, etc.) into systems. It was my first time working with hardware, and although it is quite a quick (basically nonexistent) introduction to circuits and how all that stuff works, you definitely will learn a lot about how to build an embedded system through the projects. I also got a basic introduction to how networks work and how some other areas of computer science fit into building a fully functional system, which was definitely pretty cool."

                "Strengths: the projects, creative demands, the prof, the intimacy of the class\r\nWeaknesses: harsh grading, most time-consuming, short turnaround time",
                "The design of this course if pretty great. For the most part, you get to build things that you think are cool. You can see your code do cool things in the physical world.\r\n\r\nThere are definitely a few pretty significant weaknesses to this course. First of all, almost everyone in the class agreed the pace of the class was too fast. Creating a fairly significant project (a full embedded system) every two weeks means that no matter what you will be rushing during the days before the project. I almost always had to spend the day or two before the project working really late into the night, pretty much no matter how early I started.\r\n\r\nThe grading of your projects can be pretty arbitrary. A big portion is whether the instructors deem your project \"creative\" or not, which seems pretty subjective. Scott's perspective on whether or not something is creative largely comes from the field of combinatorial theory, meaning he doesn't want you to create something with high utility or something that's been created before. This can feel pretty restrictive. If what you want to create doesn't fall within this definition of creativity, no matter the robustness of your design / the creative choices you make, you will definitely lose a good portion of points."

                "Hands-down, absolutely, without a doubt. I wouldn't hesitate to call this class the top class I've ever taken at Yale--the small class size & friendly atmosphere, the great teaching team, and the wealth of completely new knowledge that I can genuinely refer to in the future. It's incredible. The class also places a HUGE emphasis on application rather than memorization. There are no quizzes about proper terminology, historical facts, etc. Instead, the class focuses on applying your knowledge from class about how a servo (or wireless communication, or circuitry, ...) works to a project. You've inadvertently learned so much by the time that project is finished. I feel like this is a class where I can and will apply my new skills well into my future life. Many of my friends enjoyed playing with my projects and I enjoyed working with classmates to actualize the projects. I have encouraged many of my friends to take this class. This class will be one of the classes that I best remember after graduating.",
                "Definitely would recommend. People don't take this class as they think it is too hard. It is not on the same level as 323 in terms of difficulty, but it is a very time-consuming class. The projects you do, if you actually put effort into them, can be put on your resume/Github. I would say, just pay attention to rubric requirements. The grading is surprisingly harsh.",
                "It's hard to say. On the one hand, you'll definitely make a lot of cool things and come out of the class with a better understanding of how hardware and software fit together. On the other hand, the course is definitely too fast paced and also Scott can be very difficult to work with / have as an instructor."
