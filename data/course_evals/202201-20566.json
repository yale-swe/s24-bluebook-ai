Instead, I feel like I've learned a good amount of information on each of these topics and feel motivated to learn more about them beyond the course. Another bonus for the course is that I learned some of the most useful strategies on how to study and how to memorize things. I actually used them in three other exams I'm taking this semester and the strategies proved extremely helpful! Want to know what strategies I learned? Take this course!",

            "comments": [
                "The course was interesting and it was refreshing to not simply follow a textbook. My only suggestion would be more practice material for the midterm\/final.",
                "Stephanie Lazzaro was an amazing professor\/lecturer, and I often missed her during guest lectures. I thought her lectures all tied together very well even as they targeted specific areas of psychological inquiry. Some of the guest lectures seemed out of left-field.\r\n\r\nThe exam questions (some of them) are a little unfair, and get way too specific. I studied for a reasonably long time for the final examination, and at least two of its questions were unreasonable or required rote memorization.\r\n\r\nThe final research paper was a fun project that helped me engage more deeply with the process of reviewing scientific literature and understanding how experiments in psychology are generated.",
                "Strengths: Stephanie is an amazing lecturer and in general the lectures were a lot of fun and educational; If I had stopped going to lecture and just learned from the slides and recordings, the class would have felt like hell. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the work I would describe as \"pesky.\" There's not a ton, but it's always a little nagging and very inconvenient. Additionally, it's hard to tell what exactly will be on the exams, as there's a bunch of tiny stuff touched on in lecture and it's hard to tell what exactly to study. The Finals load is the main drawback, though. I took this as a fifth class expecting it to be basically a gut and was hit with a final exam AND a final paper. Not fun.",
                "The instructor is fun and makes this class less boring. But workload is a bit high.  There are mid and final exams, homework and 5 credits to do experiments and final paper as well. If we have already so much work to do, I suggest do not write final paper anymore.",
                "The lectures are truly interesting.",
                "Strengths: the instructor. Stephanie is probably the best lecturer on campus. She keeps us engaged, knows how to make a slideshow that is actually interesting and makes sense, and makes her self and the lectures available online. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the assignments felt a little easy at times and wished there was some more challenge. I also feel like the exams should just be taken remotely.",
                "Some of the exam questions were poorly worded and not designed to test our actual understanding of the material. But other than that this class was quite enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lectures that included class polls, video demonstrations, songs, and plenty of real life examples to keep students engaged. Professor Lazzaro is a lovely person and greater lecturer! Also, the workload was very manageable, and psets only took an hour or two max. Weaknesses: the pace of the lectures was oftentimes fairly fast (100+ slides per lecture)having recorded lectures was a godsend. Also, the actual names of the psychological fields that we learned weren't explicitly named; it felt like we were learning a lot of disparate things without knowing what category of psychology they filed under. The way that each lecture was framed in terms of a question was interesting, but defining the overarching psychological fields and grouping the lectures in terms of these fields may be more conducive for student learning. Also, exams tended to test very specific details.",
                "Really appreciated that classes were recorded! It took off pressure for when she further explained things in class that were not included in lecture slides (though the lecture slides are REALLY thorough already). Tests were hard to study for because there was so much information in the slides that it was kind of difficult to know what to focus on. But I guess if you memorize all the slides and the readings, you should be pretty good for tests? With the amount of information that was covered, I really wish both tests were open-note instead of just one.",
                "Strengths: Homework assignments are not too difficult, material is presented clearly and efficiently.",
                "The course is really informative! Stephanie is wonderful and she frames her lectures very well. She tries to relate psychology to our daily lives, which is very informative and fun! I do wish that sometimes the assignments reinforced topics taught in lecture more directly.",
                "This course is a delight to take because every lecture feels like a TED Talk on a new topic. Everything we learned was directly applicable to every day life, and I found myself talking about the topics to friends who were not in the class. Prof. Lazzaro did a great job making lecture welcoming and engaging - I really liked how she played music at the start of every lecture, and I also really liked the videos shown throughout lecture. The workload of the class is light on a weekly basis but requires some prep before exams. Some of the lectures had lists of key concepts at the end, and some did not - having this in every lecture would have helped me better prepare for the exams because there is a lot of content in every lecture. The parts of the brain, vision, and memory lectures were particularly dense.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is an amazing professor. Her explanations are clear and she always makes herself available for questions during and after class.\r\nWeaknesses: It is easy to become disengaged from the course given how disconnected the work is from the assignments (sometimes, our assignments were 2 weeks behind the lectures, which made engaging in the homework material and lecture material seem disjointed).",
                "Strengths: Very good lectures with interesting concepts. Lectures would always start with a question that would be answered throughout the lecture.",
                "Strengths - high level of engagement in lecture. It's hard to get bored in lecture when Steph is showing us funny videos, relevant examples, and having us participate in experiments like tasting PTC strips. The grading system is weighted so the midterm that you did better on counts for 10% more. The TFs give great feedback as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I wasn't a huge fan of the exam format of multiple choice. I wish they had more short answer\/long answer questions where you could really demonstrate what you knew since multiple choice just seems to test how good you are at eliminating other choices.",
                "no weakness, the course was 10\/10",
                "Strengths: Each lecture is focused on a question that sparks your interest and makes you want to learn more! The workload is super manageable, just make sure you get your experimental credits done, and don't wait until the last minute. Professor Lazzaro is great! I don't think there were any significant weaknessnes.",
                "Strengths: very interesting content, lectures very enjoyable\/engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures contained a LOT of information, often difficult to discern what the most important aspects were\/what to study",
                "The course is well organized, each lecture has a theme that is explored. Sometimes, I felt the concepts were pretty self-explanatory and obvious.",
                "needs to be much more organized. material and content was not presented in a way that could be properly understood",
                "Strengths: Slides and recordings always posted to canvas, very flexible hybrid format. Professor Lazzaro always makes class interesting. The course is very interactive.",
                "Professor was a strength. Teaching format (lectures based off of guiding curiosities\/overarching questions was a strength. Homeworks could be improved to be a little more involved.",
                "The class is good, it is a simple and straight forward intro class. The exams are surprisingly detailed, so be sure to study.",
                "My favorite part of the course is that it is question-driven rather than organized traditionally by chapters in a psychology textbook. Prof. Lazzareo began each lecture with a leading question, such as \"Do we see the same blue?\" \"Is my memory a video camera?\" \"Do we have free will?\" \"What is love?\" and then drew on different branches of psychology and different theories to explore the question from a scientific point of view. This creative way of organizing the course made it more engaging and a typical intro to psych course and offers an experience you can never gain on your own simply by reading a psychology textbook. Another highlight of this course is the required research participation credits. I didn't know it existed before I took this course, but I actually turned out to like it a lot as a unique opportunity to get to know all different kinds of cool research that are going on here at Yale and actually contributing something to the research by participating.",
                "Strengths: the lecture slides, recordings, and readings were always provided promptly; it was easy to receive help at pretty much any time from Professor Lazzaro and the TAs by email, office hours, and Ed Discussion; the assignments were relevant to the topics covered in lecture and did not require too much time; guest lecturers were great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the course is unique and interesting in that each lecture is centered around a question that is connected to the main concept, but this can make it difficult to understand how the given concept fits into psychology as a whole. Dividing the content a bit more into units such as \"Behavior,\" \"Sensation and Perception,\" \"Learning,\" and \"Memory\" might help to provide more context and make the material stick.",
                "A strength is the instructor as they lecture very well. The availability of the lecture slides and recordings is additionally wonderful. A weakness may be the lack of more test prep material and helpful feedback.",
                "I appreciate the efforts of Professor Lazzaro to make interesting lectures and she is a very nice person, but I felt most of the class was just learning and memorizing random facts. This could also just have been because I do not really like psychology as a subject very much because there is no rigor or justification in most of the studies. It feels like the information you learn in those Instagram\/Facebook posts. Since I do not know what else is in the field of psychology, I don't really know how to make the course better.",
                "Strengths: Prof Lazzaro is a great lecturer. Her content was well presented and easily digestible. Although I didn't go to the TFs, they seemed generally available and helpful. Ed discussions was big as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The actual topics covered need a LOT of reevaluation. We spent about 3-4 lectures just on how our eyes work, like the nitty-gritty rods and cones type of science, which seemed way more like biology\/anatomy than psychology. Most of the topics felt a little pop-sciency (optical illusions, etc.) or way beyond the scope of the course (what are the parts of the neuron; how many times can a cone fire?).",
                "Strengths include interactive classroom activities and relevant p-set assignments.",
                "This course was very engaging and one of my favorite lectures to attend. Professor Lazzaro was an excellent, compassionate lecturer and her slides and activities often made my day.",
                "No weaknesses. The course was very entertaining and something I looked forward to every week. I learned so much!",
                "More engagement with TAs",
                "The lectures were highly engaging and exciting. I found myself looking forward to the next lectures because of the questions we were asked to answer online. One thing that I didn't enjoy was the structure of the exams and the final paper. I felt that the final paper was wholly unnecessary to my application of things we learned in class. The last exam administered online was also a huge disaster due to 200+ students trying to access the internet all at once. I don't know what they thought was going to happen. Other than that, the homework was simple and quick, and the lectures were so much fun!",
                "Engaging lecture with tons of interesting guests.",
                "Strength: Professor, fair exams, fair assignments",
                "Strengths: Professor Lazzaro is a wonderful professor. She made sure to cover all the content of the course. There is not a lot of work. Weakness: she tends to give a lot of content per class and it sometimes felt overwhelming. Each slide had about 100 slides and she covered everything in lecture. Another weakness is that we had our second midterm the third week of classes and then we had to submit a final paper the following week.",
                "It was helpful that this course was recorded and brought in interesting guest lecturers.",
                "Strong in its comprehensive delivery of necessary information. All delivered in a fun way. Weak in its general lack of academic topics within lectures.",
                "Strengths: the lectures were very engaging, informative, and interesting. It was not boring to listen to lecture (it was fun). The lectures being recorded helped me study a lot because I was able to re-watch them and hear things I didn't catch the first time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt the final paper had a lot to write about, and a lot of different aspects to it. It was hard to synthesize.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lazzaro may have been the best professor Ive had so far. Her lectures are fun, engaging, entertaining, and interesting. She was easily the high mark of the class. Weakness: nothing",
                "It was a great course overall.",
                "Lectures were interesting and informative. We were not fully prepared for the final paper, though. A lecture about how to analyze studies and how to write an experimental proposal would have been helpful.",
                "The strengths of the course was the clear communication behind assignments, exams, and other important information in the course, the way the content was taught during the lecture, the manageable workload of the course, and how approachable the professor and teaching fellows were during and after class, and at office hours. The design of the final paper was another strength of the course, as it helped students acquire the important skills of literature review and proposing an experiment or correlational study in psychology. A weakness of the course is that Exam I was open-note, while Exam II was closed-note, which meant that students were not sure what to expect when taking the closed-note exam (Exam II). Another weakness of the course is the change in grading that occurred when the TFs were grading Assignments 1-7, versus when they were grading the final two assignments for the course.",
                "Engagement for this course was low.",
                "Strengths: the online recordings were great if I couldn't make it to class that day. Also, the guest lectures were a good change of pace.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the points the prof was trying to make couldn't be empirically backed and seemed to be very general.",
                "Because the class is so large and lectures are recorded, there is little motivation to attend class.",
                "This class oftentimes focused on ideas that seemed to be outside the scope of psychology (i.e. the parts of the eyes\/how each respective part works). Additionally, the extreme length of lecture slides\/notes made it difficult to study for exams.",
                "We covered a broad range of topics and the TA's were very supportive. The lectures were very clear and engaging.",
                "This course structures its learning goals around questions (such as \"Is my eye like a camera?\"), which makes it more engaging and interesting. The topics are presented well, and the evaluations seem fitting for the level of the course. The guest lectures were also a strength because they introduced us to modern research questions and work going on at Yale. A weakness is that some of the psychological studies we learned about did not have a very rigorous scientific grounding, but this is partly the nature of psychology and not necessarily a problem with the class. However, more emphasis on flaws in the studies and how to improve them might be warranted.",
                "I think participating in research studies is a great addition to the course. I think that the grading divisions however could be improved. The weight of the sections seem very odd.",
                "The lectures and assignments were interesting.",
                "It was a fun course with very fun and interesting lectures. Also the workload was light. One thing was that the exams were a little tough considering the difficulty of the homework.",
                "liked ED discussion and quick response from teachers.",
                "This course could have more engaging lectures and specialized topics",
                "strengths: clear lectures, manageable tests and assignments\r\nweaknesses: the curriculum itself felt a little disorganized",
                "Strengths: The professor made the lecture engaging and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Exams asked very specific questions even though we were told that they would only cover concepts and key terms",
                "Strengths: lots! The lectures were super interesting and engaging. I highly enjoyed Professor Lazzaros enthusiasm and joy of teaching. Workload was great and the midterms were reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: basically nothing! I think I would have liked an option to explore my own research topic for the final paper instead of one of the prescribed ones",
                "The weekly assignments were somewhat time consuming and did not necessarily reinforce class material. Also, the final exam was a week before the final paper was due, such that there was a lot of work towards the end of the semester.",
                "The class was very low stress and fun, which I enjoyed. I also thought it was fun to participate in research studies.",
                "Strength: Really great lectures! Weakness: no discussion sections.",
                "Strengths: actually really enjoyed going to class, super interesting lectures but also very intro and basic (kind of like psych ap i have been told)\\\r\nWeaknesses: TF marking is relative",
                "NA",
                "Weakness: difference in grading according to TA",
                "I really liked everything about the class. It's super engaging and the workload is very manageable. the only thing I wish was different was that we had a little more guidance on the final paper, but the class really is wonderful!",
                "Strength: Good lectures\r\nWeakness: no interactions",
                "Lectures were diverse and very thorough. Loved guest lectures. Very little guidance was provided for the research paper.",
                "interesting content but very slow.",
                "The lecture style of the course led my engagement to be very passive.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting course material that is applicable to everyday life, engaging lectures (especially with Steph Lazzaro!), relatively light workload and straight-forward exams if you pay attention in class\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures move fairly quickly; even though attendance is optional, the exams would be pretty difficult if you skipped a lecture",
                "Very difficult exams. Course work is very easy along with everything else leading up to the exam's. Exams are very challenging due to such ease in work leading up to exam.",
                "It was hard to engage through lecture only interface. I would have preferred designated timeslot for discussion sections maybe?",
                "I think the course was very interesting, and it was exactly what I thought it would be like when I signed up. The only weakness was that sometimes it was difficult to stay engaged.",
                "Strengths are the lectures, very in depth and interesting. I appreciate all the learning aids like videos and interactive polls. I didn't like the exam format, there is so much information we are expected to retain and it makes sense to have the tests open note if they are kept the way they are. It would also maybe be better to implement smaller quizzes throughout the semester on specific topics so that we can thoroughly learn those concepts rather than being expected to study\/remember everything all at once from the semester.",
                "Strengths: learn a lot. Weaknesses: slides are too long, and exams cover too much material. Maybe if there was more than two midterms?",
                "Strengths: Lazzaro has engaging content for every lecture\r\nWeaknesses: Final paper is more nit-picky than I expected. This is an introduction to psychology class, yet the final paper which is an experiment proposal seemed to be graded more on how well it was written than the idea.",
                "This course is a strong introductory course. I like how the lectures are organized around central questions. I also liked how interactive the lectures were. I don't have any substantial complaints about the course.",
                "Better preparation for exams would be very helpful.",
                "I found the material and lectures to be very engaging, though they were long side usually. I would say that the professor should increase and maintain the engagement activities throughout the lectures. I think some more guidance on the homework assignments and research paper beginning would be helpful because sometimes I would get points off and insufficient reasoning as to why",
                "Strength: Homework was short, straightforward and generally enjoyable -- and it did a decent job of reinforcing lecture concepts\r\nWeakness: Prof could consider re-organizing lecture content -- the driving question behind each lecture was not always that relevant (by the end of the lecture). If it was about a specific brain function (ex. vision) it was better, but the larger behavioral questions were hit or miss.",
                "Great course",
                "The main weakness of this course was its failure to fully incorporate the process of writing a psychological research paper in the course. The lack of this and then the requirement of students to write a final research paper is inconsistent. The strengths lied in the lenience of the course lectures and the workload."

                "Yes! It's an interesting class regardless of whether one intends to pursue a major in social sciences. It is enjoyable and a good way to fulfill a distributional requirement.",
                "Yes. Professor Lazzaro is a great instructor. I'm not a PSYC major and not interested in studying it beyond this course, but I've found the concepts I learned in this class constantly applicable to my life and how I think about things. A few of the lectures will blow your mind.",
                "I hesitantly would, but with a few precautions: the first is to ONLY TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU PLAN ON ATTENDING LECTURE! This seems intentionally designed which if it is they did a good job; I had a couple weeks where I didn't attend lecture and instead took notes on the slides and let me tell you those slides are not designed for at home note taking. Don't expect an easy A gut, and dont take this class if you expect 0 work. Those weekly assignments sneak up on you and are quite annoying, and the final paper and exam are relaxed enough, but still no joke. This class is not like the other psych classes you hear about with absolutely no work.",
                "Yes. I think we all need to learn psychology to know ourselves better and human beings' behavior better.",
                "Intro to Psyc is such an interesting course. Although this course just gives a general overview of psychology, each lecture presented a new idea and set of studies, theories, etc.",
                "Definitely. It is a pretty easy course. You do have to study for the exams, though. And start early on those research credits and the final paper. The deadlines in the class are pretty chill but sneak up really fast.",
                "Yes. This is a good introductory class. It is straightforward and coherent, and the lecture material is very interesting.",
                "Yes! It provides a good overview of general psychology, and you'll find a lot of the studies and examples are relevant and applicable to your daily life.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that wants an introduction to psychology and an interactive, engaging professor.",
                "Yes! PSYC 110 was a great introductory psychology course and provided an informative survey into various topics in psychology. It felt like the right amount of depth on each topic for an introductory course, and it was really interesting throughout! Stephanie is a great lecturer which makes the class so much better.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend taking this course, especially with Prof. Lazzaro. I learned a lot of concepts that I find myself using in every day life (post-decisional dissonance may be influencing my opinion of this course but...). I looked forward to going to every lecture because each one was so unique and engaging. If you're a first year, I think this would be a great intro to college. If you're a senior, this is a phenomenal class to take before you graduate.",
                "I would highly recommend this course if it is taught by Professor Lazzaro. There is a lot to be learned and gained from taking this course. A word of caution: Be prepared to have to motivate yourself to stay engaged and on top of the material. The exams call upon detailed information from the slides so they require a fair bit of review and memorization.",
                "Yes, great class, very fun, and entertaining.",
                "Yes! It has a super low workload but you still learn a lot",

                "Yes! It is a great class with interesting topics. It is great for a 5th class or just a fun class in your semester!",
                "Yes, it is a good \"gut\" for stem majors trying to clear a social science credit. the homework is weekly and does not take more than one, maybe two hours max to complete",

                "I would recommend this course to any other student who is interested in getting a solid introduction to psychology.",
                "Absolutely. I have never taken a psych course in my life and loved Intro Psych, if not purely to learn about how I think and the dynamics of interactions that govern my daily life.",
                "Be careful with this one. I came into it because everyone said ti would be a gut. However, I did not treat it as one. I created study guides, studied for exams, and went to all lectures. Still, the exams were pretty difficult, I ended up getting high Bs on the exams...in a gut.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to any student interested in psychology. The workload is really chill while the content is extremely interesting. I spent at most two hours every week outside class to complete the required reading. The midterm and final exams are also quite friendly, mainly multiple choice questions with a few short response quetions. The final paper might sound intimdating at first, but once you make some progress in it you will find it quite manageable. I have never written a paper in a similar way before, but I actually ended up liking it a lot as I learned a lot from the process of doing literature review and designing my own experiment. I learned about many misconceptions of psychology and how it actually works as a science. In fact, although I've never learned any psychology before, I love the course so much that I am seriously considering majoring in psychology after taking it.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a general overview of psychology. Professor Lazzaro is a great lecturer, and the content would be a good introduction for someone who has no psychology background or is interested in learning fun psychological facts. If you have taken a psychology class before, this course will likely be a review for a light social science credit. I would not recommend this course to someone looking for an intellectual challenge.",
                "Yes, if interested in psychology this is a great place to start. Lectures are clear and instructive.",
                "I do not recommend this course to anyone. It was not rigorous enough for me to learn anything of substance or be intellectually challenged like in other courses at Yale, but it was also not an easy class by far. The exams were quite difficult and required brute memorization of random facts and the weekly assignments were sometimes graded unnecessarily harsh. I was quite disappointed by this course, especially since it had such a good reputation in the past. It feels like the course was more designed solely for the psychology department to have a subject pool since every student must participate in research studies.",
                "Not particularly, unless they need a SO credit, which is why I took it, or they're a psychology major, or they're going to Cr\/F it.",
                "Yes, this course covered interesting and engaging lecture content.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in psychology. It's a great introductory course and is taught very well. I'm not a psych major but this class has been among my favorites so far at Yale.",
                "YES. Take it. I wouldn't say it's a gut. But it is really manageable. Just go to class, complete the homework, and make sure to review before exams.",
                "Yes. It is important for all students to take this class",
                "Yes. I think this class is an excellent introduction to psychology, and the lectures helped me retain some of the material simply because of their engagement. The workload is manageable and the exams are fair.",
                "It is a nice introductory course to learn about who\/how we are, however the assignments can feel like busy-work.",

                "Yes- if you want a basic understanding of a breadth of topics in psychology then this is the class for you. Manageable workload and good professor.",
                "I would recommend this class if the student is interested in introductory psychology, it is a good and interesting introduction to psychology that is relatively low stress. Even after taking AP psychology, it was interesting to see the concepts in a new light, as this class focuses more on more modern psychology research rather than historical.",
                "If you have a busy workload, but feel guilty about taking a gut, take this course. Its fairly easy, and the workload is rather light, but you still learn a lot of fascinating material. Take this class if youre interested in psych and want a class that wont kill your schedule but youll still learn so much in.",
                "I would recommend to anyone interested in Psych and wants an introductory class to start with.",
                "Yes. It is a good way to start learning about psychology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The course is well organized to enable student learning, participation, and the course allowed enough time for the students to understand the material, complete the assignments, and prepare for the exams. The course is interesting, as it is a survey on human behavior, and one of the most interesting aspects of the course was the fact that we were taught how research in psychology has changed over the years, and specifically how psychology researchers performed rigorous research in order to develop the psychological concepts we know today. The course content was taught well, and the professor and TFs were approachable and students were able to ask questions freely. The participation during class made the class more engaging, while the assignments were well designed in order to solidify the student's overall understanding of the material presented during lecture.",
                "I would if you need a So credit and want to learn about a bunch of interesting psychological topics. The weekly reading assignments don't require much time, however, there's two closed-book midterms and a final paper. I wouldn't say it's a gut, and could be interesting if you go to lectures and pay attention.",
                "No, it's not even really a gut. The exams are difficult.",
                "Yes, it was a very interesting class and I learned a lot. The workload is not high  there are short weekly assignments, two non-cumulative exams, and a final paper  but this class is NOT a gut. The exams require lots of studying and the final paper is not easy. If you are looking for an easy fifth \"gut\" class, I would not recommend this unless you are Cr\/D\/F'ing or aren't looking for a super high grade (I think a B is easily attainable if you put some effort into studying, though an A will certainly require more time).",
                "I would recommend this class if you are interested in psychology or need an easy credit. If you already have psychology experience or took a class in high school I would recommend skipping this one and finding a more specific class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if you have never taken a psychology class at Yale before.",
                "This class isn't a gut the way most people make it out to be. If you're willing to invest extra time to memorize all the concepts, terms, and ideas, then I would recommend this course. However, if you're looking for a gut class, this is not the class to take.",
                "It is a great introductory course, both for someone who needs to meet a requirement and for someone who just wants to learn a bit of psychology. Exams were fair and workload manageable.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is relatively low workload, but it is interesting and definitely one of the classes I talked about with my friends the most. If you are interested in how your brain works, it is definitely a good intro, and it gives you the tools to do your own research outside of class.",
                "Yes, you learn a lot and the workload isnt too harsh",
                "Yes, i would definitely recommend this course because many topics are touched on and there is always something that could interest everyone.",
                "Sure, it is nice to get a basic foundation\/survey of the field of psychology.",
                "Absolutely. I think everyone should take this class because it offers an important foundation in a topic that everyone would benefit from understanding. I learned a lot about how to changes things in my personal life as a result of this course.",
                "Yes",
                "No.",
                "Definitely! If you are looking for a good, albeit very basic, introduction to psychology its a good and interesting class. Stephanie Lazzaro is amazing so take it with her if you can!",
                "Yes if you are interested in different psychological concepts and how they apply to the real world.",
                "Yes! Professor Lazzaro is an amazing lecturer  lectures were clear and concise and the class is very straightforward. I didnt expect to enjoy it as much as I did; plus, it satisfies a social science \/ premed requirement.",
                "Id recommend this class as a fifth course for people who are interested in the material.",
                "Yes, because the material is so applicable.",

                "Yes!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! It's a fun class and super engaging. Definitely take it with Professor Lazzaro if you can. She's wonderful.",
                "Yes",
                "I would! It helps. you immensely with understanding basic psychological concepts.",
                "Meh.",
                "Yes if they were interested to learn the basics of psychology.",
                "Absolutely! Psychology is really fascinating, and this course offers a really great overview of the subject with engaging lectures and really interesting examples and studies along the way. The weekly writing assignments are easy and often very fun, and the exams essentially just cover straight-forward details from lecture, so they are pretty easy as long as you pay attention in class. The lectures do move pretty quickly, so sometimes I would have to check the lecture slides after class to make sure I had everything in my notes, but the plus side of this is that I was engaged and paying attention every minute I was in class. I also found that the use of polls in class made lecture even more fun than it already was, mainly because Steph Lazzaro is a fabulous, engaging, and energetic lecturer and an incredibly kind person. It was definitely one of my favorite classes from the year and one that I always looked forward to attending. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in psych, and if you can, take it with Steph Lazzaro because she really is amazing!",
                "I would, if they were very interested in psychology.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are curious as to what psychology is like. We were introduced to a wide range of topics.",
                "Yes, it is a great introductory course to psychology and manageable workload.",
                "I would recommend this class if youre looking to get introduced to some basic concepts of psychology (some of which you may already know) if you havent taken any psychology class before and are looking for an easier credit.",
                "If you are interested in Psychology as a major, yes. But if you just want to take a Psychology course for fun, there are plenty of other courses that do a better job at engaging people I think. This is definitely more of an Introductory course, and the workload can pick up if you stop attending classes and stop doing work.",
                "I would recommend the course to any student looking for an easy, interesting social science credit. Lectures are always recorded and there are frequent office hours. Concepts are comparable to AP Psychology. Assignments are weekly but easy to complete. Exams are mostly memorization from lectures and readings. The course is quite broad though so it definitely serves as an introduction and a more focused course would be more fulfilling. Nice course to take alongside heavier workload.",
                "If you took AP Psych in high school and had a decent learning experience, no need to take this course as it is exactly the same content (and I took AP Psych 4 years ago). I recommend taking this course as a fifth credit if this can count towards your major (that is why I took it).",
                "Yes, just take good notes and you will be fine.",
                "Yes! PSYC 110 is a great introductory survey course. The lectures are engaging and fun, and the workload is extremely manageable. I found it genuinely informative.",
                "Yes. Very interesting even if you are not a psychology major.",
                "YES! It wasn't really stressful and there is only one reading response per week. Some of mine were short, some were long, but we were never graded off of length, rather than the quality of our work, so no need to overcompensate! As long as you paid attention to the lectures and read the readings for the exam, you're guaranteed to do well on the reading responses.",
                "Yes, take this class if you ever get the chance! Professor Lazzaro was simply amazing and the material was very engaging!",
                "For a psych credit, yes.",
