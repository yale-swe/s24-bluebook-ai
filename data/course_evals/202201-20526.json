                "Learned a ton about Markov chains, sampling from distributions, and Martingales. Some discussion of HMMs / MRFs, optimization, brownian motion, and stochastic diffusions. This class is also a good way to learn about useful tricks in probability (ie truncation, coupling, dominated convergence) in a less abstract setting than in a class like 400. While I think 241 teaches you the most useful formulas / ways to calculate probabilities, this is probably the best class for probabilistic reasoning in less explicit, but not overly abstract, examples.",
                "I learned a lot about Markov chains, Markov Random Fields, Martingales, and Brownian motion.",
                "This course is really rich and I learned a lot of things in this course that I knew about so little or even totally new. One major take of this course is the mentality of tackling proof and show-that-this type of problems. Mathematical thinking and logic are things I honed in this course. Even though I am not a student of statistics, this course gave me a good exposure to many concepts that I might need in the future.",

I got a fairly thorough introduction to the mathematical properties of these stochastic processes, as well as some real-life examples. From the homework problems, I learned how to both prove things about these processes along with how to apply them to different scenarios. Additionally, the final project allowed me to apply these concepts to concrete data. Thus, in addition to the mathematical reasoning skills I developed through the course material, I was able to gain more experience in data analytics."

            "comments": [
                "I think despite the high workload, the problems/practice were a good part of learning. The breadth of topics covered were also good, although I felt that the last few topics near the end of the semester were a bit more rushed than, say, the earlier topics. To make this more effective, I think better course organization could have helped students learn more. More planning regarding homework release and due dates, more consistent number of problems/points, and planning a schedule for the amount of time spent covering each topic would have been beneficial for students to have good practice in all of the covered topics. \r\n\r\nTo give a few examples: HW 5 was released in the middle of the spring recess with a due date in 7 days, counting the days of the break. But since there was no active assignment out before the break it would have been better to release it on the Wednesday before the break, giving students a full academic week to work on the assignment and not necessarily during the break. The time between the last assignment and the project deadline was too short to make meaningful progress (less than a week even with counting the last minute extension) especially considering that students are often taking multiple courses in a semester. The time to complete assignments were a bit irregular; although usually following a weekly schedule, there were instances of an assignment being released on the weekend due in 4 days and the last assignment released on Monday due Friday. Although the assignments were made (relatively) shorter, it would help to just plan the assignments to take the full week and fit multiple topics into one assignment if necessary. I believe all of these things can be done with just more course planning and organization. A regular schedule can help students with planning around other priorities, and better plan to commit a proper amount of time for this course.",
                "I will paint a picture of what it is like to be a student in a course such as this. We have a poorly edited text written by an absent instructor that favors entertainment over accomplishing the practical tasks of 1. introducing objects and their properties in detail; 2. showing how they are used; 3. justifying why they are used that way; 4. giving students the opportunity to practice using such objects, and most importantly, 5. giving students the tools to know if they are using them correctly. Instead, students have a textbook which explains little, rambles often, and closes each chapter with a smorgasbord of impossible problems for which practice is impossible, as there is no way to determine if one is doing them correctly if they do not already know the material. In effect, students are punished for trying to learn the material. This raises a dilemma: do the students who do well in such a course already know much of the material, seeing as how there are minimal avenues for which one can walk down to actually learn it? If that is the case, then what is the point of the course at all? Rather than provide a place for learning, such a course instead deepens, widens, and reinforces a gap between students with the privilege of prior exposure, and those who need the exposure most. A course such as this would exist seemingly for the sole purpose of separating the privileged from their cohorts and rewarding them for it. I see no utility in such a course for any party. The people who want to learn it can't, and the people who learn least do the best.\r\nAnything can be made difficult if it is explained poorly. I would propose that, as the Earth's resources continue to dwindle and the meritocracy we subject ourselves to continues to crumble, that a class such as this should offer students the means to practice, the means to perfect, and the means to critically analyze what they are doing and why. This means providing students with problems for which the mechanics are at least alluded to, and for which information at the very least exists. This means a standard text, and not a pretentious passion project. This means having the opportunity to learn by practice, and not by waiting for your grade on an assignment that took 40 hours to complete. This means giving students the chance to know why, how, for what, rather than punishing them for trying to make their lives and possibly the world a better place.",
                "The material itself is quite interesting. I learned most everything from Professor Chang's notes, which were written in a very clear and approachable style. I did not attend lecture past the first few weeks, as I found the lectures a bit impenetrable.",
                "It kind of felt like the S&DS department wanted a class on Markov Chains, but couldn't justify filling an entire semester with just that material. And for good reason  they're incredibly useful, and you get good at using them. Some lectures really broke the flow of the class, though, and it wasn't really clear why we were talking about them. While it was interesting, it kind of felt like we just threw in stuff on stock pricing, the Kolmogorov Fokker-Planck equations, Hammersley Clifford Thm, etc.",
                "The strengths are the material - I find it very interesting. I think the weakness is the organization - problem sets were posted irregularly, sometimes without too much time to do them.",
                "A strength of this course is the wide range of topics discussed in class. The notes were also helpful and one could follow the material. Another strength is the great effort provided by the teaching fellows in this class; without them, this course would be much harder.\r\n\r\nOne weakness I can immediately spot is the lack of solved problems in this course. We only learn in class and then we get loads of problems to solve in the HW. This could be improved by solving more problems in class or making the extra Friday sessions dedicated to that instead of discussing \"additional material\". This leads to the next point: the timing for Friday sessions was never appropriate and I could not attend a single session. The professor and teaching fellows made their best efforts to record the sessions, which was still hard for me to follow. If this session was better arranged and perhaps included relevant problems to solve together with the TF's, that would be a better experience. Also, the problem sets in this course were overwhelming, and the professor has acknowledged and reduced the number of problems in each set. However, I have always been in the situation of I want to finish this HW because the next one is up. I did not really have the time to solely read more about the material and deepen my knowledge. Asking questions to the professor after class or chatting with the teaching fellows has always been enriching. They are all knowledgeable about the course and can provide great insights into the questions asked.",
                "I think the course has a ton of theoretically interesting results and real world applications, but I felt like I had whiplash because of how fast we moved between them in class. Id prefer if we focused on one at a time more often.",
                "This is the worst class I have ever taken in my life. Professor Barron is very poor at explaining things in a clear way. Everyone that I had talked to in the class expressed that they often had a hard time understanding what the Prof was trying to convey.",
                "We had a lot of challenging assignments, which was a good way to practice. The final project was also great to deepen a particular topic. However, we had less than 5 days to complete certain assignments. This made it difficult to organize our work for other classes and made it pretty stressful. Some assignments were extremely long and too hard to do in only a few days. The instructor didnt have office hours, so we couldnt go ask questions. Fortunately, the TAs had office hours but they were not always helpful.\r\nThe lectures were not well organized, we saw some topics on a very surface level. Some topics that could have been useful for the assignments were only covered in lectures after we handed the assignments in.",
                "strengths: Very responsible TAs\r\nweaknesses: recording quality is not good",
                "Too much workload. If the Professor would like to share the course notes with us, its helpful.",
                "The psets for this class felt tedious and uninteresting, and the grading was at times of questionable quality. The class exposed interesting aspects of emerging work in the field which was very engaging and rewarding to think about, but the connections to this very interesting material through the course work were lacking.",
                "The course was pretty poorly run to be honest; the lectures were basically just transcripts of the textbook and psets were not organized in a manner which facilitated learning but rather jumbled together questions from the textbook, some out of the scope of what should be expected of the students at that level. Nobody really had their act together and there was no exam prep or info given beforehand.",
                "The main strengths of this course were the strong textbook, generally reasonable homework problems, and the flexibility of the final project. Throughout the course, the textbook was my main (and most successful) way of learning material, as the author Joe Chang explains concepts clearly and in detail. Likewise, the homework problems from the book aided my learning process well, though some of the proofs were quite difficult; I actually sometimes liked the non-book problems (or those from other books) best, as they were more application-based. My favorite part of the class was definitely the final project, which we could use to investigate any related concept or application; this was super fun, and I think encouraging students to find something they are really passionate about should be an even greater focus of the class.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the biggest weaknesses of the course were the general disorganization, the unclear and challenging exams, and the poor distribution of work across the semester. Lectures were generally a bit confusing, and there was not always a clear link to the homework problems or exam topics. Moreover, homeworks were released and graded sporadically, and it was often challenging to get good help on the difficult problems. We never got clear descriptions of exam topics (and even had a totally unrelated guest lecture the class before the midterm), and the locations/format were often in the air until the day before. As a result of this disorganization, there were large lulls in work followed by intense periods of multiple problems sets, exams, final projects, etc. This added to the general confusion and made the course much more difficult than necessary. I think having a clearer schedule and syllabus would help all these problems greatly, along with having some kind of lecture notes to follow along and study with throughout the course. I dont think any of the problems were inconsolable, but they would require significant thought and organization to fix."

                "Absolutely NOT if Andrew Barron is teaching!!! He explained topics in a very confusing way. Reading the notes of J. Chang, the prof who taught the class last year, was way more helpful than going to Barron's lectures, as Barron's lectures only confused people instead of helping them. Because Barron constantly mentioned many random topics in his lectures, it's hard to know exactly what content students were supposed to master for exams. What's more ridiculous, Barron did not clarify the content coverage for the final until the morning of the final exam. There were also no review sessions for the final or the midterm. \r\n\r\nThe psets at the beginning of the class were very hard and time-consuming: around 8 questions, each of which has over 3 sub-questions. Each of those psets would take you like 20 hours on average to finish. After many students complained, Barron finally shortened the psets a bit to around 5 questions for each one.",

I fell into this category, and while I am not unhappy I took the course, it was definitely frustrating and unfulfilling at times. If you were not inherently interested in the topics (which are quite interesting and useful), I think it would be even more difficult to stay focused and motivated. It is just too difficult of a course to be this disorganized, and the saving graces (a cool final project and decent workload) are not enough to offset it."
