I developed better close reading skills, critical thinking and analysis skills, and writing skills related to developing a claim, building an argument, closely interacting with different sources, and editing\/revising.

                "This was my favorite course. I think everything that was done really well. There was a lot of discussion and feedback on our essays. The feedback was extremely  helpful. The only thing I would change was maybe going over close reading a bit more before writing our first essay as that was something I personally struggled with.",
                "The strengths were the manageable paper lengths, and the good discussions we had around food in class. The weaknesses were, at times, the feedback on some of the essay drafts and claims. Sometimes I didn't know where to go with the feedback, or the instructor would find serious faults with my final draft that were clear in my rough draft and she didn't mention them then. I don't enjoy writing and, as a result, I didn't really enjoy this class. But, as a first-year student it was a great way to get into college writing and get one of my writing credits.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting discussions and broad range of readings specifically tailored to the subject area.\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough time in between each paper to improve and digest feedback.",
                "Strengths: very interesting course material",
                "I really enjoyed the class material because we were able to get an overview of how food is incorporated in different aspects of society. I wish we could have spent more time on learning writing techniques and looking at other example papers.",
                "A strength of the course was that the essays were somewhat spaced out and most of the readings were reasonable. A weakness of the course is that the readings were long and the first few weeks the essays werent very spaced out.",
                "Strengths: numerous interesting readings that typically weren't too lengthy, engaging class discussions, opportunities for peer workshops, \"built-in\" instructor conferences to discuss papers, ample feedback on drafts and final papers\r\nWeakness: little class time was dedicated to providing tips and guidances that explicitly help with the writing process, expectations for papers weren't always clearly outlined when starting each paper\r\nImprovements: Spending more time providing tips\/guidance and explaining expectations at the beginning of an assignment during class",
                "Strength: A small class size and discussion-based curriculum made it easy to engage with the material and my classmates. Andie has lots of office hours and answers emails very quickly so communication was never a problem. Feedback is clear and specific which really helped in improving my drafts.",
                "I would say that the biggest strength of this class was Andie. The passion that she has for the subject matter and her genuine care for her students really shone through in this class. This made the lessons ten times more enjoyable (and I usually dislike English classes).\r\n\r\nA weakness was potentially the first paper that we wrote, which was based on an essay written by Mary Douglas. If you've ever read Mary Douglas before you would know that her writing is quite complex and not very easy to understand.",

We read passages that were interesting, discussed them as a class, broke out into breakout rooms and discussed them, we even did peer reviews. I loved the way this class was so engaging and discussion based. I think every class should be like this.",

                "No, unless you need a writing credit and an introduction to analytical college essay writing with plenty of feedback. The essays were not just fun stuff about food, they were close reading analyses of (often complicated) texts discussing something relating to food. It is a LOT of work, unless you don't do the readings or just skim the readings. There is no recourse if you don't fully read the homework readings, so some people just didn't do them unless they were interesting, and they were fine.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While there was a lot of back to back writing, it was a good way to improve writing skills. Also, the readings are very much geared toward the subject area so discussions are very interesting.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course material was very interesting and my writing skills improved a lot within the semester.",
                "Yes because you learn how to be a better writer and the professor gives great feedback and you just need to incorporate that into your next papers.",
                "I would recommend this class if students were highly interested in the course's topics and readings. The readings and discussions were the most interesting part of the class and provide surveys to topics for further exploration in the research paper and outside of class. Writing skills and guidance weren't heavily emphasized during class time, so the \"learning to write better\" process was largely self-motivated and dependent on course engagement and effort applied on the papers. If someone is determined to become a better writer they will likely see subtle developments over time rather than overt acquiring of skills at specific moments. As such, this course and what it has to offer is best when resources such as the Writing Center and office hours to meet with Andie are utilized. This, along with class discussions, were when I found the class most enjoyable and fulfilling.",
                "Yes! The reading material is always interesting and covers a wide variety of topics in food. The workload is very manageable, but definitely set time aside for the research paper.",
                "If you think that your writing needs polishing and you want a good introduction to college-level writing then, yes, take this class. However, make sure that the overall theme of your writing seminar interests you at least somewhat because you will end up dedicating a decent amount of time reading\/writing about that subject matter.",
                "This course gave me exactly what I was looking for in an introductory writing class. The types of essays and feedback I received were vary valuable to my growth as a writer. I would recommend English 114 in general for anyone who wants to build a solid foundation for higher level writing classes. This section\/topic in particular was very interesting. It was a topic that everyone could relate to and the professor was very passionate and knowledgable. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in food culture and history."
