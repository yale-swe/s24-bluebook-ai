   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about a field of science I knew nothing about before!",
    "I learned more than I ever thought I would about chelicerates, crustaceans (including hexapods), and myriapods.",
    "I learned a crazy amount about arthropods, which are fascinating!",
    "Bugs and evolution",
    "I learned a lot about arthropod and their evolution and diversity. It was a lot of memorization but that was to be expected",
    "I learned about the classification, morphology, adaptations unique to Arthropoda, the largest phylum of the kingdom Animalia! Moreover, Professor Wells supplemented each lecture with interesting videos and examples to illustrate the concepts she was discussing.",
    "I learned about what makes arthropods so successful and the interesting ways that they adapt to change! It was such a cool niche class that I wouldve never explored if not for shopping period",
    "This is a great course!!! I learned a lot about arthropods in a way that was so fun and engaging.",
    "I learned about the biology and ecological importance of arthropods, which I knew nothing about prior to this class, and developed a newfound appreciation for these organisms!",
    "I learned so much about Arthropods! Like.... a lot! I will definitely be applying this to my EVST major.",
    "Learnt a lot about bugs, that I had no idea I would ever know",
    "I gained a general knowledge of Arthropods, their behaviors, and their importance to ecological systems.",
    "I learned a lot about arthropods.",
    "I learned so much about arthropods! I'm pre-med and an MCDB major, and took this class mainly for fun as I finished most of my major requirements already. I love biology and this was a big change from classes I've previously taken, but was so interesting and fun!",
    "Learned about the ecological importance of terrestrial arthropods. Things like anatomy, relationships between different species, communication methods, sexual reproduction, amongst other things.",
    "I learned a lot about arthropods!",
    "I gained knowledge about the body plans\/ adaptive mechanisms of arthropods, the systems of classification, arthropod behavior and reproduction, etc.",
    "Literally everything about bugs, this class was hilarious and fascinating. I absolutely loved it.",
    "Lots of interesting knowledge about bugs but not very useful to your everyday life at all so can get boring",
    "A cool overview of the insect world, some fun and creepy bug facts to share with family and friends.",
    "I learned A LOT about bugs (terrestrial arthropods). I knew virtually nothing before and it was really cool to be able to go super in depth in a specific field. I now have a lot of great cocktail party facts.",
    "I learned all about arthropods: their anatomy, reproduction, evolution, behavior, relationships, and how climate change impacts them. Also learned the various scientific methods, theories and thought processes used to examine arthropods in this course and how to apply them to other situations.\r\n\r\nAlso I met my girlfriend through this class so I guess you could include all of those skills, knowledge, and insights :)",
    "A new love and knowledge for arthropods!",
    "So much bug knowledge you'll never have asked for, but really appreciate if you stop and think about it"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The grading scheme of the course was a huge plus. I also really appreciated the study guides that were posted before each exam\/midterm, which made it very clear what content would be on the midterms.",
    "Sometimes I wished there was more of a cohesive list of things we should know because the slides covered more info than we could ever hope to remember but not all of it was going to be on the tests--but we didn't always know exactly which parts were the most relevant.",
    "The course material is absolutely fascinating. Professor Wells is fabulous, and her energy is infectious. I used to hate spiders, but, as she promised, I now think they're super interesting. \r\nHowever, I do think that it could be a bit better organized to help students prepare for exams. We were responsible for knowing information from the study guide, practice test, class notes, lecture slides, assigned papers, and the textbook. This is all okay, but it meant that gathering information to study was quite difficult, and it was hard to know if you were focusing on studying the right things.",
    "A little sporadic, but lectures are super engaging",
    "The videos in class were super helpful",
    "Strengths: Professor Wells brings so much experience and passion to her lectures, which makes attending enjoyable as opposed to a chore. The exams are fair and reward people who go to lectures and engage with the course material as opposed to those who memorize terms. The video\/examples shown during lecture are also very engaging and make it a fun time! Weaknesses: None",
    "I think the lectures were a bit boring but the videos were extremely entertaining and so was some of the content. The second half of the course was definitely more interesting for me because of the way I was able to relate it to my high school biology classes",
    "The absolute best part of this class are the lectures themselves. Professor Wells is able to communicate the content in an extremely entertaining and engaging manner.",
    "I really enjoyed this course because Professor Wells did a great job of making the material approachable and manageable. Her passion for the subject of the course was apparent and made the class more enjoyable.",
    "Strengths: Marta was a fabulous lecturer! She clearly cares a lot about the material and her infectious love for arthropods rubbed off on the students.\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture slides could be more detailed.",
    "Strengths: interesting lectures, AMAZING prof, manageable exams\/studying\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses, as far as I can tell!",
    "Lectures are simple, easy to follow, and exciting",
    "This course is incredibly interesting and Professor Wells' lectures are full of imagery and videos which facilitate learning about the material. It is perhaps too easy not to engage in the lectures and reading, but the course content and Professor Wells herself make the class very fun and worth engaging with!",
    "The lectures were great. The professor was great. The material was great.",
    "Marta Wells is a treasure to Yale University and should teach every course at Yale.",
    "The TFs and Professor Wells are very responsive instructors which I found to be the strength of this course, especially as a non-STEM major. I think a review session for the final exam would have been helpful in hindsight.",
    "The content is super interesting and engaging. Marta is so kind and passionate. Its a really great course!",
    "Professor Wells is an incredible lecturer and she is very clearly invested in the topic. One thing that can be improved is the speed at which she moves through the power point slides. I was often scrambling to write down what was on each slide and thus could not pay full attention.",
    "The only weakness is that the lecture slides can sometimes be hard to follow. Strengths: fascinating content, SUPER PASSIONATE TEACHER Professor Wells makes you more excited to learn about whatever shes talking about.",
    "The professor is the sweetest but the content could be boring at times",
    "Strengths: interesting material, passionate and kind professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor not the best lecturer, lectures disorganized",
    "The biggest strengths are Professor Marta Wells and her videos. She makes class extremely engaging.\r\n\r\nBiggest weakness is the textbook; textbooks can be mildly entertaining but this one is not. However, I enjoyed the journal articles, and that was generally enough reading."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Even if you don't like bugs and entomology isn't your thing, it's an enlightening perspective into a field of science and biodiversity that we often don't think about. I learned a lot of cool and interesting things about insects that I hadn't even heard about before. The content itself is really interesting and eye-opening.",
    "Yes, this was almost the perfect science class for the non-science major. You do have to study hard for the three (two if you do well enough on the first two) midterms, but other than that and the final exam and paper, it won't take a lot of time or energy.",
    "It's not a gut. It's a good, interesting, engaging science class, that any non-Science person can get an A in if they're willing to study.",
    "YES YES YES",
    "Yes",
    "Biology of Terrestrial Arthropods is a hidden gem class at Yale! I walked into this class needing to get my science credit, but little did I know how much I would enjoy the semester with Professor Wells. I told my friends throughout the semester about the cool things I learned in class. Just be careful: you need to put a decent amount of work to do well. The exams are not easy and require a good understanding of the course material. The final paper and exam are very low-key and more creative opportunities to apply what you learned in the class.",
    "Yes! Marta is the SWEETEST teacher and she genuinely loves teaching so much",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other students simply because of how passionate Professor Wells is for the content itself. She is open to meeting with all students to discuss any questions they may have and is one of the nicest professors at this university.",
    "YES! Three midterms -- and you drop the lowest one. One short paper (3 pages) and a cumulative final. Really light workload!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. The course material was very interesting and I was able to make a lot of connections to how arthropods inform the world we live in.",
    "Yes! It's an interesting class taught by a wonderful professor if you're looking for an easy science credit. The exams definitely require studying, but the class overall is extremely manageable.",
    "YES!! Marta is the best prof. She cares SO MUCH, lectures are always so funny and interesting, and it's a great fifth class. If you dedicate a reasonable amount of time, you'll do well!",
    "YES!!! If you need a fifth class that's a gut or a science credit take this one!",
    "Yes! If you are at all interested in learning more about bugs, TAKE THIS COURSE! The workload is light, yes, but more importantly Professor Wells is an incredible professor and her lectures are so much fun to sit in on. I walked away knowing a lot more than I thought I would about bugs and can honestly say that my interest in them was sparked as a result of taking this class.",
    "easy science credit; engaging material; Marta is awesome",
    "What a class! You're a fool for not taking it. The greatest science credit.",
    "I would to any student who is looking for a science credit but is does not have a STEM background.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone! I hate bugs and am terrified of them. If that is you, you should still take this course. It is so fascinating (if you think biology is cool, which you should), and Marta makes the class so fun and exciting. Marta is literally the nicest and most welcoming and approachable professor I have ever met at Yale. I had to miss a few lectures for interviews, and she agreed to meet with me individually to go over the material I missed, even though she didn't need to. The class is really enjoyable and I looked forward to every lecture. Highly recommend.",
    "ABSOLUTELY!",
    "Highly recommend this course! The content was enough to motivate me to go to class in Bass 305 every week and Professor Well's enthusiasm is unparalleled.",
    "Yes definitely! A really fun and interesting science credit and Marta is amazing.",
    "yes! A fascinating science credit with minimal work.",
    "Yes!",
    "YES its a great science credit, not too difficult, and I really enjoyed all of the lectures.",
    "If you like learning about bugs but otherwise no",
    "I loved Professor Wells as a person but found her lectures disorganized and at times confusing. Having said that, the material is interesting without being hard so its not super important that the lectures are not the most organized. Not much work on a weekly basis but you do have to study for the exams. The exams are graded very generously though.",
    "To quote an earlier course evaluation, which convince me to take it: THIS CLASS IS A HIDDEN GEM.",
    "Yes. This class was so fun, and Prof Wells is very entertaining and fun to be around. The subject is also very interesting, and arthropods are everywhere so you will get plenty of chances to use it. I began the class creeped out by many insects and spiders in particular, but I ended the class comfortable and fascinated by all of them.",
    "Yes! Marta is absolutely wonderful and has so much passion for the subject. This was one of the most fun classes I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. It's a chill 5th class, it's interesting, and Prof Wells is not out here to get you, so much as she just wants you to retain some of the knowledge and do well in the class."
