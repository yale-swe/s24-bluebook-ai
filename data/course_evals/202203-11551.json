Often, I felt like I was told the issues with my writing but didnt know how to fix them. I had to go to a writing tutor after I got feedback for every essay and still felt like I didnt know how to improve. Sometimes, the readings were way too long to be examples for how to structure our 1500 word essays. Classes would often go off on tangents. The readings should also be posted earlier, sometimes not even there until the night before. All of class would be spent talking about the readings. I think it would help the course if he broke them down more closely and talked about the literary elements on the board in a more general sense."

The class' content is relatable and engaging, as well as beautifully written and helpful when writing different essays throughout the course. I also really liked the format of the class. I found myself looking forward to receiving my draft and discussing feedback with my professor.",
