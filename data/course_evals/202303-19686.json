Helps student vocalize their many ideas on modern problems, and makes student more aware of a lot of the important global issues outside of the US. Works a lot on the student's reading abilities. \r\nWeakness: for students that are not prepared, there will be a lot of vocab in the readings and in discussion. The class could definitely be more interactive, there were times in class where it was mostly just the teacher talking and going over the lesson.",

                "This is a decent upper-level chinese course to take. It has less homework and fewer graded assignments than most other chinese classes. However, if you're not a native or heritage speaker of chinese, this class will probably be much more difficult for you than it is for your classmates, who will mostly be heritage/native speakers. Not necessarily intellectually challenging, but it takes a long time to do the readings.",
                "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in politics and learn about a lot of the fundamental differences between China and US, and believe they have good foundation in reading and speaking Chinese. This class is for you if you are more interested in reading and speaking, both presentational and discussion-based. This class does not go over a lot of writing, but will cover a lot of new vocab if you were not familiar with a lot of more difficult vocab prior.",
                "Yes. This course is a pretty good choice for students who want to practice their speaking skills and learn about chinas development and dilemma."
