                "Strengths: this class gives you a lot control over learning whatever Chinese vocabulary you want to learn. Weaknesses: Because this class isn't as structured as other Chinese classes, you only get out of this class as much as you put into it. You can probably get by without doing all of the assigned readings, but you won't learn as much from the class then.",
                "The zoom format is just not very conducive to developing verbal and language skills, it is hard to pay attention for such an extended period of time  over zoom while conversing in another language.\r\n\r\nCourse was very good at developing reading skills.",
                "Zhou Laoshi is just one of the best Chinese professors at Yale, and he is easily the highlight of the course. The workload is not too much, essays and oral presentations every other week, short multi-sentence news articles weekly, and self-made quizlets for every new group of articles. The articles are pretty interesting, too. Weaknesses include sometimes it was hard to speak with 12 people in the class (though, that is average for most Chinese classes at Yale)smaller class sizes might benefit. Another weakness is that it's somewhat easy to not do all of the readings, though it's important to for familiarity and language practice. The discussions turned into people saying what interested them most about the readings. Zhou Laoshi did a good job of encouraging us  to actually discuss and build off of each others points, but because not everyone always does the same readings sometimes that's hard to ensure.",
