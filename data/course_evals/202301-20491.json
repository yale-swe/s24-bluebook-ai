                "I enhanced my Spanish proficiency (verbal, written, and auditory) and learned a wealth of valuable information about various topics in medicine. I became a more natural speaker, developed a better grammatical intuition, improved my presenting skills, bridged English and Spanish medical knowledge, and substantially improved my writing abilities.",
                "I learned about different subjects in medicine like osteoporosis, diabetes, sleeping disorders, etc. and learned to apply Spanish to describe them.",
                "I learned many medical topics in Spanish. This was also my first class where I was writing exclusively in Spanish for long essays, which was a great way of developing my writing communication skills.",
                "I learned about various illnesses which plague our society. I learned about their causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, etc.",
                "wonderful overview of key public health challenges in latinoamerican countries, anatomy, treatments, and ways to describe illnesses in spanish",
                "I learned about different medical conditions.",

            "comments": [
                "This course explored a wide array of medical topics without sacrificing depth of discussion. We discussed every reading and/or podcast in class, so no assigned reading felt neglected or superfluous. The writing assignments improved my proficiency and encouraged me to engage with the material, and I enjoyed the conversational format of our classes.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course was its reliance on paper copies of all readings and assignments. The course packet was very expensive, and all of the assigned readings could have been uploaded as PDFs to Canvas. Furthermore, assignments could have been submitted electronically. This would have saved substantial money and paper. Additionally, some of the weekly assignments were simply too long: for one of the podcasts we listened to (about cocaine in Argentina), we had to answer 61 questions. This -- on top of two other assignments that week -- was too much work to assign, and I do not feel that the high volume of questions enhanced my understanding. In future years, some of the assignments should be trimmed or split up across different weeks.",
                "Strengths: Professor Carreras (very kind and accommodating)\r\nWeaknesses: I believe the course, while well-intended, does not do justice to learning about Medical Spanish. I came into medical Spanish thinking I would learn skills that are useful to apply in the medical field as the name would imply but I left disappointed since the course was misguided: read an article, write an unnecessary amount regarding the article, speak at most twice in class since the rest of class is spent by her lecturing. Overall, this structure was very unproductive. It felt more like I was taking \"Topics in Medicine (in Spanish)\" rather than a class on \"Medical Spanish\" because we didn't even usually talk in class. I highly recommend that the curriculum be reworked to encourage skills that would be useful in the medical field. For example, I feel like it would have been a better use of my time to learn medical vocabulary in Spanish and apply it to a variety of situations, as would someone who is learning the Spanish needed to work in the medical field. Overall, I was disappointed and left this class feeling like I had wasted a semester just reading articles taken from the internet.",
                "This course had a very reliable schedule; I could always count on having one assignment per week, which kept up my practicing Spanish. Toward the end in regards to the final presentation and essay, there was less instruction, and I would have liked slightly more guidance or discussion in class about those final assignments. Otherwise, though, this class had fantastic organization and a great class structure.",
                "I liked the structure/organization of the course. I wish we did more group activities during class.",
                "The teacher does not keep the class particularly engaged. The content is interesting.",
                "I think this is a great class if you are interested in the health professions and want to use Spanish-language skills in your field of work. This class really helps with practicing Spanish skills on a regular basis. It also provides a lot of knowledge about medicine. I learned a lot of things about specific illnesses and medical conditions from this class that I did not know before. It is a slightly higher workload, but very doable if you manage your time well."

You will learn more by making a quizlet with medical Spanish vocabulary and applying it by volunteering at Haven Free Clinic or a clinic with a Spanish-speaking population.",
