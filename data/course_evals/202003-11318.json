                "Strengths: Professor Tannenbaum is a great discussion facilitator and always works to connect the reading for each week to previous ones. She is highly knowledgeable about present-day events in childbirth and reproductive medicine, too, and likes to connect those relevant things to the history. She also makes herself highly available and provides wonderful feedback on papers. Most importantly, the readings are overall very engaging. I thought having one book a week would be a lot of work, but by planning ahead, I was able to get it all done. The books were really enjoyable and provided a range of perspectives. Weaknesses: The course is rather centered on voices of white, affluent women as that is just the status of the field. Prof. Tannenbaum does work to recover these voices, but I would have preferred even more focus on other voices. Also, reading one book a week is a lot of work if you are not prepared to do so.",
                "This course was wonderful! The readings were interesting and reasonable in length, discussions were engaging, and Professor Tannenbaum was lovely. It's quite a unique course with material I definitely would not have found on my own; I was able to learn about things that were new to me, intriguing, and clearly relevant. The writing assignmentsdivided into a paper on primary sources and a paper on secondary sourceswere also helpful in crafting particular writing skills, and working towards the final paper."

                "I thought the virtual library visits about primary sources and archives were both very helpful, even if we did not get to go in-person. I actually was able to learn a lot from the activities that Prof. Tannenbaum prepared alongside the librarians' presentations. I also appreciated how Prof. Tannenbaum shortened class by 10 or 20 minutes each week as she emphasized more discussion via discussion boards. I loved discussions with my classmates, but it was great that Professor Tannenbaum recognized the reality of Zoom fatigue and did not want to overburden us.",
                "The small class size and seminar format meant that this course was engaging and worked naturally even on Zoom, and I appreciated that the class material could relate to the pandemic; we could discuss course material, but also acknowledge and consider this unusual time."

                "This is one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. If anyone is interested in reproductive medicine - whether you are a social scientist or a pre-med hoping to be an OB-GYN - you need to take this class! It provides a foundational, comprehensive, and essential education in the topic. Professor Tannenbaum is also a wonderful person and teacher. She is both knowledgeable and kind. Paper assignments were manageable and fair. I would highly recommend this course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in women's history or the history of medicine! I learned lots and really enjoyed the course, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to take a class on a rather niche but very interesting subject."
