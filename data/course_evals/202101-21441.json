                "Very fast-paced lectures, not super engaging but interesting topics",
                "organized",
                "It was difficult to study for exams because there were no other assignments which covered lecture content, and no other types of practice.",
                "Strengths: Course material was super interesting, teaching team was incredible (both Dr. Pyle and Dr. Isaacs are amazing teachers + the TF's were really nice and supportive)\r\nWeaknesses: There was a lot of content to be covered for the amount of classes that we had, which made it difficult to keep up sometimes",
                "Strengths: the material is really interesting and very currentthe professors do a great job of including recent breakthroughs and ongoing research in the course content. The weekly paper discussions were also fun and engaging, although a few of the papers were dense and difficult. Weaknesses: There is a lot of information coming at you fast through the whole course, and it can sometimes be hard to take it all in.",
                "Strengths: The professors are great lecturers and innovators in their field and it was really interesting learning about their own perspectives on the material. Weaknesses: I felt ill-prepared for the exams since we only went over the research articles in discussion section which were not tested on until the last exam. I also wish the exam was either take-home or shortened, because I and many other students did not have time to finish the exam and go into the detail we were expected to go into with our responses.",
                "Overall, I felt that this course was very well-taught! The lectures were very interesting and informative, and the enthusiasm of the professors set a great tone. The only substantive feedback I have is with regards to the papers we had to read. Reading scientific papers is hard, but I recognize that the only way to get good at it is to do it a lot, so I think having the weekly readings was beneficial. That said, I think the assigned papers varied a bit in quality, so I've included some thoughts on the papers I found most/least helpful (in case having the student perspective is beneficial for making future selections):\r\n\r\nPapers I found most helpful:\r\n \"Programmable editing of a target base in genomic DNA without double-stranded DNA cleavage\" This was so cool and so well written. I even emailed it to some family members/friends because I thought they might find it interesting!\r\n\"Postnatal genome editing partially restores dystrophin expression in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy\" Very clearly written and an interesting application of concepts we learned in the course.\r\n\r\nPapers that I found less helpful:\r\n\"The Long Noncoding RNA Pnky is a Trans-acting Regulator of Cortical Development In Vivo\" This paper presented a relatively straight-forward result, but was confusing to read. It probably didn't help that I haven't taken anatomy. I don't think I gained more from reading the paper than I would have if the result were only presented in class.\r\n\"Structures of Mismatch Replication Errors Observed in a DNA Polymerase\" This paper felt a little all over the place, and I'm not really sure what the takeaway message should be. It wasn't terrible or anything, I just think I'm unlikely to remember it after the course.",
                "Strengths include structured and organized lectures, homework assignments, and exams.",
                "A strength of the course was the content of the material presented. The material was interesting and applicable to other fields. The lectures were pretty organized although it was dense. The discussion of papers was also helpful, including further explanations by my TF with slides. A weakness is the lack of clear feedback on exams or homework. For exams, we could not see what we got wrong unless we went to office hours. For our homework, sometimes the explanation was unclear about why I gave the incorrect answer. Ways to improve perhaps would be to give model answers to the study guides and release our exam comments. Piazza would be helpful to clarify any questions as the lectures are dense. I also wish there would be more time spent on reviewing more difficult material like mechanisms and less time on simpler material.",
                "Strengths - very clear lectures, supportive section to course information, low workload\r\nWeaknesses - hard to tell how you are doing or what is the important information. Does not have study guides or practice exams, and the homework is not directly related to lecture.",
                "The course is relatively engaging and the content is well explained. There could be more comprehensive notes for each lecture and better prep for each exam such as more practice exams",
                "The lectures were excellent, the workload was quite manageable, and the exams were tough but fair."

                "The recorded virtual lectures were engaging and provided numerous examples and applications to understand the material. It was more difficult however remembering 40 slides for each of the seven lectures that the exam tested us on. I did, however, appreciate that the final was not cumulative because it would have actually been impossible to memorize and synthesize that amount of detail. Since a great deal of us depended on the recordings of the lecture, I would have appreciated if we went over the material in discussion section rather than the research articles. Or if there was some kind of enrichment section (like the intro bio sequence has) where the professors could have synthesized the material and we could have gone over the central points.",
                "Having lectures recorded and available for later viewing was really helpful. It made reviewing confusing topics much easier, and was also helpful for exam preparation. Hopefully this continues in the post-Covid era!",
                "Engagement was high during discussion section and professors were able to answer students' questions after class.",
                "The lectures, which were recorded, tremendously helped as the lectures were often dense. I had to go back to watch the recordings to fill in any gaps and take notes on the slides. The format of discussion section was engaging as we discussed figures in relevant papers. Guest lecturers were also very helpful and interesting. Open-booked exams that were 90 minutes long also made exams slightly less stressful but they were still very long. Something that can be improved is posting slides ahead of time for more engagement during lectures and giving more feedback on Canvas through the exams or homework.",
