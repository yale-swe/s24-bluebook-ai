    "I came out of this course with a new mindset and an ability to think in a more artistic perspective, looking at everyday objects and being able to dissect and analyze them. I also developed an understanding and appreciation for South Asian art history and culture, and learned the relevance of many South Asian cultural artifacts to the modern world. I engaged with resources at the Yale University Art Gallery and the Yale University Library on a weekly\/biweekly basis. I also became more culturally literate and more proficient at writing in the style of an art historian\/historian.",
    "I learned about different religions prevalent in India. I learned skills such as critical analysis and descriptive writing.",
    "about how art history influences Indian culture\r\nhow to write basic art history papers"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course excels because it is a novel approach to a broad topic of South Asian culture and art, but chooses to focus on specific objects as a way to analyze and contextualize not just the object but the time period itself. It furthermore excels in its interactivity; the seminar style allows for student participation, the instructor was willing to adapt the course to the interests of students, and the biweekly trips to the Yale University Art Gallery allow for the development of skills that are then put into practice through art observation. Additionally, the readings were very interesting and fresh; they always led to interesting and informative discussions. The only weakness of the course is that there could have been more clearly defined outlines or sample papers that were made available to the class for students to model their own papers after. Since this is a first-year seminar, many first-years do not have the writing experience in art history subjects to know what the style is like, and as a result, having some exposure and more structured guidelines would be helpful.",
    "The strengths are the range of different objects and Indian history covered. I engaged best with the religious texts as they helped give insight into the objects. Therefore I would bring in the texts earlier in the course",
    "I would've liked example papers to look at, especially for the first paper"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to those who want to broaden their perspective and learn about an interesting topic in a low-pressure environment. The interactivity of the course was very refreshing. I found the questions posed and the debate to be stimulating. The seminar style allows for a close-knit environment. The ability to choose the topic for our final presentation and project allowed us creativity and independence, which I appreciated. Overall, I found the course to be engaging and I would recommend both to those interested in art history and those who aren't. This course was a great introduction to a field that I had no prior experience with.",
    "Yes I would recommend it as it develops lots of different skills such as essay writing, public speaking, and critical thinking.",
    "Yes, Indian culture was very interesting to learn about, and I enjoyed learning about it through different mediums (movies, art, books)."
