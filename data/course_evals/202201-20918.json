                "everything is great",
                "Strengths: Interesting course to take as an introduction to NLP\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs often had mistakes and final review/midterm review had mistakes as well that had to be resolved by students. \r\n\r\nImprovement: Have revised PSETs and review sheets that are verified to be correct, make PSETs more thorough and not require a lot of online searching to find the solution.",
                "This course is highly informative, useful, and intriguing. It covers many areas of NLP that students may be interested in, but I believe it could be improve by slowing the pace a little bit and having a smaller classroom such that we could hear the instructor better.",
                "Strengths: Broad overview. A survey of topics. Weaknesses: Lectures are hard to pay attention to. Homework assignments are not really related to lecture content (which to be fair was made clear at the beginning of the semester).",
                "Strengths: really interesting material, great teaching staff, practical psets, feeling that youre really learning about cutting edge research \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I wish there were more smaller assignments just because it felt like many topics I understood conceptually but didnt really know how to implement. I also wish that the last assignment had less content but also less pre-provided code - a lot of it was given but I would have preferred to do more from scratch.",
                "Most annoying thing to me was how the TAs would handle Piazza questions. Every question was answered with either go read it in the book or with sometimes snarky-seeming what do you think?-style answers that did not help at all.",
                "very meaningful problem sets that help learning the material",
                "Strengths: Drago is an expert in the field, and learning about neural nets through application in machine translation or sentiment analysis is a nice, concrete way to learn about machine learning at an intro-intermediate level. There are funny moments in class where we're shown NLP memes or hilarious example sentences in linguistics! He's a very kind professor and was lenient on using late days for psets. Weaknesses: The TF's were relatively active on the discussion board (Piazza) to answer questions. Since a lot of content is covered, however, I end up missing many topics mentioned in class that I have to look up later, especially if it's expected we fully implement a process for a pset. Even with the piazza posts, I felt there could have been more office hours spread throughout the week (maybe 1 hour slots twice a week instead of one 2 hour slot so more days of the week are covered). The lecture slides are numbered but not taught in the same number order, meaning it could be hard to keep track of notes and lecture slides if you wanted to review past material later on.",

                "All good",
                "Strengths: We have a professor who is very knowledgeable in this area and has very good insights during lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: We only skim a lot of the material leaving more to be desired in terms of understanding NLP more deeply. Perhaps we could cut off material that isn't as interesting or relevant and spend that time to learn things that are interesting more deeply.",
                "Weakness: I think the structure of the course is pretty unclear. The slides are not well-organized, either.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Covered lots of material\r\n- Did not require lots of background in linguistics to understand material\r\n- Interesting concepts in homework\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I found lectures to be very boring\r\n- Homework problems were sometimes poorly specified",
                "I think it would have been better if we had more samples codes. Also some of the slides are nice but it could help if we have some additional notes. Also it would help if we had recordings",
                "The course is well organized and challenging. The contents are interesting.",
                "Strengths: great balance and programming work and knowledge base. The guest lecture was quite interesting\r\n\r\nWeakness: I know it's hard to cover all on linguistics plus computer science in just one semester, but maybe can focus less on linguistics but more on the CS techniques.",
                "making lectures available with a recording could be very nice. Otherwise, format was good.",
                "I think the assignments can be improved with more focus on programming aspects in class. Perhaps having an extra class in the week totally focused on programming, for instance on teaching Pytorch would have been extremely helpful.",
                "This course serves as a broad overview and introduction to NLP. However, I think the lecture quality could be improved. The lectures are way too fast."

But also maybe review is good. The HW assignments for NLP do provide more opportunities for interacting with machine learning frameworks like pytorch, though I don't feel like I actually learned how to use them.",

                "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in computational linguistics or NLP. It was not overly challenging, and I feel like I learned enough to be able to implement basic NLP solutions myself. The lectures were sometimes a bit dense, but this was mostly a factor of how much material we needed to cover.",
                "Yep I think its a good class. Very interesting.",
