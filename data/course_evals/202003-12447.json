Strengths: Meaningful discussions about art history, getting to see my classmates' drawings, insightful advice on my work from the professor. Weaknesses: Towards the end of the semester the critiques from classmates were mostly positive, I definitely would have appreciated more criticism on how to improve my art.",

                "I loved the low class size and it really felt like a little community by the end of the course. Professor Rodman offered wonderful comments and I think his passion was very present. The only weakness is that I wished there was a bit more constructive criticism in the class for our own pieces.",

We also had virtual trips to libraries that worked out pretty well, so I still felt it was engaging over zoom.",

The assignments every week are a great way to take a different kind of break while expressing yourself. You also learn to think more critically about the media surrounding you.",

                "Yes, a great introduction to the art department and art in general!",
                "Yes. It's a great class for people who are both interested or unsure about visual arts.",
                "Yes!! Absolutely. You don't have to have any previous experience with art and the class atmosphere was always really encouraging. I loved seeing all my classmates with different academic interests\/majors show their creativity through so many different mediums, and in a way it really made me remember why I liked art classes so much when I was younger. I feel like I haven't been in a class that captured that feeling in a long time, so I was really grateful to take this as my first-year seminar. The graphic novels we got to read were also super cool, and I'm inspired to work on my own comics for fun in the future.",
                "Yes",
