    "I learned how to read philosophy more closely, gaining a different perspective on how to think about problems we face. I was exposed to various perspectives which broadened my horizons and increased my appreciation for the Western canon.",

   "comments": [
    "A weakness would definitely have to be the sheer amount of reading we were expected to do, as well as the ambiguity in the syllabus about what sections of the reading for that week needed to be completed for each class that week. \r\n\r\nA strength would be the exposure to many different aspects of the western canon, as well as an outlet to discuss foundational texts.",
    "This class was very strong because Professor Angermann made sure we understood the text before we evaluated its argument, instead of having us just jump in without understanding the text first. Sometimes, this wasn't as fun, because we didn't get to really discuss the text, but would spend most of class answering his questions about it instead of engaging in a back and forth discussion. However, I think that approach ultimately helped more, because it was very important to understand the text first.",
    "Directed Studies is inherently a balancing act of covering lots of material, while also attempting to understand the ideas at a deep level. The strength of DS (covering lots of material in a far-reaching survey course) is also its weakness.",

    "I definitely think the DS program in its entirety is beneficial to understanding foundations of our history.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I left this course having gained a lot of knowledge about how to interact with philosophical texts.",
    "Directed Studies is not for everyone, but, on the whole I really enjoyed both semesters. DS is very rewarding, but also a lot of work. Pick your professors wisely based on ratings and workload, so that you don't become overwhelmed amidst your non-DS courses and extracurriculars. The seminar sections are where a lot of the really good explorations of texts occur, so it's important that you work well with the professor's teaching style and the other students in your section, especially if you hope to have a truly enriching experience.",
