                "In general the class is focused on greek grammar and vocab as a continuation of L1. Dr. Patterson also emphasizes linguistics and morphology which is awesome and adds a lot to the experience.",
                "I learned how to read Greek prose without needing to write in translations for every single word. I also greatly improved at sightreading Greek and gained a strong knowledge of morphophonology through the nature of Dr. Patterson's teaching. Instead of memorizing paradigms, I am now far better equipped to recognize linguistic patterns in Greek and in all other languages."

                "The frequent quizzes were a good way of reinforcing material. We always had at least a day of warning, and they were frequently just reviews of the homework. The structure of the class strongly emphasized participation, and recognized that it is both important and good to be wrong.",
                "The class is definitely a lot of work and time but you really leave with an incredibly strong understanding of the language.",
                "The big strength of this course is Dr. Patterson's focus on morphophonological patterns in teaching Greek rather than on brute memorization. Seriously, Dr. Patterson's teaching method for Greek completely changed the way I had viewed the language in GREK 110. Another strength of the course was the selections of authentic Greek readings---they felt an appropriate difficulty level, they were tough to struggle through but also very rewarding after completing a passage.\r\nThe only weakness of this course is the textbook, Hansen & Quinn 2nd Edition. Dr. Patterson and I discussed this once after class: the textbook is very at-odds with his teaching style, as it prioritizes memorization of paradigms over linguistic pattern recognition. Dr. Patterson suggested that in the future he would change the textbook to be less of a \"textbook\" and more of a reference book for vocabulary and the occasional helpful paradigm. I think this would be a very good direction for the class."

                "Absolutely! If you took GREK 110 and want to do more Greek, you definitely should take 120. It's a great way to interact with some famous Greek literature in its original form, and to learn how to translate ancient texts.",
                "Absolutely. Especially with Dr. Patterson.  He is amazing.",
                "Absolutely. This is a must-take for anyone interested in Ancient Greek, whether they are classics majors or just passively interested in Greek mythology\/culture. The feeling of accomplishment you feel after reading your first authentic Greek text (for us it was Gorgias' Encomium of Helen) is unforgettable. This class was an amazing, tight-knit, fun experience."
