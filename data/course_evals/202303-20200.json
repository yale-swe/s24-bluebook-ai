                "This was one of the most technically robust courses in the Urban Studies major that I've taken (sometimes it can be haunted by fun but squishy classes that don't feel grounded enough). The readings touched on a wide variety of important scholars in the field, while keeping it interesting by relating each to current case studies around the world (as a senior in the major, I had previously read some of thembut the new contextualization still kept it fresh). I learned about the nuanced challenges facing cities of today and tomorrow, including governmental structure, transit infrastructure, zoning and development, private/public gradient, and designing space to foment public use. The course seemed the circle the drain of one key question: is it possible to design Utopia? The instructors also came from a professional background in the field, which kept their perspectives soberingly realistic, forcing students to really grapple with the issues at hand. I appreciated this as other classes can sometimes be a little unrealistic."

                "Discussions were engaging and entertaining. Having a review of the weeks readings at the beginning and then discussion for the rest of class broke up the long class period, making it seem less long. Assignments were fair. However although discussion was great I feel like I didnt come away with as much concrete information as we could have.",
                "The two instructors are definitely a strength. They really helped bring the content to life, especially in cases where they were able to bring in knowledge from their own careers. The fact they had a different background to most professors / instructors at Yale added a lot to the course. \r\nBesides that, I liked the flexibility of the assignments, especially since both the instructors were readily available to help figure out what to talk about in them.",
                "Strengths -- Great content and format. I liked the new theme every week about a different aspect of the city. Assignments were great complements to the class and at times fun to complete. I liked the aspect of having discussion leaders which really help propel the discussions every week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses --  I wish the instructors shared more of their experiences and expertise in the field. They have very unique backgrounds and work on many things discussed in class but I would've liked to learn more about what it is like to work in urban planning, development, and consulting.",
                "Strengths: readings, breadth of knowledge, unique instructor perspective, interesting assignments that required you to apply the knowledge in new ways rather than regurgitating information. The instructors were also very open to talking about essays and helping work out novel points of inquiry, which I really appreciated.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes class discussion would get a little out of hand, so I appreciated moments where the instructors guided discussion with specific and pinpointed questions. Also, sometimes I had issues finding theory to cite in assignments, since sometimes weeks would be focused completely on case studies. Also, I think the course would be helped tremendously by switching up one or two class periods from the traditional discussions... maybe students could present a little on what they were planning on writing about for the upcoming assignment and discuss?"

                "Yes, amazing course to take if you're interested in anything urban or cities. It provides a unique overview that you wouldn't get elsewhere in the URBN department. It is also a relatively chill class with an open discussion-type format. Matthew and Manasvi are very experienced in their fields and do know what they are talking about.",
                "If you're new to the Urban Studies major, this would be a bit of a challenging introduction, but I think it's probably one of the best in terms of rigorI'd definitely recommend. If you're a senior in the major, though, you might find it retreads some topics you've already learned about in other classes, so the course will be a little easier. That said, I expected the course to be easier than it was and was pleasantly surprised by the level of intellectual challenge the instructors provoked."
