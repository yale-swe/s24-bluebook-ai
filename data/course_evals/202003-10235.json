                "I learned how to tell a story! Before class, I had never really tried creative writing, but I left with a greater appreciation of how wonderful writers have built their craft as well as how to build my own.",
                "I learned the traditional structure and fundamentals of writing a story. I also learned which of those fundamentals are most important.",
                "Quite simply, in Reading Fiction for Craft, I learned how to write a short story from beginning to end. In the first half of the semester, we spoke about the different fundamental aspects of storytelling in published works and in the second half of the semester we were then asked to apply what we discussed to our own writing.",
                "Prof. Sexton breaks down fiction writing into a couple of different skills like characterization, narrative building, voice etc... and does an excellent job of introducing writers to these necessary components of fiction writing."

                "The course moves at a very fast pace, reading two books a week sometimes, and when those books arent discussed to the fullest degree, sometimes it feels like it isnt necessary to read them in the first place. The exercises are a very good way to work on craft elements. And the books themselves are good. However, it doesnt feel like all the work we do in the course is accurately reflected in the grade for the course, which is a fault of the course.",
                "I loved this course, I felt as if it was organized in a way that I was able to focus on one aspect of storytelling at a time--a huge strength for someone who has never done any fiction writing before.  There are some weeks, especially at the beginning of the semester, where there is way too many readings and writings to do and then in the second half of the semester, the workload settles down substantially--I wish the readings were more so dispersed throughout the semester, but I also acknowledge that that may make the workshopping aspect of the course difficult to continue with. Beyond this, I wasn't a huge fan of all of the readings and I wish that we were to do more readings similar to the length of the 2500 word short story that we were asked to write at the end of the semester.",
                "It was just so fun! The class wrote entertaining stories, and Prof. Sexton fostered the classroom environment where we became friends with our peers by the end of the semester."

I felt as if keeping the microphone unmuted worked really well in our class and it encouraged students to actively participate. The one Zoom feature that I didn't love was the use of the chat function as a means of discussing the texts, there were too many thoughts all at once and I felt as if it was difficult to both read everyone else's thoughts and respond to them in only about 5 minutes."

I hear people at Yale always saying \"I wish I read more\", and if that's really the case they should take this course and use it to once again become excited to pick up a book when you have free time."
