It felt that a small subset of students had previous knowledge that allowed them to dominate conversations. This made participating somewhat daunting.",

On these assignments, the professor is highly nit-pickyhe is less charitable than you'd expect, and will dock you on the smallest debatably minor details.",
                "technically difficult, maybe more office hours would be good, but the class itself was incredibly interesting",

The workload also wasn't too bad: three short two-page responses and a final paper. Weaknesses: Perhaps a little too much of class time was focused on relativism (and on related positions that lacked rigor)."

This was one of the first analytic courses I took, and I would have been able to interact more and gain a better understanding of the material if I had more prior knowledge. The material is very challenging, but professor Szabo does a great job explaining it and facilitating discussion.",

                "Yes, but know what you're getting yourself into. The course essentially is a survey of a) all the major views grounding Truth, b) the different understandings of Relativism. Unless you're especially discerning and opinionated, it will show you that no standard view adequately defines Truth. Be extremely cautious of that \"knowledge\", and fight the urge to throw up your hands. As advice for all seminars, but especially this one: plant your stake deep in the ground, but be willing to move it. Don't be equally sympathetic to everything. Reject or defend the view presented.",
                "yes, but be prepared",
