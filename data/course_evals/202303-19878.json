                "I learned a lot of new Russian vocabulary and how to read articles about historical phenomena, as well as how to listen to media in Russian. It was also interesting to learn about a lot of the historical events in the USSR that I didn't learn about at home as a heritage speaker of Russian.",
                "This course provides a nuanced and empathetic perspective on Russian history. A great compliment to the courses offered in the History and PolySci departments",
                "I learned a lot about the Soviet Union, including its founding, culture, and historical events I had never heard of. This class doesn't really go that chronologically, and I would say the focus is mostly on the early years of the USSR. I continued to grow my language skills, particularly reading and listening. I have a better insight into the mind of the Soviet Union.",
                "More practice with speaking Russian in a specific setting. Lots of vocab relating to film, war, literacy, government, etc. Learned a lot of interesting 20th century russian history"

                "Strengths: quite an easy course. Homework is helpful to understand concepts and participate in discussions, but it's not formally collected. Irina Andreevna is very understanding and LITERALLY one of the nicest people (let alone instructors) that I have ever met/had. She was so helpful and funny and she really just made the class so enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not really many. As long as you participate, show up, and put in effort/show growth you will get an A- or A.",
                "S: Love the film and book components, they really help ground the class. Professor Andreevna is amazing, I had taken several semesters of Russian with her and she is one of the best! She's warm, capable, and a teacher that crafts lessons and assignments according the student. \r\n\r\nW: It wasn't a fully comprehensive history of the Soviet Union, rather it was an exploration of interesting periods of political, cultural, and social significance. We invested different amounts of time and energy into different subjects. So depending on what you're looking for, you could either be disappointed on not covering much time wise, or very satisfied at learning about some more fundamental soviet principles.",
                "Strengths: Irina Andreevna is truly the best professor at Yale. She is so passionate, kind, and attentive to her students needs. She alters the course and content based on the skill levels/interests of the class, and she gives very specialized feedback to help students improve. She is extremely encouraging and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: vastly different skill levels of the students sometimes made discussions hard to follow. Homework was also sometimes very long and hard to complete, especially because organization was not always super clear.",

            "comments": [
                "Yes, as long as you actually know Russian pretty well. Some of the articles that Irina assigns are a bit difficult because they're discussing historical events, but she's very understanding and helps with vocab. She's like a walking dictionary and she basically knows how every word should be used and its grammatical properties. It's not a hard course, so if you speak Russian at home or have been studying it for awhile, definitely take it, because you'll learn a lot without having to torture yourself.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Irina Andreevna is wonderful, she really cares about her students and puts in a ton of time and energy into giving you feedback and crafting the class according to the student's interests. She's really humble, but knows a ton about Soviet history, literature, and culture. If you're interested in anything, she will find material for you!\r\n\r\nThe class is a lot of fun, you learn fascinating things about the USSR (and America's involvement with it), get to watch great films, and read some nice literature. Definitely one of my favorite Russian classes at Yale.",
                "Take any course with Irina Andreevna tbh. You will get a lot out of a class with her. If youre confident in your Russian abilities or just generally interested in 20th century history, you will probably enjoy this class.",
                "Yes! It was incredible, one of my favorite classes at Yale."
