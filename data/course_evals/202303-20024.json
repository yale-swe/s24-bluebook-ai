Learned a few models for understanding growth, market behavior, and federal responses. Knowledge about banks and credit market, understanding and predicting market behavior.",
                "Macroeconomic analysis skills",

                "My quantitative thought process improved.",

                "This was a good course, but I was frustrated with the assessment format. The course requires you to regurgitate virtually any piece of information from the lecture slides, down to practically useless memorized facts that have little bearing on understanding macro. Otherwise I thought it was well designed and paced.",
                "The course is strong in its small size because it lends well to asking questions and having discussions. I really liked when Prof. Hawkins would do \"turn and talk to your neighbor.\" It breaks the lecture period up nicely. Another strength of the course is the weekly worksheets; those really helped me understand the basics before I turned to the PSET. \r\n\r\nWeakness..? - It is easy to coast through this course, since there is no incentive to do any work beyond the worksheet&pset each week. But you might end up with a worse grade than in ECON 116 because no large course curve. But you will understand more content!",
                "I would have appreciated a more \"big picture\" finish towards the end of the course. We were learning new material right until the end and I was kind of hoping to do more connections between things we'd learned at the beginning and end of the year.",
                "I feel like professor was talking too fast",
                "Strengths: very thorough preparation, slideshows done excellently, questions answered with much detail\r\nWeaknesses: very fast pace, through course material and in terms of how fast the Professor speaks, sometimes questions lead to more questions",
                "Prof. Hawkins is a strength of the course. Being able to take an intro econ class as a seminar is an extraordinary opportunity.",
                "A strength of this course is that it has a small class size, so I can always get my questions answered. I'm not sure what one of the weaknesses is.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-A seminar so we could openly ask questions and learn at a rate that worked for us\r\n-Many office hours to review topics and get help on psets\r\n-Lectures are posted in advance or immediately after class which makes studying and note taking easier\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Some days the lessons would easily get derailed so it would make it difficult to understand the concepts that we rushed through at the end of the class"

                "Yes!",

I am actually much better equipped now to read economic news and read Econ articles - we had a brief research presentation and I was surprised by how much of these very dense research papers I was actually able to grasp, which was cool! Its not the most exciting class but thats ok",
                "Yeah, if you want to really understand the nuance of things, this course is great. If you are someone who struggles with paying attention in large lectures, I found Prof. Hawkins' style to be engaging and the course size to be a good incentive to show up and stay alert.",
                "If interested in really actively engaging with the material I recommend the 111 intro macro class over the lecture version -- small class size forces you to really be present.",
                "Yes, it wasnt time consuming",
                "Definitely. Dr Hawkins is incredibly insightful, witty, quick-on-his-feet, and great at presenting information. My only caution would be he talks super fast and the class moves quickly, but provided you do the work, youll do well and learn a lot.",
                "Yes! i have no regrets about taking the seminar.",
                "Yes, I would. Even for students who aren't economics majors, these macroeconomic concepts are still applicable to everyone, as everyone is subject to inflation or. saving money in a bank account.",
                "Yes. If you like economics or just want to learn more this is a great way to do that because the class is smaller so you can feel more comfortable to ask questions."
