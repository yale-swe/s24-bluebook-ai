                "I learned a great deal of phonology, with specific emphasis on optimality theory. We looked at, among other things, underspecification, opaque interactions, OT-based approaches to describing reduplication, and alignment, juncture, and contiguity constraints. The final project offered a good experience to actually attempt writing the sort of paper we'd been reading all semester, which I appreciated, not only for the challenge, but also the opportunity it provided to employ the analytical skills we'd honed.",
                "I learned about several important topics in phonology. One (large) topic that stood out was optimality theory.",
                "We built upon the ideas from Phon I, learning more about both rule-based phonology (underspecification theory, lexical phonology) and about constraint-based phonology (generalized alignment, reduplication). I also learned how to write a proper linguistics paper with datasets and diagrams and everything."

                "Strengths: course formatdiscussions of phonological processes based on readings and accompanying problem setsworked well, in my opinion. Also, the fact that the final project was split up into stages was helpful, as it ensured that I actually made some progress, and it made completely the final paper easier. Weaknesses: I feel like I could've used just a little bit more guidance on how to incorporate previous linguists' work into my final paper. It wasn't a skill I'd had much practice with, and I struggled a bit to built a solid phonological grounding for my analysis.",
                "The course was very fun. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to complete many of the readings - this was supplemented by the in-class exercises, however.\r\n\r\nThere were several half-hearted attempts to get us to pair up with people we had not previously paired up with. One suggestion would be to assign groups: point to people in turn and give them a number (\"1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4\") and then have people work with the person who had their number. It might take some experimenting to see if this strategy is right for this class.",
                "Strengths: the content is very interesting, especially the selected papers to read and Kager's textbook on optimality theory. I liked how Natalie had not read some of the papers they assigned, which meant we were learning the content together.\r\nWeaknesses: the class was just generally quite disorganized. We got sidetracked easily, and people often did not do the readings which limited the depth of our discussions. It also felt at times that there was a palpable divide between the undergraduates and the grad students, which I really did not like, but this has nothing to do with the curriculum or instruction. Another major weakness of the course is that many assignments were not graded. As I write this evaluation, only one of our four psets has been graded, which makes it very hard to tell if I have a proper understanding of the assignments.\r\nAll this being said, I thought the content was fascinating, I just wish the course were organized better."
