                "Strengths:\r\n- Very useful class for anyone who wants to go into Private Equity. Everything we learned is useful for the interviews and recruiting process\r\n- Preparing cases before class and discussing them in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Reading very detailed 70+ pages\/class on a topic that is not as important was a waste of time in my opinion (I don't think that we need to understand all the details of bankruptcy law in order to become good investors). The professor claimed that most Private Equity associates don't know any of this, so it doesn't seem to be as important as the professor states.\r\n- A midterm exam on topics covered is useless if it is just learning definitions, I think that the midterm should be structured like the take-home final exam (a case to work on over several days)\r\n- Homework was given after every class for the next class. Given how much work this class is, it would be useful to be given homework for the next week, an not have 2 days to prepare for a case sometimes (Monday to Wednesday) and the same amount of work over several days until the next class (Wednesday to the following Monday)\r\n- Too much work. Impossible to carefully spend time on all homework unless you want to pull an all nighter before every class or fail all your other classes\r\n- Textbook (written by the professor) is too complicated and detailed to understand.",

                "The course gives a very thorough breakdown of methods used by private equity sponsors, but could do better to focus in on the most important things instead of broadly discussing everything.",
                "Amazing class, and it was run very efficiently. The structure was ideal for the material. There are no suggestions I have at this time.",
                "The class is really well structured and the content is very rich. Professor Schmertzler is really good at observing where the class is going and nudging people toward pedagogically meaningful directions. It would be great if more detailed, direct feedback is provided.",

                "Professor Schmertzler is a fantastic educator. His teaching style is perhaps somewhat more blunt and to the point than what you may be used to at Yale, but it is clear that he cares deeply about his students' learning in the course and that his high expectations for the quality of work required make students engage deeply with the material. Schmertzler enjoys being provocative and asking questions in such a way that whatever answer you provide, he will raise questions\/issues with your answer. This forces you to think for yourself and justify any arguments you make thoroughly - I found this to be refreshing in contrast to the typical \"great comment, Johnny\" that most professors give out regardless of what you say. If you say something that is bull hockey, Schmertzler will call you out on it. He also has a great sense of humor and many interesting anecdotes from his career.",
                "Professor Michael Schmertzler is naturally talented at sharing his experience, synthesize current deals news, and helping students answer lingering questions about the private equity textbook. The course could be improved by having a TF who could give students more frequent feedback.",
                "The professor is absolutely great, as he is immensely experienced and brings a lot of interest and experience to every single class. The material is also interesting and directly applicable (perhaps in the workplace or just in daily life). I do wish there was a bit less cold-calling in the class, as it could sometimes feel hostile\/stressful early in the semester (probably worsened by the virtual format). However, the professor took feedback and improved this completely by the end of the semester."

There is a lot of casework and collaborative group work that was actually very helpful and engaging. \r\n\r\nYou also need to be prepared to stand your ground. The course moves quickly and Prof Schmertzler has a very intense teaching style that can be intimidating even for the most prepared students. I think this class was a good exercise in learning how to be assertive and defend your ideas. That being said, it definitely felt a little too aggressive at times. But you will learn a lot, so stand your ground and try your best not to feel like an imposter - trust me, everyone feels that way. You deserve to be there and Prof Schmertzler recognizes peoples potential even if they might not think so.",

                "If you can handle a large workload and have a finance mentality, this course will give you an edge over your analyst class in any finance role. I strongly recommend you take it. \r\n\r\nIf you cannot handle the workload, cannot take criticism well, and\/or do not have a diligent work ethic, you should reconsider taking the course. This is not the course where you can rush through the material and finish the work 5 minutes before class.",
                "Highly recommend it if you are interested in getting a systematic way of looking at late-stage and some early-stage investments. There are lots of case studies that help you crystalize the takeaways (so modeling skill is a must).",

                "Absolutely. If you are interested in learning about the PE industry (and fundamental evaluation of companies from an investment perspective more generally) this is a great class. You will have to spend a lot of time on the course material and work damn hard, but it is most definitely worth it. \r\nWithout any hyperbole, this was one of the highlights of my time at Yale (quite possibly the best class I have taken at Yale) and you learn an immense amount.",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to any student who wants a better understanding of investment analysis in private equity, venture capital, and even future entrepreneurs who want to understand how to create a business structure and select leadership that would get the company funded. It is a very challenging course for those without previous finance-oriented experiences, yet if you're up for a great learning curve that would potentially help your corporate job in the real world, this would be a great choice.",
                "Yes, take this class, but only if you have actual interest in going into private equity, venture capital, or something similar in your career. The workload is pretty high and it will be a miserable time if you don't enjoy the material."
