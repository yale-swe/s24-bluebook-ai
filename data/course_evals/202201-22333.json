We also only engaged with the music in one class which was a bummer. I really enjoyed the OHAM project and wish we had done more with that.",
                "I believe the class was well organized over the weeks of readings - I felt clear and recognizable threads and debates that shifted over the course of several weeks. It gave me a clear introductory sense to what the field has looked like and what it looks like now, with great starting points to dive in deeper in several different areas.\r\n\r\nI do feel that sometimes the readings felt overly heavy\/broad. The choose-your-own-adventure reading assignments (\"read whatever looks interesting to you from this book\") were creatively stimulating and interesting, but led to some dead class discussions that felt frustrating at times. I'd love to see a little more coherence\/structure, especially when a lot of the class had not read much jazz material before."
