                "I gained a greater understanding of and vocabulary for business and enterprise in China. Moreover, I got to learn about different well-known companies' journeys in entering the Chinese market.",
                "Especially improved my reading and writing abilities in Chinese. 10 chapters of content: five from a textbook with case studies on multinational firms (KFC, Starbucks, Ikea, Sam's Club, P&G) entering China and five supplemental chapters that focused on economic growth, Belt & Road, entrepreneurship, etc. I thought the content was really interesting but mainly a conduit for practicing Chinese and learning vocabulary words that are definitely applicable to your life, whether you're trying to read\/discuss the news in Chinese or hoping that your career can involve Mandarin in some way.",
                "I learned to describe and analyze the economy with formal Chinese language. I learned more about the Chinese market through the case studies we explored in class. I was also able to strengthen my verbal presentation skills in Chinese, as well as formal essay writing.",
                "This course is a refreshing break from the standard Chinese language sequence courses. Rather than focusing time memorizing grammar and vocabulary (which of course, is still covered), most of the course time is spent learning about very interesting business and economic topics. Even after taking several economics classes in the past, I'm surprised in this class I learned about new economics terminology!\r\n\r\nThe course can broadly be decided into two parts. The first part we review lessons from . Each lesson is a case study of a different company entering the Chinese market (eg McDonalds entering china for the first time). In the text we learn why each company either failed or succeeded. In the second part we read lightly edited real life articles of very important economic\/political topics (think one belt one road, debt diplomacy, etc.). This part of the course stresses challenging students to read and discuss concepts at a very high level.",

                "No weakness. Best class.",
                "Strengths: Chen Laoshi is awesome, instructive, kind; small class environment means you participate all the time and are really engaged; very interesting course content; the right amount of handwriting (5 total ting xies for semester) without it feeling burdensome or unhelpful. Weaknesses: Workload was a little more unbalanced than I was used to for Chinese courses, with nothing really due one day a week and a lot due the next, but got the hang of it.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily a weakness, but I thought our learning could have been improved by focusing more on grammar structures in class than on the information in the text in each lesson. Most Powerpoints overviewed the content of the lesson (what did P&G do to adapt to the Chinese market?), which was interesting and still useful for improving language skills, but I might have found it more beneficial if we had merely used the readings as an intro\/to set the scene for the class and instead spent the 75 minutes of class drilling other example sentences for the grammar structures that appeared in the textbook readings. Another small suggestion: when we share news stories every unit, it might be helpful if we wrote them down in a group Google Doc instead of our own Google Doc. I always found it challenging to follow classmates when they read our their news headline because they often contained abbreviated grammar and lots of niche\/technical words so I would sort of drown out their headline instead of being able to see and absorb the headline characters on my own screen.",
                "The course is very relevant to the real-world, and aims to help the students be better prepared to work with in a Chinese-speaking setting. The workload is not too heavy, and the class is very engaging.",
                "Strengths: 1. Chen Laoshi is amazing. 2. The course material is very interesting, and I believe every person remotely interested in understanding China better needs to read. 3. Fair grading and clear feedback. 4. No more drilling or boring memorization! 5. Very interesting discussions with classmates in and out of the classroom.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1.  lessons sometimes get a bit repetitive. 2. I don't think  are necessary at this level.",
                "Professor Chen is really sweet and understanding. If you ask, she will give extensions. In class she makes sure that everyone understood the material and explains patiently and clearly, so even if you feel illiterate after doing the reading, you will no longer feel like that after asking her for help. A week before the final exam, Professor Chen handed out a study guide (a list of paragraph answer questions. You get to pick which questions to answer in the exam). The class is well-organized and follows a clear schedule."

Chen Laoshi is fantastic and the course content is really interesting and relevant if you are interested in economics, multinationals, or Chinese business news.",
                "Yes! The course is very manageable and the professor is very encouraging.",
                "Yes! If you have finished the Chinese language sequence coursework, this is a logical next step, especially if you are interested in learning about financial\/business terminology. The class covers very interesting topics (from one belt one road, to china's third child policy) that are important to know for any person interested in East Asia.",
