                "Strength: amazingly useful material for someone going into finance\r\nWeakness: the pace is a bit fast",
                "The strength of this course is that it teaches you a lot of conceptual corporate finance through many theoretical applications. The weakness is that it doesn't cover very real-world, mathematical topics the way you would approach them in the finance industry.",
                "Pros\r\n- The Median grade hovers around A / A -\r\n- Lectures are optional and recordings are available online.\r\n- Homework is manageable. There are 4 problem sets. These a graded primarily on completion (on a scale of 0 - 3). There is sufficient handholding during office hours. If you attend, you will get the max 3 points.\r\n- Prof. Clayton is a great instructor. He is lucid and goes over the lecture content slowly.\r\n\r\nCons.\r\n-This is not a hands-on finance class. It is very theoretical and there is a lot of algebra. \r\n-There is a lot of lecture material. In some lectures, you are introduced to a new formula/model every 5 slides. \r\n-The exams are closed book, so be prepared to cram all the formulas/models.",
                "It was a very general course that covered a bit of each topic within corporate finance and banking. I really like the topics covered. The psets were a bit difficult and long but very helpful for understanding the material.",
                "strength: content is interesting and useful \r\nweakness: wish there were more psets so that we can understand the material better; exam does not reflect pset well; too few office hour provided; section is not too helpful",
                "It was relatively interesting conceptually but very theoretical and the course went sort of slow. The concepts were explained with examples with a lot of exogenous variables that would be listed at the beginning but I would forget them so It would be confusing where certain numbers were coming from",
                "professor should work through problems on the board to show you really how to do them, just lecturing off a PowerPoint isnt very helpful",
                "Strength: Well organized with a logical order for learning content and made learning each new concept easier and more interesting. \r\nWeakness: Course content was highly theoretical and did not feel applicable enough to the real world. Wish Professor Clayton would change the curriculum because it seemed like most students did not enjoy how theoretical it was.",
                "Strengths was using real life examples and use of powerpoints, also having a good TF helped a lot.",
                "The material was interesting and Professor Clayton was kind, but his lectures were sometimes dry.",
                "Professor Clayton was a strong lecturer of topics and a clear explainer of concepts. The structure/organization of the class, as well as each individual lectures, was fantastic. It was very easy to follow along. The material was sometimes dry upon first glance, but completing the Problem Sets and studying for the exams made me better appreciate the importance of corporate finance.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TA's are very approachable and helpful if you need extra help. Problem sets are helpful and since they're graded on completion not too stressful. Weaknesses: lecture notes could be clearer - often, the examples are way too long and it can be difficult to ascertain what is meant as interesting side material versus what will be on the exams - if Prof. Clayton could streamline the lectures and maybe make the examples more general and to the point, that would be a great improvement.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, responsive professor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Answer keys for homework and past exams were sometimes difficult to understand",
                "Strength: very broad coverage of many important finance topics.\r\nWeakness: not really applicable to real life finance.",
                "Fairly clear content, though lectures could be somewhat dry and very few problem sets throughout the semester",
                "The course does a good job of educating you very well on certain key tenets of capital structure and how they relate to each other (such as the relationship between debt and equity). This is highlighted through scenario based exercises.\r\n\r\nThe course sometimes oversimplified nuances, and could do a better job of relating our simplified models to the real world."

This class is boring to sit through so attendance dwindles (literally 8 ppl of a 70 person class showed up regularly). There are only four psets so you arent really held accountable for knowing the material. Its one of those classes where you either are terribly lost or you think its insanely easy and theres no in between.",

The workload is exceedingly manageable, the topics are generally interesting, and the Professor is very strong. Sometimes the class felt like a barrage of debt, debt, debt -- but you learn that not all debt (or equity) is created equal.",

                "Yes, it is a good course AFTER you take financial economics or have some finance background. Not good for banking interviews not going to lie. The 400 guide is your best bet.",
                "Depends. If they're interested in corporate finance in particular, then sure. Otherwise, they might find that there's a bit too much in terms of specific  models, etc, that might not be helpful or relevant elsewhere",
