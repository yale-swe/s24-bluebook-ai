We learned how to assess arguments for validity, and how to perform a derivation on an argument to prove its validity. We also learned how to construct countermodels to prove an argument invalid. Looking back at where I started in the beginning of the semester, I really did learn a lot. The course offers an introduction into a different way of thinking and tackling problems.",

I think this class gives a somewhat rigorous, but extremely rewarding and enjoyable learning experience, that ultimately feels like doing less work than in other classes, which are not closely as enjoyable as this one. Therefore, the improvement in knowledge in this field will be exponential during the course of the semester.",

While not practically useful for me in any direct sense (I'm not planning to become a logician, or take further logic classes) the class worked an underutilized part of my brain and challenged me to consider argumentation and sentence structure in new ways.",

                "Strengths: Professor Meehan is very knowledgable and does a great job of explaining the very complicated concepts that come with L1, L2, and L3. It is definitely not an easy course to teach but he taught in a manner that was digestible and easy to understand. Weakness: I wish there was a little bit more of a clarity early on about if the final was going to be take-home this year or not.",
                "Weakness: The ELogic software is not very intuitive, and feels very outdated. Strengths: Professor Meehan and all the TFs really care about their students' success.",
                "strengths: amazing prof, class goes pretty slow, HW is very chill, weaknesses: none",
                "Strenghts: Professor Meehan is great!! Very clear teaching and engaging lectures. Workload low.\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "This class was wonderful. So very engaging. I wish that section were better, though.",
                "Recorded lectures are CLUTCH, and I hope they keep them. Class itself has nice TFs who care about student learning. But the class is clearly bigger than it's supposed to be, and it can feel like it's a bigger class with the resources of a smaller one.",
                "I found it helpful that the lecture slides and recordings were available on Canvas. I also liked that there was a large repository of practice problems available on Elogic, but it would have been more helpful if sample solutions had also been available.",
                "I think the course was well designed. We basically had one homework per week, two midterms, and one final. It was well balanced and well paced.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor and teaching assistants, enjoyable material, rewarding learning journey, really good problem sets in e-logic software which truly teaches you logic but simultaneously does not make you feel super overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Technically, none. Take it! :)\r\n(If I must suggest something, one really minor, tiny thing I would probably work on is the logic quizzes before lectures, sometimes I did not fully understand with my tired brain what they were about, however, looking back at the slides I realized that my brain got this false alarm that it must be something hard and new, however, they are pretty doable, just does not fully relate to the course material. It is a way of getting the brains of the students started  probably, but to me, it was somehow the opposite experience. Maybe if you can make it even more obvious that it is not part of the course material, and make it even more playful, then it will be more rewarding experience for students and some students will not feel overwhelmed by starting the lecture with a new concept.)",
                "I absolutely loved this class. I took this for my QR credit, but in retrospect would have taken it even if I didn't need that distributional requirement. Professor Meehan is absolutely wonderful; the lectures are well-organized and clear, and he is clearly devoted to student success and understanding. The psets are useful and not too demanding, and I found all of the exams to be fairly structured and graded. The only critique I have of this class is less about how it is taught and more about how the system of logic builds on itself... the first half of the semester is quite easy, but the second half gets exponentially harder as concepts build upon themselves. I found it manageable with committed studying, but it can be challenging to adapt to a faster pace towards the end of the semester.",
                "It would be best if there were more in-class problem-solving. I struggled a lot especially because the homework was very different than what we would do in class.",
                "This was an amazing introductory course to logic!  I had never known about the first-order system, and learning how to reason my way through complex arguments with proofs was both fun and deeply helpful",
                "The pacing of the course was a little off, with a lot of time spent on L1 and L2, but not enough time on L3 and L4.",
                "I think the course was taught very well, and overall, it's not necessarily difficult once you start to understand what you're doing which might take a few weeks in the beginning. My only slight problem is that a huge portion of the class--up until Thanksgiving Break, I believe---is largely spent on the first 2 concepts, while the final 2 concepts (that I believe to be quite a bit more complex and difficult) are crammed in the tiny amount of time (like 2 weeks) between the end of November break and finals, so while I feel like I ended the class with a very good understanding of the first two concepts, I still am not fully clear on the final two, and I feel like I spent reading week \"catching up\" on things I didn't even miss.",
                "Work is fun, lectures are well-delivered, clearly-organized, and the homework is fun. Great QR\r\nThe lectures move kinda slowly and are repetitive.",
                "Strengths: very clear instruction, well-paced, appropriate level of difficulty\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures sometimes get bogged down by questions, practice final much harder than the final itself, section wasn't always helpful/productive",
                "I liked that there was a weekly Pset that corresponded pretty well with that week's lesson. The in-class review sessions for exams were super helpful. The practice exams were also helpful along with the problems from the textbook. In general, the textbook was pretty helpful although some discrepancies between the textbook and what was being taught in lecture was slightly confusing at times.",
                "Strengths: The homework and lectures did a really exceptional job teaching the material! Although I usually dislike online programs, elogic was excellent. I never felt lost, and the questions I did have were easily answered by the textbooks or instructors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although the in-class derivations / countermodels were helpful, I think it would have been better to maybe show a step-by-step example of how rules function; maybe show a list of example expressions and explain why or why not a certain rule can be applied to each example. That way, sections can be devoted more to the practice problems.",
                "Although the lectures are well-organized, I feel like they go too fast and are too sense. I also am strongly against the fact that our section participation does not have any weight on our class assessment. I think it is unfair to ask students to attend an hour-long additional class (on top of the regular class periods) and waste their time when we have other commitments to worry about. These sections don't even facilitate student learning; I had to go to office hours to figure out what was going on in the class. If these sections are essentially useless and they don't count towards anything, then why have them in the first place? They are a waste of my time.",
                "Strengths: Cover a lot of ground, problem sets are useful and not stressful. Lectures are very clear, and TAs know their stuff. Exams were fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like there could have been more preparation earlier on for the argument analysis types of problems.",
                "The TF's were very competent and so was the professor. Very well organized.",
                "No weaknesses, great course and instructors",
                "I think the course covers the perfect amount of material and that the material was always well explained. Both Prof. Meehan and my TA were always ready to help and were a great support throughout the course. The two lecture and one section a week structure felt appropriate. The lectures could sometimes feel slow moving or repetitive.",
                "Strengths I think were the resources for practice (old exams, textbook, extra practice given by TA or instructor, puzzles at the beginning of classes). The main weakness for me was definitely the TAs. I felt like the information discussed in sections was often different from that which was being discussed in lectures and often found myself more confused during sections than helped.",
                "The course was very organized, and Professor Meehan explained all of the material in a clear and engaging way. He was always open to questions and set aside time during lecture specifically for that purpose. The workload was light, and ELogic provided tons of practice problems that were really helpful for studying for exams. However, the course could have gone at a much faster pace; I felt like we spent more time reviewing in class than was necessary.",
                "None:)",
                "I liked the lectures, but they were way too slow in the first weeks. Later, the pace was optimal, but the first 4-ish lectures were not as engaging as I hoped as they felt repetitive. I did feel the course was very rewarding though, and I left for winter break with tangible new skills that are really transferable.",
                "The course has many strengths. One is the organization of the course. There are clear expectations about the structure and the objectives for each week. The homework helped reinforce learning. I also felt the class time was used well to introduce new concepts. I believe that one difficulty of class time was in the solving of example problems because we occasionally gained great depth with certain concepts and focused less on others. I felt that we could have spent less time solving truth tables in order to gain more lecture time for the discussion of more complex logical symbolization problems.",
                "Sometimes the material was taught at a slower pace than I would have liked, but overall very few weaknesses. I do wish we had gotten the final exam back. I know the professor will be different in the future, but Prof Meehan was outstanding. Explained material really well and was incredibly patient."

                "Yes! It is a great QR credit for those who are interested in philosophy or are social science/humanities majors. It is also important to generally know more about the L1, L2, L3 languages in logic.",
                "Absolutely. It's not easy, but if you put the work into understanding the material it is very satisfying. I am not a math/numbers person, so I took this for a QR credit. There are probably easier QRs out there, but this class is very rewarding.",
                "YES! this is easily one of my favorite courses at yale (and I'm not a philosophy student or anything). If you like analytical reasoning and logic puzzles or anything of the sort you will love this class. And even if you don't you might too.",
                "Yes definitely if you're interested in logic and are not too afraid of QR. But even if you were, you can def use this course to fill your QR requirement.",
                "Absolutely. A lot of philosophy majors in the room, but as a political science guy myself, I found the class to be incredibly thought provoking. I even used some of the logic I learned to prepare a speech. Professor Meehan is just wonderful. He makes an effort to learn student names. The class is so fun. Puzzle solving!",
                "It's a fine class! Take it for an easy QR, although don't be surprised if it isn't easy--I know it's varied for different people. In all a fine class.",
                "Yes, if you want a fun QR on the easier side.",
                "Absolutely. Although, be prepared, it is NOT a gut course. But what makes it seem easy for some students, is that the learning process is beyond enjoyable! As an international, I have had a little bit more difficult times at some points due to language interpretation, and I lost one point on my first exam just because of not knowing a nuance in the English grammar perfectly. For homework, you will always get 100% if you do every part, since it is completion based. It takes about 2, max 3 hours to do them, and they feel like a fun game while facilitating maximal learning and practice.",
                "YES YES YES! I am a humanities student who is a bit scared of math but didn't want to take a total gut for my QR requirement, and this was the perfect class for me. You basically learn an entirely new language, a way to represent English sentences and arguments through symbols and logical derivations. I actively looked forward to doing the psets, and lectures were engaging and digestible (and also recorded! but go to lecture if you take the class because it's fun...). Exams were challenging, but I firmly believe that if you studied they were manageable.",
                "Not really.",
                "Yes!  This is one of the oldest courses at Yale, and the skills you learn--methodical reasoning, process of elimination, careful scrutiny--go a long way beyond the class itself.",
                "If you are a humanities person who needs a QR, this is a great option. It uses a math path of your brain without really being math, so its as good as you can get for a QR here.",
                "Yes; this class teaches you exactly what it's supposed to. The assignments actually help you learn the material and are also not that unpleasant. Overall, this has been my least stressful and lowest effort class this year but I still feel like I learnt a fair amount.",
                "I highly, highly recommend this course to students who are in search of a QR and detest math. This class can be confusing, but in all honesty, it can also be kind of fun at times. As long as you pay attention, you should be fine.",
                "Yes! Great QR if you're looking for one",
                "This was far and away the easiest course I have taken since my sophomore year of high school, if not earlier. You can either go to the lectures or read the textbook, and the textbook is about 60 total pages of content over the entire semester. I've thought of this class as a math class without any of the math, so I have the math background coming in to understand how to think about solving the problems, which I don't think everyone else will have; but even if you don't, I don't think the things people say about this being a gut are overrated.",

                "Definitely! Logic is useful not just for someone interested in philosophy, computation, or semantics, but also for general world knowledge. Usually we can intuit where an argument or line of reasoning just doesn't feel right; this class teaches you to pinpoint the exact flaw, at least on a basic level.",
                "Take it only if you are looking for a QR credit. It isn't a gut like others say, but I find it way easier than the other QR classes here. I could actually complete psets on my own, and I understood the content fairly well.",
                "Yes. I did not need this for a major or requirement, but I am one of the throng of prelaw students who take this class (though I guess by the time this is available, logic games will be gone). I can't say it directly improved my LSAT performance, but I definitely applied some of the tips and tricks from this class to some of my practice exams. Additionally, I just find it useful for analyzing arguments in general.",
                "Yes, this class was interesting and useful. A math credit like calculus won't serve you in the least, but this class may help the way you analyze arguments.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to fulfill QR credits for humanities people. It's well-taught and well-organized.",
                "I would recommend this course to students if they want a QR that isn't explicitly math. However, the actual content of this course may only appeal to philosophy majors or those who already have some interest in logic.",
                "Only if they are actually interested in math or find puzzles (math/logic puzzles fun) and are willing to take this course as an actual course and not a gut because it is work.",
                "Definitely! Logic is really fun and a great QR credit for people who don't really want to take a standard math class. Professor Meehan explains all of the course material really well in lecture and provides ample opportunities for review. I procrastinated on other assignments by doing my logic homework because doing the psets didn't really feel like work. It was very fun!! 100% recommend.",
                "Yes I would! As a STEM major this class is very do-able",
                "Yes, I was going through job recruitment for a consulting role and I felt the skills learnt in this class helped me in tackling business cases. Also, as a Philo major, I hope I had taken it earlier as an aid for essay writing.",
                "Absolutely",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in exploring a new way of thinking. I think it would be an ideal course for students interested in computer science due to the structures introduced.",
                "Definitely. It's a very manageable QR if you go to lecture and keep on top of things, and it's also fun and interesting in itself."
