                "Strengths: you learn a lot and some very useful things, the lectures are interesting sometimes, especially when applying what we learn in class to the real world.\r\nWeaknesses: the psets cover a lot of things we do not learn in class, and there are very few resources to get help on them.",
                "Weaknesses: Prof. Ryan is a smart guy, but he's not a great professor. Lecture pace needs to be sped up in first 2/3 of course, slowed down significantly in last 1/3. Midterm was way too long and difficult, almost twice the size of previous midterms...\r\n\r\nStrengths: Strong TF support, good peer tutors. Would 11/10 go to them during office hours for help. material is also very interesting",
                "The strength lies in the building of the foundation from probability all the way to IV. A weakness was the ambiguous role that R played within the class. It is necessary but I'm not sure to what extent it helped me understand anything or apply it in r studio.",
                "Strengths: Although virtual, Professor Ryan did a great job of keeping the lecture interactive.",
                "Strengths: forces kids to learn because it is required by the economics major and imposes a ridiculous curve\r\nWeaknesses: forces kids to learn because it is required by the economics major and imposes a ridiculous curve",
                "The professor and teaching team were well-organized and I felt that they knew what they were doing. I think some of the problem sets were a bit too long and unrealistic for students (who are taking 3 or 4 other classes) to reasonably complete. Besides that, I felt it was a well structured course.",
                "The course was good overall, but sometimes the information taught in lecture was hard to apply to the questions asked in problem sets. A little more guidance on how to apply the information taught would've been more helpful. It was also difficult to do the PSETs when some material needed to answer questions wasn't taught until the class right before the PSET was due.",
                "strengths - outside resources (pt, office hours) \r\nweaknesses - lecture was just... dull",
                "This was a poorly taught course. I fortunately took statistics in high school. Professor Ryan overcomplicates simple concepts\r\n\r\nAlso, worst exam design I have ever seen. No one has time to read paragraphs on paragraphs in the middle of exams--include just the relevant information. Time constraint on exam is ridiculous--tests on test taking speed and not class concepts.",
                "Strengths: Much of the course material related to real-world applications is very interesting. It brings up real problems in economics, development economics, and public policy. The problem sets are also quite interesting in this regard.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The non-real-world material is very dry. It's obviously useful, but that doesn't change it.",
                "Strengths: I think professor Ryan did a great job at organizing the lectures and teaching the material\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of material in a short amount of time",
                "Exams were difficult, although the content was taught well.",
                "I thought that overall, the course was outstanding. The strengths include all of the TFs and Professors. I believe that the content was very deep, and I think that they did an outstanding job explaining it at the introductory level.",
                "Strengths: Prof Ryan is a great lecturer, the TAs were great, the material was relevant\r\nWeaknesses: While Prof Ryan tried to tie all his examples to the real-world, sometimes the examples were hard to understand. For example, when the examples would involve finance, I had a hard time wrapping my head around them rather than focusing on the underlying econometrics principles Prof Ryan was trying to teach us. Would be great if these examples could be further simplified. It would have also been nice if psets and quizzes were due on a specific day of the week. It would be easier to plan out our weeks, especially because we have other assignments due too in other courses.",
                "Course is fast paced but well taught",
                "The TFs for the course were excellent. Jaime, the head TF, organized the course extremely well. I always felt like I had the resources and practice materials necessary to succeed. Nevertheless, the lectures were often quite dry. You are taking this course for the Econ major, so you likely cant avoid it.",
                "The statistics concepts were not taught in an intuitive way. The lectures were more confusing than helpful. Section helped clear a lot of things up. The midterm was also far too long for the time allotted and much harder than previous years.",
                "Lectures could be more intersecting and engaging",
                "More help on coding in R they helped for the first 2 psets but then we started everything on scratch",
                "Learning how to use the code should be emphasized more",
                "This course was very interesting and one strength was that it used lots of case studies to emphasize the real-world importance of the seemingly conceptual material. The course could be improved in that the material needed for the problem sets could be made more explicit in lecture, but that's not a big issue because there is so much to cover and everything students need has been covered.",
                "I don't understand in what way this course wasn't just stats 101 (I've never taken stats) --- I thought it was a bit rushed in some areas --- don't think anything in R was that helpful",
                "The content during the lectures and the content expected to be known on the problem sets often feel worlds apart. I feel if there was more emphasis on the actual number crunching itself, instead of a flurry of tangentially related real life examples, I would've developed a better level of econometric calculation ability.",
                "I cried a lot, but it pushed me to do things I never though I would do, like learning a coding language.",
                "Strengths were the TAs; they were very helpful. Weaknesses were the professor; I feel like he did not explain the concepts in class as well as he could have.",
                "Clear and easy to follow. Can get a little dry at times",
                "I really enjoyed the lectures and thought that they were very comprehensive. I also found the office hours to be very helpful and sections to be very organized. The only thing is that I felt that the lectures moved a bit quickly, so I would have appreciated if they had slowed down a bit.",
                "I feel like there were times when we get too bogged down in the math behind the statistics and there were also other times I wish we got more mathematical background. However, the course was a very strong course in teaching the material in a comprehensive way",
                "Despite the course material being applicable to virtually every aspect of Economics, the lectures in this course are very boring. I think it is because the concepts are hard to understand, (i.e., the difference in difference in a regression) making the first time through a new concept a slog. I think this course could be improved by providing pre-reading or videos prior to class, so when running through a paper which used a concept, students can actually know what is happening and not just be struggling to learn the differences between similar words.",
                "I feel like there were a number of things required for problem sets/exams that could have been taught more explicitly during lecture. One of the components of the course is to learn R for econometrics, but there were many R concepts required in the problem sets that I don't think were taught particularly well in the lectures and made things confusing. Otherwise, I thought the course was a solid overview of econometrics concepts as a whole that should be useful for anyone who wants to go into this type of field.",
                "I think the course was taught well and at a good pace. The lectures and the psets couldve been more connected.",
                "strength: especially during a time like this, I felt it was crucial to make the lecture slides easy to read and easy to read through.",
                "Strengths\r\n-Professor Ryan is an excellent lecturer, and his lecture slides are perfectly structured for both the lecture itself and for doing content review afterwards\r\n-The TAs are the best- hats off to them. The piazza page is very well administered with prompt and helpful responses to questions. \r\n-The TAs create invaluable section recap slides that are short summaries of that week's content\r\n-The lectures and psets do an excellent job connecting statistical concepts to the work being done by economists, and real-world issues\r\n-Psets are very well designed, helping to internalise the course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-While the quizzes are a good way to recap content, I don't think they are as low-stakes as intended.  I spent far, far more time working on psets than quizzes, but each pset was not weighted that much more heavily (5% of total grade per pset vs 3.33% per quiz). I recommend that the course either reduce the weightage of quizzes, or increase their number.",
                "Potential weaknesses are the timing on the exams. The midterm in particular left most students without time to finish. HOWEVER, the final was much better paced, so it's likely the instructors already implemented this feedback.",
                "This class was very well explained but could slow down at times.",
                "This class was very good, fruitful, and well-structured.",
                "The strengths of the course are the lecture slides - the definitions of the terms and the explanations of those were clear.\r\nAlso, the discussion sections were very helpful to understand the material from the week. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that the examples in class, done through polls, were not explained very clearly and were hard to follow at times. Also, the midterm exam was unexpectedly difficult (relative to the practice/past midterm exams). It would be very helpful if the lectures were slowed down a bit to allow for students to fully digest the material. Also, even though the problem sets were assigned two weeks before they are due, the lecture material needed to complete the problem sets was only provided one or two lectures before the due date (approximately 1-3 days), resulting in a stressful time to complete the PSETs.",
                "I have numerous complaints about this class. First of all, I do no believe that people coming into this class with no coding or stats experience have a fair experience. It is expected that I would struggle more with problem sets and would face an initial learning curve to coding having no background. However, it is extremely hard to compete for good grades if a substantial percentage of the class has already seen this material before and practised solving similar problems in the past. Furthermore, there were not enough office hours every week, especially when compared to other classes at Yale. This is especially true in the finals period were in intermediate macroeconomics there were numerous pages of office hours links for the finals week, with multiple hours every single day, whereas for econ 117 there was about one hour worth of office hours every day in the final week leading up to the exam. I thought this was unacceptable.",

                "No. While it can be useful, it's probably a better idea to take a stats course and do Econ applications of the material with a peer tutor or your friends.",

                "I would only take this course if you have previously taken a stats course at Yale or AP stats in high school. It puts you at a great advantage over many of your peers, but it's not impossible to do well without that background. I'd also only take this course if I were for sure majoring in Economics.",

Many of the concepts can be somewhat stale at times and probably wouldn't be too interesting for people not interested in economics and statistics. But otherwise, it is a solid course that's required for most economics students anyways.",
                "Yes I learned a lot.",
                "This class will be difficult if you do not have any experience with probability and statistics. If you have taken a stats class before, it won't be so bad, but the class still moves pretty quickly. Overall, I would only recommend this class for someone who needs to take it for major requirements. Otherwise, just take an intro stats class.",
                "Absolutely. Even if you're not majoring in econ, this is a great course to learn statistical thinking and get an insight into the kind of work that social scientists do.",
                "Yes, would recommend. Even outside the econ major, it's a good intro to stats and to using R",

The R coding part of the class is rushed and most of the class is revolved around theory, probability, statistics. That being said, if you want to learn the fundamentals of probability and statistics in a rigorous setting, this course achieves that.",
                "Absolutely not. I think the material was important and I learned a lot but it was a significant struggle due to the bad organisation, bad delivery of material to accommodate students with no background and difficulty to compete with more experienced students.",
