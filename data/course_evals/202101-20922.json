                "This course was very strong overall and there was no way to be a part of the course without being fully engaged. I think the professor did the best job they could with virtual learning using many other online platforms outside of zoom for homework as well during class to provide us with the optimal virtual experience. Oftentimes in class, we would visit different websites such as a website with a map of the world where each of us pinned a place we visited and wrote a description for our classmates to read. Obviously, being a language class it wasn't exactly the same online but I think our professor utilized different internet resources to make up for this.",
                "Strengths are that JAPN 120 follows naturally from JAPN 110 and there is not a significant jump in difficulty, which helps ease the transition. Syllabus also draws from the same textbook, so the material is consistent in both new content and allusions to past lessons. An inevitable weakness was the virtual format, which made it difficult to reach peak levels of engagement, but still a very enjoyable course.",
                "A lot of exposure--I improved without noticing I improved. The writing and grammar exercises were helpful. I was able to practice speaking when I answered questioned during classes. I wish there could've been more vocab exercises--there were a lot of new vocab and we could've practiced them more so that I'd know how to use them better.",
                "I think the only thing I would've changed about this year was if the lectures could be recorded so we could go back and check on some things if we were confused. Other than that I thought it was structured well, and fast enough that we were making progress but slow enough that it wasn't overwhelming."

                "I think the breakout rooms to practice with other students one on one was a nice way to practice or do exercising in a lower stakes environment. I think the different websites were we answered questions or did different posts were also helpful. I appreciated the video homework assignments which were usually fun to do as they were about interesting topics but also allowed us to practice the new concepts we learned.",
                "Having an asynchronous day helped immensely with relieving stress and providing a flexible \"break\" halfway through the week. Regular virtual clinic sessions were very helpful for fielding personal questions and concerns.",
                "The asynchronous classes weren't as help as they could've been. Most of these courses turned into 'shadowing' practices--reading/repeating conversations. It would've been more helpful if we could just reproduce the conversations on our own, with full understanding of the meanings. Sometimes the shadowing would turn into mechanical reproduction of the sound. But everything else was fine.",
                "I think everything worked well, class was very engaging and since the class was so small it wasn't too bad being on zoom, and it was very easy to participate and remain active in class."

Being an L2 language course there is a lot of daily work and especially for Japanese there is always a lot of new vocab and kanji to learn each week but if a student is willing to put in the work they will learn a lot in just a semester.",

                "Yes. This course is what you gotta take if you wanna learn Japanese.",
