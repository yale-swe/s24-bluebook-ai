            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are primarily that it does not ask too much from its students. It has never been a source of stress for me. It is also cool to be exposed to all the amazing resources and collections Yale has. I also liked that the instructor gave the students some choice and flexibility with what collections we choose to visit, and the broadness of the final project allowed the creation process of my own art to be a great introspective experience. However the weaknesses lie in its lack of substance and academic stimulation. I don't feel that I learned anything through the instruction of this course that I could not have learnt by visiting these exhibitions on my own. There is a constant pressure to participate but often students will say anything to fulfill their participation points. Additionally the three hours straight of instruction with no breaks in between on Wednesday afternoons are extremely draining. Quite simply the class was really boring, even for people interested in learning more about art. A lot of the themes from early classes are continuously repeated with not much gain between them, and I'd continuously step out of class feeling like I had gained the amount of knowledge that can be learned in 15 minutes in 3 hours. The course could be improved by having it be divided into two shorter sessions rather than one 3 hours session a week, and by having instructional material with an overarching theme or goal for learning in the class rather than it just feeling like looking at random art collections every week, perhaps by truly tying the artwork back to history of its time rather than just having students form speculative connections based on knowledge they already possess.",
                "The course really challenged me to think deeply about art and the way that I think and process information. Visiting different locations around Yale's campus was fun, as was the exposure to all of the interesting art and artists. One think that I think brought the course down a little bit was meeting only once a week, and for such a long time. Personally, it's hard for me to pay attention to anything for 3 straight hours, and I think breaking class up into multiple days a week (or just having a break halfway through class) would go a long way towards making the class more enjoyable.",
                "A strength of this course is that we went to a variety of art galleries and archives around campus that I otherwise probably would have never gone to before. It was also approachable for someone who had little to no experience with art before, which I greatly appreciated, and even though it had a low workload, I do feel that I learned quite a bit. I think it could be improved by breaking up the three hour class time in some way, either through a break or by having two activities for each class period since sometimes the class felt very long.",
                "Strengths: getting to see many interesting objects and discuss their artistic and historical/societal meaning. Also, dedicating time to using Yale's archives and exploring a new side of Yale. I think that the grading is fair and the system of class note-taking is interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more time/assignments for students to choose objects from archives that they found most interesting and present them in class.",
                "I really enjoyed going to different collections, but I wish we had moved around the collections more and had a bit more freedom. It was a little difficult to sit and pay attention for three hours straight.",
                "Strengths: The Professor is great and the visits to the art galleries and libraries are very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: The 3 hour format with no break in between can be a slog sometimes.",
                "Strengths: go around to all the different collections, great prof\r\nWeaknesses: way too long, focused too much on photography and not other art branches",
                "The entire class is a strength. A weakness is how there are no breaks in class given that its 3 hours long.",
                "Strengths: great instructor, interesting content, exposure to a bunch of great resources and galleries.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3 hours at one go is very tiring, specially without a break"

                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless that student truly has a unique interest for looking at a single collection of art or historical archives for three hours weekly. You will not gain much you could not get on your own by taking personal initiative and exploring Yale's resources. I wouldn't even recommend it as a gut unless you truly do not case about learning from the course and do not mind being bored in class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in getting exposed and introduced to art, but wants to do so in a relaxed on inclusive way. Students who are already interested in art will get a lot out of this class as well.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone interested in art and how art is created since you will spend a lot of time in archives and libraries researching art and thinking about art. For me, three hours was a bit long and at times I got a bit fatigued, but for someone already interested in art or with previous experience, I think it would be a great class that adds variety to and complements traditional lectures or workshop classes. For people with no experience or exposure to art, I would just take a second to make make sure that you are really interested in researching art because enjoying the topic/subjects makes the class period go by much more quickly.",
                "Yes! I think this is a great class and you really get to learn a lot about art and how to really look at it in an immersive and engaging way! It's a great way to get to know Yale's library system and the archives.",
                "I definitely would. It changed my way of thinking about and interacting with art. I learned so much about myself and the world around me.",
                "I would recommend it for learning about the collections, having a free creative space, and taking a break from the academic rigor of your day! It definitely diversified my course load. However, if youre looking for a traditional art course, this isnt really that and is more of a creative exploration.",
                "Yes. This is a great course to accompany a STEM heavy schedule. It is also an amazing opportunity to know the resources Yale has for you outside of classes.",
                "I would recommend this to people wanting to go to arts majors, because this class gives you the freedom to explore whatever you want and the Professor will accept anything that you put as art. For people who arent as artsy, it can be a bit tough.",
                "I highly recommend this class. Its a low workload and a first year seminar worth taking. There is only a final project and thats it. Its a great class for people who like critically thinking about art and people who like speaking up in class."
