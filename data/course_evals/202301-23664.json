                "Noelia is an amazing instructor. Labor intensive but worth it because shes actually very intentional about your improvement",
                "The course content focuses too much on context and it doesn't give us the capacity to practice the skills and grammar addressed in any given unit because there's too much focus on discussing something in depth the way we would be required to in an English literature class. It does develop, slowly, the skill to discuss something deeper than surface level, but I think the course could be better if more class time was spent on establishing a more solid foundation of knowledge and practicing skills before jumping into applying them in complex context.",
                "- strengths: everyone participated, interesting themes\r\n- weaknesses: a lot of work",
                "I really loved how project-based this course was. I think that the supersite felt unnecessary in the learning process.",
                "Strengths: the course is great, but Prof Sanchez-Walker is phenomenal. I dont think I could have had such a great experience without her as my professor. She was so excited to see the students engaging and learning with one another, it was great.\r\nWeaknesses: I truly think if tenses were split between Span 120 and Span 130 they could be learned more successfully. It would allow for a more concrete understanding if more time was spent on every tense instead of running through them and then backtracking the next semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor is very nice, supportive, and helpful for helping develop Spanish skills. There is a good balance of vocabulary that we have already learned and new vocabulary mixed in every lesson. The course starts at the beginning of a Spanish textbook unlike SPAN 120, so all basic concepts are reviewed and more advanced uses of them are covered. Weaknesses: I know that the course being labor-intensive is part of what helps me develop language skills but there were times where the amount of homework felt like busy work. The worksheets seem designed to be completed in-class but there were often times when they were assigned as homework in addition to another worksheet.\r\n\r\nI wish the long-term schedule for the course was road-mapped at the start. Whenever an exam happened, it always felt like we only ever had around a week of notice. There is also somewhat of a disconnect between the content learned in VHL Central and what we actually end up using in class. It felt like VHL Central covered grammar beyond what we were expected to know and use in-class."
