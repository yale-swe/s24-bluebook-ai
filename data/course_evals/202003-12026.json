                "This course was very strong in terms of teaching us vocabulary and grammar of the Arabic language. I loved how interactive this class was too during the synchronous Zoom sessions. I think one way it could be improved however is linking the synchronous meetings more with the readings we have to do for homework, because the grammar rules in the book are sometimes explained unclearly.",
                "I thought the small size of the class was super helpful and gave me lots of opportunities to practice Arabic. I also liked the asynchronous work twice a week and enjoyed the opportunity to engage with the language in that way.",
                "I enjoyed this course because I learned a wide range of introductory beginners Arabic; however, this course was fairly difficult on an online platform because engaging and practicing with students in breakout rooms could be awkward. I also feel as though there were many people who had previous experience with the language, so be aware that it would be very helpful to learn the alphabet and some entry-level vocab beforehand if you hope to be on the same level as your peers. It was very helpful to have the bi-monthly practice with our TF.",
                "Strengths: There were many opportunities in every class that allowed us to practice Arabic and engage with the language, allowing us to apply what we were assigned to learn and practice outside of class in a vocal setting. Most of the activities in class were done in small breakout rooms, which allowed for a more personal environment and allowed us to get to know one another in the absence of the in-person environment. We were required to attend two speaking sessions with the TA of this class per month, which I personally found to help improve my conversational Arabic. Overall, this course was a strong and comprehensive introduction to the Arabic language.\r\nWeaknesses: I would say the only weakness with this course is the distribution of work of this class throughout the semester. The beginning part of this class (learning the alphabet and new vocabulary) required substantially more work than the end of the semester (grammar-based). While the distribution of work was not very balanced, this class was also my first time learning a non-Indo European language, so this could be attributed to just the inherent nature of learning a Semitic language like Arabic.",
                "Strengths: Professor Al Ani was very approachable, patient, and helpful. It was nice that the class only met three times a week instead of every day. Most concepts were self-taught in the homework, which I actually preferred, especially because the classes were early in the morning and not recorded.\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of homework, especially toward the beginning (at least 1-2 hours each night). The weekly quizzes had a lot of vocabulary words on them, which got a little overwhelming when other exams started piling up."

                "I think that the Zoom meetings with the class were very well done, and although it probably wasn't as effective as in-person classes would me, I still was able to learn a lot with the PowerPoints that our professor prepared and the breakout room activities that we participated in. They were a great way to stay interactive with the class and meet our classmates.",
                "I thought speaking practice still worked very well over Zoom and helped me out a lot. I might have preferred to have two longer live seminars a week,  instead of three short ones. I think that might've helped me focus more over Zoom.",

                "The major practice that was implemented in this course in light of the COVID-19 pandemic was the decrease in class periods throughout the week from 5 class periods to 3 class periods. I'm not particularly sure why this practice was implemented, but I do not believe that this was that beneficial for the students. I believe that we may have benefited from the normal 5 class periods instead of being assigned more homework on the days off. In terms of the other aspects of the class, I believe most aspects were able to translate well into the online Zoom format.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because Arabic is a beautiful language, and this becomes even more apparent through this class. It is also a fairly easy language to begin in terms of learning the alphabet and writing it, although pronunciation might be a bit hard to pick up. The professor, however, was extremely friendly and encouraging when we made mistakes and didn't know how to say something. I loved this course and it has made me excited to take future Arabic courses.",
                "Yes! Arabic is such a great language to learn. This class was challenging but definitely worth it, and Professor Al Ani is a great teacher and really sweet person.",
                "I would. If you want to take Arabic, Professor Al Ani is really kind and fun. It is a good amount of work, but not in a way that would dissuade me from recommending this course to anyone. The pace was fast, and it's a lot to take in for just one term, but again, I still really enjoyed it, and highly recommend the class if you have an interest in the language. Don't be discouraged by Arabic's reputation, I haven't heard convincing evidence that it's really much harder than the average L1 language (this is in talking to my classmates taking other L1 languages this same term).",
                "Yes, it's a wonderful way to learn Arabic, especially for those who lack a great deal of self motivation.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to learn a Semitic language and is willing to put the work and effort into successfully learning the language. I believe that if you are not willing to allocate the time necessary to learning Arabic, you will not really get much benefit of electing to learn Arabic in comparison to other languages that may require less time and effort to learn.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think Arabic is a really beautiful language. Yes, the workload was intense, but I feel like I've gained a solid foundation in Arabic."
