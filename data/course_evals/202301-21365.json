Furthermore, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of how financial statements function.

                "very disorganized, slides were old, a lot of unclear directions on each slide",
                "Strengths: low workload\r\nWeaknesses: poor teaching (disconnect between the professor and the students, low attendance as a result), in a corporate finance class I hoped to examine more real life examples rather than being shown various random formulas without context.",
                "Strengths: good content and lots of continuity in lecture Weaknesses: lecture slides are way too long and lots of students get lost in the weeds of mathematical theory that aren't even tested or really relevant in the applications later on",
                "Exams much harder than psets",
                "There was a lot of math but not a lot of practice, and in class, the math problems wouldn't actually be done by hand and would only show up in the slides.",
                "Assessed on application that unfortunately barely gets walked through in lecture. Content is solid and Prof Clayton is very engaging, but the assessment is poor.",
                "The strength is definitely in the material and the way it was taught by Professor Clayton. I found the lectures and the concepts learned interesting. The course can be a bit too theoretical at times with no real practical applications but this got better toward the second half of the course as topics were more centered around numbers and making quantitative analyses. I felt that the exams were way harder and ambiguous than they needed to be. I left both the midterm and final not being very sure whether if what I'd put down was right, which was the same for pretty much all of the class.",
                "Lectures could tie more closely to the types of problems that are on problem sets and exams. Lectures could also tie concepts and equations more closely to case studies.",
                "The subject of the course is very applicable for those who want to go to Investment Banking or Consulting, but the final exam was very hard, far from what we were able to prepare for.",
                "I can honestly not think of any strengths for this class. There was very low engagement across the board and the lecture material was often dense and not engaging.",
                "This course offers several strengths that contribute to a comprehensive learning experience. It covers a wide range of topics within the syllabus, providing a thorough understanding of corporate finance. The workload is relatively low, with only four problem sets graded on completion, allowing for a manageable pace of learning. Additionally, the instructor's jovial disposition creates a positive and engaging learning environment. However, there are certain weaknesses that could be addressed for further improvement. The exams are significantly more challenging than the practice exams and do not closely resemble the homework assignments, which can create difficulties for students. The qualitative nature of the slides could be enhanced with more quantitative content to better assist with completing homework and preparing for exams. Lastly, the instructor's approach of covering too many topics in a single lecture may lead to difficulty in concentration and potential disengagement among students. Addressing these weaknesses by aligning exams with practice materials, providing more quantitative slide content, and structuring lectures to focus on a single topic at a time would enhance the course's effectiveness and improve the overall learning experience.",
                "Could be less theoretical and more practical",
                "Lectures can be made more clear, more\r\nPractice questions in the slides.",
                "you learn very comprehensive theories about finance. a weakness is there isnt much time in class to go through word problems found in problem sets\/exams; it would be helpful if there is some time allotted to that. also, sometimes the slides arent the most consistent (typos, not updated cut-off points for slides that are too long).",
                "Great course",
                "Strengths: Very little unfortunately, I felt I could learn so much more from reading a textbook, speaking to my parents, or even watching a short video.\r\nImprovements: This course couldve been so much better if it was taken far slower and covered less material, but with a lot more focus given to the core concepts. Also, section were almost pointless as the TA did not know the concepts, and OH were only attended because we wanted the problem set answers (which therefore were also only useful during review).",
                "I don't think the class lined up with the psets super well, especially on the 2nd set",
                "More practice! Whether it be more psets or another midterm, I needed to be more engaged, and it was hard to be with a pset once a month.",
                "The course is extremely technical, prior knowledge of corporate finance is required to understand the material presented in class. Would not recommend if not familiar with the material already.",
                "There need to be weekly problem sets. With so few problem sets, students this semester had little inventive to learn weekly content.",

If that interests you, then I'd recommend this class with the goal of C\/D\/F given how absurdly difficult the final was (it was not at all a reflection of what we had learned on psets and the past practice exams we were given) and with a mindset to learn.",

                "It is an interesting economics elective that I think would be worth taking if you are interested in or plan to venture into finance at some point. I would highly recommend taking Financial Economic (ECON 251) before this course because it serves as a great set up to the skills and concepts you'll need to use at some points in this class as well. I would recommend with cautionary advice about how the material can be very theoretical and not directly applicable to what you'll see in real world finance. That aside, you get to learn some interesting things about how corporations work and their overall structure that you would not be able to learn otherwise.",
                "For students interested in finance, this is a good course.",

                "No. If you are planning to take this as an econ elective, please look for another one. Many people will say that it is an easy class with a generous curve and while that is true, it is simply not worth it. You are much better off taking an interesting class and putting in a bit more work instead of taking this class and having to force yourself to find it interesting. If you are actually interested in corporate finance, knock yourself out. Prof. Clayton is very nice, so that is a plus.",
                "Based on the strengths and weaknesses identified, I highly recommend this course, especially for students interested in pursuing a career in finance without prior knowledge in the field. The course covers a wide syllabus, providing a comprehensive understanding of corporate finance, while maintaining a manageable workload with only four problem sets graded on completion. The instructor's enthusiastic and jolly demeanor contributes to an enjoyable learning environment. Although there are weaknesses, such as the challenging exams that differ from practice materials and the qualitative nature of the slides, these can be addressed. Considering the valuable insights and practical skills gained from the course, it is an essential choice for individuals seeking to enter the finance industry.",

As I said, one could easily (and indeed I felt like I had to) learn much more from reading the textbook themselves and watching videos \/ being taught by family friends.",
                "Only if interested in a career in finance.",
                "I would not recommend this course to someone who is looking for a first exposure to corporate finance, it is very technical and the lectures assume a lot of prior knowledge.",

                "No, the lectures were so boring. You could easily have chosen to not attend the lectures and still have passed the class, especially considering barely anything taught in lectures were on the exams. Also the TAs were little to no help so it really sucked.",
