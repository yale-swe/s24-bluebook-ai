                "during the middle of the semester i felt really apathetic towards the course. but after submitting the final paper I actually realized how much this class improved my writing. prof. shirkhani really teaches you to write in a nuanced way. sometimes, without you realizing, she teaches you what works logically in a cultural critique and why ---what techniques and narratives work for a point, and what don't. i didn't realize i was learning at all until suddenly, at the end of the semester, my writing became 10x better. \r\n\r\nalso, prof. shirkhani definitely makes you WORK with the re-drafts. my engl120 feedback/redrafts look so so so silly compared to the amount of redrafting i've had to do for this class. she genuinely challenges you with improving your argument. this class is probably the first class where i've actually sit down for hours not knowing what to write.",
                "Learned what makes a strong cultural point and strategies on how to make one! Learned to atomize research and anecdotes to achieve this",
                "This course was amazing. We read various cultural critiques in different forms. Some were long-form journalism, others were centered around personal anecdotes, others were satirical or humor. We read from a range of writers, who wrote on a range of topics. I found all topics to be interesting, relevant, and thought-provoking. Our class discussions were also very insightful, with Professor Shirkhani clearly having a lot of experience teaching this material. The papers were also super fun and interesting to write. The process of writing a cultural critique really challenged me to think through an issue and dig into its underlying dynamics and assumptions. Professor Shirkhani's feedback and guidance on papers was truly so thoughtful and helpful.",
                "I learned so much about narrative voice and the relationship between writing form and meaning",

                "Prof. Shirkhani is amazing, the articles are super interesting (things you could read in your free time), and the work you produce is really valuable. Could be improved by a little more direction in the conversation and maybe more marked differences btwn the essays.",
                "this course was great and i definitely became a better writer because of it but there are a lot of weaknesses. a lot of the assignments are not specific enough in terms of what they ask you to write... which would be fine, but prof. shirkhani looks for certain things and looks for a specific way of writing a creative essay. we talked a lot about the importance of personal narrative in writing a cultural critique, but towards the second half of the semester it really felt like almost none of the essays were about personal narrative.... so a lot of the model essays studied in class were rendered practically useless in giving us literary techniques to borrow. \r\n\r\nthis isn't so much a weakness... but be prepared to read differently... we didn't really seem to talk about techniques as much when breaking down the readings in the class imo, it felt a lot more like we were breaking down their arguments. \r\n\r\nthe people in the class were cool tho! <3 and prof. shirkhani is really funny",
                "Strengths: Shirkhani is very kind and helpful always. Readings are interesting and enlightening. Workshops are fruitful. \r\nWeaknesses: Having one draft is definitely hard!",
                "Strengths: Professor Shirkhani is an amazing professor and everyone who can take a class with her should absolutely do so. She is so thoughtful in reading paper drafts and meeting with students. Her feedback is truly one of a kind. More than any other professor I have encountered at Yale, I felt that she really thought so deeply about my papers and offered such thought-provoking feedback that pushed my thinking and my writing. She is really really great at picking out ideas in papers and pushing them forward to another line of thought. She also brought up very important ideas in our seminar discussions, encouraging me and other students to examine great writing at the sentence level as inspiration for our own writing. Beyond her wonderful teaching, Professor Shirkhani is a lovely person and her class was always the highlight of my week! The class material was also very well selected and the readings were all on interesting, relevant topics and by great writers. Weaknesses: None!",
                "I gained a lot of insight into the readings from in-class discussions. I also appreciated the very clear, detailed feedback on my writing. However, coming up with my own essay idea was somewhat difficult.",
                "Some of the readings were interesting but many of them were far too long for the majority of the class to have done them for class. This led to certain class discussions being a lot of on-the-spot random thoughts rather than students having done readings ahead of time. \r\nThe prompts were very (too much, in my opinion) open-ended. Since this is a class on Cultural Critique, I felt like the class did not really ever progress into different types or more involved forms of writing."

She is the best professor I have encountered during my time at Yale and will really push your thinking and your writing to improve. The reading for this class is also very relevant and interesting.",
                "Yes. Prof. Shirkhani creates a welcoming classroom environment, and it was great to hear her insights during class discussion.",

                "Personally, I would not recommend this course. I found the readings to not be very interesting (compared to readings in other nonfiction, personal writing classes) and I thought that the writing prompts did not allow us to try different formats or more involved styles.",
                "Yes! Definitely take this class, even if you're not a writer or English major. Writing used to be intimidating for me, but after this class I've definitely become a lot more familiar and comfortable with writing. Prof. Shirkhani is amazing and organizes our readings and seminars excellently."
