Make sure to choose an adviser wisely, however  some professors can be notoriously unreachable/unhelpful. Also know that whoever you choose as an adviser, it will seldom be a priority for them. Don't rely too much on them, and try and develop a wider support network from grad students and friends who can help you along the way."
