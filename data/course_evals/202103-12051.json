The course could be improved by providing more advance notice of assignments, clearer explanation of expectations, and more regular provision of grades/feedback.",
                "The progression through topics is good, ensuring a gradually growing base of words which are consistently used. The cultural topics are also often very interesting, if not directly relevant to actually learning the language. The main weakness is certainly the arbitrary nature of feedback and grading. I often felt as though I was unsure exactly what was going to come up on the test (and sometimes material tested was beyond what we had been told to study), while feedback on performance was often minimal and unhelpful. When I talked to the Professor about this, I would receive generic \"work harder\" advice rather than anything more targeted on how I could practically improve my performance."

This is a course that demands a lot of work and effort and your progress is very limited if you do not spend a substantial amount of your time on the language. I would really not recommend this unless you are intending to major in the subject, or have other classes with a low workload. The time spent is not always because the material is challenging, but rather because of the arbitrary and sometimes scattergun nature of assessment - you always have got to be on your toes."
