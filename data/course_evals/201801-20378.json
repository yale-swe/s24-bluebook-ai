    "This class was a good foundation for the basics of acrylic painting, covering essential topics like color mixing, composition etc. while giving students the freedom to pursue our own projects.",
    "how to make your own canvas, color mixing, critique artwork, painting light",
    "I learned how to look at value and how to use color to bring out value, how to vary brushstroke, how to think about light and what parts of a painting to bring out.",
    "I developed a more refined style of painting and learned a lot about the creative process. The course brought an improvement in some technical painting skills I was lacking prior to taking it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was a lot of fun and the students were given free reign, spending most classes working on our own paintings and receiving guidance from the instructors. Developing your hand and skills requires a lot of practice and so this is the best way to accomplish that. However, I would perhaps have liked to see a little bit more structure and maybe a few lessons devoted to pure instruction rather than just jumping into it every class. Likewise, it would have been nice to have some indication what our grades would be throughout the course.",
    "great course for people who already know how to paint, but the course does not really provide one with \"how to paint\" lessons. We were pretty much just thrown into painting. there was only like 1 assignment outside of class, but I wish we had more or I wish we had to paint a lot outside of class and present our work. I was caught off guard at the end of the course because the instructor decided not to have a final. I wasn't really satisfied with my final project and wish i could have ended with a better painting. but, the strengths: chill, can paint almost anything, free supplies. weaknesses: instructor not present, not enough assignments, no grades",
    "Strengths: helps you develop your own style and critiques help a lot in terms of feedback. Basically how much work you put in determines how much you'll get out of this course. Challenges you to step out of your comfort zone. Professor willing to talk over painting ideas and gives helpful suggestions\/things to think about.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not super structured in terms of a schedule, but most work timeline is determined by you.",
    "Variety was a strength of the course. Most students benefited from the changes in the painting assignments and prompts. Starting with the basics was an efficient way of gauging where people were in terms of painting experience. The course could be improved by more assignments. I think we had too much time to complete an individual painting, and not enough work was generated at the end of the course."

    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course and think that anyone, regardless of artistic background, could take it and learn from it. I think that since the course is largely just you working, you get out of it what you put in.",
    "i'd reccomend this because it's a chill class and mark is a great instructor. but, this isn't for beginners (this is coming from a beginner). there isn't much instruction on how to paint and you're pretty much just thrown into painting. sometimes, we skipped critiques in the beginning of the term so i didn't really receive feedback until the end of the term. i think there was also supposed to be a final, but mark decided to can it, so i was disappointed that i wasn't able to show my full potential at the end of the term. mark wasn't present most of the time, so the TA watched over us a lot. both are great instructors though.",
    "Yes - definitely helps you develop your own style and pick out what you like to paint. I personally found painting really hard at the beginning because I was used to drawing in black and white so a paintbrush and color is a whole different thing. It's a really fulfilling class if you push yourself to be as engaged as possible and really think about your work.",
    "Yes, I had a great time. The paintings, as far as assignments go, were less stressful and demanding."
