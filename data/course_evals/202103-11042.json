                "This was the perfect French class for me; I was able to improve my reading, writing, and speaking skills. The diversity of assigned texts allowed me to learn not only about French literature and literary movements but also about French history and culture. I appreciated that Professor Sanjabi allowed us to submit ungraded first drafts of our essays; this allowed me to hone my writing skills and take greater risks in my essays. Professor Sanjabi's feedback on my writing and on my presentation were very helpful and insightful.",
                "I learned a ton on French literature from the medieval time to the existentialist period. Not only do you read the books, but the professor gives biographies of the authors and context for the time period when the book was written.",
                "I learned how to examined and evaluate more complex texts in french.",
                "For me this class was a very valuable way to introduce myself to reading a survey of French literature (a really well-chosen, moving sample of texts), discussing texts in French, and writing about French literature. While I found this section less discussion-heavy than other literature courses I have taken (in English), we were still able to contribute to the discussionMme. Sanjabi makes it clear she wants us to converse, and she has us present works of our own interest to the class, too! Overall, I learned about different literary movements (modernism, existentialism) and genres (tragicomedy, comedy, memoir).",
                "This course helped me develop skills in speaking and writing in French. I also learned how to think more critically about reading material (in this case, in French), and my reading comprehension surely improved.",

                "Strengths: I really enjoyed all of the works we read. Class discussions were always very thought-provoking, and I always felt comfortable sharing my thoughts with the class. I particularly liked the structure of the course: each class included a short yet comprehensive lecture on each reading, followed by a class discussion moderated by Professor Sanjabi. Professor Sanjabi's feedback on my writing and presentation were very helpful and insightful. Weaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: Professor Sanjabi is great and you will learn a ton of French literature. \r\nWeaknesses: reading is often overwhelming and students seem to forget what happened when discussion comes along and it can be boring at times.",
                "It was sometimes a little hard to engage. It could be improved by having like power points or somethings of the sort.",
                "Strengths: great reading list; wonderful, very knowledgeable professor who poses thoughtful questions and wants to hear your opinion; flexibility of assignments (various prompts for essays + oral + presentation); breadth of texts covered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Sanjabi models her class after the French cours magistral lecture style (our seats face the teacher in rows, as opposed to a seminar circle, and this definitely influences the nature of our conversations), but Prof. Sanjabi still creates an environment of discussion! (Just keep in mind this wont be the same atmosphere as your classic literature seminar because its not really a seminar.) This quality is not necessarily a weakness, just something I had to adjust to, so dont let it turn you off. At times I also felt like it was hard to fully appreciate each author given the large breadth, but again, thats just the nature of the class as a survey\"and it has its advantages, like getting know a lot of wonderful texts. Overall, please take the class!",
                "I think that it was difficult to fully discuss some of the readings within the class period. Some readings would merit more discussion, but we would not be able to discuss them further because class ended. It is possible that a longer class period with a weekly meeting (as opposed to twice weekly) would make the course feel less rushed at times.",
                "This course is amazing the instructor is very cognizant of the needs of each individual student and pushes us to do our best and improve but not in a way that is overwhelming. Extremely well run course.",
                "This is a great course that covers French literature through discussion and deep understanding.",
                "This course was well taught, but it was difficult to complete the readings on time (about a book per class), so I didnt get the most out of the course as I could have if we spent more time on each piece.",
                "One strength of this course was the syllabus organization chronologically reading through the French literary canon was a great way to better understand literary movements and the relationship between the literature and its history. Lectures on historical context and author biographies were mildly interesting and definitely helpful to better understand the texts. The reading load for this course, if completed in its entirely, is quite heavy, but worth it to better be able to engage in class. Participation was a struggle of mine, and discussions were structured in a way that sometimes suggested that there was a 'wrong' or 'right' answer or way to think about a text, which wasn't the most welcoming to students engaging with French literature for the first time."

                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. This is the perfect course for honing reading, writing, and speaking skills in French. The assigned texts are drawn from a variety of different literary movements and time periods and thus represent a great introduction not only to French literature but also to French history and culture. Prof. Sanjabi is a wonderful professor who is thoughtful, dedicated to her students, and incredibly knowledgeable; I believe that this course improved my French skills immensely.",
                "I would recommend this course for the professor and if you want to establish a foundational knowledge of important French authors like Voltaire or Camus.",
                "Yes if you would like to improve overall French reading and writing ability.",
                "I certainly would! Its really perfect for folks who have a basic/good grasp (your personal level doesnt really matter, as youll grow a lot through the texts) of reading and analyzing French literature and wish to jump into (or just get a taste of) French lit. Just note that this isn't really a seminar, and you may be surprised with the structure (everyone faces front of class, 25 min intro by Mme. Sanjabi, not as discussion-heavy as a quintessential small Yale seminar, although she does always encourage it and ask for our contributions very often). These are wonderful authors, and theyll definitely inspire you to read more of their works. Itll open lots of doors, plus Mme. Sanjabi is wonderful and helpful, with a particularly French sense of humor.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student but with the caveat that they are very curious about or already enjoy French literature (that at times proves difficult to read closely). In short, I think it would depend on the student and their preferences, but overall, I would recommend the course.",
                "Yes the instructor chooses very meaningful readings that have lessons applicable to students in the present. The class is run with genuine care.",
                "Yes - it is a good introduction to French texts that allow students to further their knowledge on literature analysis while also improving their French.",
                "Yes, primarily because Professor Sanjabi is a very good professor who wants her students to learn.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students interested in taking their study of French to the next level after studying grammar, language and culture but not literature. However, I wouldn't recommend it to students who don't anticipate being able to complete all of the readings; you get out of this course only what you put in, which is to say, coming to class without having done the reading will be unfulfilling at best and stressful at worst."
