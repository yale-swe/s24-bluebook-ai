                "Strengths - low workload, basic introduction \r\nWeaknesses - could have had better focus on applications; final project was not particularly useful in learning the topics and seemed like busy work",
                "Strength: learn the stuff so you can you use it in your field of choice\r\nWeaknesses: taught really boringly, with very little of the cool geometric visualizations that are possible.  Final project didn't really help us learn anything.",
                "strengths: I learned various application methods, which would be extremely helpful in learning mathematical concepts of data science.",
                "The biggest strength was the professor, James. He's a wonderful lecturer and explainer, and he was very helpful in communicating the best ways to think about concepts. The homework, while sometimes rote, was always helpful towards understanding and the exams weren't huge surprises. The biggest weakness may also be the biggest strength, which was the applications project in lieu of a second midterm. As this was the first time this happened, there wasn't much guidance in how to approach it, which was difficult, but it was nice to not have to worry about another big exam. It would have been helpful for this project to be due a little earlier, though.",
                "It had a really good scope, and the homework was beneficial. I think the course could have really benefitted from more outside resources, especially around exams and midterms (review sessions, study guides, practice exams with answers).",
                "I enjoyed the end of year project and sprinkling of applications throughout, but I wish there could be a linear algebra course that combines applications with proofs of the theorems we learn.",
                "The course adhered to the textbook very well but there really were not many applications as the name suggests. When applications were used, they were token and did not teach how to apply linear algebra to real life situations"

                "I'd probably recommend 225 over this if interested in truly learning the concepts. This felt like a much more computation-based course, and did not cover as many applications as I was hoping.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you have to take it, it's not a lot of work and it's fine, but it's not fun.  Would not recommend if you don't need to take it.",
                "This class is mostly brute forcing algorithms but you gotta do it once",
                "I would recommend this course to students who study data science.",
                "Definitely take this class, especially if it's with James! The workload isn't bad at all, the exams are very similar to the homework, and the focus on applications means you end up thinking about real-world problems in a variety of fields. This is one of the better math classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, but with the note that the class will often need them to use outside resources to learn the material.",
                "Yes I would, it is crucial to have the knowledge learned in this course if one wishes to enter most of the sciences.",
                "This is a good course to learn the basics of how to use linear algebra, I would recommend it only for that purpose. To get a better conceptual understanding of linear algebra, you're better off taking MATH 225."
