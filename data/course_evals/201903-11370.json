    "Learned how to analyze data in depth and create robust experiments that prove what is being proposed.",
    "how intricate the cell is and how so many other things are affected when one protein is mutated ever so slightly. a deeper appreciation for the checkpoints in the cell cycle and in mitosis specifically. an appreciation for some specific proteins that play a key role in the cell cycle. i am now more comfortable reading scientific papers.",

   "comments": [
    "This course was very interesting, but I did not like student presentations that cycled off for each paper every week. Listening to one student lecture on a paper became rather dry.",
    "This course is centered around journal articles, which meant the class provided a great opportunity to build a habit of reading journal articles each week. For someone intimidated by reading dense articles, I found this process helpful in building a mindset to help process information from the literature. A weakness of this course was that sometimes it did not feel like we were challenged to think beyond the scope of the article. Perhaps discussion questions that compare and contrast the articles for each week might be helpful for creating broader discussion.",
    "I really like how students had to present papers because it forced me to speak about scientific material in public and is a skill I didn't expect to develop in this class as much, but I am very happy I did. It was challenging and I didn't know how much of the nitty gritty details of the papers I was supposed to understand. I liked the idea of having to write a grant proposal because I think it is a pretty good way to test out understanding of the material we learnt and ability to apply it to actual research.",
    "I think the class can be made a little more interactive and can a little more guided especially for the final paper. Besides that, jit is a very friendly and welcoming environment that makes learning pleasant."

   "comments": [
    "If you are planning on pursuing research seriously or going to graduate school then yes. The final project is a 16 page proposal. As long as you are genuinely interested in what you are writing about it is manageable.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I do not believe that there are many courses which offer an opportunity to get your feet wet with reading research articles. The format of each classes revolves around presenting and discussing the literature, which I found helpful; I felt like I got better at being selective with which pieces of information were truly relevant.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to a student who has a strong background in research."
