                "I learned how to use a printing press, how to make linocuts, how to arrange text, and basic methods of bookbinding, as well as basic knowledge of the history of typesetting.",
                "I learned about the letterpress tradition, and mostly the more hands-on part of it, like setting type. We also covered a little of the history of printing, but very little of it.",
                "This course offered an invaluable opportunity to learn how to use a printing press, and develop knowledge regarding typographic aesthetics and sensibility. Professor Marsolais offered one-on-one guidance for each project, which made the experience so engaging!",
                "Learned about the resources available to us! Printing press, Center for British Art, and professors and professionals in the field! Really enjoyed incorporating linocut illustration with typesetting!",
                "I learned about the history of the printing press and how to use one. I also learned about the development of Western letterforms, particularly in the Roman and pre-Roman period. The course developed my attention to detail as well as my ability to improvise with the given resources, and it definitely challenged my patience.",
                "I learned out to set type, how to use a letterpress printing press (both the Vandercook, C&P and proofing press), although I'm not sure if I would be able to operate any of these presses by myself. I also learned design principles and how to best use space to convey meaning. The more theoretical concepts that you learn in the class can be used in realms outside of the press room."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: this is a hands-on class. If you want practical knowledge more than knowledge of history or theory, this is the class for you. The professor is also extremely helpful and willing to spend one-on-one time outside of class to help students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class could be a bit more rigorous. I think clearer and firmer due dates would motivate people to come by the press on their own time, which would allow us to complete more projects in a semester. It might also help to mandate some number of hours for students to spend in the press outside of class.",
                "Strengths were that it was a very fun class to be in, and wasn't a stressful commitment.\r\nWeaknesses were that the teacher was new and so the class was a little unorganized, meaning we didn't complete many projects.",
                "The best part about this course was the chance to receive such personalized instruction from Professor Marsolais. He strongly emphasized a hands-on experience with the printing press, which I think was the best way for me to make tangible progress on creative projects. Professor Marsolais also included exciting lectures and demonstrations that complemented the more menial and mechanical steps required in the printing press. There were sometimes a few issues with class timing and organization, but I think that this was largely due to the short time block of the class period, and overall it did not hinder the class experience.",
                "Typesetting is not accessible, so I'm very grateful for being able to take a class on it this semester! Jesse is a professional in the field, so he knew a lot of tricks and tips that really helped move things along for me (such as the carbon paper impression). However, because the syllabus required us to move at a faster pace, some of us ultimately did not have time to finish our projects...",
                "Strengths - engaging with an actual printing press and getting to see the Yale Center for British Art's collection of old books definitely informed my aesthetic as a designer, as I've always been drawn to vintage-inspired pieces. The assignments can be really fun and fulfilling if you typeset something that's meaningful to you. Professor Marsolais is also very passionate about his work, which is great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course wasn't that well organized so it was hard to be motivated until the very end, especially because there's such a steep learning curve. At times, the course feels less creative than an actual graphic design class and more like repetitive labor, which can be nice for de-stressing during finals but also frustrating during the rest of the semester. It would have been nice to learn more about graphic design history etc or even to have more specific assignments to help inform our creative process.",
                "Strengths: Prof is incredibly passionate about both the subject and the class and he is willing to devote a ton of time outside of class to students who put in the effort. It is interesting learning about the history of printing. You will never have the chance to take a class like this again! \r\nWeaknesses: The pacing of the class could be improved. Many of the students felt rushed to complete the major benchmarks of the class (there are three main projects throughout the semester). Additionally, a clearer introduction at the beginning of the term of each step of the printing process (maybe accompanied by a handout for future reference) would have been helpful. I didn't feel like I really understand how to operate the press until the last few weeks of the semester."

                "Yes, absolutely. I always looked forward to class and often stayed late to wrap up my projects. You're not explicitly required to come to the press outside of class, but you are going to want to.",
                "Yes, definitely. It was very fun and interesting. It's a very unique class, so it's an opportunity to take it.",
                "Yes, take this class! It is such a unique experience, and with Professor Marsolais, it was an incredibly fun class, where I could incorporate a lot of individual ideas for each project. I learned how to prepare text for printing, as well as art pieces that we could make on our own. I got to learn about the origins of typography through lectures, as well as exciting demonstrations by Professor Marsolais that included calligraphy and even marble carving! I also got to look at old manuscripts in the Center for British Art, which created such a well-rounded experience. Overall, I am so glad that I took this class Professor Marsolais was such a kind and supportive teacher. And, as a book fanatic, this satisfied all the little niches and gave me such a special skill set that I can continue to use as I access the press in future years!",
                "YES! You learn a lot about a hidden art form that you might never have had the opportunity to be exposed to!",
                "Only if you have at least a little graphic design experience and are fairly confident with typography, and/or if you really just like the look and feel of letterpress. It could potentially be very frustrating if you're not confident working with typography, because typesetting takes so long that you don't have much time to drastically change a design once you've committed to it.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in design! I looked forward to designing projects and executing the book project. I think the structure and pacing of the class is only going to get better because this was Jesse's first semester teaching the course!"
