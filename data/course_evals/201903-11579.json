    "I learned about how the office of the presidency has changed over time in the US.",
    "Patterns and themes that haunt the presidency; very new perspective",
    "I learned a great deal about the history and development of the presidency. The highlight of the course was Professor Skowronek's structure of authority.",
    "This course influenced how I think about politics today, especially during this 2020 presidential election. It changed how I read the news and provided me with the historical perspective to better engage with politics today. It was a comprehensive overview of the history of the presidency and led up to theories of how the presidency operates today."

   "comments": [
    "A powerpoint or other visual aid during the lecture may be helpful for visual learners during the lecture portion of the class.",
    "Professor Skowronek has an incredible wealth of knowledge, but without slides or notes to follow in class, it was hard to engage and retain information from him. The final exam essay questions were very intellectual and perhaps beyond the level of undergraduates in this course.",
    "No visuals, nothing on canvas besides readings",
    "Prof. Skowronek clearly knows a great deal about the material, and is an engaging lecturer. The TF was also great. I think that perhaps at times the assigned readings were too long, which made it difficult to know exactly which material to focus on.",
    "The strengths of this course were that it was well organized and it was a comprehensive overview of the topic of the presidency. Another strength is that when I took it there were only 10 students in the course which made it a less formal atmosphere and allowed us to engage during lecture more. If there was a weakness it seemed like there was never enough section time to cover all of the material in class and so you were not always sure you were getting the right insights from the readings."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the professor is a leading scholar in his field and provides a really important grasp of the intricacies of the presidency, especially during our current turbulent political era.",
    "only if severely interested in the presidency, otherwise this class will drive you insane",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Both Prof. Skowronek and the material were very engaging.",
    "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course. I would venture to say every student should take this class before graduating college. The knowledge, history and analytical perspectives provided in this course are critical to understanding the politics of the presidency and should be known by every young adult in this nation. Professor Skowronek guides you through the nuance and controversies of the Constitution, then into a mesmerizing series of lectures on the history of significant presidents and swaths of time. He then explains the mind-boggling organization and expansion of the executive office, a knowledge critical to understanding our nation and those who lead it. He finishes surveying the most prominent theories on presidential leadership, a progression students are extremely well prepared for, ending with his own theory of presidential leadership that dominates scholarly presidential work. This course is an absolute gem, necessity and joy. This is a must-take course covering one of the most polarizing positions in American politics, critical for all citizens to understand, and an incredibly opportunity to learn from one of the most prominent scholars in the world.",
    "I would 100 percent recommend this course to another student. Professor Skowronek is a good lecturer and the content of the course is interesting."
