                "Weaknesses: The essay prompts were vague and hard to understand. The readings were sometimes dry and very dense, and many didn't add to our papers. The feedback was timely, but sometimes too pedantic. The course grading was too harsh for an intro writing class, and not very standardized across English 114 classes.\r\n\r\nStrengths: The seminar-style of the class offered chances for lively discussion and engagement.",
                "It would have been nice to focus more on writing techniques during class, which would be more helpful in improving my writing.",
                "This course was well-structured.",
                "Weakness - sometimes felt too intense, everyone was silent in class and no one spoke up. Professor did not do a great job often to dissipate this tension.",
                "The course had a wide and interesting selection of readings that I really enjoyed discussing.\r\n\r\nSometimes the discussions could be a little low-energy or dry.",
                "Strengths: There are often very engaging topics and discussions in this class; since the topic is rather contemporary, it lends itself to humor which can be extremely fun, yet we still discuss the necessary linguistic topics that allow for that humor to exist. The course material was also very diverse, which was great! \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings are a bit dense, which dissuades people from reading them. Otherwise, the course is great!",
                "I think the variety of content is definitely a strength, as well as the way that writing assignments develop over the course of the semester to become bigger or more intense. I think the course could be improved through a stronger integration of writing assignments and class content, although I do think the course already does a good job of that.",
                "strengths: the topic is inherently interesting, especially to gen z. the conversations were relatable.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the class had a lot more potential. the readings weren't the most engaging and felt a bit out-dated. i didn't feel like i was critically thinking about internet language. essay prompts were weird and difficult to write about.",
                "Strengths: Obviously, the topic is interesting to many in various different wayseach student engages with memes, fandom, and the internet in vastly different ways, giving diverse opinions. Feedback from Holt was helpful and consistent. Most of the journal articles we read, especially in the second half of the semester, were extremely interesting and yielded some amazing discussions. Holt was very agreeable, you could tell that she was very passionate about linguistics and that she was truly trying to help you. We got a lot of freedom in our writing assignments, which was nice. \r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions were either extremely interesting or mind-numbingly boring, and this was due to the readings we would be assigned. We spent the majority of the first half of the semester doing readings on linguisticsthese readings were unnecessarily convoluted to the point where they were nearly impossible to comprehend without an underlying knowledge of linguistics, which many in this introductory English class did not have. As such, most of the class was spent trying to figure out what the reading was actually trying to get across instead of engaging with those ideas. Picking different readings on the same subject, finding abridged versions, or simply cutting these readings altogether would have greatly improved the class. Additionally, Holt, while a gem, can be boring at times during class. She would often go on linguistic tangents that were barely related to our days discussionthese tangents no doubt would come out of a passion for linguistics, but she would attempt to explain things that were relatively advanced in the world of linguistics without giving us any basic knowledge. While it was apparent that Holt had a lesson plan for every class, when she would go on these tangents, 1. we would run out of class time and 2. we wouldn't be able to understand what she was trying to teach us because she had not planned to teach it and was going off of her head on the blackboard.",
                "Strengths: English 114 is a well-structured class with a manageable workload and engaging seminar style. Professor Holt was always willing to answer questions and provide feedback, and her commitment to the class helped us all to become better writers.\r\nWeaknesses: The writing assignments were vague and difficult to interpret.",
                "This class was very well-oriented around student-led discussion. Much of what we read the night before would be seamlessly integrated into the conversation."

I feel that I would have enjoyed the class much more if I was well-versed in the internet and in linguistics, not just one or the other. As a person who is chronically online, I really only enjoyed the parts of the class that focused heavily on social media and was bored and frustrated during the portions of the class that focused on linguistics.",
                "This course focused heavily on linguistics, and less so on internet communication. Because I am not so interested in linguistics, I did not enjoy the readings and class discussions. However, a person who is passionate about linguistics would enjoy this course. Professor Holt was an amazing instructor and helped me to become a better writer.",
