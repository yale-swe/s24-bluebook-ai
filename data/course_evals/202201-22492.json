I developed comfort with talking about the wave function. A lot of particle physics stuff I took for granted, I got a foundation for. But of course, as everyone else might tell you, no one in this class really felt they learnt something new in lecture.

In addition to learning how to work with the formalism of quantum mechanics, I learned how to describe phenomena such as electron tunneling, the Pauli exclusion principle, fermion degeneracy pressure and the formation of electron and neutron stars. We explored common problems and the mathematical tools used to solve them, including the generation of coherent states, finite generators of translations and rotations, the BCH relation, and the Pauli-Euler identity.",

                "It was sad to take a course this bad on a topic so interesting. The Professor does not lead an organized lecture. The psets are not related to what is done in class. The psets, especially in the beginning, are extremely tedious. He made very little effort to explain the importance or significance of anything we did.",
                "I had fun in lecture, SKL's life stories were very interesting. That said, I feel that this course was very disorganized as it felt like we were jumping between random topics with no clear path. The course could be improved by having a lecture-by-lecture syllabus and by stating the purposes of lecture at the beginning of each lecture on the whiteboard.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Prof Lamoreaux is a very friendly guy, and always makes time to try to answer questions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Very confusing lectures\r\n- Unhelpful problem sets. Just long and repetitive. \r\n- Felt like a confusing linear algebra class. The only thing that was really taught was math, which anyone who took linalg already knew. The quantum stuff was just sort of assumed.",
                "The course started out well when we closely followed the book, but the Professor decided to stop following the book after the midterm and the class lost a lot of structure. The class could be improved by him either writing his own material from the get go like he transitioned to later or just following a textbook.",
                "Course content is strong. The biggest weakness is we dropped the book halfway through and never got another comparable reference.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lamoreaux is pretty forgiving and understanding. Both of the exams were easy and if necessary, getting extensions on problems sets wasn't an issue. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Griffiths' third edition wasn't great, and SKL wasn't afraid to share this sentiment. Oftentimes I felt like the math in the textbook was way too intense and SKL's notes were more informative. Also, I feel like quantum mechanics is hard to teach in general, but I feel like I hadn't absorbed a lot of information this semester.",
                "Very disorganized teaching. Having lecture notes ahead of time would be helpful",
                "I think the biggest weakness was a lack of clarity surrounding the expectations for what we should know. At times the we followed the book very closely, but other times we'd veer off considerably, spend a bunch of time with something else, and then have that thing not meaningfully appear on the exams. The psets were also a ton of work time-wise, and often times there'd be multiple (long) problems from the book that felt like they were teaching pretty much the same thing.",
                "The strengths were the professor's dislike of high-stakes testing and personal anecdotres, the weaknesses were almost everything else. The psets were so long that I never had time to actually think about them, and ended up just scribbling to get points. The lectures weren't very helpful. I appreciated that he went over the homework in class, but oftentimes he did it in convoluted or unhelpful ways.",
                "Would have been great if the professor would provide lecture notes, the lectures didn't really align with where we were in the book, the PSETs were ungodly long - maybe twice as long as the PSETs of other physics courses, and he didn't really take into account our feedback about how long we spent on them. The topic is fascinating, but at times it was very hard to follow the lectures.",
                "The course strayed way too far from the textbook which made it difficult to understand things.",
                "Strengths: Awesome book (entertaining, conversational, organizedalthough a little too basic), very easy grading (although a little too demotivating), funny professor (although a little too disorganized), fantastic TAs (although a little tooperfect? I like em!), great HW problems (although a little too time-consuming and annoying), and of course the fact that it is QUANTUM MECHANICS (although a little too uncertain)!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Enough said. But Ill add. Apart from infinite digressions and monologues in lecture, I have major qualms about psets. Professors should write up their own problems. Almost (if not literally) everyone was copying off solutions from the manual. This is demotivating. TAs are rendered useless in a class where they should have been flooded with questions. I hate it when professors assign problems from textbooks, ugh!",
                "PSETs generally had interesting problems, I felt like it spent too much time on basic math.",
                "Strengths: the Griffiths textbook. If it weren't for this, I would have come away with terribly little from this course. Weaknesses: As wonderful as Prof Lamoreaux seems as a person, his teaching is often chaotic, and often fails to stress what should be the main points of each lecture. Furthermore, the problem sets in this class are unnecessarily tedious and not well designed; there are definitely better ways of reinforcing the concepts taught in class. Finally, since the exams were guaranteed to be the same as the 'study guides' provided earlier, there was little incentive to actually comprehend any of the material taught in class, meaning that many of us students are leaving this class with very little understanding of quantum mechanics itself.",
                "The course had more weaknesses than strengths. The lectures tended to be somewhat confusing, without a clear goal or exercise in mind. There seemed to be a heavy focus on specific examples and applications without enough explanation of what was actually going on. In short, it seemed like a fair amount of comfort with the subject matter was assumed, which was not the case with me. However, the office hours and TAs, as well as professor Lamoreaux, were very helpful. The PSETs were demanding but normally good. Some questions not from the book could be quite confusing.",
                "Lectures were not very helpful and often scattered. They were not correlated well with the textbook.",
                "Strength: Griffith is a decent textbook\r\nWeakness: I wish the course were more conceptual and focused more on physical understanding rather than math without context",
                "This course has potential but I think it could be better organized. The main problem was that the professor didn't actually like the textbook he chose, so our lectures didn't match with the textbook and the psets were kind of all over the place. This was detrimental to our learning and understanding. However, with a lot of engagement from the student and self-study, it was possible to get a lot out of the course both from the prof's lectures and from careful\/selective readings of the textbook.",
                "Strengths were comprehensive, weakeness was that the instructor was sometimes hard to understand, and that the textbook used was sometimes unclear.",
                "This is a very strong course for anyone interested in Physics, and a great one for math, chemistry, and CS majors to learn about one of the frontiers in modern physics and some of its strangest consequences. One of the strengths of this course is the real-world phenomena that can be understood with this formalism. The primary weakness of this course was the textbook. Griffiths quantum mechanics is at times vague and hard to follow, and in the future I might recommend using a different textbook.",
                "First few psets are extremely long, painful, and boring. Later psets are mostly disconnected from material in the book. Classtime was mostly spent going over pset problems, so we were required to teach ourselves from the book. Personal opinion but Griffiths QM sucks, so that didn't help. The very little I learned from the class I don't know how they relate to each other or to QM in general.",
                "Strengths: Flexible deadlines, very transparent about what is on midterm\/final\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures difficult to follow (mistakes in work on the board), written problems unclear at times, tedious algebra for no reason"

                "Yes if you need it for the major",
                "Lamoreaux's quantum mechanics could definitely be a slog and at times you'd feel like you have no idea what's going on, but the exam prep was really useful, so grades wise I wouldn't be worried. If you legitimately need a deep and complete understanding of quantum mechanics, though, I don't think that's something you're guaranteed to get.",
                "Lamoreaux isn't teaching this again, so it doesn't really matter. The homework was brutally long and very inconsistent in topic, but his tests might be worth it. Lamoreaux is really just focused on having you learn by doing, and he helps by telling you how to do them. With that said, he's not good at explaining things. The highlight of the class was his little asides and personal stories.",
                "You'll get an intro to QM but it was difficult and convoluted to follow along. If you want to read the textbook (a great textbook) then you'll learn stuff, but it's not necessarily the same stuff that is covered in the lectures. The class itself was interesting and entertaining, but I'm not sure if I'd recommend it.",
                "It's required for the major so you have to take it anyway. The assessments were a joke - ridiculously easy. You could probably get by learning barely anything if you choose not to care. That being said, Prof Lamoreaux is a genuinely interesting guy and really cares about this stuff, so it will be a fun class.",
                "If its the easy-A SKL, but you want to learn quantum, sure take it, but self-study. You can get an A without understanding much. Thats no benefit for you, since youre very likely not a pre-med or pre-law who needs easy perfect grades. Without a strong grounding in QM, youre no fun as a physics student. For the math majors out there, brace yourselves. If its your first physics class at Yale, expect no explanation of a Hamiltonian or Dispersion.",
                "Take it when someone else is teaching it. Even though Prof. Lamoreaux is clearly brilliant and means well, his lectures weren't very helpful, I mostly read the book to understand things.",
                "If you're an intensive Physics major, you have to take this course, although hopefully Professor Lamoreaux will not be teaching it next year. Quantum mechanics is such a cool topic, and if this course were better taught and assessed, I'm sure it would very enriching.",
                "This course is required for the intensive physics major, so most people won't have much choice. However, for those who do not have to take it, I would not recommend this class.",
                "Not unless required.",
                "I would, with the caveat that you have to be willing to take responsibility for your own learning. The experience in this class really depends on the professor you take it with, and I've heard that all the profs who teach this class have their own flaws and particular methodology, so definitely be prepared to make some adjustments and be flexible with your expectations.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand quantum mechanics better and doesn't like sleeping.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. This course is crucial for understanding much of modern physics.",
                "Don't take it with Lamoreaux",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student because I feel like I was learning primarily from the Griffiths textbook and online youtube lecture series. However, SKL is a character and will definitely leave you with some interesting stories and hilarious comments so I guess there's that. Also this is a required course for the physics major so I suppose if you're a physics major I would recommend it."
