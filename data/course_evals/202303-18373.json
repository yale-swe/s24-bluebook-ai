Alert students to not schedule conflicts with discussion section during registration.",
                "Daniel and Ryan were great! Super efficient communication and thorough explanations. The class was based on lecture slides, which aren't too exciting. But, the Daniel's interactive questions, problem-sets, and open-ended midterm and final projects were all super engaging. This is not a course that is going to teach you how to code in R. Daniel and Ryan were both super helpful when it came to coding questions in office hours or via email, but you'll have to learn it on your own. However, the coding tasks were never impossible. \r\n\r\nMy only issue was that, towards the end of the course, we were slightly off schedule and had to push deadlines closer together. The only problem with this was that, given all my other final assignments, I couldn't explore my final project in depth. \r\n\r\nBut overall, a great course that combines statistics with real world application!",
                "A strength of the course is that because the problem sets are done in R, I definitely left the course with working knowledge of how to do something in R in the future, and how to go about doing something I don't know how to do. However, there were a lot of learning pains throughout the course because the lectures focus heavily on the stats content rather than R (though the code is available in the slides \/ there is some explanation). Because of that, I think the structure of the course is both a strength and a weakness."
