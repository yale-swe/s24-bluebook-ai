                "I really liked how we got to learn how these mathematical concepts are applied to other subjects and the basis of many formulas we learn. It felt a lot less theoretical than a lot of other math classes. However, problem sets were sometimes a bit long and grading on the problem sets happened a bit slowly, so it was hard to see if you had a good grasp on everything.",
