The readings were all very manageable, and for the most part enjoyable.",

                "Strengths: Wonderful variety of readings! \r\nNo weaknesses! Professor Abedin adapted wonderfully to Zoom and it made for a lovely virtual classroom experience.",
                "I really liked the reading material! \r\n\r\nUltimately, however, class discussions got quite monotonous. I wish we had different types or formats of discussion. We never did Breakout Rooms or group activities, role-play or debates. It was all large group discussion and there were some really long, awkward pauses. More diverse discussion format and much more specific, guided questions would be great.",
                "Strengths: lively discussion and intricate thoughts, interesting readings and broad range of topics covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt ill-prepared coming into the seminar with my knowledge of the US healthcare system and health insurance\/public health policies which made some of the readings difficult to understand because I had to spend time to dig deeper, discussions aren't heavily moderated which might be a strength or weakness (my classmates had wonderful ideas and I was always very engaged with what they had to say), but I can see how that might be difficult to keep track of the concepts if you're stuck with classmates who like to go off tangent",
                "I really liked how Professor Abedin emphasized seminar discussion and having the students create a dialogue amongst one another. That's definitely something hard to do in a virtual setting, but I think the way we went about it was successful. The texts she picked for the course were also well thought out -- I especially liked how she grounded the themes of the semester in the book Healthcare for Some by Beatrix Hoffman.",
                "Strengths: Readings for each week aligned well with topics covered and allowed for cross-interpretation with ideas and knowledge from other classes etc., Primary source analyses were structured enough to provide a starting point but not so limited that the assignment was boring, final paper was very open and could be adapted to whatever topics related to health that you're interested in; professor is very understanding of virtual learning issues and allowed asynchronous participation and one-on-one meetings rather than synchronous seminar discussion and also provided guidance on assignments when requested\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Super important material, great readings (and a manageable amount each week), knowledgeable and approachable instructor, and discussions in class were always engaging and respectful (unlike in some classes where it's just a few people talking the whole time)",
                "Professor Abedin gave us a lot of space for discussion and really allowed us to dive into the readings.",
                "Strengths: It's really broad, and it will help you understand our contemporary mental healthcare landscape. I really enjoyed this class, and I learned a lot, and applied some of these course concepts to my other classes this semester. Professor Abedin is also SO KIND. She was probably one of the most self-aware professors I've ever had and her presence really tied the whole class together. \r\nWeaknesses: There was a lack of mental healthcare topics which would be interesting to explore in later semesters.",
                "The readings were really relevant and it was also a very manageable reading load. I also liked that we integrated a library session to learn more about the research tools that were at our disposal. I also appreciated the fact that we all got the chance to speak during discussions."

                "I liked the virtual library session, but nothing really beats an in-person library session (which can't be helped really). I think the session was really good for it being virtual, and although I wasn't able to find the resources I needed through the session, it was good to know where I should be looking the next time I have to look for resources.",

I really like the two small assignments we had done, and I think I would have appreciated maybe another one of those, and a end of term research paper that was shorter, because it felt hard to concentrate on getting that big piece of work done (I had one class though that wanted a 20 page research *proposal*, so this was definitely not the worst in that regard).",

                "Absolutely! This course is a must-take for anyone who wants to go into medicine or public health.",
                "Yes! The workload is typical of HSHM seminars and topic matter is very interesting. I can't speak on in-seminar discussion as I participated asynchronously due to wack time zone difference but Prof. Abedin is very knowledgable and strives to make sure each student gets the most out of the class, even with situations like never actually being in class with peers. The primary source analyses and final paper allow you to pursue any interested related to healthcare for specific populations that aren't necessarily discussed explicitly in class and the readings set you up to think about several other areas of the history of healthcare in the U.S in situations beyond what is discussed in class. The overarching questions outlined on the syllabus summarize the course of the class quite well and the class changed my way of thinking about what health means beyond healthcare.",
                "Yes! Important material, which will give a good overview of both the general US healthcare system's history and the more personal experiences of people trying to survive within that system. What you learn will be really frustrating, but also really essential to interpreting many specific issues we hear about today. Professor Abedin is also great: she was super knowledgeable about the content, asked thought-provoking questions to facilitate discussion, and, because she's a physician herself, I appreciated that her analyses often tied history to the modern, immediate realities of the healthcare system.",
                "Yes, definitely take this course if you can get it! It is supr interesting and professor Abedin is awesome.",
                "Yes! Professor Abedin is extremely kind and has a lot of useful commentary throughout the course. If you're interested in healthcare even slightly, this course has enough material to keep you hooked, and to deepen and further develop your interests. I didn't know anything about the Office of Economic Opportunity, for instance, but now that's a topic that I want to more deeply explore.",
                "Yes, absolutely! If you're interested in medicine or healthcare this class is especially relevant for contextualizing the field."
