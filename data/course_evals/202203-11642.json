I came into this class because I knew very little about American Healthcare and even less about economics and I can now say I'm pretty confident in being able to explain a lot about health care in the US! We learned content from types of hospitals, the market, health insurance, health care access, health care reform, physician\/nursing labor and reimbursement, pharmaceuticals, the FDA, and about 5-6 highly qualified guest lectures that gave insight on topics that complimented the class really well!

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the paper is interesting because you get to pick the topic \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tests require lots of memorization from slides that can be confusing; pretty much need to go to class to fully grasp material",
                "Strengths  an absolute gem of a professor. Prof Forman is so unique. He's a practicing radiologist, so he can speak to that side of medicine, but he's also had lifelong chronic illnesses that have put him on the patient side, so he really truly understands medicine from all angles. He's also hilarious and very engaging. The readings are not too long and are quite interesting, and the exams are very fair. Lots of memorization but that's kind of the point.\r\nNo weaknesses. Incredible course.",
                "Strength - always interesting. Guest lecturers were incredible. I love how it was presented.",
                "One of the strengths of the course is that it is a very minimal workload. The most work that you do is preparation for exams and writing the final paper, but on a week-to-week basis, it's barely anything. Also, lots of great guest lecturers. In terms of weaknesses, it did feel a bit disorganized. I think Howie often made assumptions about what students knew and jumped to talking about more advanced topics without providing a simple foundation to start with, so it felt kind of difficult to follow along at times. This could be improved by clearly outlining what's going to be discussed. I remember there was one lecture where we discussed the financing of Medicare Part C (Medicare has four parts A, B, C & D), and only at the end of the lecture did he mention that he was talking about Medicare Part C. So basically just being more organized in how information is presented would be helpful.",
                "The course covers a lot of really interesting topics. It may seem disorganized, but as its covering an overview of health economics as field, its make sense and doesnt detract from the course. Howie and the team organized things very well and worked together effectively. The guest lecturers were a real treat!",
                "The lecturing is horrible, so much useless information is thrown at you and it is presented in a way that makes it almost impossible to remember anything. TA's were rude and not looking to help or accommodate student learning.",
                "Howie is a great lecturer and the course if very organized. The review sessions were great. I wish there had been more guidance on the final paper, though.",
                "Professor Forman is great and adds very unique insights as a professor, physician, former senate aid. I wish the discussion post responses from Professor Forman were released in real time because that would really help clarify information as the course progressed.",
                "Awesome class. Well organized and interesting throughout. Howie's a fantastic lecturer. I thought the material on exams was sometimes too focused on trivial facts rather than big picture questions but otherwise, huge fan.",
                "Strengths - Prof is really good and smartest person I've seen teach a class, not much work outside of exams + paper; paper is cool; fast grading \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the TA's would often give misleading\/incorrect\/contradictory information in review sessions; exams were incredibly arbitrary (it might pick a really really small thing that the professor said in class, and make it worth 4-5% of an exam via an MC question - i.e. what did the BBA of 1997 do on residency caps); Sometimes Howie is a bit confusing because he goes fast and jumps over the place (and goes on tangents on random examples)",
                "Strengths: content is well organized in slides, professor is very well informed, exams are reasonable, the paper was a bit difficult for me to write but I haven't gotten my grade back so maybe I did well? \r\nWeaknesses: I honestly really like the format of this class, if anything maybe more guidance on the paper?",
                "The course is extremely memorization heavy and exam content is heavily reliant on what howie disucsses in class.",
                "Easier tests less specific",
                "The content was taught very quickly at time with some knowledge assumed. Would be helpful to restructure the slides to reflect the content Professor Forman speaks about",
                "Strengths: Professor cares about making sure our questions are answered, Arya was very knowledgeable in review sessions and on class material, the module exams were very fair and felt accessible. Weaknesses: final paper felt like it was very loosely connected to the class -- honestly would have preferred more guidance regarding this. Would have liked to have real-time access to our discussion posts and feedback while we were in the class.",
                "The course content was very interesting, and it was great that we had such a wide variety of impressive guest speakers. However, I did not find myself to be very engaged with the material, as the professor did not teach off of his slides, we were not assessed frequently (other than with two midterms), and the biweekly discussion posts felt more like a chore than rewarding. I also wish that there had been more guidance on the final paper, as it counted for a lot of the grade, and I lost points on metrics that I did not realize I was being assessed on.",
                "Strengths - guest speakers \r\nWeaknesses - exam content is surprising",
                "Strengths: When studying for the exams, the material came together. Howie is a great person and brings in phenomenal lecturers. \r\nWeaknesses: The exams require you to remember everything he has said in class. Lots of memorization, which is hard because his lectures can be hard to stay engaged with.",
                "Strengths: The content and guest lectures\r\nWeaknesses: Everything elseESPECIALLY the teaching staff. Professor Forman was extremely passive aggressive during office hours. He was always extremely condescending towards me and acted like I was dumb for asking certain questions. Once (on Thanksgiving day), I woke up early to attend his 9 AM office hours. He told me he would get to me by 9:20 since there was someone else in front of me. He didnt get to me until 9:50, and at 9:54 he asked me to hurry up and that he needed to wrap up after I had waited 50 minutes for him. The TA Arya was also condescending whenever I asked questions during exams.\r\n\r\nTA Erin was the same thingextremely condescending. Once I asked Professor Forman a question after lecture and while I asked it she was just shaking her head. Whenever I asked her clarifying questions on Zoom review sessions she would either ignore my question and answer someone elses or just plain answer it wrong, and Arya or Professor Forman would have to answer it correctly. During the final exam when I tried to ask her a clarifying question, she never made eye contact with me and rudely asked me what do you even mean. Shes being rehired next year apparently, so good luck to all the students next year.\r\n\r\nSame with TA Pranamcondescending!! I tried to ask him clarifying questions when I received my first exam back. The entire time he never made eye contact with me and just said this was in the lecture instead of explaining the reasoning to me. When we were walking out of lecture and talking, he walked ahead of me and talked, again never making eye contact.\r\n\r\nIve just felt extremely neglected and mistreated as a student in this class. Im not sure if it was just me, just it certainly felt like it sometimes, when Professor Forman or Erin would happily joke and answer others questions. I enjoyed learning the content, but I wouldnt do it because of how miserable I felt because of the teaching staff. Its horrible.",
                "The course was interesting, and provided a good overview of public health and its economics. However, the course could be improved with clearer slides. The first two exams were fair, but the final exam seemed to test niche questions that were not a great representation of what was important to takeaway from the course.",
                "One weakness is that the final paper was daunting if you had never written that type of paper before. It would have been useful if more guidance were provided.",
                "I didnt particularly like the quantity of memorization that goes into exams, it reminded me a little of the high school examination process. I really enjoyed writing the final paper though: I realized how much information i was missing out on simply due to not having the prerequisite knowledge it takes to understand it.",
                "the material was very interesting. some of the guest lectures were not my favorites but others were better",
                "The slides are packed with a lot of information. Sometimes it is hard to know what is relevant and important.",
                "This course is very interesting and the guest lecturers were great. I wish the lectures were recorded.",
                "Lectures felt disorganized and there were many tangents. Review sessions really helped hone in on the material that was important for the exams.",
                "Strengths: depth of personal experiences of Professor Forman and the TFs, great overview of underlying economic and policy development concepts that are accessible regardless of previous background, fascinating guest speakers, opportunity to do independent research for final paper\r\nWays for Improvement: exam wording at times were confusing, perhaps more depth in analyzing the policies presented to understand failures and successes of reform",
                "Strengths:\r\n Great general overview of the complex healthcare system here\r\nDelves into pertinent legislation\r\nGreat starting point for further inquiry\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nNot a lot of comparative stuff (it is a US healthcare class after all)\r\nNot as much economic analysis as one would hope, but thats not entirely a bad thing\r\nI wish we delved a bit more into possible solutions, but I understand why we didnt",
                "This course really benefits from Professor Forman's lived experiences. His background as a physician and advisor of public policy provides a unique lens on the lessons of the course. That being said, this format also means that topics are a little jumpy and students must really pay attention in class. That is not so much of a weakness but a caveat. I think that the class format could be stronger if there were a resource to follow up on the personal experiences that are discussed. I found the readings to be really informative but since they were not mandatory and not tested I found that I fell behind without any incentive to catch back up.",
                "This course does a great job of reviewing basic healthcare concepts, ensuring that students understand the economic forces behind ideas, and also explaining economic terminology for students. \r\n\r\nSome weaknesses are the importance of memorization, especially of a high number of acronyms and ideas that don't always seem super important.",
                "I think this class is very engaging especially with the guest speakers and class discussion posts being involved. It is very conducive and a welcoming environment to ask questions. I think the slides could perhaps be improved by posting revised versions after lecture to omit slides that were not covered. It can be a bit difficult to keep organized notes sometimes.",
                "Howie does a great job of encouraging questions.",
                "The course was a lecture-style class, but it was small enough that it worked almost like a seminar in that Prof. Howard allowed us to interact at all times. It would have been convenient if the lectures had been recorded since a bulk of the exam materials was dependent on what was said during lecture and built upon the slides. Other than that though, it was a solid course.",
                "The strengths of the course are how interesting and applicable the material is, some of the weaknesses are that even though the course emphasizes that they ask questions on exams related to what he spent the most time talking about in class, often they will have one or two questions randomly related to something Howie went off tangent about ONCE in class. It can be really hard to stay paying attention, and if you miss half of what he is talking about\/giving examples about, then you miss the whole thing and often that is what is tested. It's great that it gets you to go to every class, but often he talks off the slides and it can be hard understanding the main takeaway from his points. Also, there sometimes seems to be a disconnect between what he says in class and what the TA might teach in review.",
                "Strengths: mostly straightforward exams and lectures; interesting content and a great survey of \"healthcare.\"\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: largely up to the student to be engaged with the content (not necessarily a bad thing); both final paper and exam; subtle sense of being patronized during lectures.",
                "Strengths: Course is well structured for student feedback\r\nWeakness: The lectures are sometimes hard to follow and slides are not necessarily following closely with the lecture",
                "Strengths: Covers a lot of important topics to give an introduction to the healthcare industry, especially if you are coming to it without any background. The paper is generally a grade boost and lets you dive deeper into a topic that you are interested in\r\nWeaknesses: The exams are just pure memorization, sometimes on random specific things. The key points slide is not actually the key points of the lecture because Howie may go on tangents or focus on a single part of the deck for much longer than the rest of the deck",
                "A strength was that the teacher was very knowledgeable. A weakness was that, because he is so knowledgeable, he sometimes explains things in ways that seem simple to him, but make no sense to the students at all",
                "Solid course. Refreshing because of applied, real-world information. Might have been my problem, but I only ever got to see feedback on my discussion posts during the last week of the course.",
                "This course is very insightful and interesting. The professor and TAs are very helpful with ensuring we understand the content. However, there is A LOT of content to know. I would have loved if the course was more interactive.",
                "Strengths: guest lectures were always so so good, Dr Foreman is a gem, very organized class. You know what you are getting into every day\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if youre looking for a class thats very engaging and interactive with peers, this is a lecture so you wont get much of that. But not a weakness per se. The grading frustrated me a little bit on the exams because even if it is right, if its not the answers mentioned in lecture then it is marked wrong. Not unfair, but something to be aware of and I wish I was aware of that for the first exam at least. I also wish that the discussion posts were open during class. They only open after class ends and although I really appreciate that theyre not a lot of work at all, at the same time its really easy to slip your mind for the same reason",
                "Strengths: Howie is great and is able to tackle very serious, polarizing, and sometimes heavy topics with a lot of nuance and grace. He also doesn't shy away from talking about how broken healthcare in the U.S. is, while still maintaining some amount of hope for the future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the lecture slides on canvas were sorted by the order they are delivered in class, right now it's alphabetical (and some lectures have duplicates) and that made it a little difficult to find which slide deck to look at. Also sometimes the slides are a little outdated or don't match what Howie talks about in class. But if you're going to class and taking notes, it's not that big of a deal.",
                "Despite not having weekly readings or PSETs, I still found myself learning so much. The content is very interesting and the multiple guest speakers make it for an engaging classroom. The course is really beneficial so long as you pay attention and ask questions. Otherwise, it is easy to fall behind. \r\nThe only weakness is that the exams, while straight forward, require a lot of memorization (and you get points off for small errors sometimes) and not necessarily a deeper understanding.",
                "Good lectures, very interesting guests",
                "A major strength of this course is the breadth of knowledge and insights into the healthcare system you will come away with. That being said, occasionally very specific details were focussed on such as the minutiae of some regulatory acts that clouded the larger picture a bit. Because of the amount of content to cover, it felt as though we were running out of time towards the end of the course and we did not finish the last slide deck. Perhaps having one fewer guest lecture to accommodate all of the course content could have been beneficial.",
                "Strengths: Professor Forman's expertise in the material, his lecture delivery and enthusiasm, the breadth of topics covered, guest lectures"

                "If you are interested in learning more about the American healthcare system, I would recommend this course. There was, however, certain points in time throughout the semester where topics discussed in lecture seem out of place\/random. But overall, this course was good.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if you know nothing about the healthcare system, its a great intro. That being said, its a lot of material that can be confusing, so only take if genuinely interested in learning",
                "Absolutely, Professor Forman is one of a kind and the class teaches you to be an informed citizen on a very complicated issue in today's day and age.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. One of my favorite classes at Yale so far.",
                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend the course to another student if they have any interest in learning more about the various aspects of the healthcare industry and how it's financed. It can feel a bit disorganized at times\/hard to follow, but once you sit down and take the time to study for the exams, everything really does come together and make sense. If you are interested in going into the business side of the healthcare industry, definitely take this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this knowledge. It has a ton of valuable knowledge, in an easy and accessible form. Exams are fair ( just take notes on what he talks about in class) , workload is pretty light. Howie is a real treat as a professor, and a truly good and funny person.",
                "No, this course is all about memorization and while the topic are useful, the exams are painful and somehow always manage to test on material that was barely covered in classes.",
                "Yes! It's interesting and the topics are super relevant. The exams can be tedious, but if you take diligent notes in class and you are good at memorizing, this class won't be a problem. The fact that it has a final paper and a final exam was a lot of work in the end, though. The content is also super specific.",
                "Absolutely. Howie's awesome. Not a ton of work.",
                "Yes, you should take this class. I am a non-STEM major taking this class and I learned a ton about the healthcare system. You don't need to know any economics to take this class.",
                "As a non-econ major, yes! I had heard that US healthcare system was flawed but I didn't really understand why or understand HC at all. After this class, I can say I have a strong understanding of where the system is failing, some reforms that have impacted recent years, and overall trends in health economics. There is practically no homework (only small discussion assignments that take less than 5 mins after each class), the tests are completely within the content (just a matter of memorizing\/learning it all), and although I haven't received my grade on the paper it's a 6-8 page assignment and the TAs were really helpful. I think anyone going into medicine should definitely take this class and overall I think students can learn a lot no matter what their major is!",
                "It depends. The matrial of the course is interesting if you are fascinated by the US healthcare system, though the material is very convoluted and memorization heavy.",
                "Yes is youre interested in healthcare, the us healthcare system and economics",
                "Yes for Econ major",
                "Yes - if you are pre-med and interested in understanding how our healthcare system functions, this is a great class for you.",
                "I would recommend this to another student if they are pre-med or looking to fill an Econ elective, as I was. However, I would suggest that they engage more with the material, as this was the kind of course where you only get out of it what you put in.",
                "Absolutely take this class. Howie is an amazing and interesting professor and his guest lecturers are fantastic. I learned so much about healthcare and the workload wasnt bad at all. There isnt much (if at all econ) so if thats what you are worried about dont be. Highly recommend to all students!",
                "Yes I would",
                "Yes, but credit D fail unless you need it for ECON.",
                "No. Extremely rude and condescending teaching staff. See my comments above.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone with any remote interest in the healthcare field or anyone who is going into policy. It can get a little boring at times but you gain so much context at the end of the course.",
                "yes absolutely",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in anything related to healthcare.",
                "Yes for the reasons mentioned in the strengths of the course but also for how it stimulates you to think about possible solutions.",
                "Definitely! If you want to work in healthcare (because youre Pre-Med) or you want to work in public policy this class is a must. Also, the prof is great.",
                "Yes. I recommend this course to almost any econ major and premed student. Although Dr. Forman is not teaching a class in ethics and moral philosophy, he does delve into modern healthcare reform and how equity can be improved moving forward which is a valuable insight not found in every econ class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in basic healthcare infrastructure and economics, or is planning on going into the healthcare field. It isn't super econ-heavy, however, so economics majors who want to get into the nitty-gritty of the economic concepts may be disappointed.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student so long as they are willing to take the time to learn lots of terms\/organizations and be able to piece them together. This class is a lot to learn but it builds on itself, and once it starts to piece together becomes easier but it can be difficult to understand at first.",
                "If you are interested in medicine or public policy this is a great course.",
                "Yes, if you're fine with high stakes grading systems. The bulk of the grade came from the final essay and exam. There was no PSETs so you had to make sure you were well-prepared for the midterms and that you stayed on top of your reading responses. If you can handle that though and you're good at keeping up with lectures, you're golden.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are very interested in healthcare, learning about Medicare\/Medicaid, and want to go into health policy in the future. You learn a TON of valuable information (which helped me especially in life sciences consulting interviews for next summer) but it is also really hard to know where you are in the class grade-wise and sometimes the exams test if you came to class but not necessarily if you like understood the relevant information because it will test really random things he talked about at length one time. It might be hard to take notes in the class, but Howie has a very valuable mindset\/is a valuable source of information and can really help you learn\/engage with the material.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to learn more about the U.S. healthcare system, especially its challenges and where it succeeds.",
                "YES! If you want to understand how healthcare works in the US, you should take this course.",
                "I would. Overall, this is a great course to get an introduction to the healthcare system. The week to week is very light, and you just have to spend two days studying before each exam. Howie brings in some interesting speakers as well.",
                "I would recommend this only to premed students.",
                "I would recommend this course to pre-med students and all others interested in health fields.",
                "Yes, the topics were super interesting.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend if you enjoy learning about the healthcare industry and how economics is related to it.",
                "This is a great econ major elective; it's super interesting, highly relevant, and not a lot of work.",
                "Yes you should take this class",
                "Yes. Even if you are not at all considering a career in medicine or healthcare (like me), it's still a very interesting class and you learn a lot of useful knowledge about navigating healthcare and insurance as an adult.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. Even though I had no prior knowledge of the healthcare industry, I really enjoyed learning about it from an economic standpoint. Although the class is less economics-heavy than I would have expected, you walk away learning so much relevant information that can truly be used in career. The way the course is facilitated fosters true understanding.",
                "Yes if they are interested in healthcare",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a career in the healthcare space. Not only do you learn a lot about how healthcare actually works, but the guest speakers offer excellent examples of what you can do in healthcare coming from a variety of backgrounds.",
                "Yes, if interested at all in medicine\/healthcare\/public health. I think anyone can benefit from having a better understanding of how the US healthcare system works, and this course doesn't require an extensive background in economics or policy."
