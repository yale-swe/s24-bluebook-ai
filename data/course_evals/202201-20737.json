                "Strengths: only four days a week, learn so much, good for Lang requirement, small workload, nice people and professors \r\nWeaknesses: pretty much none",
                "The strengths:\r\n- the content\r\n- the organization\r\n- the professor\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses:\r\n- the online textbook\r\n- the required hours for outside service work",
                "Strengths: lots of opportunities to practice signing in and out of class. The class really cultivates a community and friendship, and the signing only classroom space was a low stakes way to really improve signing skills. We had a good mix of practicing after models and forming our own stories\/sentences which I think was good for language acquisition.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes in pair work, other students didn't understand the direction so the time was spent trying explain what the prompt was. I wish that that could have been clarified more. Class also frequently started late. Since class is short to begin with, it was hard to feel like we got through the material in that time.",
                "The department is wonderful. The teachers all care about their students and the class format reflects that. The final project is a window for you to explore anything you want, and the classes are paced and managed with students in mind. Since the department is expanding, it can occasionally be hard to keep up with class logistics, but the professors are incredibly understanding.",
                "A major strength is the 4 day \/ 1 day asynchronous model of teaching. The service projects force the students to get involved with the deaf community at Yale and in New Haven, thereby enhancing their learning. The students would not do this otherwise and so this is a great way to help increase the students' involvement. One weakness is that the different professors have different signing variations for some signs. This makes exams difficult if the video is made by another professor (not your own) and they use a different sign variation."

                "Yes!!! Take ASL, it really comes into play even as you navigate Yale's campus. The department is amazing and cares about students, their learning, and the community.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this to another student! I think ASL is often overlooked when considering a second language. Taking time to learn this visual language really stretches your brain in a different way than learning auditory languages. I think everyone should learn ASL at some point because it is useful in many situations for hearing people as well"
