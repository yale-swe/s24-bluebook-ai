                "Overall I think that this was an excellent class. It was well organized, engaging, and I felt comfortable to speak freely and openly even when I knew that some of my grammar and pronunciation was bound to be imperfect. One aspect of this class that I found to be perhaps the most appealing was the allocation of student energy. Rather than forcing us to prepare for weekly quizzes or needlessly stressful examinations, the majority of our time was spent on projects and assignments. The projects and assignments, in my opinion, were even more beneficial to my learning of the Spanish language, and were significantly more enjoyable. When we did have exams, they were straightforward. Moreover, instead of oral examinations, which are my absolute least favorite part of most language classes, our speaking was assessed during group discussions and project presentations. My oral examinations in previous years have been one of the most significant sources of anxiety in my academic career, so I was very thankful for an opportunity to showcase my speaking proficiency in a more comfortable setting. I cannot think of any significant weakness pertaining to the class; it was, as a whole, very enjoyable, and I learned quite a lot.",
                "StrengthsThe nature of the class forces you to dedicate time to improving\/maintaining your spanish fluency. \r\nWeaknessesI don't think the class assignments\/worksheets are good at reinforcing the new grammar and vocab that the course is meant to teach us.",
                "Strength: full immersion, new perspectives, asynch day, small group so you get to know other students well\r\nWeakness: Some days have so much homework, having two syllabi is confusing",
                "The strengths of this class were the welcoming environment and the relevance of the content we covered (from the environment to neocolonialism to capitalism). The weaknesses of this course were that the learning of the Spanish (in terms of vocab, grammar, etc) wasn't very thorough\/emphasized and often felt rushed. The speed\/frequency at which we received feedback was also a weakness as we only got grades back like 2 days before our finals grades were due, leaving little to no room for improvement. The homework assignments were also posted really late in the day, the day before they were do which made completing them a hassle sometimes.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this class. Take it with Professor Baff is you get the chance! Her teaching style is a perfect combination of instruction and discussion; she teaches the grammar at the beginning to make sure that everyone is on the same page, and then she uses the class to have discussions about literature, poetry, societal issues, et cetera. I could not imagine a better professor. Another aspect of her teaching style that I really appreciate is the fact that she never exerted undue pressure on anyone; she maintained an expectation that everyone would participate in the class discussion, but she never singled anyone out. She created an environment in which I felt comfortable speaking and practicing Spanish, and for that I am incredible grateful. When I began her class this semester, it had been over a year since I had practiced or spoken Spanish. But thanks to her, I was able to recover my grasp on the language and develop it even further.",
                "Yes, this course is fine if you need to take more spanish classes\/want to solidify the skills you have learned previously.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot and it is a well-structured class. Prof. Baffi is the best.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I actually had a really good time in this class and even though I took it at 9:25, it was a class that I usually didn't mind going to. It was always a very welcoming, laid-back environment. Just do the homework assigned the day before, and you will pretty much always be prepared for class.",
                "Yes, class was always fun to go to, and speaking a lot improved my Spanish a lot"
