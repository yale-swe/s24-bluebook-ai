                "This class has taught me how to gather and analyze evidence for a research paper, specifically by providing a class with the Yale library to demonstrate how to access such resources. The skills developed in relation to writing the research paper, alongside the extensive commentary and aid for the paper, will be beneficial for upcoming classes.",
                "The course is very well structured and allows students to greatly improve their writing. Personally, from my first essay to my last, I felt my writing improved tremendously, a feat I would not have accomplished without Professor Baynes-Ross and the way she taught the course. Through our class discussions and readings, I felt that my close reading skills grew as we tackled increasingly complex texts, and coupled with the Professor's guidance, helped me in my own writing as it not only gave me a better insight into the texts I would be analyzing, but also served as a model from which I personally could improve my writing.",
                "The course thought me how to approach the task of writing an essay. I acquired skills of revising the essay as well as doing research and gathering the data. The most important skill learned was writing a well developed claim.",
                "I learned so much about the way I write in this course. I realized what my particular weaknesses were in my writing and the course was set up in a way where I could address these in multiple drafts and discussions with my professor. I gained skills in writing transitions between my paragraphs and making my essay sound whole rather than a bunch of separate ideas. I learned how to support my argument in an effective way. Class discussions really helped me gain a better understanding of the readings assigned and insight into what the authors' intentions were."

                "Weaknesses: I wish I knew my overall grade in the class throughout the semester. Additionally, I wish the readings were easily accessible through the Modules tab on Canvas rather than having to look through the entire files tab on Canvas.\r\n\r\nStrengths: The small seminar class really allows you to flush out your ideas in class, while also exploring new possible concepts from others.",
                "I think the course was very well designed in general. I liked that there was a lot of feedback on my own work. I would have liked to see more examples of essays from previous students and discussing of those examples.",
                "I really like how we had many drafts for an assignment because it gave me a chance to improve my writing with one-on-one feedback from the instructor. The conferences with the instructor were very very beneficial. They allowed me to express my scattered thoughts and concerns about the paper and then receive suggestions or thoughts to advance my thinking. I can not really recall any weaknesses of the course."

                "Yes!! I took this course specifically to attain a writing credit. I quite frankly did not enjoy writing until this class, the different concepts of home we explored really showed me the multitude of directions writing can embody. Oftentimes, we believe that professional writing must be written one standard way, but this class showed that even professional pieces can hold your own opinions, personality, and slang.",
                "Yes, if they are prepared to work on their writing. This course is both interesting and allows for students to improve their writing. It requires effort, but the final payoff is worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone seeking to improve their essay writing skills as the course teaches you everything and your writing improves greatly afterwards.",
                "I strongly recommend this course to other students regardless of year. This course really makes you learn how to analyze texts and media and gain greater insight from them. Not only that, your analysis skills and writing argument skills undeniably get stronger."
