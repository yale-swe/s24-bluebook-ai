                "The major strength of this course was the that it provided a good introduction to how Yale math department works as well as providing a solid foundation of multivariable calculus. The major weakness of this course was definitely the lengthy psets that sometimes felt tedious due to the difficulty, thus taking hours to complete.",
                "Class section was great, wish there were more office hour times during the week.",
                "The pre-class quizzes helped ensure that I was up to date on the material. However, the fact that those quizzes were weighted half the amount that Psets were seemed bizarre considering the time commitment that the Psets called for.",
                "Strengths: MATH 120 is highly ordered and systematic, making it easy to consistently keep up with content and assignments. Modules (with their included pre-quizzes) and information on exams are all posted far in advance, allowing students to plan and budget their time each week. Plenty of resources are provided to help students succeed, including practice tests and Ximera. In my opinion, this course represents a very effective implementation of the \"flipped classroom\": the pre-lecture videos are well-paced and not too tedious.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures essentially cover the same content as the pre-lecture videos, and they tend to fall behind. Perhaps a format where lectures quickly review the content at the beginning and then spend most of the time working through practice problems would complement the pre-lecture videos better.",
                "great organization; no significant weakness I think",
                "I thought the course was well-taught and there were many resources to better understand the material, but it definitely required a lot of time to do so.",
                "Having more peer tutors on the days prior to deadlines for homeworks can be helpful. Outside of that, I felt the course was well done.",
                "MATH 120 has many strengths. Most importantly, there is an abundance of help, including peer tutor office hours (which were very helpful for problem sets), problem-solving sessions, professor office hours, and official review sessions for exams. I also felt that my professor, Danny Nackan, was very helpful in class teaching us material with packets and answering student questions.\r\n\r\nMy one possible complaint would be that a student's experience in MATH 120 could vary widely based on the professor they have. (And based on my experience in the Fall 2023 semester, it seems that there was a wide range in professor ability.)",
                "Strengths:\r\nI ultimately feel like I got a good grasp of calc\r\nMy instructor was good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nP-sets serve a valuable function in learning, but too often they required mind-numbing integration which took a long time and was not related to any topic we were learning that week. I felt I spent more time doing integration than actually learning the concepts on the p-sets.\r\nThe homework serves little purpose if we are just going to learn the same thing in class.\r\nI like rigor, but the weeks we had midterms we would have a p-set due Thursday of the previous week, then a p-set on that Monday, and then a midterm on Thursday.",
                "It is too abstract and does not give you any sense of the utility of what you are learning.",
                "Strengths: daily videos to explain concepts before class and review sessions before midterms. Weaknesses: exams, especially the final, felt rushed and as if they tested the most difficult versions of concepts, rather than the way problems were presented in problems sets."

The course is mainly theoretical, but it is nonetheless important as a pre-requisite to many STEM majors at Yale.
