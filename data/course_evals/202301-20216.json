                "I learned about Nazi Germany from so many interesting perspectives, both historical and methodological. I also improved my writing and research skills, particularly in concise historical writing and building arguments. I also learned about some strands of broader European history beyond just the Third Reich.",
                "I developed my skills in primary source analysis and looking at video testimony, as well as learning to critically examine not only history, but historiography.",
                "I learned a ton about the discipline of history how to go about writing a research paper, how to think about historiography, and how to read secondary sources for their arguments and not just their facts. That's not to mention a ton of interesting content relating to Nazi Germany as well.",
                "helps you develop really important reading and writing skills. Professor Allen is very attentive and hands-on, which really encourages you to produce your best work.",
                "I improved my writing skills and discussion skills. I learned about the history of Nazi Germany in greater in depth and detail than before.",
                "This class is fantastic -- one of those seminars where everyone wants to participate, learn, and contribute (it's a very high level of investment). It takes a topic you think you know a lot about and shows you how wrong you were. I learned a ton about not just Nazi Germany but also broader theories of genocidal violence, nationalistic attitudes, government control, propaganda, memory, and more. Also my writing became a lot stronger, and more concise.",
                "I learned a lot about how to think critically about a period of history that is extremely disturbing/oftentimes simplified.",
                "I learned a lot more about Nazi Germany, and the origins of the movement. In addition, I also think I became a muc hbetter writer."

                "Prof Allen is a huge strength of this course. She gives so much constructive feedback and really encourages students to meet with her about their writing. Also, her selection of readings was excellent and varied. I do think this course was overly stressful, and Prof Allens expectations seemed designed for graduate students rather than undergrads. I found myself discouraged in the middle of the semester because I felt like I could not please her with my writing. That said, I felt like Id improved a lot by the end of the semester, and I do think the course is very much worthwhile if youre prepared for some of the stress that comes with it.",
                "Very high workload in terms of readings for each week; I feel that if the readings were slightly reduced, we would be able to look at each one in greater depth and ensure that all students are realistically on the same page in class discussions, since (especially toward the end of the semester) students are generally so busy and it becomes very difficult to devote the same amount of time to as much reading.",
                "The course was incredibly well structured and taught there are very few ways I could imagine it being improved. The assignments were well-thought-out and interesting, the feedback was pointed and helpful, and the readings, week-to-week, were fascinating. The one area I thought had any room for improvement was class discussion sometimes I felt we were simply bouncing between differing students' views on a given text and it felt like we were not gaining as a collective but simply speaking our minds.",
                "The course is very demanding, which is both a strength and weakness depending on who you are. Prepare to be challenged.",
                "My biggest issue with the course was that it felt like we didn't actually talk very much about the Nazi period itself. A ton of time was spent on the Weimar period, which was probably my favorite part of the class, the last few weeks were about memory politics, but there wasn't actually any time devoted to how the Nazi state functioned.",
                "Strengths: I felt lucky to learn from Professor Allen -- she's kind, thoughtful, and incisive in her analysis of your work (and her comments are very helpful). She puts so much into the class and it shows -- discussion level was always very high and I managed to come away from every seminar meeting feeling like I had really learned something. Allen gives really comprehensive feedback on work that genuinely improved my writing (even if it intimidated me at first) and she challenged me to think about Nazi Germany in ways that will influence my future, non-Germany-oriented History coursework. She, and the high level of investment from the students in seminar, make this a really great experience. I thought most of the assignments for the class were well-structured and well-placed (ie assigned at the right time and with enough time to complete). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: take this class if you know you have the time/motive to put in the work for it -- you'll realize quickly that it's an awesome class that you want to engage with and do all the readings for, and it just feels like a loss if you can't afford to do that because you have a hard set of other classes. The assignments are demanding but not busywork, and I wrote some of my best writing at Yale for this class -- in short, the work level is very high but worth it. The only caveat I'd make to this is that I really wished that the final paper was due later in the semester (for our year it was due April 25th, with a prospectus due a week earlier). I thought it would be nice to have the final due earlier because it's obviously way less work during finals period but this wound up being a mischaracterization -- it's pretty hard (and kinda annoying) to have to get into a final paper mindset in the middle of April, and I thought this just felt very rushed. I think a rough draft due around this point, or perhaps a fuller prospectus, with the actual final due at a normal date would let students put a lot more time into it.",
                "I think Professor Allen leads an extremely engaging seminar and is thought provoking. She makes sure that every single person is engaged in the class. I do think, however, that she is unfairly harsh on the assignments.",
                "Professor Allen is an excellent teacher. The only thing is I wish sometimes I heard more of her opinion, but she does a great job of facilitating discussion. I really enjoyed my time in the course."

                "Yes, I would, as long as youre prepared for the pressure around writing assignments and Prof Allens very high expectations. I learned a lot of content and improved my writing skills significantly.",
                "I would recommend this course for anyone very interested in German history or 20th-century history and the Second World War, although it might be overly challenging for non-history majors or anyone with insufficient background knowledge about this time period. The course is obviously emotionally taxing to an extent, given its content matter, and I would caution students taking on a workload that is otherwise already high from taking this course (I took it during a 4-credit semester and still occasionally struggled); it is also by no means an easy A, but it certainly feels worth the work if you're up for an intellectual challenge and willing to take on the risk of receiving slightly humbling grades!",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Easily the best history course I've taken at Yale, and a great introduction to the discipline if you're not particularly familiar with it. Nazi Germany's history is incredibly important to learn, but beyond that, you learn a lot about history writ large,,, and Professor Allen is one of the best, most attentive teachers you will find here.",
                "Absolutely! By far the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, it is super demanding and challenging though. Prepare to spend upward of 15 hours on this course a week.",
                "I would recommend if you are willing to put a ton of work in.",
                "Yes yes yes and I have. The stuff I learned this semester has already crystallized/improved my work for other classes and changed the ways I view politics and history. I really looked forward to discussions every week and was always excited to do the readings, and although there's a lot of work I found all the assignments very valuable and engaging. Professor Allen is a fantastic professor -- one of the best I've had at Yale, both in her intellectual creativity but also in her teaching (she has high expectations, but is clear in what she's looking for and always supportive/encouraging). I really, really recommend. You won't regret it!",
                "Only if you are ready to commit yourself fully to the course. Professor Allen makes it very hard to feel good about your writing.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. Your writing will get torn to shreds. That being said, it'll make you a much better writer. This course will make you a better student, and you will learn a lot of about the rise of fascism."
