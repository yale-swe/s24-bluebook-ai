The daily assignments on grammar and vocabulary helped me quickly gain a good introductory grasp on how the language operates. In addition, the cultural lessons we had in class gave me a better understanding of the cultures of Spanish-speaking countries around the world. And the bi-weekly Linguameeting sessions really helped me feel more comfortable speaking the language.",

            "comments": [
                "I think the daily assignments and the fact that classes were every day was a huge strength for this course as it gave students the opportunity to engage with the language on a daily basis. In addition, the compositions and tests of this course gave students quick feedback on different areas we could improve in. One thing that I think could be improved is how the homework is structured. The assignments required students to learn the material for the next class the day before, and while that makes sense, completing the Supersite assignments could sometimes be very challenging.",
                "Could be a more detailed approach to assessments earlier before they actually happen.",
                "Very good at preparing students to read and write, but very little to do in terms of practicing speaking. LinguaMeetings were helpful, but more in-class help would be appreciated.",
                "This course is very fast paced! Do everything you can to not fall behind and remember vocabulary.",
                "It was amazing, no complaints.",
                "The course was overall strong, but the pace was often quick and the homework assignments can feel more like busywork than productive. I think that there should be more writing assignments, more readings of Spanish sources, and less Supersite assignments.",
                "Homework taught lesson would learn next day, but could be confusing. Having lesson on subject then homework relearning what happened in class so practice with learning twice better than struggling through it on own then after assignment due leaning about topic.",
                "Most of what is learned preliminarily in this course is learned from the textbook on our own time. Class is used to apply what we have taught ourselves to engaging in conversation with our peers, which is useful, but I think more time could be spent on actually learning from the textbook in class, at least for L1.",
                "The strengths of the course is the level of engagement and participation because it makes it so you can practice a lot on the same subjects in different ways before moving on, which allows you to remember better and put it into practice so that you can start potentially using it in your everyday life. Another strength is the small class size because it gives everyone a chance to speak and participate fully. A weakness of the course could be that sometimes, the way the curriculum is, the class moves a little quickly at certain points. It can be improved by slowing the class down on more complex parts of the language.",

                "Yes, this course was a great learning experience and students are actually able to retain information.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially with Professor Maria Jos Gutirrez Barajas, because it was a very engaging class that I looked forward to. She made learning more fun than burdening. The course itself covers a lot about the Spanish language plus more about the different cultures in Spanish and this is important for anyone to learn, even if they just want to be more experienced with the language and better with communicating with Spanish speakers. It provides a lot of background and experience.",
                "Yes, if they had taken Spanish in high school. If you were going to begin with a new language I would recommend taking a different one because majority of the students had already taken Spanish in high school."
