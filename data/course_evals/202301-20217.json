                "In addition to an overview of the history of Japanese imperialism in Korea, this class demanded of me a really high level of historical analysis that was actually really refreshing. The three reading responses throughout the seminar, while manageable, also encouraged me to continuously return to the readings and build upon existing knowledge, and I felt that over the course of the semester I was able to bring better insights to bear during seminar as a result. It was also fascinating to approach this imperial history from so many angles -- political, economic, social, cultural, etc. -- and from both \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" approaches. Overall it was incredibly thorough and more than just gaining an understanding of the sequence of historical events, I was able to gain insight into many manifestations of Japanese imperialism in Korea.",
                "I learned so, so much! Some of the most informative classes that I have taken at Yale!  I learned so much about Korean history in the context of Japanese imperialism. If you want to understand Korean history from like 1876 to the Korean war period, this is the class for you.",
                "I had no specific knowledge of Korean history before taking this class, just broad notions. The topics professor Shepherd chose to focus on were really fascinating and had a through narrative tying major events into theories of nationalism and empire and race. She also taught us a lot about academia and proper academic practices.",
                "I learned what good research and strong argument-making is through this class. I really enjoyed how we were able to compare scholarly arguments and evaluate them as historians ourselves."

            "comments": [
                "I guess this really depends on the group of people you are taking this seminar with, but one of the strengths during my semester was definitely the discussions we had as a group. Every class, we would be able to have lively discussions on the topics that we read about previously, and it was really nice that there were other students to provide new perspectives and angles on a reading or event that we were studying.",
                "Excellently designed course that covers key topics in modern Korean history. Professor Shepherd also does a good job discussing historiography of the subject.",
                "I can only think of strengths! Professor Shepherd made it very easy to participate meaningfully in seminar, the first half of class was as normally based on primary source analysis so even if you missed the readings for a week, or just didnt have much to say, you could still engage and learn a lot from class time.",
                "This is probably the best-run history departmental seminar I've taken. It made me realize the extent to which a professor's ability to run a seminar will impact students' level of engagement. Professor Shepherd did an incredible job of creating variety in the discussion each week by dividing the two-hour block into one section of short lecture, primary source analysis, or some other activity and one section of discussion of the readings. This was a great format because it broke up the monotony of a two-hour seminar and gave us new content beyond the readings which then impacted our hour of discussion. She also wasn't one to dominate discussion and turn the class into a \"leminar;\" instead we really got to guide the conversation and she'd occasionally turn us toward a particular direction. The final paper was well-structured to set us up for success, with the midterm paper requiring an introductory bibliography and source analysis that made the final paper so much more manageable. Professor Shepherd was also very accessible in office hours and super helpful. She gave thorough feedback on all three reading responses as well as the midterm assignment with suggestions of sources we should look into for the final paper. The reading load was fairly standard for a history seminar, which is to say around 150 pages per week, but the quality of discussion made the reading load well worth it. As a result of all this, there was a really high level of student engagement. And the readings and topics were all incredibly interesting and varied, so each week presented new aspects of Japanese imperialism in Korea for us to analyze. All told, it was an incredibly strong class and I don't have any major critiques.",
                "Strengths: The way this class is structured is actually a god-send. The first half of class typically being some sort of primary source analysis is extremely effective as it leads perfectly into the second half of the class which is the reading discussions. Both halves were consistently so interesting and Professor Shepherd's insights and guidance during the seminar consistently left me wondering more!\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness that I can possibly think of is that some weeks, the readings were particularly brutal, and with only an hour to touch on everything, I sometimes felt that such efforts to read everything were fruitless. (However, depending on which topic you choose for your final research project, attentiveness to the readings will pay off in the long run).",
                "The beginning of the semester was a little bit difficult to follow having to dive into long readings about events and people I had never heard of, but this is probably my own fault for not reading the textbook chapters she recommended as background. Otherwise, the long readings felt manageable because they were genuinely so interesting and prof Shepherd is so knowledgeable and makes class and discussions really fun.",
                "One of the biggest strengths is Professor Shepherd's teaching. Even as a professor, she is able to navigate and understand the atmosphere of the class, if people are feeling rather low-energy or feel particularly excited towards one topic. Throughout my time at Yale, it's surprising how much of a difference good and aware teaching is. Even though the material was challenging and dense, it was very easy to understand and navigate because of Shepherd's teaching. She is approachable, energetic, and cognizant of her students' understanding, as well as her own.\r\n\r\nAs for the weaknesses, I think the readings were quite dense. And though there were discussion questions, sometimes it was difficult how to prioritize certain readings or what to look out for in these readings. I'm not sure if this is a weakness that can be fixed, however, as the class meets once a week and that means that the reading load has to be dense. I also think one thing I wanted a little more in this class was working more with fellow students and interacting with a varied group of peers."

                "Yess! Definitely take it if there's space in your schedule and spots available! This course overall was such a great learning experience and and allowed me to grow academically and as a historical thinker. Hannah Shepherd was an amazing professor, and the topics of each reading were also super interesting. I will say that this is a reading heavy course it was a lot more than what I expected going in, but even on the days where I wasn't able to finish the readings, I still left class feeling like I learned something new and was engaged in conversation.",
                "Yes! This is a unique course taught by a great professor. The reading and writing workload is a bit on the higher side though, so plan accordingly.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed the teaching style and conversations in class, and the content of the course was very interesting. I feel like i learned a lot about Korean history and also improved my academic skills",
                "I would highly recommend this class. It was incredibly well-run, and as a result had a higher level of student engagement than probably any other history seminar I've taken at Yale. I never felt like doing the readings was a waste of my time because they were engaging and discussed in full during the seminar. I wish I could say the same of every departmental seminar I've taken, but I can't; so if you have an opportunity to take this class, I would recommend that you seize it. The subject matter was fascinating and our approaches to it were varied, so there wasn't any sense of monotony. Professor Shepherd was super accessible for help and feedback and very kind. She gave really thorough feedback on every single writing assignment and she's also the only professor I've ever had at Yale who has bothered to take class time to discuss what makes effective academic writing. I think any student of history would find it very interesting. That being said, the vast majority of the class were of Korean or Japanese descent, and while I don't think that people's personal or familial experiences influenced the discussion that often, it was certainly interesting and particularly meaningful to have so many students have a connection to the history at hand.",
                "YES! I highly recommend. An amazing course. The workload is a little higher, but so worth it. Professor Shepherd's guidance and style of teaching is truly one of the best I have encountered at Yale! I can't praise this class enough!",
                "Absolutely. Such a great class with the caveat that its a lot of reading and you really get less out of the class if you dont do the readings. If youre interested in this subject this is the best class youll ever take.",
                "Yes! It's a great class to grow as a historian, in general and it's a great class to understand the enthusiasm for Korea-Japan studies. Especially as we engaged in the scholarship, poor scholarship, of Ramseyer, it was so wonderful to see scholars interacting with one another and to see the importance of scholarship as it pertains to current political issues. I feel like that's a portion of academia that is rarely seen in the classroom."
