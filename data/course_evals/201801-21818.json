    "I learned an array of conditions under which democratic erosion can occur, more broadly in the world and the U.S., as well as more specifically in orcountry case studies.",
    "This class really informed my understanding of the state of democracy in different countries. It takes a comparative look at democratic erosion, and gives students the tool to assess democratic backsliding."

    "I had an awesome time in the class. Potentially focusing more on non-American case studies of democratic erosion would be good but overall an excellent class.",
    "Mattingly is a good discussion facilitatorhe asks probing questions that build up the conversation, and also allows everyone a chance to speak. I appreciated the opportunities in class he gave us to reflect on the readings before discussing them. One thing that Mattingly could improve upon is providing more positive feedback to students after the offer comments, rather then allowing for a silent pause and then moving to the next person. It would also be nice if he could offer a few more comments on papers. Overall, an enjoyable class and a nice professor!",
    "The content of this course is very strong. It would be interesting to figure out new ways to engage with the other universities offering the course."

    "i would definitely recommend the class! the only comment i would make is that a lot of our debates seemed skewed toward pointing out the flaws of populism\/current leaders that are unpopular in college campuses, without elaborating deeply on potential counterarguments. this was more due to the students as opposed to the instructors or curriculum; even though we read texts attempting to illustrate the contrary point of view, i felt class debate always focused on elaborating on the points of anti-trump rhetoric which, though i personally agreed with, limited my in-depth understanding of opposite points of view. in trying to understand democratic erosion it the US, i would have found it helpful to take more time to elaborate on unpopular opinions.",
    "Absolutely - I learned a great deal about the course material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in studying modern democracies and compare their indicators of backsliding.",
    "Excellent class! The material was really relevant and interesting, and Professor Mattingly ran the discussion very well.",
    "I learned a lot and enjoyed the process. Definitely an interesting way to learn about current political phenomena"
