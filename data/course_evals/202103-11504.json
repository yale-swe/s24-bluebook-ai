                "What made this class really special is that we focused on cultural aspects of Spanish and practiced vocab/grammar etc. via activities, movies, and books. This made the class a lot more engaging and educative than a class that focuses solely on grammar. I think this is the right way to teach a language and the Spanish department places a lot of focus on this. Daily homework, activities, and group projects also gave us a lot of chances to practice our skills every day.",
                "It was a really good way to learn Spanish but a weakness is that the homework could have been spread out more evenly because sometimes there was a lot more in one week than another.",
                "This class was very active and involved -- 6/7 days each week, I would be doing something in Spanish (homework, reading, writing, etc.), which helped with my Spanish capabilities. The biggest strength is the professor, who did an excellent job at keeping students engaged and accountable. This class was doable, but challenging enough to ensure that students showed up and gave it their all. Very encouraging atmosphere. The greatest weakness is the asynchronous day, which was often the least engaging and interesting day of the week.",
                "very helpful to do in class work but there were a lot of projects that made it unclear why we were doing them",
                "I think this course was extremely successful and I have greatly improved this year. There were many presentations, which were a lot of work but, in the end, paid off. I think more lectures in class would be helpful, I enjoyed learning as a collective group.",
                "This course was great. I do not think there are any glaring weaknesses.",
                "A lot of work everyday but there is also a lot of group work, so it is manageable.",
                "I don't think the course had any weaknesses. The course was very well structured and organized outside and inside of the class. I knew all the time what to do long ahead and the workload was reasonably high to support my learning.",
                "The course was excellent in that it forced you to improve in Spanish, mostly through immersion. It was very empowering being able to read texts and give presentations in another language. However, I felt that it was almost too text/presentation based, and could have benefited greatly from somehow incorporating more natural conversations."
