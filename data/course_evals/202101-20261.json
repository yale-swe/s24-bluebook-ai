Could maybe contextualize the readings more. It would have been nice to have open office hours. The purpose of section was not always clear."

As a STEM major, I felt like I got a great intro to elements of history that I've always been curious about, and I was able to spend time thinking about the implicit assumptions we make in the modern world about scientific knowledge now and in the past. The readings were mostly pretty interesting, the writing assignments very manageable, and the exams fair."
