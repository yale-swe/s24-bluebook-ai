            "comments": [
                "Strengths - organized syllabus; facilitated communication between professors, TFs, and students; transparency in assignments and expectations \r\nWeaknesses - lengthy required weekly readings, disorganized class discussions and recorded lectures, unaddressed confusion about certain philosophies, prolonged silence during class discussions",
                "I really like the pre-recorded lectures on the philosophers' work, that was very helpful to understand the big picture. I wish there was more connections made between different philosophers and more emphasis on non-European thinkers. The course is called \"Foundations of modern social theory\", so it doesn't mean that all the modern social theorists are European-centered; if we are only looking at European-centered theorists, it shouldn't be called \"modern social theory\" because it doesn't include the diversity of all thinkers from different places. \r\nThe class is quite big to have formal discussions, so the class environment wasn't made encouraging enough for people to actively participate except for about 10~ people out of 40~. I understand things are different with Zoom, but I hope we could have a smaller environment for discussion. The thing with break-out rooms is that it was difficult to get conversation started without a TA\/ instructor, and conversation quality varies depending on who the people are in the break-out room. I think it would be better if there is more lecture part in the course because the pre-recorded lecture isn't enough to get to the details of the works.",
                "I think the strengths of this class are the recorded lectures and the synchronous sections led by the TAs. The live virtual lecture often felt like a waste of time and only seven people consistently spoke out of a class of almost 50 students. It's really not necessary to have both live class AND recorded lectures. A possible fix would be for the professors to teach the recorded material live in real-time but also have recordings available for those who cannot make lectures all the time.",
                "One strength of the class is just the works themselves. They're super interesting and I think most students taking the course engaged with them really well. An additional strength was that discussions really made the works easier to digest. One major weakness was that the works were not as varied as they could have been.",
                "This was one of my favorite classes this semester but I do think that the way the class handled race\/difference was a bit elementary. Many students of color in the class, including myself, often felt uncomfortable due to the way race was treated in the readings (which is to be expected when reading the canon), but we were dissatisfied by how those details were just glossed over in class. Even more so than the uncomfortable treatment of readings, it was the response to students bringing it up in class that made it truly worse. While I'm grateful that we created a space in class to have the discussion, it ended up being a hostile situation and I believed the instructors ended up playing the part of white victims (to some extent). As a student of color, there were many times when I had to prioritize protecting the feelings of white peers and instructors over my own discomfort, and I don't think I was fully heard. However, I do think the instructors of the class are capable of much better and that this can be fixed with a bit more thought pertaining to the criticisms we gave in class.",
                "Strengths of the course include the papers we had to write--these papers allowed for a deeper analysis\/reflection on concepts by one (for the first two papers) or several (for the final paper) theorists that we went over. Weaknesses of the course may mostly have to do with its virtual format; see #5 for feedback on these issues. The amount of reading required was definitely not low and sometimes verged on being too much, but for the most part was manageable.",
                "The teaching fellows are phenomenal and the recorded lectures were also helpful in facilitating learning. The syllabus really needs to be improved and I hope that there is more of an intersectional lens to the class, rather than just bracketing discussions on race and gender.",
                "Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this class. The course featured one perspective heavily- that of white, European men and neglected to discuss others. Due to the title of the course and its role as the only theory class required for the Sociology major, I was pretty disappointed.",
                "This course will develop you as a writer. Reading theory, analyzing it, and synthesizing it is not an easy task, and you will grow from the experience. However, this course is heavily dependent on Western thinkers, who often have problematic perspectives on race, gender, etc. which influence their theory but were not discussed in the class. Additionally, many of the readings are old and thus hard to understand.",
                "The course instructors were knowledgable and approachable. I learned a lot from the peer tutors and received great recommendations for future courses to develop my understanding of social theory.\r\nThe virtual lectures were not lectures so much as discussion times. I wish we had a little more time to receive in-depth expositions of the authors before having to guide our own discussions.",
                "I believe the biggest strength of the course was the constant push to think beyond the thinker. I had never taken a class where I was always trying to come to my own conclusions. It was daunting because we are thinking about people who have work that we are not reading and reputable. \r\n\r\nThe biggest drawback was sometimes the readings were difficult, and there was not always ample discussion or context. I also believe we should read more thinkers with a variety of thought. I understand that white men are the backbone of Western thought, but it would be nice to challenge them a bit more with other contemporaries.",
                "Strengths: Professors are very good at explaining complex theory.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was at times very emotionally draining due to the stress created in the class in regards to the topic of critiquing the theory we were reading. The syllabus was also a weakness as we spent almost the complete semester talking only about limited canonical theory written by cis white men and then spent a much shorter time on later theorists. For example, we spent probably a total of 10 minutes discussing Judith Butler in contrast with the hour and 30 minutes devoted to Simmel. Coupled with this was the fact that reactions to questions about the limited scope of the class and the lack of addressing racist theorists pasts were very defensive. The class felt highly constricting and at times blatantly ignored the problematic nature of many theorists. de Toqueville's genocidal tendencies had to be brought up by a TF, if they hadn't been they most likely would not have been mentioned.",
                "The syllabus should be restructured to include readings that contextualize and critique the selected authors, replacing the less crucial, sometimes trivial parts of some unnecessarily lengthy selections. This would make for a more constructive and purposeful discussion.",
                "Strengths: Emily Erikson is very intelligent and great at teaching the concepts.",
                "This class was provided a good overall conception of Western modern social theory. Concerns about the content of the class appeared throughout, but I am of the opinion that if this class was meant to provide a baseline understanding of the social theories that construct the discipline of Sociology, then primary focus on the works and theories of the likes of Marx, Weber, and other white Europeans is justified.",
                "Strengths: Discussion sections and lecture discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus perhaps didn't lend itself to a more global or inclusive understanding of modern social theory. There could be more texts from non-white theorists. There could be more discussion of the very outdated aspects of the theory that we did read.",
                "A big weakness of this class this semester was the time constrain for discussions. We had a pre-recorded lecture for initial background on the theories and the theorists. During the live lecture a lot of our time would quickly be consumed by simple questions which made it difficult to obtain an in-depth understanding of the theories discussed.",
                "I appreciated the professors' efforts to generate engagement. I felt the syllabus of this course was very limited and I wished we had more opportunities to read a more diverse list of authors. Theorists were studied with regard only to the portion of their text that was assigned and were not looked at holistically. As a result, the theorists' other works, personal beliefs, and potential contributions to racist behavior were not acknowledged. When students brought this up to the professors, many of the students' concerns were listened to, but ultimately dismissed. This created an environment that made it difficult for students to want to participate. However, on a positive note, I did feel that section was an opportunity to critique and challenge theorists in a way that had not been given room in lecture.",
                "Strengths would be the TFs, the pre-recorded lecture, and sometimes section. A weakness was definitely the lack of diversity in the curriculum and the awkward synchronous lectures where only 8 students and the professors talked. I really did enjoy Prof Erickson; she made a point of reaching out to all of the students to hear about our takes on the class. She was also super kind and understanding.",
                "This course had a very limited syllabus. Most of the authors were white and male despite a number of POC and female theorists existing that could have been included on the syllabus. Not only that, but some of the authors were racist, and rather than having a truly constructive conversation regarding this, one of the professors fiercely defended the author and the syllabus that she'd created.",
                "I think the course would be better if it reverted to the standard lecture format that it uses in-person and those that want more discussion can use office hours. The breadth of the readings was interesting, but I think some of the assignments could be better paired to prompt more critical analysis of each author."

                "I appreciate the efforts that Profs. Erikson and Karell made to adjust the course to the virtual format; however, there were several aspects, perhaps out of their control, that were not successful. During synchronous lectures, most of the class would have their cameras off, with those who participate the most frequently usually having theirs on. This eventually turned the lectures into a sort of public section discussion with the same participants, and the rest of the class silently observing. \r\nAnother aspect of the course that I found to be a weakness was the inclusion of the pre-recorded lectures. I understand the reasoning to do so was to free up time during the scheduled lecture time to take questions and have class discussion, but I don't believe it was entirely helpful in the end for two reasons: (1) the pre-recorded lectures felt rushed, as if a 50-minute class's worth of material was being pushed into a 15 minute video (that eventually turned into 20 minute videos and then 25 minutes...) and (2) the synchronous lectures did not feel like an essential use of time, since much of what happened during these lectures could have been done in discussion sections. Perhaps it would have been more efficient to deliver the material of the pre-recorded lectures during the synchronous lecture times, as was originally planned, which could have been recorded live and posted on Canvas after the class.\r\nI'm thankful that the breakout room part of lecture was removed after mid-semester feedback: it was not helpful, often with nobody even speaking\/turning their cameras on.",

                "Definitely improved as the course went along. Removing the breakout rooms halfway through the course was the right decision, as these discussions weren't fruitful. Sharing key quotes and key ideas to center the discussion, also halfway through, was helpful. It made sense to have students watch the recorded bit of lecture outside of class, but when the video went beyond the time allotted for it, this was a bit inconsiderate. Also sort of an odd dynamic to have two professors.",
                "I really enjoyed the recorded lectures which were insightful and provided a lot of flexibility.",
                "The prerequisite lecture video was helpful in priming my mind to understand the material, though class discussion felt limited and difficult.",
                "Having the pre-recorded lecture was good because otherwise most of our class time would just be devoted to giving a basic understanding of the theories.",
                "The format of this course could be stressful and overwhelming in terms of the expectations of the pre-recorded lecture videos, attending live virtual lecture twice a week, in addition to section.",
                "It was an insane amount of work. Like the fact that a midterm was two 4 page papers? It should have just been one. I did like that we had choice, but it was an unrealistic expectation to ask students to do all that with other class and a pandemic going on. I just felt like I never had enough time to commit to this class because of the less than ideal headspace I was in because of the pandemic, and the syllabus was essentially the same as a pre-pandemic syllabus. No noticeable adjustments were made."

                "No unless sociology.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as long as the COVID-19 related practices are improved and better organized to facilitate comprehension and participation. We learned about very interesting topics, but our discussions were often confusing and disorganized.",
                "Requirment for Sociology major. I wouldn't recommend if you don't have to take this course. We go through each thinker very quickly, so no time to delve deep into each thinker.",
                "Yes! Such an amazing class that gives you a comprehensive understanding of the philosophical foundations that underpin the modern theories that most of us are familiar with",
                "I would only recommend this course to people who absolutely need to take it; it's normally much harder in person, so this semester was pretty decent in comparison to how it normally is. If this is something you are taking for fun, beware. It is a lot of hard and theoretical readings; they are challenging and dense. However, there are not many weekly assignments. There are 2 midterms and one final.",
                "No",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend if you're at all interested in diving into classic and foundational theories.",
                "Yes, definitely!",
                "I took this as a requirement for my major; I would only recommend the course to students with a high interest in the philosophy behind how society functions or how social theory might be applied outside of an abstract realm.",
                "I think there are better philosophy courses. I would only take it if you need the requirement.",
                "No, because of reason given above.",
                "Only if you are ready and excited to engage with Western philosophy for the entire semester. If you are a political science major looking for a credit, there are easier\/better classes to take.",
                "No. Until there is a thoughtful reconsideration of the works included in the class I can not in good faith recommend the course. The complete lack of Black feminist and Indigenous authors is hard to ignore. It is a requirement for the sociology major so if you have to take it for that reason be prepared to have to deal with a lot of frustration.",
                "Yes because the teacher is the best. She is understanding, caring, and a great motivator.",
                "Unless you're taking it for the major, but even then it might serve you to try getting out of it and check out the readings that seem interesting to you.",
                "Yes! It does a great job at going over foundational philosophers and thinkers in a clear way.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone wanting a foundation in modern social theory. It is a good course for getting a survey of authors that we often hear about at college or in wider conversations in society but perhaps don't know about more intimately than just name-dropping.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student, the readings are very interesting",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they need it for a requirement. However, I felt I could read similar works in other classes that are maybe better suited to my learning style.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student with the current syllabus. If there were less readings and assignments were more appropriate for the amount of time students had to commit to the class, I would recommend it. The material was definitely interesting, but there was too much of it to actually appreciate what was going on.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have to take it for the sociology major. The course was an interesting overview but did not provide me with any specific information that I found particularly useful.",
                "Yes, it was really interesting and a good introduction to Eurocentric sociology (if you're looking for non-white theory and systems of thought, this isn't that class)."
