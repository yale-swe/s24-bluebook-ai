                "Strengths: Professor Fan is kind, reasonable, warm, and charming. There isn't much homework, and all assignments are informative, helpful, and teach you more about the topic. TAs are really helpful and willing to take time to debug any issues with you. Walkthroughs of material are very easy to follow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is sometimes hard to stay engaged, since there is almost no assessment of learning in this class or follow-up on homework--thus, since no one is checking that you're doing assignments or understanding the material, it is easy to fall behind or not learn much if you're not independently motivated. Also does not really teach you how to write your own single-cell dataset analysis code, simply walks you through example code each week.",
                "Some basic knowledge of sc will be appreciated.",
                "Strengths: low workload, journal club environment, flexibility of attending class on zoom\r\nWeaknesses: students aren't great teachers and it's not our fault but half of the class was student presentations that were super boring and not well explained. I thought I would actually learn how to code in R and analyze data sets but all we did was run other people's code and I really wanted to learn but it was just so hard to do so when there was no teaching from the professor in this class and we didn't actually right any code ourselves.\r\n\r\nPlease spend more time in this course actually teaching the concepts...there should be entire lectures on Seurat, UMAP, tsne, read depth, relevant statistical methods, etc. Right now I can throw these terms around but I don't have a good idea about what they mean. Also the intent of the student presentations is well meaning but students are not good teachers and we don't know what we're talking about...that's why we're taking the class. I would honestly prefer some guiding questions or an annotated paper to read. That way I could use the guiding questions as I read through the paper to pick up on key points and it would be helpful to have notes/annotations with key definitions we might not be familiar with. I would also have liked to hear more from Professor Fan himself about his lab and his research.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fan is awesome, and the student presentations were generally pretty good and a good experience to prepare. Really interesting papers and topics.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab portion was definitely a weakness -- it had the potential to be really interesting and useful, but it was pretty disorganized and not usually very helpful. I think part of it was that it was online so troubleshooting was a bit of mess, unclear communication beforehand, no computational prereqs so they didn't really ask us to do much coding, few assignments (which I appreciate) but also makes it hard to practice, etc.",
                "I liked how students were asked to present on a paper, but I kind of felt like there could have been more structure provided during the lecture. Maybe have students present some of the time and the professor lecture other times to try and fill in the gaps/deepen our knowledge.",
                "The topic of the course was very interesting. For the data analysis portions, it felt like we were only running code directly following the TFs without really understanding why certain analyses were being used or how they worked.",
                "I think this course was a really great survey course. I do wish the programming assignments involved more programing from my end",
                "Fascinating content. Good to have students present. I wish there was more introduction to the basics in the beginning.",
                "strength: I like the format of the course very much. Discussion on recent literature combined with hand-on computational labs really deepened my understanding for the topic.\r\nNo weakness, for improvement (I can't believe I am saying this ) but I actually hope there are more homework to help ourselves getting more familiar with the"

                "Yes. An intro to SC biology.",
                "Absolutely not unless there are some serious revisions to the class. Obviously if you're taking single cell analysis you're looking to actually gain something from it and not simply take a gut. Unfortunately, I walked away from this class having not really learned anything and not writing any code at all to analyze single cell datasets. Every Tuesday, two students present on a paper journal club style - the sad thing is the whole reason students are taking this class is to learn so making students unfamiliar with a topic present on advanced Cell and Nature papers really just results in an hour of boring and confusing presentations every week. On Thursday, there is a computational lab but unfortunately we literally just opened up code files from the papers we read and ran already written code. The TAs try to briefly explain what the code does but we just end up confused (and I know it's not me - I've texted other students in the class and we all feel the same way). Professor Fan adds some comments/questions at the end of the presentations but he doesn't do much actual teaching other than that which is unfortunate because he seems super knowledgeable. If the course were structurally changed, it could be interesting and useful but as it is, you'll walk away from this class not having learned much at all. If someone gave me a single cell dataset and told me to analyze it I wouldn't even know how to start.",
                "Yes! Really good content, interesting topics, solid professor. Really chill workload-wise, but doesn't give a great computational background.",
