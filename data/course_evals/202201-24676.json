                "The course has amazing tutorials for the arcGIS Pro program. They are exceptionally amazing at guiding students to the right direction. That being said, the class is quite unengaging because it is taught to be hands off.",
                "Dana is very available to answer any questions or concerns about the use of GIS, which is great. I think the structure of the course is a big weakness. While we got a little feedback from the first homework assignments, once they began to focus on our final project there was not much feedback at all. So I had no idea whether my project topic/proposed methods were what he expected for a final project.",
                "I loved the homework assignments, I thought they facilitated and aided my learning really well. I also like the grading structure, it took some pressure off to not have grades on the homework. I think there could be a little more direction in terms of content/topic for the final presentation. Lectures were interesting but sometimes it was a little hard to follow ArcGIS being run on the projector, would have preferred just general overviews in class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tomlin is very knowledgeable and very willing to help students out with their work and helping them get a better understanding of GIS. I also appreciated the course structure, which had well-designed weekly lessons and clear agendas. Professor Tomlin also supplied us with additional materials with well-explained and clear procedures for certain GIS techniques.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very little feedback over the course of the semester, and little classroom engagement (every class could have been recorded rather than held in-person). The weekly assignments were often very grueling (more so due to the extremely slow and clunky nature of ArcGIS Pro than how the assignments were designed, to be fair) and took very long to complete.",
                "Dana is very available to his students. He provides really great resources and makes finding out how to do this very straight forward and easily navigated. However, the final project for this course is quite heavy; I feel it is most suited to students who come into the course with data/a project they already know they want to use for this. Proactivity is key. Also did not get feedback from week 8 onward, and would have appreciated a bit more.",
                "Strengths: Good introductory course to ArcGIS\r\n\r\nWeakness: Required a ton of independent learning",
                "It's very well organized around student learning and the professor does a great job \r\nThe load in terms of work isn't particularly high but it is pretty time intensive to produce the results you're looking for.",
                "Strengths: meets once a week, helpful handouts for ArcPro tools and processes are given out, professor responds fast to questions, demo/labs can be done on your time instead of through discussion sections or scheduled lab times. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: weekly assignments do no count towards grades which puts all the weight on the final assignment, feel like you are actively competing against your classmates since prof constantly reminds/emphasizes that our projects are graded relative to one other, you have to be self-motivated in this class or you will fall behind since there aren't graded assignments in place to keep you accountable, you receive feedback on your assignments but in very short email format",
                "tomlin is very smart and funny but the class is.hard",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot through this course. If your goal is to learn GIS and have proof of your skills for internship/job applications, Professor Tomlin will provide you with all the tools you need. \r\nWeaknesses: I did not feel that our TA was helpful as they did not seem familiar with the assignments we were working on each week. Thankfully, Professor Tomlin is very responsive to questions. This course is also a major time commitment. 6+ hours for weekly assignments and a term project that requires a lot of time during reading week, even if you have been working on parts of it throughout the semester. Please do not take GIS with a heavy course load.",
                "The grading method is somewhat odd and overly stressful as we are compared to our peers. I also think we should get more credit for the homeworks we complete along the way and not have the whole grade be based on the final project."

                "honestly no. i was hoping to learn a skill, but instead i learned how to google things",
                "Yes, with a few caveats. I learned so much through this course and feel very well-versed in GIS. The final project is also a great product to show to future employers. My first word of warning is to not take this course as part of a 5+ credit semester. Weekly assignments take a long time (6+ hours), and the final took 60+ hours, leaving very little time to sleep or work on other assignments during reading week, even though I started work on my final project during spring break. I was taking GIS as one of four courses. If you take this course, you must ask for help. When you inevitably run into an issue or question, Professor Tomlin is very willing to help and responds quickly through email. Asking for help is absolutely necessary as you do not receive grades/direct feedback on weekly assignments.",
                "Yes if you really really want to learn GIS. There is a certain amount of personal willpower necessary for this course."
