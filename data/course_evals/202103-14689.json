                "I think the course design - with discussion of critical and scholarly issues loaded to the front and musical transcriptions in the latter half of the semester - was fantastic. It allowed us to engage with methods of analysis and critical issues before we tried analyzing anything ourselves, which made me feel more confident going into that part of the semester. The course readings and listenings were well-grouped and made for coherent transitions from week to week, and I really felt like my knowledge and skills grew cumulatively throughout.\r\n\r\nI also really ended up liking the group final project. It was a little daunting and unorganized at first, but Dr. Veal provided the space and tools we needed to complete a project I feel really proud of and is better than anything any one of us could have completed individually.\r\n\r\nI think the course could benefit from more concrete assignments from the onset of the semester. I had mostly finished the midterm essay assignment (analyzing a visual piece of art with our musical analytical terms) when Dr. Veal swapped the assigned essay to cover the critical issues of the course instead. He did so with plenty of time, and I was able to finish the assignment, but felt like I had wasted time and effort writing that other essay."
