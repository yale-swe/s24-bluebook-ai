                "This course had a lot of work, and while much of it was repetitive, it was overall effective in drilling the material and helping with memorization. The workload quickly became manageable, and I found that my French improved significantly.",
                "The audio activities we had assigned every night were a lot, and they were also kind of difficult to learn the material when these audio activities were the ones introducing you to a new concept for the first time. I would have liked activities that would have served more as a practice to reaffirm topics, rather than teaching us. Teaching us was best left to in-class time.",
                "Strengths: very well organized series of audio recordings and corresponding exercises; class atmosphere that was conducive to participation and learning; Weaknesses: not a lot of opportunities to practice long speaking responses",
                "I've fully enjoyed the course and all the assigned readings and films. I think the professor is especially good at encouraging meaningful discussions.",
                "This course was taught very well, and I think that all of the concepts taught in this course were very appropriate for this level. Having audio programs everyday improves your listening comprehension skills immensely, and the listening programs align nicely with the exam material. The great thing about this course is how fair it is; if you put in the effort, improvement is guaranteed."

Even though having class and assignments everyday may seem intimidating, this class is set up for you to succeed, and with time you will adjust to the rhythm.",
                "This class is worth the effort that it demands. I hadn't taken French in quite a few years and was worried about not only how I would find reacclimatizing to the language but also how well I would pick it back up, but the fast pace and consistent, structured work load enabled me to hit the ground running. The professors were personable, understanding and very willing to help and make themselves available. I recommend this class, just make sure you can dedicate yourself to it.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course if you enjoy French. Mme DeVos really cares about each student and wants everyone to be engaged. However, there is a lot of work so if you dont like French then I would say this class isnt for you."
