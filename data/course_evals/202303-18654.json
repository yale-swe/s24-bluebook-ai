                "The course provides a strong foundation in the history of the university as a uniquely Western institution that has changed much since its original conception in the Late Middle Ages. It also has some seriously fascinating material with writers and thinkers that are likely not read in any other classroom at Yale. However, I definitely struggled to walk away from the course with a greater understanding of the \"big picture.\" That is to say, I do not feel as though I have an answer to the question, \"What is the university?\" If anything, I am more confused now than I was at the start of the course. Furthermore, the amount of people in the seminar---likely over twenty---made it hard to participate and to formulate a clear line of thinking throughout class. It felt more like a bunch of people chiming in with their interpretations rather than a through-line of thematic information that gave us deeper insight by the end of class.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Interesting topic and relevant to Yale students personally!\r\n- We incorporated YDN and/or recent news articles/stories about universities (and Yale in particular), which was super interesting and helped us understand the concepts better!\r\n- A variety of sources/types of readings we read each week (letters, official documents, book excertps/chapters, articles, etc.)\r\n- Lots of freedom to explore topics students are personally invested in in the final project! Very, very exciting.\r\n- Hot takes and uncommon interpretations/comments were always encouraged in class in productive ways. It felt like a safe environment to share genuine opinions/thoughts.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The readings sometimes felt all over the place and not well connected to each other in terms of time period, perspective, geographic region, topic, etc. I had a hard time finding continuity from week to week.\r\n- Long readings were sometimes emailed out with very little advance notice\r\n- I would have liked more support in researciing for the final project"

            "comments": [
                "Eh. I think the course kinda falls off when it moves from being a history of universities into just general debates. It was hard to understand why we were moving from one week's topic to another and often felt more like a little book club about universities as opposed to an attempt to follow any clear lines of thinking from week to week.\r\nAlso Mordechai is happy to let conversation wander so it really depends on construction of the class. There are people who you don't want to let wander and they can totally change the vibe of the discussion.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student for the primary reason that it is one of the few classes I have taken in which research---actual research---was prioritized as the foundational goal of the class. I had never actually done serious research, in which I was required to make new, original observations about primary source documents found in an archival source, until taking this class. After taking it, I now have a new appreciation for the work that people at universities do in conducting and performing research on topics that have not yet been explored in history. It is for that reason, and primarily that reason, that I would recommend this class to a student.",
                "Possibly. If one is looking to understand discrete concepts of the university system in interesting and historical ways, and is prepared to do a good amount of weekly reading, then yes.",
                "The course grew unfocused as it got to the middle of the semester and lost some of its historical grounding (land grant act, early European colleges, etc), and this made it harder to follow and engage with the material."
