                "The vocabulary and grammar was taught very well; the course was somewhat difficult, but that was necessary to effectively teach the language. I just wish there were less people per class so that I could get more individual time to speak, although I understand that's not a fault of the instructor.",
                "I learned a lot a lot. Id say no weaknesses as long as the students know that theyre going into a fairly demanding course. Very great teaching style",
                "No weaknesses. Clear instruction and engaging classroom environment.",
                "Strengths: very straight forward teaching\r\nWeakness: can sometimes move past harder topics to quickly"
