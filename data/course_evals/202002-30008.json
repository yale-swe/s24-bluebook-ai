   "comments": [
    "I learned all the bones of the body, directions, markings on the body, associated ligaments, nerves, tendons, and muscles as well as methods to age and sex the skeleton.",
    "Bones, bones, and more bones. I can now name most bones in the body and their features.",
    "This class was awesome and I think it will be extremely beneficial in the long run.  I definitely feel like this was a great anatomy starter class and that it will give me more knowledge moving into higher level anatomy courses for med school.",
    "I learned a lot more information about the human body, and I now know about all of the bones and their muscle, ligament and tendon attachments.",
    "I learned so much about anatomy and the study of bones. I feel like I have a new appreciation for my body and definitely left the course knowing more than before.",
    "Insight into human anatomy and how to get info from human remains, helpful for my future field career in archaeology.",
    "Lots of bone information!",
    "By taking this course, I feel I gained valuable knowledge and developed a variety of skills related to the human body. Not only did this course deepen my understanding of bones, it also taught me how to identify many important bony features, determine the sex of skulls and pelves, age by analyzing both molar eruption and pubic symphyses, and side various bones. While supplementing my basic knowledge of bones and their importance, this course also allowed me to develop many skills. The most important skill I learned was how to think of bones in a 3D view to better orient myself. This skill proved to be fundamental to my success in the course because it taught me the importance of context in the field of human osteology.",
    "The skills about recognizing the structures of human bones, such as sutures, fibula and skull etc, whatever in isolated bone and in whole human body skeleton. In addition, I also learned about the muscle tissue cohered with bones, which make me strengthen the whole knowledge system.",
    "Learned to recognize all of the bones in the human skeleton, as well as how to age and sex specimens of such bones. This learning included a great deal of committing to memory the features unique to each bones, as well as the soft tissues that attach to those bones.",
    "I learned to recognize all the bones in the human skeleton in addition to aging, sexing, and features on these specimens. The class required large amounts of memorization during each unit. This is especially harder during a condensed and online summer term.",
    "Learned how to identify, analyze, and compare important bones in the human body.",
    "I learned about the different bones in the body, their functions, and how to identify them.",
    "I learned how to identify every bone in the body, plus some about their function and muscle attachments. I learned how the skeleton works together as a unit. It was really interesting!",
    "This course gave me a great insight into the overall structure of the human body and how to study anatomy both in a course and lab context. It also showed me new online tools to visualize biology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is just very difficult to have this lab course be engaging online. The professor does a great job of making sure the class is consistent and does a wonderful job of helping us prepare for our exams but it does not come close to what a lab experience would be like. The majority of this course was a lecture and but I really enjoyed that the class had no homework. It really allowed me to focus on solely studying for the exams.",
    "I think that its main strength is that it made you learn all the bones in the body.",
    "This class was awesome even online.  I wish I could have seen the bones in person because that's an experience within itself.  But with the times we are in, I thought the class was perfect.",
    "I think it could be improved by going more in depth on the functions of the muscles that connect to bones.  Having the class in person would have been a lot more practical, however with the current COVID circumstances that obviously would not be possible.",
    "We took the course online so we couldn't feel any of the bones in real life and had to learn and identify them all through pictures. Although this isn't the fault of the course, I think it would definitely be better to take it in person if that is an option.",
    "Clear goals and trajectory of course. The quizzes were much more difficult than the labs, so it may be helpful to emphasize this to students before they take the first quiz.",
    "Great course.",
    "While there were a few weaknesses of this course, there were many more strengths. This course successfully introduced me to the field of human osteology by explaining the necessary context and information about bones, teaching me how to identify bones\/ bony features, and developing important skills such as aging and sex determination as related to bones. Firstly, there were many resources given to us at the beginning of the course that I found very useful and effective in supplementing the information we received during lectures. Further, these resources allowed the course to be very teachable and manageable via Zoom. Second, there were very clear expectations of us both inside and outside of class in terms of workload and preparing for lectures\/ labs\/ quizzes. Lastly, the course was well organized, ran smoothly, and made good use of class time each day which allowed me to gain the most knowledge possible. In terms of how it could be improved, I think the lectures could have been slightly more interactive in order to allow us to become more comfortable with the material we were expected to know. I also think there could have been a little bit more time set aside for questions because I felt that the lectures were sometimes rushed at the end, which left me with some lingering questions.",
    "Strengths: High professionalism.\r\nWeakness: the flexibility of time,actually the jet lag make me so tired during class. Maybe the recorded video for playing back should be available in Canvas System after class.",
    "The strengths include the quantized nature of the material (each quiz required us to memorize a discrete number of bones and features, making preparing for examinations quite manageable). I very much appreciated Professor Sargis' teaching style, even when taught through Zoom.",
    "The strengths included the ability of Prof. Sargis to distill large and difficult amounts of information into more discrete and discernible sizes. I think it would be helpful if the Professor went over siding bones more comprehensively during lecture. This is an especially difficult thing to do virtually.",
    "Remote learning was the greatest weakness for this course but it was adapted as well as it could have been. An in-person setting is best for this kind of course.",
    "It was as good as it could be considering the pandemic; having real bones to hold would be better, but obviously not possible at this time.",
    "Strengths: very clear and engaging lectures. Professor Sargis is awesome, and he's great at explaining things. He makes the course really fun. I'm not a science major at all but I thought this class was super interesting, possibly one of my favorite classes at Yale. The class was well organized, had clear expectations, and it was not hard to do well. One weakness, which maybe only happens in the online format, is that lab didn't always feel like super helpful practice for the quiz. (Labs happen on certain class days and they have questions similar to the quizzes, which we take right after lab.) The lab was a lot easier than the quizzes so it sometimes felt like I would rather just study on my own.",
    "The professor is very invested in the material. The lab really enforces the material gone over earlier. However since it was online sometimes it was difficult to differentiate features on the pictures used."

   "comments": [
    "Yes but try to take it in person.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in learning more about the human body because it is very interesting and you learn a lot.",
    "YES! If you are interested in the human body then you should definitely take this course.  Even if you aren't pre-med or science focused, this class is still super awesome and you learn a lot! Professor Sargis is also wonderful so that's definitely a plus.",
    "Yes.  For anyone who needs a social science but doesn't want a super challenging anatomy class, this is your course.  Human Osteology is very interesting, yet also very informative and detailed.",
    "Definitely! It's a great course for STEM and non-STEM people! It's definitely really incredible to be able to feel things in our own body that we're learning about in class, which makes everything feel more real and relevant.",
    "Yes, good professor and helpful info for a variety of fields.",
    "Yes! Great stuff to learn. Important information to have.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student for a few reasons. I thought the lectures and labs were very interesting and engaging, which allowed me to become more invested in the material we were learning. I also thought this course taught me many skills that will be very valuable to me, especially if I take a related course in the future. Finally, I thought the workload and expectations were very manageable.",
    "Yes. Actually I considered that this is a quite proferssional class, especially for the medical student. Although it is quite possible that I will forget the konwledge I learned in this class soon, but the ability and sleights in memory of numerous complicated new knowledges I learned in this class are beneficial with my whole memory system construction.",
    "No. I took this class in the summer and was wholly unprepared for the collosal amount of material and extremely small time frame (day) we had to prepare for the weekly quizzes. I cannot speak on behalf of the course when it's taught in person under a regular time period, but online this summer course was terrible. It was difficult to distinguish between images of bones - and even more difficult to conceptualize the human skeleton and how every structure is interrelated. During the school year, students are given a take-home skeleton, and I imagine it greatly helps in learning locations and structures. But simply using powerpoint images - and then getting different images for the exams\/quizzes made it so that I had to consult a lot of outside material to feel prepared and not bomb each quiz (there are only 4!!!! no midterm and no final). Not to mention, this class is 3 times faster in the summer, so we had 3.5 hour lectures, and it was information overload to constantly be inundated with information with only around a 20 minute break. The only reason I did okay in the class was because I spent the weekends studying 4-5 hours in advance, attended every lecture, and studied nonstop for each upcoming quiz. This class was the bane on my existence. I felt like it was impossible to retain the information after a single day of instruction and then be tested. There's no cushion if you do poorly either. I would ONLY take class if you're passionate (not merely interested like I was) about the material, or if you come in with prior knowledge\/need it for your major.",
    "Yes, I definitely would recommend this class to students interested in learning about the human skeleton, as well as some of the more analytical techniques often encountered in human archaeology. You will likely never have an opportunity to learn all these material in such an engaging and intensive way.",
    "Yes, especially if you're looking for an interesting science credit where you will learn something. The in-person version would be even better  you get to take home a full skeletal model and handle real bone samples in the lab. It would be preferable if you take the class with a friend or a study buddy because there are large amounts of information to memorize.",
    "If you're looking for a simple social science credit or if you really take interest in anthropology. Great overall introductory course to explore a new topic.",
    "Only if they are already interested in the subject; it is somewhat dry.",
    "YES! Definitely take this class!! You will learn so much with not too much work. This was probably one of my favorite classes at Yale even though I'm not a science person. Also, this class was adapted seamlessly to the online format. You wouldn't expect that with a class about bones that normally shows you real specimens. But definitely take it and know that it's a class that works great online for the fall.",
    "I would. It is different than your typical science class since it is more physical and tangible than conceptual. It gives you a new aspect of the body to study that you don't get from other courses at Yale."
