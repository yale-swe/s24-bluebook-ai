    "- confidence in writing\r\n- wide-range of types and styles of creative writing\r\n- how to incorporate social themes and personal conflicts into writing\r\n- narrative techniques",
    "I learned how to analyze creative stories and poetry, write creative pieces of my own, and also improved my written and spoken Spanish.",
    "I am now able to express myself better in Spanish in ways that I didn't think I was capable of. I also read many interesting short stories and poems that gave insight into different aspects of Spanish, Latin American, and South American culture and life.",
    "I became familiar with various forms of creative writing (e.g. poetry) and more comfortable with writing in Spanish.",
    "I learned to craft concise short stories and poems based on the models we read in class. We critiqued others' work and submitted our own writing to be workshopped. We also were encouraged to research background and history for each writer\/piece. Most notable was the lesson that fiction can achieve and portray greater truth than actual \"nonfiction\" at times, especially given politics, corruption, and censorship.",
    "I was able to develop creative writing skills in another language and also build my ability to analyze complex texts in that language as well.",
    "I learned how to think creatively and truly express myself in Spanish.",
    "Better Spanish proficiency\/fluency, I learned how to write efficiently and deliberately in a foreign language, learned how to be more confident sharing my writing even if it had mistakes.",
    "I learned to analyze readings more closely and think about the different components that make a story, but also how different authors and myself can bend those guidelines.",
    "I gained knowledge on Spanish authors and improved my writing skills as well as my ability to think creatively in Spanish."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Total freedom in writing and unconditional support from the professor. No bad things.",
    "Strengths: entertaining professor, keeps discussions interesting, lots of fun creative activities and writing, gives students a great chance to explore their imaginative side. This course also had a diversity of assignments also is a strength - independent writing, reading, answering questions, word games, partner presentations.\r\nWeaknesses: some of the pieces we read were overly complex and I gained little understanding of them. If we spent some time in class going over the plot that would've enhanced my learning.",
    "Some strengths of this course are that it is very fun and it is not too difficult at all. Profesora Mara Jordn supports all students throughout the course, and her readings are very interesting and moving. However, there are is a lot if weight placed on participation, so speaking up is very important.",
    "I love the diversity of authors\/forms of creative writing we read! I also love the different types of activities we did outside of writing traditional stories\/poems (e.g. collages). However, I do wish that there was a little bit more guidance in the beginning when it came to writing our first stories (an intimidating task!). That said, I really came to love the creative freedom we were given.",
    "Strengths: small class size means that all students are given attention; all work is edited by the professor; the class bonded very well over the course of the semester; there is a lot of room for creativity and sharing personal stories. The sense of community in this class is phenomenal. Content was also interesting; lots of genres.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some readings were on the longer side - they were good stories, but considering most of our own work was to be between 1-2 pages, brief stories might be more helpful to serve as a model. Also the comments\/feedback we received were sometimes kind of hard to read, so maybe sticking to typed comments instead of hard copy (there were only a couple of hard-copy edits) might be better.",
    "Less lengthy texts or at least an introduction to the lengthy texts before theyre assigned",
    "I don't think it has any weaknesses. Course is fun and engaging and overall super enjoyable.",
    "Strengths include a wide diversity of authors and readings as well as ample opportunities to engage in class discussion. An area of improvement would be to facilitate more student-student interaction and to get students to interact with different peers each time as everyone had unique insight which would have been interesting to talk with about.",
    "Excellent, engaging course. Deadlines could be clearer for daily homework."

    "No doubt. Loved the class. Helped me developed my passion for writing",
    "Full disclosure: I took this course to fill my L5 language requirement because Span 150 was full. Coming into the course, I did not like creative writing, and did not want to put much effort into the course. That being said, Maria Jordan is an excellent professor who made the class as interesting as it could've been for me. If you are at all interested in creative writing, take this course!! If you want to just fill a language requirement like me, sure take this course, but know what you are getting in to.",
    "I definitely recommend this course for any student who wants to take L5 Spanish. Profesora Mara Jordn is incredibly nice, fun, and supportive. The workload is very manageable and engaging. The only thing is that you have to be willing to participate in class a lot, as that is a large portion of your grade. But, Mara Jordn makes it easy to participate and encourages everyone from all backgrounds of Spanish language abilities.",
    "I 100% recommend this course to another student! As a non-native speaker, I was intimidated to take a creative writing class in Spanish, but Mara makes the class so low-stress and enjoyable. Everyone leaves the class feeling like a writer!",
    "I'd definitely recommend taking this course! I think it's helpful to read poetry and prose in a different language because the culture and history you get from it is different from that of English classes and helps expand your worldview. There's a lot to learn from the styles of other students and from what they share of themselves. My favorite part of the class was reading about personal experiences and getting to know the other students. The highlight of the course was finding a welcoming community in the class and professor - I felt that the class bonded, and that's not something I've experienced in any of my other classes at Yale before.",
    "Yes because it is a small and laidback class that allows you to truly learn and engage.",
    "I would recommend this course to literally anyone who is at the L5 level. The teacher is amazing and the course was actually a form of stress relief from my other classes.",
    "YES!!! This class was so much fun and I learned so so much. Professor Jordan is an inspiring professor--hands down one of the most passionate people I've ever met.",
    "Yes. I would absolutely recommend this course, native speaker or not. It offers a wide range of authors and styles of writing while simultaneously providing an outlet for your own creativity and improvement. The professor is wonderful too and creates a very warm and open environment.",
    "This course is valuable in the sense that it forces you to step out of the box and use your imagination. It challenges you ability to think creatively in a different language which I think ultimately solidifies your fluency in Spanish."
