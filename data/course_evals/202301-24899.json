I especially enjoyed the open and inclusive discussion environment with the well structured classes. The final conference style activity was also beneficial in introducing me to this format of work."

Conversations generally flowed well and were productive. The readings were compelling and informative, and the visit to the Beinecke at the beginning of the semester was super cool. Overall, this was a great class! I don't have any suggestions for improvements.",
                "Strengths: the syllabus. Loved it. The class discussions were wonderful too. For some reason, there were many students that did not always speak up, but I enjoyed the class discussions nevertheless. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, it was hard to manage all the readings. They were all wonderful, but coming to class, it was clear that every person did different readings. Maybe picking ONE primary source and situating the secondary readings around it. So that no matter what kinds of readings each person did, we could still all contribute to one discussion.",
                "Strengths: well-structured classes and course progression. A bit of reading from each era and more than one country. Feedback from Prof Roosien was very helpful and direct. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the format of the seminar is inherently dependent on discussion from students. When students are quiet (me) or at times underprepared, the instructor may find it difficult to carry through the class."
