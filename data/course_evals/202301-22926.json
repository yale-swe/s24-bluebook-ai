                "I learned a lot about various nonfiction essay writing techniques. The most important insight that I gained from the course is to \"rewrite, rewrite, and rewrite\". I found it such a valuable experience that forced me to sit down with my nonfiction writing for weeks and try to improve it draft after draft. This is what being a good writer is about, continuously coming up with new thoughts and ideas as you write. I never ended up at the place where I thought I would end up and Dr. Saraceni applauded me for it."

                "Strengths: reading for craft is a very interesting way to read, and I learned a lot from analyzing writing in this way. Prof. Saraceni is also incredibly kind and provides lots of feedback on essays. The draft-revision structure of ENGL 120 is also amazing, as it gives you time to reflect on your work and improve it, something many classes don't do. The workshops are also really cool, getting to read your peers' work.\r\nWeaknesses: not much to say. Sometimes class discussions could be more engaging.",

                "The course does a great job of improving writing skills of students. However, like most English classes, the grading and feedback is wildly subjective.",
                "No weaknesses! One strength for this course was the small number of students per class that allowed the students to get each other really well through their writing. The readings were extremely helpful for writing essays I had never written before.",
                "I really enjoyed this course and the seminar format of this course. However, there were some times when we would look at essays and say things just to say things. The essays did not resonate with everyone. I wonder if a unique addition to this course could be a day built into each section of the class (humor, place, person) when everyone can submit an essay that they like that fits in each section. This more personal communication between classmates was why I really loved the workshops when everyone was able to read a new essay."

I started off the class thinking I could only write boring analytical papers and walked out thinking hey, I do have a voice for not just my thoughts but my feelings and experiences as well.",
                "There actually are not that many essays for a writing credit (only three 4-pagers and one 2-pager). However you need to do a revision for each. I believe its difficult to get an A in the class, and it largely depends on whether or not the teacher likes you.",
                "Yes, this class helped me realize how much I loved writing and gave me freeway to add creativity to it, while keeping it as nonfiction.",
