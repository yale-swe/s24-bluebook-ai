However, I think this class could've improved with less assignments. Some were helpful, but often it felt like busy work when I had to complete the Lingco vocab review sessions in particular."

                "Certainly. I'm surprised by how much I can understand now compared to when I started the class. The workload is heavy, but the homework always felt tangibly helpful. It never felt unreasonable.",
                "I would, but only if you're interested in moving into more difficult topics, and not just conversational Chinese. It's a lot of work but it's very do-able, so long as you stay on top of your Canvas."
