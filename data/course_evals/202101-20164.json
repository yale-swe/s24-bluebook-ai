I have learned so much about post-colonial theory, the politics of language and naming, asked question about what it means to study \"English\" or to brand a world literature \"Anglophone,\" and so much more. I've also improved as a writer and learned how to better interpret really complicated theoretical readings. Such an amazing, eye-opening class!",

                "Strengths: without doubt the strength of this course is Steph. She is the type of Professor you genuinely look forward to seeing every class. The material is interesting but the way Steph facilitates class discussion is so so so informative. She pushes you to think critically and creatively about texts. While I had read some of these novels prior to the class, I gained a completely new perspective on them. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I could not name a weakness in this course. It is a book a week but the readings are so fascinating this is not a problem.",
                "I wish this course gave a set schedule for the reading so that it would be more structured. I really liked the discussion posts that we had to make.",
                "This was an outstanding course, truly one of the best I've taken at Yale. The reading list, Professor Newell, the small class size, the other students in the class, and the assignments were all geared towards engaging critically with the material. The only weakness was just sometimes I felt there was too much reading and I didn't have time to complete all of it, even though I badly wanted to.",
                "Steph is the best professor EVER! Such a strength  the readings are FANTASTIC! And discussions are so much fun, too. Our class was also so brilliant that I learned so much from my classmates, too. The only sort of downside is that sometimes the readings are super long - that being said you feel so accomplished looking back and seeing how much you've done!!",
                "The main strength of this course is that Steph really cares about her students and the topic, and she encourages us to go above and beyond in our thinking. Personally, I felt more intellectually alive than I ever had with another course, and it's all thanks to Steph and her awesome syllabus. One weakness is the sometimes stifling political tangents that some students can go on not every student in the class has the same opinions, and since some of our discussions were built upon assumptions that I fundamentally disagreed with, it was sometimes difficult to participate since I didn't want to throw off the harmony of the class. But these were small occurrences, and overall I loved the course."

                "YES!!! I cannot tell you how much you should take this course. The novels are very interesting but Steph makes this course a must take. It is without doubt the best class I have taken at Yale purely because of her. She just cares so much about her students and is so brilliant. Every one on one interaction with her has further confirmed her kindness and just immense intellect. Before you get to Yale I think there are always stories of incredible professors and she is one of them. She has single handedly reversed my cynicism surrounding Yale faculty. If you are even remotely interested in fiction please please please take this class.",
