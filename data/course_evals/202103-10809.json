We covered topics such as social determinants of health, social construction of illness, healthism, medicalization, physician authority, insurance, clinical ethics, patient movements, and medical technologies, among others.",
                "You learn a bunch of sociological concepts relating to health that are all very interesting. It's hard to know how these would be applied in the real world, but are interesting nonetheless.",
                "I feel as though I bettered my ability to read papers critically. My writing has become clearer and I was able to focus my papers on a topic that really interested me. I learned a lot about inequality within the US healthcare system and how it compares to other systems around the world.",
                "This course definitely broadened my perspective by giving me a sociological perspective of medicine and the healthcare industry. As a future doctor, I took this course in order to learn more about inequities in healthcare, especially with regards to disparities based on race or socioeconomic status. SOCY 127 definitely helped me to understand more about the fundamental causes of disease and the factors that shape an individual's experience of illness.",

                "I learned about different global health systems, how people rarely know how to differentiate between a disease and an illness, and how medication plays a huge role in our lives.",
                "My perspective on the American medical system changed SO much by taking this course. You learn about the AMA, medicalization, and insurance models.",
                "In this class I learned so much about health and health inequalities, including topics like healthism, medicalization, patient activism, health insurance, public health, the pharmaceutical industry, etc. We learned about these phenomenon and concepts by looking at specific illnesses and public health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and pregnancy.",

                "I learned about the sociological aspect of disease and illnesses in which ways it applies to our current society through the social determinants of health. I also learned how to look at ads and see how pharmaceutical companies socially contrast a disease and how they target their markets in their ads. I also learned how to make sociological arguments in our final research project.",

                "Strengths: The readings were very interesting and relevant to the concepts we covered in class. The lectures were interesting and the topics covered in class were applied to current events. Weaknesses: None",
                "I would say the biggest weakness was section. There has to be something more helpful and interesting to do than annotations each week.",
                "The course is very interesting at the start of the semester but gets a little dry when studying patient activism. The course can have a lot of reading at times which can be hard to complete and then actively participate in the discussions. All of the assignments are very similar, it would be nice to have more assignments like the first one (which was an analysis of an advert).",
                "This course was structured in a very easy-to-understand way, with lecture slides posted and in-person lectures taught in an engaging way. It would have been useful to have the choice to attend zoom lectures or to watch posted lectures, but it's understandable that not every professor provides this option. The only weakness was the discussion sections-- we usually discussed material and readings from a few weeks prior, meaning that many students did not remember specifics and couldn't effectively contribute to the discussion. The discussion sections should be structured to go over the same week's readings. Otherwise, the material was very engaging and I actually enjoyed reading the texts the professor gave us, even if they were often long. The course could be improved by creating more opportunities for interactive learning--for example, by inviting medical professionals or sociologists to give guest lectures.",
                "Very well taught and sections were useful! Didn't feel like I really learned the second part of the course because we were not tested on it, but I appreciate the learning environment that was created.",
                "I think having weekly reading responses or some sort of reflection could be helpful for facilitating discussion in sections.",
                "Perhaps one more writing assignment?",
                "The course was well-organized and the Professor was great. Section could be more organized and engaging. I think everyone should take this class because the topic is so important.",
                "Strengths --> The course content is fascinating! Grading was quite clear, with rubrics and examples for almost all assignments. Both the professor and TAs are invested in your success in the course. My section was great!\r\n\r\nWeakness --> At times lectures can get boring, but Prof. Menon does try to get class engagement and she is pretty funny! The lectures are about as good as a lecture can be!",
                "This course is great but mainly for students who have already taken previous sociology courses. Some of the course concepts were hard to understand in sociological terms. However, despite this challenge, there was a great class structure.",
                "STRENGTHS: kind professor, engaging material, great lectures\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: would be good to have more resources for writing the final paper",
                "There are so many strengths to this course, including how clear and easy to follow the lectures were, how Professor Menon is able to explain course concepts, and how the setup of the course is manageable and does not include busywork (one quiz, notetaking, discussion section). Discussion sections were often experience-based and were always engaging as well. I don't think there are any real weaknesses to the course.",
                "Strengths: organization, engaging and applicable material, supportive environment.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course was well-taught with an engaging lecturer and well-organized slides and concepts, especially given such a broad subject. The readings were relevant and the structure of classes felt like a good balance between strict lecturing and questions/answers. As for improvement... maybe a little more clarity on the specific subject of each reading regarding what we learned in class (again, most were relevant, but sometimes it was difficult to discern how).",
                "I think that the lectures should have been recorded. I really liked how hands on the conversations during sections are and how this paves the way for an opportunity to express your opinions.",
                "This was a very strong course overall; the lectures were excellent and engaging, the readings were interesting and relevant, and the assignments were very fair and added to the other material. The section discussions were also interesting, and led by students.",
                "Strength: Professor Menon!!! She was a great lecturer and she's very accommodating. The concepts are very interesting to learn about and the readings are insightful.\r\nWeakness: too many readings which can be hard to stay on top of.",
                "Professor Menon is definitely one of the best part of the course: she is incredibly engaging, passionate, and knowledgable about the material. The only weakness that I could think of is that there did not seem to really be a point to having section. Not much was discussed, and it was rather just 50 minutes that was spent discussing 1 or 2 readings from that week instead of course concepts.",
                "The material was honestly quite surface level - basic concepts with sociological names attached. Keep in mind that this is fairly normal in introductory social science courses. The teaching and lectures for the class were great though.",
                "I wish there were more regular assignments to engage students and ensure understanding of course topics.",
                "The lectures could be more engaging!!",
                "The strengths of this course are that it is easy to follow along if lecture is attended. I do not believe the weekly discussion section was necessary and felt that it could have been structured differently so as to actually help understanding course concepts.",
                "Not much enforcement of readings and not a lot of graded assignments",
                "Liked the fact that we had recorded mini lectures. Sometimes I couldn't make class and having this resource really made it not a stressful thing; I could watch the lecture after the fact.",
                "The class structure provided a way to engage with class material regularly with hypothesis annotations and alternate forms of material such as podcasts and videos, which particularly helped my engagement.",
                "Professor Menon is very engaging and I enjoyed her lectures. I also really like the structure of the course and the assignments were always very interesting. I think the only weakness was keeping up with vocabulary and key terms, but Professor Menon provided a list midway through the semester and that made it much easier.",
                "Having a small section with a TF was a tremendous strength because it really broke down the material.",
                "The strengths of the class were that the lectures had very interesting and engaging material. In addition, I found the discussion sections to be very helpful in understanding the concepts and discussing some of the readings assigned for class. I don't believe there to be any weaknesses to this class however the course could be improved if there were workshops or more resources to help with writing a paper on sociological argument.",
                "I feel like we covered a lot of width but not much depth. If we spent a bit more time on things, it might have been better.",
                "I loved all the concepts that were taught in this class. This is exactly what I want to do with my life. Loved it.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- It's very readings based and a little less STEM-oriented than expected\r\n- The workload isn't too demanding, there's no curve, and Dr. Menon & the TA's are really nice!",

Also Professor Menon is kind and very funny.",
                "Yes! This course covers a wide range of topics and teaches you how to to think about health and illness from a social perspective. The readings are very interesting and the concepts covered in class are very relevant to happenings in today's medicine and society.",
                "Yes absolutely. It's not much work and you'll learn a ton in a very warm and safe environment. Prof Menon is one of my favorite teachers I've had.",
                "Yes, if you wish to connect the dots between the structure of the healthcare system and how it can cause many inequalities. This course really showed how intertwined economic security, race, gender, class, and many more factors all link with health care.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The workload is not bad, especially because the professor goes over the material in the readings during class. there is also only a quiz and a final project in terms of assessments. I would definitely recommend all pre-meds to take this class, because it will give you a more holistic view of the medical field and the inequities that still exist in the healthcare system.",
                "Yes! Take for a broad overview if you are generally interested in health. If you've already taken other intro level health classes (like global health challenges and responses), then this class would be repetitive.",

                "Yes! Lecture content is great, you learn a lot about the context of health for me in ways I never had thought about before. It made me want to pursue projects related to the ones we talked about in class and take other classes in HSHM.",
                "Yes! I definitely believe that anyone remotely interested in medicine, sociology, public health, etc. should take this course. The content was incredibly interesting and formatted in a way that was engaging and made a lot of sense! It really is a good foundational course to have.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in the intersection between medical and human issues.",
                "Yes! Great course that I think everyone should take. This class has work and assignments that are spread out through the semester so it does not get overwhelming at any point. Readings are great and varied. Course was well organized, take this class if you can!",
                "DEF take this course if you're interested in learning about the American medical system. workload is super low, only final paper, easy quiz, and drafts of the paper. you don't necessarily have to do all the readings (tho you should to participate in section and because they're actually interesting). you need to go to all the lectures to do well on the quiz",
                "Absolutely! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in public health or medicine, who is looking for a social science credit, or who is interested in sociology. It is not only highly engaging, but the workload is manageable and intentional, and Professor Menon is an incredible lecturer.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE. It was super engaging, and I always left lecture feeling like what I was learning was directly applicable to my life, and that I understood the work around me better. Take this course even if you aren't working in healthcare. Given the pandemic, this course provided context for a lot of decisions that took place.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in health inequalities, structural racism, healthcare systems, or just how our concepts of health and illness have been developed. It exposed me to concepts I had never even heard of before and I found myself leaving each class feeling that I genuinely learned something new. Professor Menon is kind and brilliant and weaves in her own research beautifully. This was easily my favorite class this semester.",
                "I think this is a really good introductory course for Sociology. I would recommend taking this class since the workload is not as much but it still is a class that provides a lot of knowledge to students.",
                "I would if they are curious about public health and want to get a sense of what the field of study is like.",

If you are pre-med or looking into the healthcare field, take this course!",

                "Yes. Interesting material and reasonable workload--just section and a few papers throughout the sem. Completely manageable course, and well worth it for what you learn.",

                "Yes. It's a great intro class for people interested in health matters and sociology.",
                "I definitely would and already have. It was very interesting with a low work load. I was never stressed out about this class and I think that led me to enjoy it more.",
                "It depends... If you're looking to get an easy social science credit done then definitely yes. If you're a data driven statistician with public health experience (or just experienced with public health) this is almost certainly not for you... If you're looking for an entry level course into public health then maybe this would be a good fit.\r\n\r\nThis course was less about numbers and more about readings like a history class, which some might find surprising...",
                "Yes. It was an amazing course. I learned so many things about the different inequities of health care as well as how people dealt with them overtime."
