                "The course was very well-planned out and offered lots of opportunities for student feedback, which I appreciated. At the same time, I did feel that the workload of the course was certainly intensive. While there was the opportunity for accommodation, the circumstances of the pandemic had just already made things difficult for me. Other than that, the course was really well taught and was a natural step after GREK 131.",
                "Strengths: manageable homework schedule, dynamic teaching fellow, occasional outside readings, in class presentation of slideshow on shared screen so as to simulate a classroom, intimate class size (very important to be directly participating multiple times in class in order to enhance one's understanding of the language in practice).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "This course was excellent! I really enjoyed the coverage of the material especially in reading the selected books of the Odyssey. The pacing of the class was perfect and I really wouldn't change a thing.",
                "This class was overall very strong. The reading pace was fast, and in the beginning we did struggle to keep up with the syllabus, but we eventually improved a lot in speed. Sylva's course design was excellent-- weekly vocabulary lists were super helpful and useful, presentations on certain grammar, meter, etc constructions were useful and very well integrated with the text. I not only gained a lot of knowledge of Homer but I also feel my Greek overall is much better and my skills with close reading. The assessment design was excellent, especially the final."
