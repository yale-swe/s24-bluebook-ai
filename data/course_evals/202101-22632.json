If student's are engaged, the semester will be filled with conversation-rich discussions and debates surrounding the course material. If student's aren't engaged, then the class may feel long at times. However, Professor Turner always did a great job of discussing the key themes associated with that week's readings.",

                "I really enjoyed the blog post assignments. I thought learning about a specific agency was very fruitful. I think the discussion could have been better if it came a little bit more from the class and less from the instructor. It might have been helpful to have students partially lead class on some days with the discussion questions we came up with.",
                "Interesting material but the class ultimately ends up being pretty theory heavy. Would love to have had more opportunities to try and apply the theory to case studies",
