    "I learned a ton about reading scientific papers and dissecting their figures\/findings in particular. I also developed my own scientific writing and analysis skills.",
    "Reading primary literature in cell biology. Also, understanding commonly used lab techniques in molecular and cell bio.",
    "I learnt how to interpret scientific journals to an entire new level. \r\nIt really helped me and was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale - it really helped me with senior research too",
    "How to extract from a paper the most important information from experiments.",
    "I learned how to read papers critically and analyze them. I also learned a lot about how to write succinctly about summarizing papers.",
    "You really learn how to read and understand a scientific paper.",
    "Learned how to thoroughly read research papers and be able to understand the methods fully as well as what was done in each figure. I also learned how to succinctly  explain the important aspects of the papers with the reading responses.",
    "Learned how to both deeply read a more difficult scientific paper, as well as discern its main takeaways, primarily by the results and figures. An important skill as a scientist.",
    "It was great practice reading journal articles in depth every week.",
    "This class focuses on the cytoskeleton and several cytoskeletal proteins. You gain a lot of insight and understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern many of the processes that you learn about in the lower level bio courses."

    "The class has a nice format that allows you to definitely put work in, but also recognizes that you're a senior  you have to read a paper every week, and then you get to pick 5 reading responses + a presentation day + your final paper.",
    "Strengths: The professor is amazing, she's extremely knowledgeable and kind. The discussions are very interesting because everyone cares about the topics. One of the best classes I've taken. Assignments and grading are very fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: can't really think of one. Maybe more discussion? Nothing really.",
    "Nothing negative - course was amazing",
    "Strengths: Focusing on various proteins and their roles in diseases, being able to demonstrate this knowledge during class discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can really think of.",
    "Strengths: not much of a workload, engaging class, wonderful professors\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I wish we talked more about the background of papers more than the methods",
    "I don't think there are any weaknesses. Prof C is amazing!!",
    "Nothing it was fantastic.",
    "Class is bope",
    "I liked how the course was designed with weekly readings and reading responses as well as one presentation. I think it helped me to engage with the material."

    "Definitely! Its a great way to solidify your biological knowledge and analysis skillsspecific to the cytoskeleton and more broadly across biological literature in general. Its also a neat, rare opportunity to have a seminar in STEM.",
    "Absolutely. Interesting, informative, helpful, chill class for MCDB seniors. You will learn a lot and will end up feeling confident about reading primary literature. Take it.",
    "Definitely recommend this class to anyone that loves science.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! Dean C is a wonderful professor and her enthusiasm for the class makes it that much more enjoyable. The class does not have a heavy workload at all so it's a great class if you have a busy semester or are a senior.",
    "If you are an MCDB major and need a 350+ class (or even if you don't), this is a great MCDB course. It is super manageable, there is no need to cram for any exams, and Professor Chandhoke is great in all ways.",
    "I would definitely recommend.",
    "Yes! Awesome topics were covered throughout the semester.",
    "Absolutely. You learn how to critically read a scientific paper but are not overwhelmed with courseload. Perfect class.",
    "Class is a high level MCDB gut! Prof. Chandhoke is also a GOAT.",
    "Definitely! It's great to be able to take an MCDB seminar, especially because most MCDB classes are lecture style. This was a good way to engage with the primary literature. Dean C is great!"
