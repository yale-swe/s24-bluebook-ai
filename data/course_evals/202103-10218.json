            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Prof Karell was very meticulous with his lectures and really seemed like he cared about what he was teaching and if we understood it. If a student had a question he couldn't answer in class, he would always follow up with them later in class, over email, or in the next lecture. Weaknesses: I wish we could have spent more time in lecture going over how to do certain statistical functions in R earlier in the year; I came into this class having never coded at all and at first doing the PSets were overwhelming! After he got mid-semester feedback, though, he spent more time on R which was helpful. The replication project was also difficult but I understand why we had to do it.",
                "The course was very informative and helped me to learned a lot about quantitative methods related to social sciences. It would have been helpful to have more prompt feedback regarding the problem sets and more review of course materials in the subsections.",
                "Daniel is very responsive, willing to meet outside of class, and clearly committed to helping us learn the material. That said, I think because it was his first time teaching the course, there were definitely times where class could have been more engaging. I would have appreciated more time to practice R together in class. While the content itself was similar between lectures and problem sets, we rarely spent time in class practicing coding. As somebody totally new to R, it was challenging to feel like I understood material conceptually and had absolutely no idea how to implement these methods in code.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it attempts to introduce students to the world of statistics and coding in R and that the professor was very easy to reach out to for help. However, the course itself presents so much information that it is difficult to master any one concept in either area. Additionally, the course packs about 70% of your grade into the last month of the class (a p-set, project, and exam), so that was a bit stressful. The replication project and exam back to back was not very helpful in terms of learning, so maybe the replication project can be completed earlier in the semester, and then the exam could stay as is.",
                "I think that in terms of the concepts we learned, this class was great for accommodating all levels of statistics understanding. You were able to ask a lot of questions, and a ton of review was built into the class, so that it was easy to understand complex topics. I think that was a huge strength of the class and something I wish I saw in more Yale courses. \r\n\r\nMy major complaint with this class is with it not really being suitable for R beginners. On the course listing it said it was recommended but not required, but I think it probably should be, or the course should have more direct instruction with R. I struggled with coding throughout the class, and while my TA was wonderful and able to help, I didn't feel like I was learning practical R skills because I was so busy keeping my head above water. Professor Karell is great about explaining complicated statistics concepts and I think I would have really benefited from more R instruction from him.",
                "Strengths: It was a good idea for Professor Karrell to provide r markdown files of the lectures before each class. He should do that at the start of the semester. Professor Karrell was very responsive to email. Professor Karrell was also flexible and generally understanding and funny.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was a bad idea for Professor Karrell to assign a 3rd problem set, a statistical replication project, and a take home final exam to be due all within 1.5 weeks of each other. He said that he gave us more than enough time for the statistical replication project, but many of us, having never done a replication project before, ran into unforeseen circumstances. Because of this, the end of the semester was very stressful. Professor Karrell also needs to be better at editing his slides. He always had typos in his slides and when someone would ask a question, he would blame it on the professor who he inherited the slides from. He also had typos in his assignments. This made it difficult to build confidence in my ability to do statistics because I was never really sure if I was encountering a typo or if I just didn't know what I was doing. For the statistics replication project, he should consider providing mini-assignments along the way to help alleviate the end of semester rush. Maybe the first assignment can be selecting an article, then the next assignment can be data cleaning, and then so forth. Also, he said that learning r would not be the focus of this class. If that's the case, then the course should be modified to lessen the importance of being able to code in r. If you didn't know how to code for this class you most likely failed because everything we did hinged on being able to code in r. There was not enough emphasis on the actual concepts. Something else he could do if he wants to keep things the same is to provide the code we need for everything so that we are just focusing on demonstrating our understanding of the concepts, instead of demonstrating our ability to code in r. Lastly, if coding in r really is that important, maybe he can do a \"flipped classroom\" type of thing where he does mini-lectures on how to code and posts them to Canvas. That way he doesn't have to spend class time doing it and he doesn't have to field endless questions via email.",
                "Having the slides online and including R code within them were a big strengths in my opinion, but I wish we had taken more time to learn R and to go over expectations for assignments in class. I know that we didnt have much time to get through all the material, but maybe there could be more fusion between using R and the material.",
                "I think Daniel and my TA Hannah were very good and thoughtful. I, personally, thought the class went well, but I do know it was a bit more challenging for other folks. I've coded before, so I could focus on the content. But, for everyone else, they have to do coding AND content. So, it can be a bit more challenging. The other small weakness is sometimes some of the wording in the PSETs can be a bit vague, which creates a series of questions\/answers between the professor and other students that makes the problem even more confusing. Overall, it only happened a few times.",
                "different time and spread out over multiple days",
                "Overall solid course. I think the problem sets could have been more spread out, to match course materials. There was quite the load at the end of the course, which was stressful. The replication project was super interesting, but I was distracted from that due to the problem set\/exam. Also I couldn't have really completed the replication project earlier, due to the material covered. I also would have appreciated discussing the problem sets after completing them, to understand the objectives more clearly.",
                "I thought that a huge strength of this course was how open and communicative the teaching staff all were (TAs and Professor).",
                "I think the once-a-week model has its benefits, but Im not sure it is right for this course. I found the lectures to be quite long and not particularly engaging, although the professor nicely incorporated student feedback in changing the course structure over the semester, which I quite appreciated.",
                "The course benefited from a well organized structure that helped take students form basic methods and concepts to more complex techniques. Working through coding examples in lecture and section was very helpful for gaining skills in R. Additionally, concepts and examples given in readings were supplemented by different examples in lecture. One limitation of the readings + lecture approach is that certain concepts and approaches that came up in readings were not given much time in lecture. Finding ways to more clearly situate those secondary concepts in the larger structure  of the course would be helpful (even if they won't be examined in depth), and ensure that they are not overlooked or forgotten. Additionally, having an even more clear and consistent approach to how students engage with the lectures, would be beneficial (for example, more consistent releases of R documents to follow along with lectures and a set time for interactive activities in R or elsewhere, sharing outlines of the coming class before sessions etc.). Lastly, more opportunities and stronger encouragement of group work would be helpful, especially for students more new to the course topics.",
                "i think this class covered an incredibly wide span of content, i acknowledge that trying to balance the statistics content with the learning R component is difficult, but if there was a way to spend more time on integrating R into the lecture or making extra video resources more available, that would have been greatly appreciated, but overall i still managed to learn a lot throughout the course of the semester",
                "The course is a good QR for non-STEM majors, and it is a very manageable workload throughout the semester. However, it does all catch up to you at the end. In December, we had a pset, a project, and the final exam due about a week apart from each other, totaling to about 70% of grade being determined in the last few weeks of the semester. I think the class would be better organized if the replication project were a midterm assignment, so that the end of the semester can be a little less heavy. I would have also liked a bit more time devoted to learning R from the beginning of the semester, since I didn't have any background. However, Prof. Karell did listen to mid-semester feedback and start incorporating R practice later in the semester. Besides this, I think the class is great, and since this was the first time Prof. Karell taught it, I think it'll just get better.",
                "difficult to use R on psets and finals when it is not taught in class\r\nmeeting once a week is difficult (should have more instruction time, i dont know if this can be changed)\r\nclass felt unorganized\r\nsections were a huge help and incredible thank you to the TFs"

                "I wish that I could recommend this course to another student because Daniel cares about our success and clearly wants the class to be successful, but I did not have a great experience. If I were to choose again, I would just take a standard statistics course. I would prefer a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts behind the code and could apply that strong foundation to my work in the social sciences. This class felt so geared towards people in the qualitative social sciences that it skimped on the mathematical reasoning behind the quantitative methods that I had hoped to learn.",
                "Take this class only if you need it and if you already have some experience in statistics and in R. It can be very difficult to keep up in the class if you haven't encountered the information before.",
                "I don't think I would unless they knew R already. It's great for a statistics review and I'm glad I took it because my original statistics class was interrupted by going online for COVID. I would just stay to be prepared and know that you would have to learn a LOT of R on your own to do well and not be stressed.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they were already well-versed in r.",
                "I would recommend it to a student interested in the logistics of statistics, but maybe not to one who is only curious about the role of statistics in social science more broadly.",

                "I would recommend this course as a good introduction to statistical analysis!",
                "I would recommend the course to someone who wants to major in sociology or is looking for a QR credit that will teach them some of the basics of quantitative methods.",
                "I really want to recommend this course because of Professor Karell. My biggest advice to you if you take this course is do not freak out--it's going to be very difficult at first. This class is an introductory course in mathods, which also makes it an introductory R course. A lot of people in it had never even used R, so you can imagine how the first problem set went. Looking back, I think a lot of us worried much more than was merited; you get thrown in the deep end a bit at first, but when you do learn what you're doing it feels so rewarding. Professor Karell is very receptive to student feedback and tweaked the course format so he would have more time in class to help us learn basic R code, and the TAs always answered problem set questions and worked on R concepts in section. As long as you go to lectures, go to section, and always attempt the problem sets so you have some specific points you can ask for help on, you will do alright in this class. One more note: the end of the semester was a bit challenging if you didn't plan out your final project beforehand, as there's also a final exam. They introduce the final project in the first half of the semester, so if you start casual work on it then and you'll be done probably before the last class period and have more time to ask for help!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in adding some quantitative research methods to their repertoire (especially those whose own interests skew towards the qualitative!) The topics and techniques discussed are interesting and readily applicable to a variety of research areas in the social sciences and beyond. Students with previous statistics experience will find some course topics to be review, but even so the use of social science examples and coding in R provide valuable new skills.",
                "yes! as difficult as it was at times since i kind of went into it with limited high school background in statistics and no background in coding, it definitely made me come to appreciate the ways in which stats can be used to make some kind of sense of the things that can be observed in the world. this class has made me want to potentially pursue a statistics and data science certificate!",
                "Unless you have to take this course, I dont recommend it. It is a semi-easy QR, but there are definitely better out there. If I didnt already have a background in R, I would have been completely lost.",
                "I would, if you need to take this class for the Sociology requirement or if you're a non-STEM major looking for a QR you can actually get something out of and isn't a gut.",
