                "Usually, I'm not a huge fan of a flipped classroom, but I think that structure suited this class perfectly. The video lectures made the material really understandable, and then class provided a great opportunity to make sure I really understood the material.",
                "Strengths: the class is taught in reverse classroom format, where you watch the lectures as pre-recorded videos before class and then do activities and problems in class to better understand the content. At first, I didn't think I was going to enjoy this format, but I actually loved it!! Being able to watch the lectures at any speed I wanted and pause it any time to take really detailed notes helped me learn the content a lot better than if it had been the classic lecture format. This way we got to learn each new bit of content twice, which was really helpful. The problem sets are very reasonable and direct applications of the lecture content. Jeff is a great lecturer and a very fun guy. I had a great time in this class! Weaknesses: Not really a weakness, but a warning: the exams are mostly just memorization of really small details. The final didn't feel as reasonable as the midterm or problem sets.",
                "Strengths: straightforward assignments, engaging lectures & great lecturer. I don't think the amount of content in the class is a weakness, but it is a lot!",
                "I think the flipped class aspect of the course was entirely unnecessary, and the videos were far too long to expect us to watch them all the way through before every class. Students with any substantial workload in other courses will skim these videos or not watch them at all and do perfectly fine in the course without them. I think these should be condensed somehow, as it would be helpful to have background info before coming to class and engaging with the material, but the videos are not the way to do it.",
                "The course felt very disorganized, and there was a lot of information. It was flipped classroom with long recorded lectures, so functionally there were four lectures per week.",
                "Although I usually don't enjoy this format, I thought the flipped classroom teaching style was incredibly effective. Going over key problems and questions in class while combining emphasis upon both conceptual and mathematical approaches truly helped me understand the material. The interactive component made classes engaging, and I always grasped concepts that might have been confusing after the recorded lectures. Professor Kenney is also generally an engaging and entertaining lecturer with a large amount of knowledge of the subject. The recorded lectures were a significant time investment in addition to the problem sets, and the same material was often covered in class, along with helpful problems. I wish that there were less overlap between the recorded lectures and the class, in order to make the time spent on the recordings feel more worthwhile."

                "Yes!",
                "If you're an astro major, this is a required class for the major, but I do highly recommend it! Aside from ASTR 330, this was my favorite class for the major. If you're not an astro major, as long as you've taken ASTR 210 and have some prior understanding of galaxies, I also recommend it! It's a fun time and you learn a ton.",
                "Im a junior in the astro major whos finished pretty much everything except senior thesis, and this was 100% my favorite class in the major. It is a LOT of contentthere are lecture videos to watch before each class, which genuinely will make your experience a lot easieras well as the in-class lesson, where you process & expand on that content. But if you care about galaxies at all, its super engaging material. Prof K is an incredible lecturer, goes to lengths to make the class engaging/easy to participate in, and is very communicative. I will say it is MUCH more memorization heavy than the other classes in the major. If youre not an astro major but are exploring after enjoying 210, please be aware it is nothing like 210; it is comparatively much harder and far more work. Exams can be detailed and tough, but I think they were still very fair. Psets were quite fair and balanced. Overall, I learned so much here and genuinely enjoyed learning it. I really cannot recommend 310 enough; I already miss going to this class!!",
                "The class was fun and the material was interesting. The course was honestly disorganized, however, which seems to be a theme in the Yale astronomy department. The material is not a struggle to understand, but it takes a lot more time than it should to go through the material because of redundancies in slides, mismatches between the book and the lectures, and things that are unclear. The material is not difficult but at times it is unnecessarily confusing.",
                "Only if you're taking it for major credit.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to Astro and Physics majors. Great overview of galaxies and the class develops skills of inference and deductive reasoning. The workload can be annoying at times (1 to 1.5 hours of recorded lectures plus the two weekly in-class lectures) but the psets made up for it because they were often short and not too challenging (doable in an hour or two, max). Prof Kenney is a great lecturer with an awesome sense of humor, encouraging student participation and keeping everyone in the class engaged.",
                "This class is required for Astro majors, but I would recommend it to any student interest in astronomy or astrophysics looking for a deeper understanding beyond the content of Astro 210. I found Astro 210 to be a much more surface-level course, while in Astro 310 we study in-depth the key components and behavior of galaxies and their sources. This course felt rewarding in how much I learned throughout the semester and has a great blend of both conceptual and mathematical understanding. However, students should be prepared to take on watching the recorded lectures in addition to the problem sets each week."
