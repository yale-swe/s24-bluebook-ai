                "I think the teaching is extremely conducive to learning a new language and lessons are well planned. I do think it could be improved by allowing for a little more flexibility especially considering we are still dealing with Covid. I also think sometimes having connect assignments listed separately from all other work on canvas can be confusing.",
                "Only one suggestion: maybe dont schedule a final project, homework, and exam for a period of a few days in the last week of classes. The final exam period exists for a very good reason. Students need time to handle large final assignments and exams outside of the fast-paced environment of the actual semester, after a period of time spent preparing without having lectures and weekly problem sets to juggle. To end the course before reading week only does the instructor any favors."

The course is structured very well, which helps the student prepare well for exams and assignments. You will learn a lot and towards the end of the semester will be able to write a coherent paragraph. This class requires a lot of participation, but it really helps strength your skills and vocabulary.",
                "very helpful",
                "Yes--good introduction to German. The work you do in class is enough to get you really comfortable with the grammar, but memorizing the vocab will take a lot of time outside of class. Otherwise there isn't too much homework.",
                "Absolutely!  If you're willing to put in the work to understand the grammar and really commit to it, you learn a lot!  Liese is a great professor and makes it much easier than learning on your own, and she's super understanding and truly wants people to learn and enjoy the language.",
                "Yes, teaching is effective. One can speak elementary German after taking the course",
                "Yes, but with the caveat that the course will be challenging in regards to learning vocabulary very rapidly.",
                "Definitely. It is a good way to start learning German.",
                "Only if you have a true passion for German, or if you have a light schedule. German is more complex than most languages, so definitely dont take this class arbitrarily just for the language credit like I did. This class will demand a lot of your time if you want an A, but getting the grade is pretty easy if you put in the work. Prof. Sippel is really great and fair with assignments and exams. There are no truly cumulative exams. Do not take with more than two STEM classes."
