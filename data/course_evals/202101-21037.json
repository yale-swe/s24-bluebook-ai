The extensive study of development papers was a really good way to understand the thinking that goes into writing for academia and coming up with studies and models.",

It is one of the only classes that truly exposes you to what economic research is like in the real world. This class taught me many skills including identifying frictions in an economy,  writing down an empirical model, testing the model by deriving predictions, estimating structured parameters, addressing counterfactuals explanations and testing mechanisms. If you are interested in pursuing higher degrees in economics, development or social science in general, this is the perfect class for you."

He constantly tried to engage his students with the material despite how isolating Zoom sessions can be. The class was very structured, and the syllabus was very clear. The class covered a wide range of topics in development economics but the professor always made sure that we understand the general connection and institution. Although some of the models were a bit technical for other economics classes at Yale, he always broke it down to make it very easy for the students. The best part of the class was student presentations because we got to research a topic and present it to the class. This was a very good way to test/reflect on our general understanding of the material and how we approach research papers in economics."

                "Absolutely. This class is easily in my top 3 classes I've taken at Yale. More than just learning concepts and reading papers, this class really changes your perspective on economics. The material is rather difficult (especially at the beginning of the semester) but Prof Munshi is very understanding and the studies we looked at are super interesting. If you're truly interested in econ, I think this is a class you absolutely should take sometime in your 4 years",

The class cover some of the most important and interesting topics in development. The class is also taught by one of the most prominent contributors to the economics fields. I took many seminars (especially on development) at Yale, but Professor Munshi's seminar was the most engaging. He always try to challenge his students and bring new ways of thinking about development economic. I personally loved this class, especially its unique combinations of research papers and technical models."
