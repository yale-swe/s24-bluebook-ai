Instead of a class focused on the art of programming, this really dived into the unique quirks and features of python, and a great way for beginners and intermediate users of the language alike to learn more. I highly recommend for the certificate path for those looking for a more applied selection than 201, as UNIX skills are equally taught in both classes for 223."

                "Strengths: none\r\nWeaknesses: It teaches you to memorize code, which is not useful for any profession. The professor speaks at 0.5x speed and teaches half the material that later shows up on PSets. There is also very little help -- from the professor or from the TAs. TAs are basically non-existent anyway. They sometimes do not show up to their office hours and when they do, they are unhelpful. The office hours are held on a niche site that makes you think 10 times before asking for help. \r\nImprovement: Maybe stop making us write code on paper? I took ENAS 130 last semester and we were able to use our laptops during the tests and they were open notes and open internet -- because that's how people code in real life.",
                "The lecture notes given are pretty comprehensive and introduce the topics well. It is perhaps by nature of a CS course that lectures would not be the most intuitive format to learn, but the level of engagement is low. The psets cover a good range of course topics and help us understand how the structure behind programming came to be; however, the instructions can be rather unclear, and there aren't many available office hours to help out, so the psets almost always take longer than you think they should.",
                "The course was a bit disorganized and some topics were a bit rushed. There were also some topics advertised on the syllabus that we didnt get to, but it happens.",
                "Strengths: Python, UNIX, and SQL are very useful tools. Problem sets were fairly easy, deadlines were not strict (late days, and extensions if there was a problem with the assignment or autograder), and Slade is a very kind, often funny, professor. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were dry and typically consisted of copy-pasting code from Jupyter notebooks into the terminal without much explanation\/value added beyond seeing the input and output. Many people got by without ever attending lecture. We only ever wrote functions, so I'm not sure how I would write main() to solve a given problem. The SQL portion was rushed and pretty much just required us to memorize commands. It would be nice if one of the problem sets taught us to write python code from scratch.",
                "As a non-stem major, this was a really difficult class for me. I wish there were more resources and the pace was slower (we were covering a new topic almost every week), and it was very difficult to keep up. For strengths, I appreciate the element of forgiveness and understanding: how if you do better on the final than your midterm you can replace your score, and how Professor Slade was accommodating with submission deadlines in the face of the many submission issues encountered."

                "Absolutely not. I was previously considering the programming certificate but this course destroyed my desire to take any more cs courses at Yale. Take it only if it is a requirement you can't escape. The classes are boring and teach you very little. The PSets are time consuming and you receive little to no instructions or help. The professor does technically go over what's on the PSets in class but he just explains what the code should output (which is written on the questions by the way) but rarely offers advice on how to actually write it -- and sometimes the code involves things that were not taught in class at all, which I suppose can be fine for a computer science course since coding involves a lot of googling anyway. However, if that's what they believe in, there should be no paper exams. They encourage memorization rather than critical thinking and are actively detrimental to student learning. Furthermore, the TAs are absent and unhelpful so if you are stuck, you will be on your own.",
                "If you need an organized class structure to motivate yourself, and want to gain proficiency in Python while being introduced to other computing concepts, this may be the class for you. Otherwise, I think other introductory programming courses, including those offered outside of the CS major, may serve you better.",
                "Yes, if you want an easy intro to some very useful coding languages. If you have any python experience, you are probably better off skimming the Jupyter notebooks and taking a more advanced course. Expect to come out of the course feeling comfortable enough with python to teach yourself more useful python skills, not as if you have mastered it.",
                "I thought this course was going to be easier than it actually was since it was advertised as non-stem. As a humanities student taking a Yale CS class for the first time, I struggled a lot. Perhaps it's because I don't have much experience or am not a fast learner, but this course became a huge stressor and time suck for me. Though I did eventually learn, I feel like a lot of it is not very practical: I still don't think I can build a project from scratch, but I can tell you about bytecode. I would only recommend taking this course if 1) you're a fast learner 2) have lots of time to dedicate to this course (if you haven't done CS before) or 3) are interested in the theory side of CS more than the practical."
