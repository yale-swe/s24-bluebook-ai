    "I think I learnt a lot more about how to read books in this class. It wasnt that it was a boring theory class, but the combination of philosophy readings and normal texts made me feel like I was actually engaging on an academic level with the texts. I also just really enjoyed reading the selection Professor Eccles chose. And as with every class of hers, the requirements along the way of the paper writing process were long and detailed but so very very helpful",
    "Novel Feelings was one of the most enlightening, intelligent, and challenging classes I have ever taken! We engaged with central and alternative philosophical texts to develop a complex history of the theorisation surrounding emotions and feelings  I also got to explore and experience the philosophy and politics of affect theory. I did not expect to enjoy my time reading 18th century English texts but this classs deeply infused feminist method made every reading and seminar the thing I looked most forward to every week.",
    "This course provides an incredible perspective on the formation of the novel as well as affect theory. It weaves together novels and philosophy in a way that is approachable and stimulating. I wish more courses would take this sort of approach to reading literature. The course is also focused on workshopping building arguments and writing.",
    "Perhaps the most unique aspect was the integration of philosophy and psychology with literature--sometimes secondary readings were a bit outside my comfort zone, but I think it expanded my way of looking at things.",
    "overview of affect theory and in-depth reading of 18th and 19th century English novels. Introduced a new methodology to study literary under the framework and inspiration of theories.",
    "I learned to think critically about 18th century novel from the lens of phenomenology and affect theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was so interesting. One of the best parts is Professor Eccles, so thats a strength. The syllabus was excellent and the additional readings well-chosen to match the literary texts we were reading but also to provide an interesting challenge. As usual, no weaknesses.",
    "The seminar was small so it made for a lot of very interesting and thoroughly explored discussions! The class was also made up with wonderful people and each discussion felt like a shared intellectual project, with real, emotional stakes and aspirations for the people involved.",
    "There are so many strengths to this course. I think more time was dedicated to workshopping writing than was necessary, but this was still very useful. And, while on the syllabus, each student was supposed to lead discussion for 30 minutes, this did not really happen, which might have been a good thing as conversation flowed organically each week. Professor Eccles makes each student's voice feel heard and appreciated. Sometimes it might have been helpful to have comments challenged more, but this ultimately provided an incredibly encouraging educational environment.",
    "I really loved the discussions we had in this course--everyone was quite engaged, and had unique insights on the readings.",
    "The narrative arc of the course is extremely inspiring. The variety of scholarship introduced to us pose a rigorous approach beyond the close reading methodology, and rather interrogates literature for its ideas and effects.",
    "I loved how our class paired the novel with critical texts, and how I was guided step by step toward my final paper."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. This class is great! You read an insane variety of books and you get to talk about some fascinating topics. However, the course will only give as much as you put in. If you arent engaged, dont do the readings, and just dont care, then please dont take the class! It will ruin it for everyone.",
    "10000000%. If youre a feminist, into philosophy, and like reading, this is a must-take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I would particularly recommend it to anyone who is hesitant about 18th century writing, like I was. I came into the course skeptical that I would enjoy the books on the syllabus and left grateful for all that I learned. I am particularly grateful to have taken a class with professor Eccles.",
    "Certainly! An excellent seminar for all the reasons seminars should be excellent",
    "Yes! However, the work is substantial, and demands you to engage with every component  a novel a week, several fragments of affect theory, and secondary scholarship. Only do it if you are genuinely intellectually curious about the ideas posed by the course.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student!!!"
