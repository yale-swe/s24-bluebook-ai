                "This class was full of interesting material overall, and the psets helped me understand the concepts we were learning. The problem is that the psets left me largely unprepared for the final project, since the psets had helped guide us through the NNs we were trying to build, and the final project was left completely open-ended and had to be created from scratch.",
                "The course was very approachable and gave students lots of space to explore their own personal interests in the assignments. The coding work, however, was really easy to I'm not sure we really got much from them. That was a pro and con because it meant the assignments were fast and straightforward but then again we probably wont take much away from the course.",

                "I think it would have been better to have the student presentations spread out instead of having them all on the same day, so instead of having 4 in one class it could have been nice to have one or two at the start of class",

                "The first half of the course was taught well, with homework that reinforced the key lessons, though the step-by-step frameworks given for these assignments sometimes seemed unnecessarily detailed and took away from the useful challenges. The second half, focused on hardware and recent research, seemed much less effective because most students lacked the background necessary to understand the technical details of this work. A reduction in scope in exchange for greater depth would have been an improvement. The final project, while interesting, felt too broad and too heavily emphasized for a course with otherwise introductory material on neural networks. A more limited project, together with exams or more substantial programming assignments, would have been better. I'd also have appreciated written feedback on major assignments, instead of just grades."

The second part of the course turned to recent research with a focus on hardware, and since most students had little background for this section, I felt that it didn't produce a useful level of understanding. The final project was interesting, but felt over-emphasized in a course that is essentially introductory for its subject matter."
