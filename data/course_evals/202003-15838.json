The class was unlike other history courses that I have taken because studying pre-industrial Economics, especially of Antiquity, requires the integration of traditional history, science, and creativity. We learned different philosophies from notable historians about how to study Ancient Economies, including questions like the degree to which we can call behavior \"economic\" or \"irrational\" and the nuances of using ancient sources and archaeology with their sporadic preservation. I also learned some important general history of Greece, Egypt, the Hellenistic Era, and Rome.",

                "Three papers were the only graded assignments makes it hard to follow along with the class",

Also, some classes were pure lecture while others were all discussion  the balance felt off. Part of this was due to the fact that we didn't have section, so Professor Manning was essentially combining a lecture with a section every week.",
                "None, Manning did great.",

                "Strength: Very interesting classes + course materials. A rich variety of modes of instruction that made classes more engaging (breakout rooms, presentations, guest speakers, etc.)\r\nWeakness: None that are glaring that I can think of",
                "Strengths: The topics in the course are wide in range and interesting. There are sufficient readings into each topic and there are further readings that help students explore anything they are interested in. The guest lectures allow students to interact with edge-cutting historians & scientists in various areas (eg: shipwreck, ice-core study).\r\n\r\nImprovement: There can be more direct sources.",

                "Strengths: in class seminars were recorded. Yes, thats it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: disorganized, unclear and harsh in terms of grading. In class discussions have very little to do with the assignments. Half the time we were behind on discussing the readings in class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Manning's live lecture format which allows students to ask questions in real time as the lecture is happening (something not typical of the other history in-person live lectures I've taken pre-pandemic)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not all the reading was covered in the class, so I would recommend lessening the reading load per class.",
                "The course material itself diverges from standard historical thinking sometimes and encourages students to change their pre-conceived notions of the ancient world. Its all very interesting, and the promotion of integrating scientific analysis with conventional history might be good for anyone aspiring to study history. The professors expertise in Ptolemaic Egyptian history also makes some of the material very new for experienced classicists. His guest lecturers also represent some of the most important minds working on the field at this moment. That said, the class can sometimes strawman conventional conceptions of the ancient economy too much, obsessing with Moses Finley when its clear all modern scholarship have abandoned his view. I must also say that his final assignment, a prcis that also needed to include 7 other sources as well as our own opinions, was a disjointed and self-contradictory request. I couldnt figure out what he really wanted there.",
                "I think the biggest strength of the course is simply the subject matter, which is totally unique and fascinating even among Yale history courses. It really does give you a new perspective on antiquity and arguably even modern economics too. Professor was also very nice and accommodating considering the circumstances of Zoom learning and COVID. Also, the writing workload is relatively quite low, with only 3 papers for the whole semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class was too big given the format. We had 30-40 people but the class format was largely seminar-style, so as a result it felt a little difficult to participate in the discussions. Feedback on the essays was not very thorough, although this is hardly surprising given the large class size and no TA's.  Also, at times I think the big picture of the class was unclear, as it was easy to get lost since we were considering many different economies from different regions and time period.",
                "Strength: interactive, exposure to various fields \r\n\r\nWeakness: lack of independent research-oriented learning\/project (thus discussions generally limited to sources provided by Prof)"

The readings can be really interesting, but a lot of class time is just reinforcing the readings. Some interesting elements of the class (like the object of the day) petered out after a certain point in the semester. It also seemed like a lot of people stopped doing the readings, so our discussions got worse at the end of the semester. We didn't get a lot of feedback on essays (since there was no TA). Without being genuinely interested in the class material, it would be easy to lose motivation. However, the readings will spark many new ideas if you are interested in the material.",

His lectures are engaging and the guest speakers were very interesting. The essays aren't particularly challenging, so this makes a good 5th class if you find the topic interesting.",

                "Yes. The course is great for both history and econ students I think",
                "Overall this class was pretty good. The prof was really nice and the material was interesting and simple. However, note that you do have to put some thought into all the assignments - especially the prompt for the final essay was rough, since you had to cite at least 10 syllabus readings and write a new history of the ancient economy (which is not easy). Would recommend as a chill and interesting 5th class, especially if you like writing essays.",
                "Yes because as an economics student this was a very refreshing course that allowed me to look at the development of economies and our very definition of them.",
                "Yes. This course provides a unique perspective of ancient history, one that not only covers what historically happened, but also analyzes why & how changes were made. The readings are interesting, and this course can be a great choice to anyone who is interested in learning more about the unique ancient economies.",
                "Yes, especially for the student interested in Antiquity; there is so much economic thinking that the ancients had that we do not realize. I would say that it is advisable to have at least some background or interest in Antiquity (even a non-History major could have enough) to engage more fully with the material, but it is definitely fine for a first class in Antiquity.",
                "I absolutely would! I knew nothing about the Ancient Economy and took this class because a friend spoke wonders of Professor Manning. They were right! Professor Manning managed to make a topic I knew nothing about accessible, without erasing the complexities and nuances of the field (which are many). He was always willing to clarify, to explain things further. He also humanized people who frankly previously felt very foreign to me. Ancient people left a far greater historical record than I had realized, and Professor Manning really helped make that come to life. I would absolutely recommend this class to a friend, but I would also tell them to take any class with Professor Manning. He is great.",
                "I would recommend this class to those looking for a different and new way in which to learn about the ancient world.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Manning's 'Ancient Economy' is not just a history or economics course, but a comprehensive humanities survey that includes those two subjects and much more. You will treat humanistic questions differently after taking this course as well as being exposed to the many different approaches Manning employs to solve those questions.",
                "Take the class if you are interested in the subject. Otherwise, don't take it because of the low workload evaluation on coursetable. The seminar\/lecture was at times dry and unstructured, but professor Manning is a great person who is very knowledgeable in this field.",
                "Its a very chill 5th credit.",
                "Yes I would. There were things I weren't enthusiastic about, but I think this class has so much potential and might be improved upon in later years. The class material itself is absolutely fascinating and I think provides an invaluable perspective on antiquity and economics that one simply won't get elsewhere. The workload was relatively low--only 3 short papers and readings were average length. I think the class format\/structure could be improved, as I think it was easy to fall behind and miss the big picture of Professor's points. There weren't many \"lectures\" or slides giving us facts about the ancient economy as much as it was seminar discussion about the readings we did, although it was unclear at times why we were doing the readings in the order we did or how it related to the other readings. Overall though, it's a fun, valuable class with not a large workload, and I'm very glad I took it.",
                "This course is probably best suited for students with some prior exposure in a related field (not that it is required for enjoying or understanding the course content) because the most fun\/exciting approach of this course is to combine seemingly unrelated fields of study. Without background in ancient history\/economics, this course still is a fine survey of one specific school of thought in ancient economics, possible comparisons would be limited to provided course material.",
                "Yes I would totally recommend this, especially if you're interested in economic history or pre-industrial history more broadly.

The workload is very reasonable, but the work is very intellectually stimulating and the readings are incredibly interesting and you come away with some great insight every day."
