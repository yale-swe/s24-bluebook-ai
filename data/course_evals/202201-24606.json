                "Became a better interpreter of Plato. Felt like I began to see more inside the Silenus statues of the texts. Became a better close reader, and much more attune to rhetoric.",

                "This course evaluated Platos dialogues not just as philosophical argument, but as literature as well. The seminars approach to the material allowed me a richer, more encompassing view of the dialogues than expected.",
                "This course further developed my critical and analytical reasoning skills. You get to engage the text or author's claims as closely and slowly as possible. This is what makes learning exciting: if you grasp the material and are able to explain the claims or arguments in your own words.",
                "Many of the platonic dialogues involve Socrates as one of the interlocutors. One of the things he is notable for is his very meticulous reasoning, sometimes called the Socratic Questioning, in which he strives to strip any argument off of its facade and gain a better insight into the very essence of what someone is saying. \r\nIn reading these dialogues, I, as a spectator, became another interlocutor, immersed in the conversation, thinking along as the dialogues progressed, posing my own questions and answers.\r\nI feel as though my brain has been stretched, my sense of reasoning and developing a coherent argument, improved; a small bit of knowledge in the Ancient Greek culture too has been acquired."

                "Honestly, reading load was very manageable, but class discussions sometimes dragged just a bit. Maybe having a very low stakes, short discussion post due for each new text could be a way to get peoples thoughts going before class.",
                "Professor Schillinger did an excellent job balancing the seminar discussion with his own insights into the text. I always left class having learned so much more from both him and my peers than I would have been able to glean on my own.",
                "The course was set up so that we could fully dive into each of the dialogues we read. Professor Schillinger was always prepared with questions that we should explore, but he also encouraged us to develop and discuss our own hypotheses about the central claims or topics of the texts.",
                "I thought the pacing was great - neither rushed nor prolonged. I only wish there had been more time to include some of the other major dialogues.",
                "The professor was absolutely fantastic! He knows his stuff and helps you understand it. During each class meeting, he would start the class by explaining or breaking down complex themes or ideas.",
                "The seminar format of this course is definitely a strength. All students are encouraged to participate in the discussion. Prof. Schillinger facilitates discussions, taking into account each of the students individual characters and ways of being, as well as referencing the subject matter to some of the contemporary topics, thus building a bridge between the ancient texts and today."

                "Yes! Professor Schillinger does an excellent job facilitating seminar discussion, leaves excellent feedback, and is very accessible. We only read Plato, but I feel like I learned so much more than in other courses I've taken.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Schillinger is amazing and the course approaches a range of Platos texts in a digestible manner",
                "If you want a semester of Plato, then yeah",
                "Yes!! I absolutely loved this course. This was one of my favorite classes of the semester. Professor Schillinger does a wonderful job steering the discussion and encouraging us to share our thoughts. Not only did I get to deepen my understanding of Plato and his works, but Professor Schillingers feedback helped me improve my writing skills, as well.",
                "This course was a wonderful way to explore a thinker many consider foundational. The more I read and wrote about Plato, the more difficult it became to answer the questions central to the texts. You truly learn something about Socratic humility after struggling with Plato's words yourself, seeing past the initial ridiculousness of Socrates' arguments and beginning to grasp his thoughts, an experience that is invaluable as a reader and student.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class. Dan Schillinger is a great professor, and the seminar style class generates lively and enlightening discussion.",
                "Yes.",
                "Definitely take this course if you are interested in political science, philosophy, etc. There's a lot of reading, but there's also time to get it  done. I'd strongly advise that you don't take it for a distributional requirement unless you are into the themes that the course explores or that it falls within the range of your major."
