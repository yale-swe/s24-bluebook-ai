Analyzing varying issue-based policies from the stand point of both the U.S. and Russian side was also useful.\r\n\r\nThe policy modeling workshops were an interesting exercise, and more of them should be incorporated into the class on various topics. \r\n\r\nSome of the course material is a bit outdated. It would also be valuable to trace the arc of Russian political decline towards autocracy to understand its impact on the bilateral relations."
