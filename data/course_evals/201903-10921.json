    "I learned a lot about the writing process, especially writing a research paper at the college level.",
    "- the best steps and methods for writing a research paper\r\n- numerous helpful editing methods",
    "My ability to write essays improved significantly over the course of the class.",
    "Excellent writing organization skills and creative thought development. This course teaches you to take abstract concepts and turn them into organized and effective writing.",
    "I learned what it means to develop a coherent argument based on warrants and gaps\/tensions in the sources that were examined. I also learned how to proofread my writing for style and concision, how to engage in active discussion with my peers and professor about my work, and skills for research and developing a research question.",
    "Learned a lot about material cultures with a focus on writing academic essays.",
    "I learned how to write at a college level. I learned how to synthesize new claims and ideas from different sources of information.",
    "English was one of my weakest subject areas in high school, taking this course definitely improved my writing skills. Dr Klemann makes sure you build on previous learnings in order to build yourself as a writer. One of my favorite classes iv taken at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "I think that overall this is a very strong writing course for freshmen coming into college. I think it could be improved by changing some of the readings because some of them were incredibly confusing and we never spoke about them again after the day the reading was discussed formally in class.",
    "- strength: walks through each step of the writing process for different kinds of papers \r\n- weakness: prompts are sort of vague",
    "The strengths of this course are: 1) good introduction to college-level writing, 2) good synthesis of writing and discussion, 3) plenty of opportunities to work closely with professor.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are: 1) I believe it would have been better to focus more on writing our papers in class discussions, 2) find ways to better integrate the techniques we learned in class into our writing. \r\nOverall, one suggestion I have is I wish we had more time seeing how the readings we were assigned applied to our writing.",
    "This is a very good course if you want to improve your writing and have some interest in material cultures. The feedback from the instructor is constructive.",
    "The instructor was very flexible with deadlines. I wish their were more check-in opportunities with the professor so that students could have a better idea of where their paper stood on the grading scale before their paper was submitted."

    "I would definitely recommend this course! Do not be turned off because of the title -- I was at first, but ended up having a very enjoyable experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this section of English 114. The topic is interesting and the instructor is awesome. If someone is just in search of a writing credit, i would recommend something with a lighter workload.",
    "Yes!! The topic is interesting and it significantly improves your writing skills.",
    "Yes! This professor and class is amazing. This professor and course are like no other classes you will take at Yale. It is a unique experience regardless of your major.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This is because it provides valuable skills in 1) learning how to balance writing papers with your other course load, 2) techniques to improve the style of your writing, 3) techniques to approach a prompt with clear scope.",
    "Yes! Material cultures of childhood is a very good choice if you want to take an English 114. Heather is a fantastic instructor and the readings for the class are quite interesting. A very good course if you're not comfortable writing long argumentative essays. You'll find the lessons from this class useful immediately.",
    "I had trouble with interpreting the instructors feedback. I felt as if my papers were heading in the right direction after meeting with the instructor, but I would still have trouble with earning high grades in the course. It was always hard for me to tell if the instructor thought my paper was good or bad.",
    "Yes !!!! One of my favorite courses at Yale.  Everything is laid out and builds upon previous lessons. Dr Klemann gives clear feedback and is able to teach difficult concepts easily."
