It is a really different intellectual exercise than most of the work I have done at Yale up to now.",

                "Strengths: Super awesome experience to write an economics thesis, especially with Rebecca and Matthew at the helm. A lot of clear communication and flexibility compared with other people writing theses in other departments. Never really felt stressed about deadlines, and there's a huge amount of support for students to get connected with professors and find the correct resources for their projects. Pretty world-class experience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We had a deadline in mid November for our paper (just an update to our advisor) but I'm not really sure what the purpose was of that. I feel like it could be nice to have something published online that tells us where we should be roughly at different stages of the writing process (I also acknowledge that everyone has different timelines, so this could be tough). I think it was just tough for me to gauge my progress relative to where I \"should be.\"",
                "The experience of doing independent research has been great so far. The weekly lectures were useful for the most part, although it might have been nice to cover slightly more advanced material since we've all had an introduction to R in prior courses.",

                "Yes! Study what you love :)",
                "Yes -- I didn't initially know if I wanted to write a thesis (and I hadn't done Tobin or Scarf, so I felt a little behind relative to peers in terms of experience). But it's totally something that any economics major can do (just make sure you have enough econometrics) and a hugely fulfilling experience. It's special to work on an independent project like this one, and I've learned more in this thesis-writing process than in most of my other economics classes at Yale.",
