   "comments": [
    "This course was good, but most of the readings were really problematic. We could have read more work by Native authors and other scholars who are more respectful in their work.",
    "The strengths of the course are its diverse syllabus and array of topics, including but not limited to DNA, trauma, cartography, science fiction literature, and research ethics. An improvement might be the inclusion of classroom presentations, because I wanted to hear more about my classmates' final projects.",
    "This was a new course that was taught for the first time this year, so it had a few bumps, but I think it has great potential. The content of the course was relevant and important and the professor was professional and open about content.",
    "The discussions in this course felt extremely one-sided. Some of the students in the class made it difficult to contribute to discussions, and there was little mediation of the discussions. The environment felt a little hostile at times. \r\n\r\nThis course offers the opportunity for students with little background in this subject to engage in interesting and pertinent material, but the nature of the class's environment makes it uncomfortable to ask questions about the material.",
    "The readings in this course were amazing and I loved the wide variety of topics we discussed."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "This class was good because we were able to learn about the systematic oppression and genocide of Indigenous peoples through science that still continues today.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this student and Tess is readily available to provide feedback and help steer the course towards students' needs.",
    "I had really high expectations for this course, but discussions were lacking and I could not tell if it was not because people did not do the readings, or if It was because they were disinterested. To have better discussions, it is important that people taking this course engage with the material and not wave this course off as just another class. There are a lot of readings, sometimes we would have a book to read, but this is a seminar course. Before anyone takes this course, they should have some understanding of Native history and have some familiarity with the appropriate terms to refer to Indigenous peoples with. I wish the course had come together better, this subject is very important and definitely needs to be taught in future years. While it is need of a lot of improvement, courses like this in HSHM are necessary and there needs to be more of these conversations.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have a thorough and comprehensive background in Indigenous studies and are extremely comfortable with terminology, current events, and past history.",
    "Yes! It teaches about critical indigenous studies with a wide approach to health, technology and science."
