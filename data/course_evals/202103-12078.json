The small class size allowed for great relationships to be formed between classmates, and formal critiques encouraged everyone to be engaged with their peers' work. The class was a disorganized, so it wasn't always clear when assignments were due which made it hard to balance the coursework with other work (before midterms and finals the necessary time commitment was very high)."

                "I would recommend this course to someone who has time to put into their paintings. Though the class doesn't work the same academic muscle as many others, it takes time to produce a good painting. Be prepared to spend a lot of hours outside of class in the school of art!",
