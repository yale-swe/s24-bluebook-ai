The small class size allowed for great relationships to be formed between classmates, and formal critiques encouraged everyone to be engaged with their peers' work. The class was a disorganized, so it wasn't always clear when assignments were due which made it hard to balance the coursework with other work (before midterms and finals the necessary time commitment was very high)."
