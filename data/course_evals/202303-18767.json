                "The strength of this course is the peer tutor system run throughout the week which helps students complete their p-sets. The peer tutors were willing to take the time to explain complex concepts and problems. The weaknesses of this course include the non-engaging 75-minute lectures, really time-consuming P-sets, unhelpful exam review sessions and practice tests, and challenging exams. The p-sets often had questions unrelated to any testable concepts, which is excellent for learning but bad for overall exam preparation. The course material was also rushed, and the exam schedule did not match the pace at which all the material could be taught.",
                "The exams were way harder than anything we did in class and the classes were not that useful",
                "This course is very heavy in terms of a course designed for first years mainly. It has a decent structure followed by the professors and has many resources available for the students to take advantage of. However, a main weakness with this course are the explorations assigned through canvas and due before each class. These explorations are more confusing when the topics themselves are confusing to learn solely though reading the material. The explorations would definitely be more helpful if they were due after class as a check and extra practice for the topics covered that week.",
                "The peer tutoring that was available daily was a strength. I think there wasn't enough practice available other than problem sets, so an improvement could be more in class practice problems.",
