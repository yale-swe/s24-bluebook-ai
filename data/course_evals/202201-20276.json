                "I thought that the psets were rather fair and that the expectations for the midterm and final were also fair. However, I would have liked a little more guidance on how to approach MATLAB questions on PSETS, since a lot of them took much creativity to solve. Furthermore, if there was a living equation sheet that kept track of what we needed to know as the semester continued (ie, equations on flow). I found myself flipping through lecture notes just to find the relevant equations, and had they all been on a centralized location, it would've been much easier and conducive to learning.",
                "The strengths of the class was the course style. The lectures made sense easy when we went over them. I liked the layout of the grading style. A weakness of the course is that I didnt really understand much of Duncans notes.",
                "The strengths of the course include the homework, the TAs, the open-note exams, and the professors. One weakness of the course was the problem set due right after spring break, as it likely required work over break.",
                "Strengths: TA's were very helpful and the weekly review sessions helped a lot with the homework, psets were based off class material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the final exam covered some topics, particularly related to images, that we did not go into much detail on in class",
                "Very cool having two professors teach the course! Was a good way to learn all the material, and the set up of the class helped with success",
                "I wish the roadmap of the course and the connection of class material to real-world application was more explicitly stated. It took until the middle of the semester to synthesize the connection between the different mathematical tools we learned and the biological applications."

The matlab content, however, was not directly taught and was primarily guided by TAs. Also, the course may seem repetitive at times, but the course is set up that way to hammer down on certain aspects in different contexts. Even if you dont like coding too much, this course may be rewarding from the various types of thinking introduced, such as using machine learning in image processing and considering the circulatory system as an electrical circuit.",
