The ability to scrutinize a paper is a very important skill in research, and this is one of the few classes where you can learn it. And of course, you get a good understanding on what the recent research/debates are in visual perception and its relation with social attributes.",

            "comments": [
                "strengths: fascinating readings every week, super cool topics and well organised flow of course material\r\nweaknesses: sometimes too many papers to discuss in seminar, discussion was also a little erratic, as Prof. Scholl would provide a lot of background context so that there was not always enough time to actually engage in a discussion (there was also an overall sense that each question has an \"empirical\" right answer, which i think may have stifled people's questions and thoughts a little).",
                "The discussion format allows for a lot of flexibility and student input, not just within each class but with topics and themes as a whole. It's really student-driven which is great for those that are highly interested in the topic. Because of this flexibility I don't think each time this course is taught is the same, so I'd say it'd be hard to point out a specific improvement although perhaps some more regular feedback regarding our performance would be useful.",
                "The seminar is very engaging, and has a nice atmosphere where you can speak up when you want to.",
                "Interesting subject matter. But the teaching was not very engaging. Felt more like a lecture punctuated by long-winded and hardly related comments.",
                "I had mixed feelings about the amount and type of readings. For one, I really enjoyed all the materials we have read for this class  both the bad/fake and good papers. But from time to time, it did feel a bit too much. Even at times when the readings seemed brief in the first blush, they turned out to be quite dense and sometimes I ended up spending my entire day reading these papers and having to save the response for another time. That being said, however, I am very glad that I had the chance to read all the materials, even the ones that ended up being too technical (especially the Chang & Tsao, 2017 paper) for me to understand. I can see the reasons why each of them were relevant to our discussions. But sometimes I wished that there would actually be more time that we spend discussing these papers, because I often felt like we ended up discussing some experiment demonstrations that you have shown us in the board or digressed from the topic.",
                "I honestly found the course format overall extremely good. The main strength of the class is that it opens a space for students interested in Cognitive Science to openly discuss social cognition in an engaging way. We were able to question the validity of certain published research papers, and we were encouraged to propose ideas/pose questions that open doors towards future studies with novel methodologies.",
                "Strengths: very interesting content\r\n\r\nWeakness: discussion a little bit too geared to Professor Scholl's opinions. I think it would have been nicer if there were not so much bias involved in the content we discussed"

The topics covered are broad and fascinating to pretty much anyone into these sorts of fields and disciplines, and are adjustable based on student interest. Professor Scholl is also a highly knowledgeable and engaging instructor that makes the content really click.",
