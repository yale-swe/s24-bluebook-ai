   "comments": [
    "This course transformed the way I think about historical sources; I have developed a more sophisticated form of analysis by learning how to analyze cartographic sources. The weekly questions also taught me to become a more inquisitive reader, and we consequently had incredibly rewarding class discussions.",
    "I learned how to evaluate maps and other cartographical resources. My analytical skills definitely improved over the course of this class.",
    "I developed methods to critically engage sources and figures.",
    "Expanding the idea of what a map is, how to look at a map, looking at the history behind the map, analyzing different historical arguments about fundamental cartographical concepts; honestly, pretty cool range of things that we've learned in this class",
    "Ive learned how to read maps textually as arguments, and gotten more accustomed to synthesis ideas across different readings through asking critical questions. The course has provided me some insight into critical theory as well, which is really helpful moving forward into other classes which demand the same level of rigorous analysis!",
    "I learned a great deal about the history and techniques of mapping, how maps can influence what we see and believe, and how mapping is rooted in certain preconceptions and beliefs about the world. I gained so many skills related to critical reading and question-asking, as this class forced me to really work hard to ask meaningful and informative questions about the texts we read.",
    "I learnt so much from this course. Its specific focus was on understanding the ways in which spatial knowledge is produced, and on reading maps critically, as sources whose \"accuracy\" must be questioned on various levels (and not just in geometric terms). But the course offered so much more - from skills related to reading and drawing maps, writing papers to deep conceptual questions about science, knowledge and power."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is incredibly strong: engaging class discussions, highly committed instructor, thought-provoking readings, challenging assignments that resulted in student growth...I do not recall any weaknesses, nor do I have any suggestions!",
    "Strengths: interesting source material, brilliant professor\r\n\r\nweaknesses: intellectual challenge is by far the highest and hardest I've had at Yale (more a minus than a weakness), high high workload",
    "Strengths: I liked that the discussion questions every week that would be used for discussion the next day. It made me critically think about the readings that we were assigned and how that relates to themes in the class. The projects and assignments were great at making me think outside of the box. Professor Rankin is also phenomenal at facilitating discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a 'wrong' way to think in this class. While I understand it is Professor Rankin's goal for students to take away certain themes, I also think it is important for students to develop ideas that aren't spot-on with what the intended goals are. This class is a little different from how I thought it would be, and I've gotten marks off sometimes for proposing interesting points, but not points that are main themes.",
    "Readings were very informative and were often in conversation with each other which was great for comparison; I think that incorporating more of the discussion questions into class discussion would be helpful since these were things that the class needed to clarify or wanted to know more about; I also think class participation in a quick summary of all the readings before class would be great for recapping lengthy and \"meaty\" readings; it's a more theoretical and abstract way of thinking about cartography (in my opinion) which was also new but cool",
    "This is probably the hardest class Ive taken at Yale so far - because of how rigorous and voluminous the content is! That being said, the biggest strength of the course would probably be its comprehensiveness because we really study maps across a whole time span and across cultures. Prof Rankin also made every lesson exciting by starting off showing us really interesting maps, and I also appreciated how structured lessons were. One weakness (ironically) might lie in the volume of content in the course - it might really be a personal thing but I often struggled to read all the assigned readings and understand them in a week because of how dense and long  the readings were, and given that discussion time (after presentations started) wasnt very long , it often felt like  I didnt really manage to understand or unpack the readings enough.",
    "Strengths - readings were fascinating, discussions were interesting, and papers and assignments were both engaging and rewarding\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - very few I can even think of",
    "Strengths: Prof. Rankin is a wonderful instructor - sharp, organized, humorous, and so knowledgeable. He also puts such a large amount of effort into thinking about, organizing and teaching the course. The readings were challenging and stimulating, class discussions were well-framed and productive, and the assignments were a lot of fun. Writing discussion questions before class was also an incredibly productive endeavor - much more challenging than responses\/reflections but also so much more beneficial. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the only weakness I'd point out is that the readings were often too onerous, in the process stifling the amount of discussion we were prepared to have. Often, entire books were assigned on top of articles, which seemed unnecessary. Often a tighter set of readings that we could read closely offered space for the best discussions of the class."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, especially is he\/she\/they is interested in historical research and would like to reconsider how to analyze sources. Plus, learning about cartography is just really fun!",
    "If you're up for the challenge, go for it. In the beginning of the course Prof Rankin says it'll be the hardest class you'll take at Yale, but most rewarding and stimulating, and I'd definitely agree with that statement. I didn't realize just how hard it would be, though- so be warned. Yes, it's a very interesting topic, a very interesting course, and Prof. Rankin is an absolute genius; but it is incredibly time consuming and intellectually challenging (and not in the funnest way).",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in cartography, territory, and\/or how it relates to identity. It's a hard course, but probably one of the most rewarding courses I've taken here at Yale. The readings are interesting and the analysis that follows in class is really good in furthering your thinking.",
    "If you are interested in maps at all, even if they're video game maps or another, then you should take this class! Prof. Rankin is just cool and really passionate about his field of study it's awesome to see, and makes you excited to learn about it even if you know nothing about maps or cartography. Readings are dense and hard to parse at first, but then you get used to the reading load. Sometimes things flew over my head, but having discussion around everything really helped, but do the readings because they're worth it and it'll make discussion better.",
    "Certainly! Particularly if you are interested in the intersections between geography and history - maps offers a great window to understand this interaction",
    "Yes 100%. It's a very difficult class with lots of reading and individual assignments, but if you are at all interested in maps, cartography, and the making of geographic knowledge, DEFINITELY take this class. It is worth the challenge and you will walk away feeling like a better student.",
    "Absolutely- Prof. Rankin is wonderful and the topic is so intellectually stimulating!"
