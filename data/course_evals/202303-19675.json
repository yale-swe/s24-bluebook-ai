                "strengths: well-organized and designed based on student feedback, good for students who prefer a self-directed learning style and a fun way to maintain and improve Chinese level for heritage speakers and connect with culture\r\n\r\nweaknesses: relatively new course so still in the process of optimizing course design through trial and error, but instructor is very receptive to student feedback and implements quickly",
                "Strengths: You will have a lot of freedom to explore what chinese and chinese culture means to you in this class. Professor Liang is also very diligent about receiving student feedback to help her tailor the class to match the chinese abilities of her students. It is also a very interesting take on learning chinese! \r\nWeaknesses: could use more organization in facilitating out of class group work. Some assignments are posted a day before they are due without advance notice, although Professor Liang is lenient about deadlines in such cases."
