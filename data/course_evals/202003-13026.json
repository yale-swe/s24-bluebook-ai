I find that some smaller assignments related to the material might be better.",
                "Strengths: interesting material and the QSETs are much better than midterms in my opinion (they're like open book, timed PSETs, so you spend 3 hours on them a week, in one sitting, and there are no midterms)\r\nWeaknesses: the professor isn't the most engaging, and (at least this year) there was so much repetition between the live\/recorded lectures that it was hard to always pay attention and retain the information",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of content in very little time; Weaknesses: goes over too much content -- might be better suited to a two part course",
                "I genuinely started succeeding in this class when I stopped doing what the professor recommended--we're asked to read and watch all of the pre-prepared lecture materials before coming to class each week, but it's a lot of the same things repeated with minor deviances so it's easy to get lost\/confused or just overload the information. The time of the pre-recorded lectures alone doubled or tripled lecture time each week. The materials are all very well-prepared, they just need to be combed through better or there needs to be some sort of sign of what's most pertinent to the class considering how much content there is to learn. When I stopped looking at the materials before class, took notes on all that was mentioned and went back through the pre-prepared materials to fill in the gaps I started retaining and learning a whole lot more.",
                "strengths: having access to the lectures \/ notes before hand as to be able to go through them at my own pace and take notes \r\n\r\nweakness: this sort of made the live lectures redundant. but at the same time I was really glad to just be able to focus during the lecture rather than trying to write everything down so I'm not sure what the solution to this would be",
                "I liked how there were multiple resources tackling the same topic so we can have a better understanding.",
                "Strengths: Professor McCarthy was a clear lecturer and the material was very interesting. The course is phenomenally organized. The professor's website has all the lecture videos and notes conveniently located, and the PSETs were helpful in learning the material. He held weekly review session, and also held midterm\/final reviews.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was way too much material covered in one semester. We would have hours of lecture video to watch each week, and then on top of that, we had additional live lectures to tune into. I think maybe the material and some of the experiment explanations could have been cut down.",
                "For every class McCarthy tells you to read a chapter in the textbook, watch ~2 hours of prerecorded lectures, read the lecture notes posted on his website, and attend a live lecture. All four of these resources cover roughly the same material, so doing all of them was excessive for me.",
                "This course is difficult because it is extremely content heavy, and there is a lot of information which can be difficult to keep up with. However, the information is organized in an EXCELLENT manner. Everything is easily accessible on Prof. McCarthy's website and his notes are very easy to follow  and super helpful if you miss a lecture or to review.\r\nAdditionally, the weekly qsets are open note which really helps students focus on the material from the lecture and review it to build information to prepare for the final. I would say this is the best accessible course I have taken so far at Yale.",
                "The class covers a lot of information, which is cool but can also be stressful if you aren't staying on top of the workload.",
                "Strengths: the course material was organized in an organized way and was taught clearly, not to mention the material of the course was simply fascinating (e.g., sleep, stress, etc)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For a remote semester, the workload was too much. It is a lot to expect students to watch an entire prerecorded lecture and read lecture notes before actual live lecture. This made studying hard as well since there was so much different places the material was covered. Furthermore, the prerecorded lectures were often longer than an hour and thirty minutes. It is fair that students can play the lectures at a faster speed but it was still a struggle to capture all of the material and stay on top of the class. On top of that, there were weekly qsets that required students to chunk out 3 hours time.",
                "There were no weaknesses in this course. I enjoyed the weekly QSets, which allowed students to keep up with material weekly. I greatly enjoyed the pre-recorded and live lectures, which all gave an encompassing view of every aspect of the course as well.",
                "Strengths: fascinating content and knowledgeable professor. Weaknesses (not exactly weaknesses, just some things to keep in mind): HOURS of pre-recorded content, 3hr qsets, and lectures the reiterate the pre-recorded content.",
                "Strengths: doable problem sets worth 70% of your grade, 5% participation grade if you do quizzes, passionate and knowledgeable professor\r\nWeakness: lectures can be long and time consuming",
                "The course is designed to allow students to thrive. Professor McCarthy has his own website with all the lecture notes posted, past recorded lecture and review sessions. There are also pre-lecture videos that students watch. With the multiple sources of notes available, students are setup to read and hear the lecture material multiple times. The pre-lecture videos are very time-consuming so condensing the lectures could help improve the class.",
                "Some of the lecture topics were extremely engaging and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the lectures contained multiple parts and were several hours long. It was extremely time-consuming to watch these lectures and attend the live lecture. After a while, I stopped attending the live lectures and just stuck with the pre-recorded lectures.",
                "I feel like this class is one of those that is definitely challenging but you are AMPLY warned by everyone who's taken it and by any review you read. It's difficult and there's a lot of info to learn but you know that going in. That being said, it seemed like a lot of people were confused about how much recorded content there was on top of going to lecture. It did total to about 6-8 hours a week, but there was also not a ton of reading, so I think it was fair. I just wanted to say that as a strength because you know what this class will be and the expectations are really clear. Another strength is that we could ask questions on Piazza anytime and get a good answer. Professor McCarthy would answer questions directly on there which is something I don't see professors do a lot. Also, he had separate review sessions each week and there were a lot of TAs with office hours, so you could always get help with something really easily.",
                "I thought the qsets were helpful for baking in the knowledge we learned in class, although I would have liked to have been able to collaborate on them, and don't think it would have detracted from my learning. The qsets were also confusingly graded, and I ended up getting points taken off for not saying enough about things when the question never specified how much we had to write. There was a lot of material to cover and I appreciate the depth and breadth of the course, but it was frustrating to watch the prerecorded lectures for sometimes over two hours only to have the same material gone over in less detail in class.",
                "The strengths of this course were the many sources of assistance for those who want additional help alongside the virtual lecture. The pre-recorded lectures and online notes were extremely helpful.",
                "The strengths were Professor McCarthy's lectures and explanations of the material, as well as the lecture notes. Weaknesses were the amount of lecture time",
                "Strengths: The qsets were good review and the material was pretty interesting to me, a person who really doesn't care for science classes.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that topics from lecture to lecture were woven together better rather than seeming to be unrelated. I also wish the in-person lectures had more new materials rather than almost a direct summary of recorded lectures. I also wish that more compassion and less - I don't think ableism is the right word, but something similar and worrying - was extended to the patients in cited studies.",
                "Requiring us to watch two hours of recorded lectures twice a week and ALSO attend synchronous lectures made this class take up significantly more time than it should have as a 1hr 15 min class twice a week. We also had weekly quizzes and three hour long psets. Improving this course could start by shifting from thinking about how much work you ought to give students to thinking about how to best facilitate their learning.",
                "Strengths: very, very, very detailed notes and videos! While a lot of work to annotate the notes and watch the videos in addition to going to live lectures, it was definitely worth it and made me understand a lot of the material. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the actual class time could have been used differently. It was basically a synopsis of the pre-recorded videos but without going into as much depth, so normally I did not get much out of going to the live lecture.",
                "Strengths: the weekly 3 hour Q-sets while seemingly long at first, these ended up helping me really reinforce my material acquisition and I'm glad they exist (otherwise, I would have had no accountability), \r\nProf. McCarthy is great as well. He knows so much and is very willing to help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final even (though it was open-note this year) was just a brain killer due to its sheer breadth of material. I highly recommend that this class maintains the Q-set format with still having a midterm exam to lessen the huge load that the final puts on the students. I studied for hours but still felt very unprepared when taking the exam. I have so much respect for the people who took the final on paper\/in-person in previous years because it is impossible.",
                "The information you learn is very important, and the professor is great at teaching very complex topics. It's just SO MUCH lecture time. You're expected to watch prerecorded lectures that range from an hour and a half to two hours. And then you have to attend the live lecture where more information will be taught... and the live lecture is basically a spark notes of the recorded lecture.",
                "Could have been structured better with the progression of concepts. A clearer overview of what our week-to-week schedule would have been nice, as well as a bit more clarity with respect to the psychological versus anatomical concepts we need to understand.",
                "Thought this course was really good compared to my others in the online format.   The problem sets were stressful but manageable if you worked hard, and I much preferred the format to a midterm (and felt like it helped me to stay engaged).",
                "Strengths - very comprehensive, there is a large amount of information covered in a semester long course. The professor is also very skilled at explaining information and how it relates to case studies and experiments. There is also a lot of evident research that goes into the lectures. Weaknesses - large time commitment, having recorded lectures before live lectures is largely unnecessary as almost the identical material is covered, and yet the added up lecture time is more than double than if it was just the normal lectures.",
                "Strengths: the sheer quantity of information covered, the professor's thorough and detailed lectures, resource availability for a more in-depth understanding\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For those who wish to take thorough notes and actually understand the content in the lectures, prerecorded lectures take up a considerable amount of time. (A 30 min video might take 1 hr to watch.) The information taught in prerecorded lectures is then reiterated in live lectures, making the class incredibly time-consuming.\r\n\r\nLearning is rewarding when you are in the zone and are consistently engaged with the material at hand. However, during a pandemic, when motivation is already low and all classes occur via a computer screen, it can be very difficult to sit down at a desk for hours on end to watch lectures for a single class. The combination of readings, notes, prerecorded lectures, live lectures, and old lectures (even if you don't use all of them) becomes overwhelming.",
                "The strengths of this class were the additional recorded lectures to ensure the students had several forms to review the content. Furthermore, the provided notes allowed the students to study the material before class, allowing time to formulate questions.",
                "Yale University must never allow a professor to pre-record this much extra lecture material for a course ever again.",
                "This course is packed with information, and I ended up learning a lot about the brain, which is very helpful for future psyc studies.\r\n As the course started with brain anatomy and some biochem stuff, I was a bit thrown off at the beginning.",
                "A strength of this course was that it presented us with a lot of information, but this was simultaneously the course's weakness, as I felt that there was an overwhelming amount of information at times, and Professor McCarthy, while he did an excellent job of explaining all of that information in great detail, didn't always do as excellent a job of keeping the pure volume of information down somewhat.",
                "The structure of the course makes it very reading\/memorization intensive, also a lot of lectures to watch.",
                "Incredible amount of knowledge must be learned. But the professor does everything in his power to prepare you. The course is set up with weekly Q-sets which ensure you stay on top of material, which is great. Final is pretty brutal in what it covers, so a midterm and non-cumulative final might be a better system.",
                "This class was organized wonderfully, as there were so many resources to aid us in learning. However, I feel as though there was too much content, such that it was overwhelming and incredibly stressful. Because there was only one exam, that being the final, I wasn't sure how to prepare or what to expect, which made me very anxious.",
                "I thought that the live and recorded lecture made the class feel a bit repetitive.",
                "The organization was a major strength. Weakness would be receiving feedback on qsets. After the first 3 qsets we moved onto gradescope where our work wasn't corrected so it was difficult to understand why I got things wrong sometimes.",
                "Interesting content \r\nToo much work for the time given, class moves very fast for an intro class",
                "Review sessions should be recorded for students who are in far away time zones.",
                "The class was well facilitated for online learning and the structure of each lecture was very helpful",
                "The greatest strength and weakness of the course are strikingly the same: the ample, ample amount of material that is provided. Each 75 minute lecture came not only with a corresponding slideshow, but also with a thorough note supplement and 1.5-3 hours of pre-recorded material to watch before lecture. While this much material can be extremely helpful, given that repetition is key for understanding the anatomy and physiology of the brain, I often found the sheer amount of material to be both overwhelming and unrealistic (especially within a virtual setting where Zoom fatigue is very much a real thing). I quickly came to a point where I, as a student taking four other courses, had to selectively choose which content to focus on, and unfortunately this resulted in me only watching the pre-recorded lectures and rarely attending the live lectures (which were usually a less thorough review of the pre-recorded lectures). In order to improve live lecture attendance, there needs to be a simplification of material in order to reduce (if not completely eliminate) some of the pre-recorded lectures. I believe this simplification would also help students perform better on the final exam, as I found that materials that I focused on in the pre-recorded lectures were far more complex than the more fundamental understanding required for the test. Ultimately, I ended up spending so much time on the small details that I missed the fundamental cores, leading to a worse performance on the exam than I would have hoped for.",
                "There was a lot of information and it often felt like there wasn't enough time to engage with all of it. However, I liked having weekly qsets rather than large exams.",
                "weekly qsets were great, but a midterm might have been helpful",
                "Strengths: Well organized info\r\nWeakness: A little bit too much info, easy to get caught up",
                "-I belive the final exam was a bit long for the time allowed (understandably because of format changes due to covid)",
                "Strength: \r\n- I think the pre-recorded lectures were very helpful \r\n- The fact that the q-sets were open-note was helpful and I think that really pushed me to learn the material\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\n- pre-recorded lectures were very long, and it might have been nice to have either the pre-recorded lecture time reduced or the live lecture time reduced, if possible",
                "I love the consistent effort throughout the semester. I appreciate how much the p-sets make up such a big part of our grade, so putting in effort all semester long is rewarded. I think the lectures were pretty monotonous... it was hard to stay engaged on zoom for over an hour with nothing to mix it up. Also, I dont understand why the p-sets must be completed in one sitting. That essentially makes it an open-book test once a week, not an assignment. I like to spread out my work throughout the week and to be forced to spend 3 hours all at once seems entirely unnecessary. I felt it hindered my learning of the material because I couldnt do little sections at a time and absorb what I was reading.",
                "The course content was incredibly interesting, if you're into neuroscience and psychology. The recorded lectures and the live lectures often overlapped and it became redundant. Also the pre-recorded lectures were often very long (1.5-2 hrs per class day). This meant that watching both pre-recorded lectures and live lectures amounted to 5-7 lecture hours per week. This was a huge weakness in the course, and should be modified for remote learning in the future.",
                "I loved how much you learn from the course, however, I think in-class lectures were too similar to the pre-recorded lectures. It felt like I was listening to the pre-recorded lectures twice.",
                "Taking this class in person would've made it better, along with having a small break in the middle to stretch and move about. It was hard to stay focused during class while sitting in my dorm room",
                "I believe this was not an aspect of the course usually, but the quantity of recorded videos we had to watch before even coming to lecture was not reasonable for us to accomplish. The friends I had in the class that watched every single video seemed to be very overworked. The amount of time I spent on this class was more than I spent on any other class, and I still didnt consistently feel super confident that a I knew all the material. The review sessions were all helpful.",
                "Strength: I think the course gave a nice overview of the brain that was accessible to people of different majors. I think professor did a good job at explaining things in a easy way. I liked that the majority of our grade cam from the psets. I thought the questions accurately reflected what we were learning and they were also open note. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I would have liked there to be more application based questions rather than just referring back to the notes and lectures. I also do not really understand the point of having recorded lectures and live lectures. The live lectures repeated what was said in the recorded and for the most part didn't include new information related to the topics of that day. Also, since this course was an 1 hour and 15 min and the recorded lectures were meant to be the main focus of the class, I would have liked them to shorter and more condense to fit that time slot which did occur more towards the end of the semester.",
                "The recorded lectures and notes\/pre recorded lectures were very helpful. However, the final was brutal and I felt unprepared and overwhelmed.",
                "The material was explained very well but there was not much engagement between the professor and the students",
                "I really appreciated how the lecture notes were given in advance, which meant that I could study ahead of time and also revise effectively for the qSets. However, I found the volume of content a bit overwhelming, and the time commitment required to engage with all the pre-recorded and live lectures was too much for me to handle. Personally, a more distilled version of the lectures would have been more helpful.",
                "Strengths: The prerecorded videos are extremely thorough and well-explained. \r\nWeaknesses: Extremely time consuming to get through all the material each week, and it takes a lot more time in the Zoom format than it would have in person.",
                "There was a lot of material that we were expected to know in detail, and the class went very quickly. I don't know if this is a weakness or a strength, though.",
                "Strengths were that we learned so so much about the brain in this class! Weakness is that there was a lot of material, slightly overwhelming especially in the first half of the semester",
                "I thought that having weekly qsets was good for keeping up with the material, but I wish we had had a midterm to break up the course.",
                "Very well organized: the website really facilitated learning and the prerecorded lectures were extremely helpful in grasping the information. There was also a very logical progression to the course. I can't think of how the structure of the course could be improved.",
                "this course covers a lot of material but it can often feel overwhelming, probably more so due to this virtual mode of learning",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive material\r\nWeaknesses: Too much material. Recorded + live lectures combined was 4+ hrs of lectures \/ week"

                "Successes were that the qsets and the final are open-note and there were weekly review sessions held by Professor McCarthy. \r\nThe class could improve upon engagement during lecture, perhaps with more breakout room questions.",
                "Having both the recorded lectures and live lectures felt extremely redundant to me since they were basically the exact same\r\nI also would have loved having small group sections with TFs like I have in other large STEM lecture classes",
                "The prerecorded lectures were helpful, but the fact that we had to watch 2 hour long prerecorded lectures + go to class made it difficult to balance courseload and stay engaged.",
                "I think the pre-recorded and live lecture model works, just watch how much is put into the pre-recorded (especially since you included pre-recorded lectures from years past). Same with the written materials, considering there were lecture notes and supplementary textbook passages and scientific articles.",
                "One of the only issues I had with the course was the length of pre-lecture videos. It is my opinion that pre-recorded lecture videos should not amount to more time than the actual length of the class. Especially since most of the material was just covered again anyways. In some instances the total video length would amount to more than 2 hours. I think that it should just be considered that many other professors also decided to do lecture videos in addition to live-virtual lecture and as someone who watches them at normal speed and stops to take notes, this amounted to a lot of time for me. Additionally, this was the only class that I had of 3 that followed the same course mode, in which the lectures videos were so long. Even though I did enjoy learning the material, I think this is an aspect one should be considered for next semester.",
                "I think the recorded videos were very beneficial for learning the material, but it could feel repetitive when watching the recorded lectures before class and not covering much new material. I think it would be helpful to reduce the recorded lectures to minimize overlap.",
                "I like the prerecorded lectures because we can plan when to watch them before class.",
                "The posting of the lecture videos and notes ahead of time was very helpful in managing time; however, the lectures were very very long (even when watching at 2x speed).",
                "McCarthy offered more extensive prerecorded material which made the in-person lectures review (which felt like a waste of time). The prerecorded material was fantastic, however. With the extra time he was able to discuss each unit inn real depth.",
                "There was not much virtual engagement in this course, much of the class was just watching lecture and reading supplementary materials. There was an attempt at breakout rooms, however, with virtual learning, everyone was at different places in keeping up with material so the disscussions in the breakout romms were not always very productive. Perhaps a weekly email to a TA would be a better way for virtual engagement - like answering a question and emailing that \"homework\" to a TA so you can get immediate feedback on whether you know what is going on in class and it could open the door for easier communication.",
                "For a remote semester, the workload was too much. It is a lot to expect students to watch an entire prerecorded lecture and read lecture notes before actual live lecture. This made studying hard as well since there was so much different places the material was covered. Furthermore, the prerecorded lectures were often longer than an hour and thirty minutes. It is fair that students can play the lectures at a faster speed but it was still a struggle to capture all of the material and stay on top of the class. On top of that, there were weekly qsets that required students to chunk out 3 hours time.",
                "Honestly, this course was displayed perfectly through virtual learning. Lecture notes were given along with pre-recorded lectures for a detailed introduction for each live lecture. Secondly, the live lectures had concurrent diagrams, which allowed students to follow along just as they would in-person. The class ran very smoothly even with it being online.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures definitely helped me as a visual learner (I prefered watching them over reading the textbook). Prof. McCarthy put a lot of effort into making them, and they were great resources for qsets and review. However, please consider making them shorter\/more brief so that you could go into greater detail during the live lectures.",
                "I know some people really didn't like having to watch recordings and then going to live sessions but I really didn't mind that. I think it worked super well to have the lectures available anytime during the week. I had a mom recovering from surgery, a house that's just not super easy to do work in, and a job, so being able to watch whenever worked for me was really nice. Also, they did try to make zoom sessions have a bit of discussion but with everyone being like, devastated half the time, that didn't always work but it wasn't their fault. I think Professor McCarthy made great videos that were really interesting.",
                "Breakout groups were a good idea but people sadly rarely participated in them. I appreciated the review sessions that Prof. McCarthy held outside of class. If there were less of an emphasis on the prerecorded lectures, more people might have shown up to the live lectures.",
                "I think the final exam was not at all conducive to the online learning environment. In an effort to combine the usual rigor of the in-person exam with the open note concept of an online exam, the exam overall was very rushed and very long. I think it would have been much more beneficial for students to have a research paper to end the course. We covered so many interesting topics, and a research paper would have given all of us the opportunity to dive deeper into one of the topics and actually use our knowledge instead of memorizing flash cards and organizing an entire semester's worth of notes for a 3 hour exam",
                "The virtual zoom session allotted to midterm and final review sessions were extremely helpful.",
                "Lecture times were way too much. We had prerecorded lectures that usually totaled up to be 1.5-2 hours (longer than they should have been) per lecture, as well as synchronous lectures at the normal class time. This totaled up to be about 6 hours worth of lecture per week when it should have been 2.5. It was way too much, and many students (myself included) just did not have time to do this, and had to pick and choose which things we thought were worth watching or not.",
                "This class was unforgiving and brutal during the pandemic. The workload was ridiculous with synchronous lectures on top of prerecorded lectures and quizzes and psets. ESPECIALLY during a time of universal stress and panic like this semester--- this was awful. Also, we were told at midterm the exam would be open note (to adjust for not being able to proctor the exam I guess) and then like a week before the exam we were told that it would be so many questions in so little time that we would not be able to look everything up and it would be essentially not open book. The professor also said he made the exam as hard as it has been in the past and I cannot fathom why he would side against empathy and hold us to the standards that his classes NOT HAPPENING DURING A PANDEMIC were held to.",
                "The pre-recorded videos were a big help!! Again, it was a lot of work to watch them (sometimes the videos would amount to around 2 hours per class), but I learned a lot from them.",
                "I really liked having the pre-recorded lectures before class to review the material ahead of live sessions. That helped our understanding a lot.",
                "Please shorten the recorded lectures or live lecture. The live lecture is kinda useless... since it's basically the same information. If we had the option of just watching live or recorded, then it would be perfect.",
                "Did not need the live lectures, they added far too much time and the same information was repeated from the recordings.",
                "This was great in virtual learning honestly, compared to my other classes.  The one thing I would say is that watching all the pre-recorded lecture videos and the live lectures takes up a lot of time, and a lot of the material is repeated (but not completely).  I would just have the live lectures (and maybe post them later for like time zone differences), and then pre-recorded supplementary material, instead of the sort of supplementary stuff\/more detail in the live lectures.",
                "The recorded lectures are not very beneficial to class and just are extra time. However, the live lectures worked well, as did the virtual open note Qsets and quick quizzes.",
                "It was wonderful that lectures were recorded, though review sessions were not.\r\nI wish Piazza had been used more actively, to encourage greater participation and help create a 'class feel.' It seemed people were emailing TAs or the professor directly.",
                "I appreciated Professor McCarthy's extra investment in the course upon the virtual format. However, the pre-recorded and live lectures combined amounted to a pretty large time investment each week. That being said, it's still doable if each student makes choices about their individual priorities.",
                "this was a great covid course because he's so organized and up-to-date. he is pretty good with tech, all of his lecture notes, powerpoints, and pre-recorded videos are uploaded on this very pretty, easy-to-navigate website",
                "Professor McCarthy recorded far too much content that anyone could be reasonably expected to meaningfully consume in the BEST of times, but given that we are living in a pandemic and suffered through incalculable loss and difficulties adapting to new lives on campus, off campus, or struggling with challenges of studying remotely with family\/guardians, it was simply too much. Professors should not be allowed to pre-record lecture content that surpasses the amount of lecture content that they would have in a normal semester. Professors should only have their allotted time in the course's schedule to lecture and not a minute more. Professor McCarthy pre-recorded 2+ hours of lecture material per class meeting, in addition to having an hour and 15 minute live lecture component. This led to us having around 7 hours of lecture material to consume on a WEEKLY basis. This doesn't even account for the amount of time it takes to create notes or study the material after the initial viewing of it all. This also was redundant as he mostly covered the same content from the pre-recorded lecture, but there were days where he included new content embedded in the original content, thus requiring every student to either watch the full lecture or scrub through until they reached new content. None of his lectures had captioning or a transcription available, so they were very inaccessible as well. Professor McCarthy made all of our quizzes open-note, and after mid-semester feedback, made the final open-note. However, with 4 days to spare before the final he informed us that, while the final was technically open note, there were so many questions in so little time that it would be impossible for us to consult our notes for the majority of the questions and that we must treat it like a closed-note exam. This was after several weeks of the entire class preparing for the final expecting it to be open-note.",
                "The prerecorded lectures and live sessions basically covered the same things so they could get repetitive. I made sure to watch all of the lectures and live sessions and felt a bit overwhelmed with simply how much time you'd have to devote to watching lectures. I was also enrolled from a distant time zone so I couldn't participate in any of the review sessions, which were not recorded due to privacy reasons. Would be better if more accommodations were made for those in other time zones!",
                "There were both pre-recorded lectures and live recorded lectures on Zoom, which both worked well for me. Professor McCarthy also made use of Piazza for students to ask questions, which I thought also worked well. In general, I don't think much needed to be improved on in this area.",
                "The review sessions were helpful",
                "Pre-recorded lectures plus recorded live lectures made all the information readily available on students' individual schedules. Professor McCarthy went above and beyond in this regard.",
                "The recorded lectures were very helpful, as I could return to them whenever. However, maybe the usage of TA sections or optional discussions would be helpful in reviewing concepts and helping students comprehend what they just learned in lectures that week.",
                "I thought that having extremely long recorded lectures in addition to live lecture made this course much more difficult to keep up with.",
                "This course did an extremely good job of transitioning to online learning.",
                "Either live lecture or recorded lecture, but not both",
                "Prof. McCarthy prepared amazing videos to help us reinforce the material.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were very useful.",
                "McCarthy does an excellent job at providing ample, ample material in order to address the difficulty of self-learning that comes with isolating oneself during the pandemic. However, what McCarthy does not seem to grasp is how immensely fatiguing watching videos and lectures is for hours upon hours at a time as a full-time student. While the videos he provided were helpful, I believe that his attempt to keep students more engaged with the material actually had the reverse effect for many students: I became so overwhelmed by the amount of pre-recorded material, written supplements, and lecture material that I mentally checked out. I know several students who felt the same way and addressed such concerns on Piazza, yet there seemed to be a lack of understanding from the teaching fellows and instructor, with the general response being, Speed up the pre-recorded material if that is helpful. I believe that McCarthy is a wonderful professor with the best of intentions who is exceptionally devoted to his students, but in the case of COVID-19, less is more. \r\n\r\nHowever, one major strength of the course given the online, virtual format was the use of breakout rooms during live lectures, as these breakout rooms enabled students to stay engaged by actively discussing with peers. \r\n\r\nWhile McCarthy seemed to attempt to address the concerns of virtual learning by making the final exam open-note, I believe that the ability to use notes actually hurt my performance rather than helped it. Without having access to a practice exam, I had absolutely no concept as to how to time manage for the exam, and I ended up being far too reliant on my notes and running out of time to answer many, many of the questions. Personally, I believe that I would have performed better without using any notes at all and just relying on my gut. Please, PLEASE, incorporate some sort of a practice exam in the future (whether the exam is open-note or not) to allow students to practice this time management skill.",
                "The qsets succeeded and the combination of synchronous and asynchronous lectures could be improved.",

                "There was no variety in the Zoom lectures. I found it really hard to focus for an hour and fifteen minutes 2 times a week to the same style lecture.",
                "I liked how the prerecorded lectures and recorded lectures were available online. I don't think the prerecorded lectures were new, but they definitely were nice to have available. The breakout rooms were hit or miss though, as in some no one wanted to talk",
                "The review sessions and lectures themselves were fine. The recorded lectures were especially digestible. It was more the combination of both and the quantity of time spent on the class that was a bit of a drawback.",
                "Having the focus of the class in the recorded lectures was really helpful. It is much easier to follow along and take notes than just a regular live lecture. Allowing us to do the psets and weekly quizzes during our own time was really accommodating.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the final was delivered was not conducive to online learning. The test was not really user friendly and could have been displayed in a more easier to follow way.",
                "Virtual learning went well",
                "As above, having the lecture notes available beforehand was really great, but the volume of pre-recorded and live lectures was a huge time commitment that I wasn't really prepared for. I did appreciate the in-class polls and breakout rooms, though, that did help me stay more engaged than simply watching a lecture.",
                "The class could definitely go slower, in my opinion, to be able to take in and process more material.",
                "Live lectures were great! I felt the pre-recorded lectures were not as useful as the live lectures",
                "Having prerecorded lectures was really useful, as was the weekly quizzes. However, I found having both prerecorded and live lectures to be overwhelming and often redundant.",
                "There is a exuberance of information for this course. It was very demanding and required a lot of time, but it is very complicated material and I don't think I would have learned as much if Prof. McCarthy cut anything out. I think the prerecorded lectures were very informative and helpful, and I appreciated the opportunities for questions, discussions, etc. during the live lecture meetings.",
                "I really liked having the lectures recorded and the weekly Q&As, I liked having the weekly question sets instead of a midterm, but the pre-recorded videos often felt very long and unnecessarily repetitive in the actual virtual lecture.",
                "Given that remote learning is a lot more challenging, I would appreciate if the workload could be lessened to accommodate. I did appreciate that the final exam and qsets were open book.",
                "Weekly Psets were great this semester, as were weekly quizzes. I appreciated that they replaced midterms, for virtual learning especially. However, I think this course was incredibly poorly structured in terms of the delivery of material. It is simply unreasonable to expect students to watch 90 min prerecorded lectures ahead of a 75 minute lecture two times per weekespecially when both of these are VIRTUAL. It is rather uninspired way to learn over recordings of slide presentations ahead of a live slide presentation. I would appreciate condensing this into one live lecture so that I actually have time to consolidate my learning after lecture instead of just worrying about the next lecture."

                "If you are interested in the structures and functions of the human brain, you should absolutely take this course.",
                "Not unless it is required for your major",
                "Only if you're really interested in neuroscience\/the brain. I am, so it was definitely worth it, but if you're not, it might not be the exciting class (lots of material and McCarthy isn't a very engaging professor during lectures)",
                "Yes! Initially, this class is very intimidating. By the end, it was my favorite of the semester! This is a great class to take if you're interested in learning more about the brain. The lectures are engaging and well-designed. I do not recommend taking this class if you already have a difficult course load, though.",
                "If you need to take this course, take it. Just know that it is a lot a lot of work and doesn't always feel rewarding.",
                "If you're a medical student or want some cool facts about the brain, this is a good class for you. Just be sure to find your own way to understanding things. Student-made quizlets were the only thing keeping me afloat the first few weeks.",
                "If this is someone's major requirement, I would, but if someone is trying to take this course for fun into addition to other work heavy courses next semester, I would suggest something else. This course does require effort be put in.",
                "Yes, this is a very informative course.",
                "I would recommend this to a student who either 1. is very interested in this topic and is willing to put in the time to learn a TON or 2. is cred\/d\/failing the class to reduce workload.",
                "Absolutely. I thought I could get through neuroscience without taking any introductory courses. I am so glad I took this class. It is an introductory course, but McCarthy teaches every topic in incredible depth and they build on each other, rather than being surveys of slightly-related fields. PLEASE take it if you're on the fence. I learned more in this class than in any other I have taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. This is a fascinating class for anyone. We all have brains and it is beneficial to understand what goes on inside to some degree. If you have time to dedicate to this class it is worth it. There is a solid 10 hour commitment (aside from lecture)  for prerecorded material and homework sets.",
                "I would if you are able to put the work into the class. Professor McCarthy is really clear about what you need to do in order to get the most out of the class, and he holds helpful weekly office hour review sessions, but the class can be difficult if you're not able to do all those things. I took the class as a psych major who wanted a useful science credit and a natural science core, and I really enjoyed the content on illnesses and brain lesions, but the anatomy that you have to learn before you get to that point was grueling at times. Overall, you can get a lot out of the class if you're interested in the content and are willing to put in the work you need to.",
                "Yes, the material was so interesting and this is a great course if you are willing to put in a lot of time and effort! Very useful in a lot of fields and understanding everyday life as well.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, as it has meaning and interest in all aspects of life. Even if you are not interested in neuroscience, this course allows students to retain given material and apply it to real-world scenarios to be able to instinctually discover \"how things work.\" The brain is a powerful tool with many intricacies, and in this course, you learn about each aspect of the brain, itself, and how it cohesively coordinates other movements through the nervous systems.",
                "Yes, but only if you're interested in neuroscience\/psych\/human behavior. If you don't have this passion, the class will be overwhelming.",
                "Yes! If youre interested in learning brain anatomy and really cool clinical cases but dont mind the workload.",
                "Yes, if interested in the human brain and neuroscience! I learned so much about the content, and the lectures were interesting. The reading and pre-lecture videos are very time-consuming though.",
                "It was interesting to learn about the content, but it was EXTREMELY time-consuming.",
                "I would if they were in Psych or otherwise interested but I wouldn't just like, suggest it as a science credit. I really liked it and learned a lot that connects to psychology so I would definitely encourage psych majors to take this class as a science credit.",

                "Yes, if you are interested in learning neuroscience and want a glimpse into the array of topics.",
                "Yes I would, but it definitely is a decent amount of work",
                "Honestly, if you are not a neuroscience major or specifically need it for the psych major-- do not take this course.",
                "Definitely, especially if you are looking to better your foundational knowledge of the human brain (helpful for neuro and psych majors!). It will be a lot of hard work but you will walk out with an incredible amount of knowledge!",
                "Yes, you need to learn this information to study psychology! But I honestly can't imagine taking this course close-book.",
                "If you would like an overview of the brain, this is the only course to go to. It allows me to participate in conversations that consider anatomy and psychological conditions.",
                "Yes!  Lots of work, lots of material, the final was really hard, but you learn a lot.",
                "Yes, it is a very comprehensive course and introduction to neuroscience. However there is a lot of information students are expected to learn so I recommend it to people who want to indepthly learn the subject.",
                "For those interested in learning anything about the human brain, I recommend this class.\r\nMy only piece of advice is to be mindful about prerecorded lectures. Use breaks to catch up on any lectures you missed. Give yourself peace of mind when finals come so you can focus on studying, rather than playing catch up.",
                "Yes. I took this course as a senior, looking for an interesting science credit, and I truly learned a lot from Professor McCarthy's lectures. Because I came to the course simply looking to learn something new, not embark on the neuroscience major, I probably engaged with the course less than my peers, but I still benefited from it.",
                "yes! I wish I put more time and energy into it. People say this course is so difficult and stressful, but honestly I think it's totally doable. You don't have to go to live lectures, so put in about 5-6 hours a week for the two units of the week and you're fine. it's much different online because you don't have to memorize random things, but conceptually I found it fascinating. I'm also not a STEM person at all, but still found the technical mechanisms and structures cool. There is no need to know everything in this class unless you want to go into neuroscience (even med students hate studying the brain), but it's cool to know how things work generally.",
                "Absolutely. I would recommend this class to all majors since it provides explanations for a wide set of neural processes. From psychology to neurobiology, this class helps reveal how the brain interacts with the environment and others.",
                "Only take this course if you have to.",
                "Yes for psyc and neuro majors. If you just need a sc credit I'd say look somewhere else, unless you're really interested in the brain.\r\nThis class is very information heavy and I ended up learning so much. As long as you are willing to put in the work, it will be a fruitful experience. As a psyc major, I'm very happy to have taken it because now I know the fundamentals of neuroscience which could be of great help for the future.",
                "I would recommend it for anyone interested in learning about the brain in great detail. Seeing as we use our brains every day for just about everything we do, I definitely think it's important to understand it.",
                "Yes, it's tough but a great intro to neurobio",
                "Yes because of the subject matter, but be ready to put in serious work.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they wish to major in neuroscience (or psychology) or wish to really learn about the human brain. However, I would not take this course for an easy science credit, because one must really put in the time and effort to do well.",
                "Listen.\r\nIf this class could be taken without the stress of grading I'd recommend it. I really would. This stuff is fascinating. However there are grades, so that creates a pressure which in my experience made learning much less fun. \r\nSo it may not be fun for you. Maybe it will. But maybe not. \r\nIf you're reading this, you probably have to take this course. If you have to take this course, just pause and take a deep breath. You're going to do just fine. Try your best to have fun, but if you don't hey at least you survived. Drink plenty of water, sleep as much as you can (even if that means being late for a deadline. It'll be okay, get your rest), and go outside every now and then. Remember, you're brilliant. You made it into this place called Yale, and you sure as heck can make it through. I'm rooting for you, and so are all the students who came before you. Bless :)",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student; however, I advise that the student first takes a time management course or two through OCS. As a neuroscience major, this course has significantly helped me gain a fundamental (if not ample) understanding of brain anatomy and jargon needed as I read scientific papers. However, I struggled to keep up with the workload for this course, especially given the inevitably draining format of learning from home during a pandemic. I also struggled greatly with time management on the final exam, and I ended up running out of time and leaving many, many questions blank. The concern with this class is not whether or not you can understand the material provided, but rather, how well you navigate and prioritize that material.",

                "Id recommend it in person. The material was great and the structure of p-sets\/assignments were great. However, the Zoom format did not work for me in such a big class.",
                "I would recommend if you're interested in neuroscience and psychology. I learned a lot and I know that it will be applicable in more advanced neuro\/psych courses.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the brain. Prof. McCarthy is such a great professor and keeps detailed AND organized lecture notes and videos which helps a lot when you have a ton of information to learn. I think the workload is not too much greater than the average class at Yale as long as you keep up with watching the pre-recorded lectures and studying the material outside of class.",
                "It was an interesting class. There's a lot of work involved that I didn't care for entirely, but if this is what you're interested in, I don't think it would be an issue.",
                "Good introductory course. Doable if youre not typical a science-y person, but you definitely have to put in the work.",
                "Yes. It does not matter if you are psychology\/neuroscience major, this class is a great introduction to the brain. If you are premed, this class is especially helpful. I thought all the topics especially in the latter half after anatomy was done were all really interesting.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, the material is very interesting while not being too difficult",
                "Depending on their capacity for the time commitment, yes I would. I would say that it's fascinating and they'll learn a lot, but I would caution them that it is a lot of information and a lot of work.",
                "If you have to take it for your major or if you just want a really strong introduction to neuroscience, take it, but only if you're taking a 4 credit semester.",
                "Yes, it is a very good class, but I would recommend taking it after you have taken other Neuroscience\/psych\/cog sci classes, as the class is something of an information dump. It is all very interesting, but would be more meaningful if you already have some knowledge of the things the class expands on. I would say it is more of a supplementary knowledge class than a one off \"here's some brain stuff\" class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student, but only if your major requires it. While it is an incredibly interesting course, the workload and material is very high and requires a lot of time to study it.",
                "Absolutely! Essential foundation course for anyone interested in studying the brain!",
                "Yes! I loved this class as a person who's interested in all aspects of the brain- from anatomy to recent studies. It covered a lot of material, but it didn't just touch on a little of everything- I feel like we learned a good amount of details that helped me understand how everything was connected.",
                "If you are willing to put in the time and effort, yes. It is incredibly rewarding and interesting, but it is a lot of work and you will get lost if you don't keep up with it.",
                "I would recommend this course (especially since it's required for NSCI majors) but otherwise it's a lot of work and information - pretty intense of a course."
