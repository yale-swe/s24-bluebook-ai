I learned to write a 3-4 page paper on  intricate subjects and intriguing questionswriting such a short assignment is far more challenging than papers that can ramble longer. I also began to read more slowly, trying to appreciate how each sentence leads toward Aristotle's conception of the world.",

                "I always looked forward to the opener Professor Garsten would provide to the class, especially when moving through the texts slowly. We would often read only a few paragraphs over the course of a session together, and I loved the challenge of trying to understand how every word and line fit together. The paper topics were always interesting and invited a creative re-imagining of Aristotle's world. Professor Garsten also gave detailed and thoughtful feedback. My only challenge in fully enjoying the class was the dynamic among the students. The course was cross-listed for graduate students, who often took over the discussion. A more balanced set of students in the class could greatly improve the experience, but I think our challenges were very specific to our particular year. Overall, an excellent class.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. Never had I spent so much time and energy on a single philosopher, and this was the perfectly formatted course to do it for the first time. Further, Professor Garsten is one of the most insightful professors I've had at Yale. I do wish he had made a better effort to mitigate the level of conversation domination by a handful of students. Despite having ideas that I wanted to share, I felt that my confidence in speaking up was severely diminished because just one or two people were name dropping secondary sources that I had never read, and who were so caught up in their own arguments that they lost all charitability toward others.",
                "The syllabus is well designed. I especially like the inclusion of Aristotle's metaphysics as well as early modern and contemporary responses to Aristotle. The class discussion is usually well-organized and thought-provoking. There is no major weakness.",
                "I liked how much close reading we did in class and the big questions that we asked, but sometimes it  felt like we bit off more than we could chew.",
                "The undergraduate-graduate system provided an interesting dynamic, which could sometimes be challenging. The discussion could become unbalanced, but Prof. Garsten generally guided it back on track. He was a highlight of the course, pushing us to think deeper and more methodically about the texts from the foundation up. This was reflected in the syllabus, which really helped to give grounding to Aristotle's later, more complex political ideas. It was a great mix of readings without feeling like a superficial or hasty overview.",
                "The strength of the course is the mode of reading that Professor Garsten encouraged and practiced in class: slow, careful, and with primary focus on understanding Aristotle in his own terms."

It does not matter whether you like Aristotle, because part of the point of taking such a class is to challenge your perceptions and opinions of him. As long as you are willing to do that and not hold to a previous reading, I recommend this class."
