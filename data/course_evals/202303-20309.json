            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Straightforward presentation of reactions and schemes, easy to follow Slavoffs reasonings and lines of thinking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the speed of the course really amped up in the last three or four classes, resulting in a less than satisfactory experience learning new reactions.",
                "STRENGTHS: Profs. Slavoff and Son are both fantastic, and the workload is manageable. Prof. Son lectured too quickly sometimes but it's her first time teaching so I'm sure she'll adjust. With these professors it's probably the best that organic chemistry can be. The PSets are just right to facilitate learning. WEAKNESSES: Not enough office hours / peer tutoring (I was never able to attend a single office hour!); supposedly the office hours that do happen are super crowded anyway; no focus on learning IUPAC nomenclature (important for medicine or chem/chemE majors); last two weeks of material felt rushed; grade cutoffs were obscured by the curve system so it was hard to figure out how I was doing",
                "Weaknesses: THE POP QUIZZES. I felt like I was constantly studying for this class, which made it difficult for me to keep up in other classes. It was also very stressful when I had to miss class for extracurriculars.",
                "Strengths is that the pop quizzes keep you accountable. Weaknesses: we fell behind pretty quickly through the semester and we covered a lot at the end of the semester.",
                "The course material was presented in an organized and consistent way. There were many opportunities to practice the content through homework, discussion section, study halls, peer-tutors, etc. Another strength is the exams were all fair and accurately reflected the course material. I believe the pop quizzes should be removed, though. It often felt like I had inadequate time to process and practice material before I was assessed on it.",
                "the strengths is we get a lot of helpful resources. the weaknesses is rushing through the course material",
                "The pacing felt good until the last two weeks of class, where it felt like information was being thrown at us with less explanation.",
                "strengths: sarah is a really compassionate and articulate lecturer, even if the material goes fast - I found myself much more engaged in class compared to gen chem lectures\r\nweaknesses: no recorded lectures, which made it difficult toward the end when lecture moved really fast (& it was sometimes difficult to read the board)",
                "The lectures are really clear and the homework assignments are really helpful.",
                "Great content. No weaknesses come to mind",
                "This class was very helpful in introducing the principles of organic chemistry and building upon the knowledge from general chemistry. I liked the lectures and how assignments and exams were structured. However, I feel the pop quizzes were unnecessary.",
                "strengths- sarah slavoff is the absolute sweetest person and her grading system is even sweeter, she obviously loves her job and teaching. weakness- everyone always wanted to know about grading and there weren't definitive answers throughout the term. i understand that she used pop quizzes to make sure we went to class/kept up with material but they are EXTREMELY EXTREMELY stressful (especially considering that we could have class on monday and a pop quiz on wednesday on the content learned on monday, so we had to learn all those reactions and mechanisms). just thinking back on it makes me shudder. and the quizzes consisted of 1-3 questions, so the average was always around 12-16/20. that was tough im not gonna lie. exams were fair but still tricky.",
                "Strengths: There is a nice review period at the start of the course where you go back over relevant content from Gen Chem, but in a bit more depth. The class is, for the most part, paced nicely. The exams are fair and the pop quizzes aren't really \"pop,\" so those end up being fair as well. The professor/preceptor both did a good job taking questions while lecturing as well.\r\nWeaknesses: The review period at the start takes awhile and then the end of the course felt really rushed, so maybe rebalancing that would be good. I felt like we spent a lot of time on a few reactions in the middle of the course and then went through like 5x as many in a quarter of the time at the end of the course.",
                "This course was well taught as the lectures were easy to follow and clear instructions were given for homework and tests. Towards the end it we did cover a lot of new material within a short period of time so I think it would be helpful to cut down on some of the earlier content to spend more time on the later material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Slavoff was a great lecturer! There is a lot of support available and the course was very well organized so everything felt on pace. \r\nWeaknesses: Having 9 am time for the course was rough, the 4 pop quizzes do create stress but they were nice in hinting if a pop quiz is to occur in a given week.",
                "This course was fairly well taught throughout but could have benefited from more practice problems being made available on a regular basis outside of discussion section.",
                "STRENGTHS: lots of opportunity for practice. WEAKNESSES: i feel like there were a lot of things I had to teach myself to understand what was going on. Doing homework took time because there were times where examples or niche concepts on the homework were not covered in class",
                "Towards the end we were given an excessive amount of problem sets. \r\nPros were that we given room to fail with some of our psets in order to learn",
                "I think the units could have been spaced out a little better, and the last few lectures were understandably rushed due to the printer incident, but it did make it more difficult to learn the last reactions. Overall, I enjoyed learning about the reactions and gaining a better understanding of how mechanisms work.",
                "definitely taught well!",
                "Strengths: The course was really engaging and had a lot of support available outside of the class. I think Professor Slavoff and Dr. Son had great energy and making the material more enjoyable and the class environment more open for questions and comments.\r\nWeaknesses: While it alleviated the pressure of the course, the problem sets being for participation disincentivized me from fully engaging with the material which caused CHEM 220 to sometimes be lower on the priority list. This would not be beneficial particularly when pop quizzes would arise. The pop quizzes also oftentimes had no preparation material. The achieves and homework would not be comparable to the quizzes, causing really low grades. I am grateful for the generous grade distribution, but I would also like to feel well-prepared to tackle more difficult problems.",
                "To me, the strength of this course was in the assessments because they were very fair. That being said, having to delay the second exam the day-of was a major drawback of the course and generally I felt that the organization of the course could have been better.",
                "I enjoyed this class and appreciated the analog way in which it was taught (all chalkboard, no slides)",
                "Lots of office hours available.",
                "its def a weed out  but sarah and ruth are cool",
                "it was taught fabulously. Sarah Slavoff is a great lecturer.",
                "Strengths: amazing professor, amazing TFs, interesting material, fair exams, engaging lectures, homework either gave immediate feedback and multiple tries or was completion based, lenient grading\r\nWeaknesses: pop quizzes were sometimes very stressful and were difficult enough to the point where you had to guess when they would be and study specifically for them (they were advertised as more of a way to see if you were just attending lecture and paying attention)",
                "Strengths: lectures were organized, exams were fair, most of the TFs were accessible and helpful, homework assignments were helpful and fair; Weaknesses: the unannounced quizzes were not a great way of facilitating student learning as they were unnecessarily challenging and graded unfairly; the grading was too harsh on the quizzes and exams; significant lack of clarity on Quiz/Exam grading",
                "I enjoyed how well-organized the practice exams were and the past quizzes/solutions. I am not sure how helpful the review sessions would be. I feel like the first review session was more helpful because there was time for open QA with questions rather than spending an hour and a half reviewing answers. I also felt that the content was rather rushed in the end especially because we were responsible for understanding epoxides even though it was covered in only one lecture.",
                "The consistent homework assignments on Achieve were integral in my understanding of the content. I also appreciated the moderate pace of the course; this made the content digestible.",
                "The strength of this course was that it was well structured. However, I found the pop quizzes unnecessary and towards the end, the course became fast paced. I also think that having lecture sides could be helpful or clear notes, because the lecture recordings were hard to understand as the chalk is not captured well by the camera. The rest of the course was designed well to facilitate learning.",
                "I really wish we had learned stereochemistry with the reactions the first time around for alkenes because doing it afterwards was very confusing. I like the first part of the course but then it felt like we were just rushing through topics to get to the end and we just had to memorize reactants and products.",
                "The course is well taught. The recordings are very blurry sometimes. Sometimes course materials are taught without sense of big ideas/guiding direction (i.e. just listing reactions after another).",
                "Strengths: \r\n- There is a lot of homework which allows you to practice the principles discussed in class. The different types of homework, written and Achieve also help\r\n- The practice exams are almost the same format of the real exams \r\n- The professor and preceptor were both incredibly patient\r\n- Discussion section built on class material to help you with exams \r\n- Lectures written out on a blackboard so we could keep up!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The Quizzes didn't seem to mimic the practice achieve or hw from the previous week which made them really hard\r\n- The Achieve homework would have been much more useful on paper because the tool was irritating and timeconsuming to use",
                "The strengths of this course are the professors - Professor Slavoff and Dr. Son. They both were very invested in each student's success. They were engaging during lecture as well as accessible during office hours. Furthermore, the support of the TAs and Peer Tutors were excellent. The many study halls and office hours offered multiple opportunities nearly each day to get one-on-one support with questions and problem sets.",
                "I think this course could be improved if it had much more structured learning. Notes in class felt very disjointed and it is was hard to find clear takeaways or themes from a lot of the things we were being told to write down. I also think the grading needed a lot more clarity it was so frustrating not knowing your actual letter grade in the class until essentially the very end.",
                "Strengths: lectures, TF team, and peer teaching teams were especially engaging and helpful for solidifying material and overall making improvement in the class possible \r\nWeaknesses: none, as I feel that the course structure and grading was fair and rewarding of improvement, even despite the challenging course content",
                "Great class with great and understanding lecturers.",
                "The strengths of this course is the opportunities Organic Chemistry has to help you grow outside of class time, whether that be in office hours, peer tutoring, or through the homework we were assigned. One weakness I would say is that in class, the lectures are harder to follow and we sometimes move through the content a little too fast.",
                "I think both Dr. Slavoff and Dr. Son were excellent lecturers, and Betel was a wonderful TA. They were certainly the strengths of the course, and made everything much more enjoyable and clear cut to understand.",
                "Strengths: Both Professor Slavoff and Dr. Sons lectures were very clear and facilitated students learning. Achieve and written problem sets. Dr. Sons discussion section. TF and peer tutor office hours and study halls.\r\nWeaknesses: Quizzes. The quizzes were a huge hinderance to learning in this course, as they privileged students who are able to memorize a brand new set of mechanisms in as few as two days. For example, Quiz 4 assessed complex material taught just two days prior that I had not yet found the tools to understand or internalize (especially with a discussion section that took place after the quiz). Meanwhile, I was able to completely grasp the concept in advance of the exam. There must be a better way to compel students to show up to lecture. If pop quizzes continue to serve this purpose, they should only test basic content like predicting products rather than complex content like entire mechanisms.",
                "This course was very thorough and had many ways of emnsuring that concepts were understood.",
                "The teacher taught us occasional incorrect topics that the teaching fellows had to reteach us.",
                "Strength was clearly taught. Weakness was that the online recording was not very good quality so missing one day was hard to catch up with.",
                "I thought this course was very well-structured. I appreciated the format of discussion sections to reinforce and practice our knowledge in class (which was definitely necessary), and the quizzes were good refreshers for the type of content we would see on the exams. The homework assignments could be a bit odd, with irregular spacing, such as something due either right after an exam or multiple assignments due at once, as well as little written practice (though what we had was only for completion). I also think we fell behind by the end of the semester because the first few weeks felt slow and solely focused on review, whereas in the last ones we went at a significantly faster pace.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple challenges we faced, both predictable (Professor Slavoff leaving during the semester) and unpredictable (the exams not printing), but I thought the teaching team did a fairly good job responding and listening to student feedback and experience.",
                "I liked the grading for the class. It was based on problem sets, quizzes, and exams (the lowest dropped for each). I also enjoyed Professor Slavoff's lectures as she made the class seem less difficult.",
                "I enjoyed the chalk board teaching style, but also it has drawbacks in that there is nothing to reference after class. Weakness: TFs really differ in being helpful I felt mine made the content more confusing than clear",
                "I think presenting more examplessomething the textbook does wellin lectures could heighten the stakes and clarify the universal relevance of the courses content. Oftentimes I found myself wondering why certain things, like memorizing chirality rules or remembering certain reactions, were so broadly foundational in chemistry. Offering context for those bits of information would be useful.",
                "This course went at a manageable pace and was great at going in-depth into the material without being too overwhelming. I felt that the lectures, sections, homeworks, and course structure really enabled me to fully learn and understand the material. I also appreciated the fact that lectures were all written out on the chalkboard instead of on powerpoint; I found this to make the lectures much more engaging and effective.",
                "This was a great course.  Professor Slavoff and Dr. Son were amazing and really made the learning environment comfortable.  Lecture always flowed smoothly and",
                "The weaknesses of this course outnumbered the strengths because the weaknesses were the teaching. Professor Slavoff decided to teach this course despite being 7 months pregnant at the beginning of fall semester. This meant she was going to inevitably leave at some point, and who we were going to get taught from was going to change. The discontinuity that arose from this was unfair; our teacher after Professor Slavoff left for maternity leave was a TA who was in their first-year of teaching, and her lack of experience showed. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the course simply did not account for how students could effectively learn. For instance, mandatory attendance is a good idea to facilitate learning. What is not a good idea is sporadically placed pop quizzes that are a significant portion of ones grade. A better alternative would be having the quizzes, but only having them serve as extra credit opportunities because sure Professor Slavoff could say the purpose was for ensuring people are practicing the material outside of class, but lets get real and factor how much people are doing outside of the class. Expecting students to grasp tough concepts that are presented in organic chemistry to the point of expecting them to ace a quiz when the class only meets twice a week is unrealistic. Plus, the quizzes were inherently unfair, as only a select portion of the class had discussion section before the quizzes were given, and usually the discussion sections correlated to what the quizzes were on, so clearly, a lapse of sound judgment happened when these quizzes were instituted.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the review sessions for this course were woefully inadequate. We were generally given two practice exams, one meant for solo practice and one meant to be reviewed at the review session. However, Professor Slavoff and the TAs decided to give time for people to complete the review session practice exam at the review session, which served as a complete waste of time for those expecting to begin review of the exam once the review session started. An improvement would be if they posted a recording of themselves going over both practice exams because the keys were often wrong or did not have enough commentary for clarification. And instead, at the review session, we reviewed topics that would be tested.\r\n\r\nPlus, this course expected the students to show up to class prepared and ready to be tested whenever; yet, when we had a designated midterm 2, Professor Slavoff decided to print the midterm 2 that morning. The printers malfunctioned (supposedly), and our midterm 2 was resecheduled. Mind you, we had our exams during class time (9:00AM), so each student wasted their time studying and being anxious about the early wake-up time because Professor Slavoff could not do her job. The in-class exams were nonsensical.",
                "The strengths of this course include the fact that the exams were extremely fair if the material focused on in class was thoroughly studied and the TAs in this course this semester truly made my experience. They were all wonderful teachers and I felt that since the professor, prereceptor, and TAs were passionate about the subject, I was able to learn better through them.",
                "I appreciated the recorded lectures and the office hours provided to guide me. I think that the biggest strength of the course is the transparency the professors provided each step. They would release grade averages and explain where students would fall and provided practice exams for each exam the entire semester. Exams reflected the practice exams so that nothing was a surprise or out of the ordinary. The practice they provided for the content covered was of great benefit. \r\n\r\nI also appreciate Dr. Ruth Son for creating extra practice she provided during exam season and patiently reexplaining concepts during office hours and discussion section."

                "Yes. Probably the most pleasant an orgo experience can be. Workload is just right and exams are fair. But beware that the workload becomes very high over Thanksgiving break/before finals (we had 4 psets over Thanksgiving break and then 4 more the next week). GRADING: This semester, according to the prof, the median is approximately where the A minus / B cutoff lies",

                "Absolutely!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course as it prepares students for higher levels of chemistry and is a good introduction to the subject.",
                "the class is difficult. there is absolutely no getting around it and it's not worth lying about. you're definitely reading this if you have to take the course, so my recommendation is to try to your absolute best to keep up with the content. literally at the beginning of the course, sarah says to practice everyday. DO IT!!! but in all honestly, her grading system is absolutely freaking excellent (at least in my semester it was), so try your hardest but try not to stress",
                "I assume most people aren't looking to take organic chemistry unless they are chemistry majors or premeds, but honestly, this is a really good class. It's a great introduction to organic chemistry and made me much more interested in chemistry in general. I felt like I was learning the logic behind organic chemistry and that each reaction that we saw was a logic puzzle to unpack. That made the class a lot more fun and engaging. The grading is honestly really fair and the curve is generous to the point of excess, so I would say that if you're on the fence, just take the class.",
                "Yes, a good intro to organic chemistry.",
                "Definitely would recommend taking this class!",
                "Yes, this is a very interesting course and necessary for anyone studying science.",

                "Not necessarily, but for those who are required to take it, it's not a bad course. Grading and the overall curve was really fair, so I wouldn't worry too much about doing poorly. I got an overall good vibe of organic chemistry from this class.",
                "only if they're interested/it's required",
                "Yes. Slavoff is a great lecturer, and the preceptor, Dr. Son, was also great. Organic chemistry is required for pre-med students and some STEM majors, but i recommend it as a course for even non-STEM majors. A lot of the reactions and concepts are visual and has to do with the interplay of molecules rather than the explicit math.",
                "Yes, you're likely taking Orgo because you have to but Profs. Slavoff and Son were really great. This course was run very well and for the most part, organized very well",

                "yeah it's great",
                "Absolutely, I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take it. Obviously it may be dry if you arent very interested in chemistry, so I wouldnt take this if it is not necessary, but Prof. Slavoff and Prof. Son did their best to make a difficult subject very interesting and engaging. I learned so much in this course and I would absolutely take it again in a heartbeat",
                "Yes, Dr. Slavoff did an overall great job of facilitating CHEM 220, and this course is a a foundational course for many STEM majors.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it's a pre-requisite for their major. I think that organic chemistry is a difficult course in itself and this course was enjoyable in teaching those concepts.",
                "This class will definitely be intellectually challenging at times, but it definitely is fulfilling once one begins understanding the content.",
                "I would recommend this course as it expands one's understanding of chemistry and how it applies in the real world.",
                "Organic chemistry is really interesting, definitely not as scary as I thought it would be",
                "Yes, it is a good class as a prereq, but might not be that relevant to students only taking it for a science credit.",
                "The first half was actually really fun! (Surprising I know!) It's also needed for prereqs. If you placed out of Gen Chem, but are considering whether to do Gen or Orgo, Orgo (I think) is more enjoyable. The workload is high but the material is interesting.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Slavoff and Dr. Son were great during lectures and office hours. In addition, the support staff of the TAs and Peer Tutors was excellent.",
                "If youre taking the course with Professor Slavoff, ABSOLUTELY! She instructs very clearly, will test you fairly, and is a joy to have teaching.",

                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they were in a STEM-related field. The dedication and time needed for this course is a large amount that I would not recommend it for people that do not need to dedicate the time to. But for those in a related field, you are given a strong foundation of organic chemistry through this course and it will help build the structure you need in terms of learning, as well as your habits for tackling difficult courses.",
                "Yes, I think it is taught very well by the professors and is not made too hard despite being a daunting topic.",
                "Only as a prerequisite.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn about organic chemistry or needs the knowledge in related fields of study.",
                "Yes, you learn a lot, but it requires a lot of self study and it is difficult.",
                "Most people take this course because it is a requirement, so the best advice I can offer is to not be as scared. I think that the teaching team genuinely wants students to succeed, and if you take advantage of that fact, even with the challenges that will inevitably arise, doing well is very attainable.",
                "I was nervous about organic chemistry because I found general chemistry tough. In the end, I did better in this class than I did in gen chem. I took this class because it was a requirement, but I would recommend it if it was taught by Professor Slavoff.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed Sarahs teaching",
                "Absolutely. I find Organic Chemistry to be a wonderful foray into the world of chemical synthesis and provides the grammatical rules for the language of chemistry.",
                "YesI found organic chemistry to be fascinating! I would tell prospective students not to get scared off by organic chemistry's reputation; everyone in this classthe professors, peer tutors, and TAsall want you to succeed, and there are plenty of resources available to help you understand and work through this fascinating field!",
                "Absolutely!  Especially if you can take it with Professor Slavoff.",
                "Only if you have to. The first-year orgo class is much more structured and easier, which is a shame because students should not have to be punished based on what year of college they take organic chemistry.",
                "I would recommend this to students who wish to pursue chemistry in the future and even if you are premed and are required to take this course, I think it's important to appreciate the fascinating science behind every reaction because ultimately there is groundbreaking chemistry faculty at Yale.",
