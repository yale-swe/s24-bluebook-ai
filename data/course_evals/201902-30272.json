    "Reading + Analyzing, Note Taking and writing clear and concise statements.",
    "I read a lot of books regarding classical mythologies, most of which are interesting stories and poems. I got to know the stories themselves as well as things beyond the stories.",
    "Basic information about Ancient Greek and Roman mythologies (especially the books we read).",
    "I gathered new perspectives on Greco-Roman mythology and read many of the texts that I have studied before. I learned that the Greek pantheon acts like a family, and humans are not considered as important or ingenious they are in other pantheons. The class expanded my appreciation and knowledge of Greco-Roman culture, storytelling, morals, and deities."

    "Professor Freudenburg was definitely  one of the strengths of the course. It was so clear how interested he was in the subject every time he spoke and it was hard not to share his enthusiasm.",
    "I think it is very good.",
    "We are really engaged in the professors teaching and its wonderful.",
    "Strength: Size of class, the way that it was set up (homework, test, way class was run) \r\n\r\nWeakness: Course load was expected to be difficult but it was a bit hard to read as much as we had to read in 5 weeks.",
    "It was perfectly organized, clear, and helpful.",
    "It analyzes Greek mythology in the context of Greek culture for the majority of the course, and lightly touches on Roman. It ignores the fusions between Roman, Celtic, Gaelic, Etruscan, Thracian, and Egyptian cultures and mythologies, and is also heavily interested in analyzing Homer's and Virgil's writing style. Though these are all important to the culture of the Greeks and Romans, I would like to focus on the implications behind these stories as well as the stories themselves. This course also moved very quickly. so I did not have time in class or out of class to really engage with the stories and analyze them."

    "Of course. Mr. Freudenburg is an excellent teacher!",
    "Yes. This course would be highly helpful and informative to anyone interested in mythology.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who was interested in Greco-Roman culture and pantheon."
