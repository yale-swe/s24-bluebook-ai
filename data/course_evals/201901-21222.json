    "This is a great course to take if you want to explore a mechanical engineering topic more deeply. I learned a lot by working closely with my advisor, and I much preferred it to some of my intermediate engineering courses.",
    "Great course for independent project research.",
    "Yes if you have a personal project and want to work on it during the semester\/want to get research for credit and understand how to do research in mechanical engineering."
