Moreover, this course was a great introduction to research at Yale and to our library system.",
                "Through this course, I learned how to write argumentative essays and skim Supreme Court cases.",
                "How to read more analytically, and how to write with an original claim.",
                "I learned the qualities that make a good thesis statement for a college paper, and greatly improved in essay organization.",
                "Compared to English classes in high school, I learned that I can disagree with the stances in an assigned reading if I believe that the author's reasoning is incorrect. I also learned to write more fluidly as opposed to using a five-paragraph template like in high school.",
                "Foundations of writing a solid essay",
                "I primarily learned how to structure an academic essay, from start to finish. Starting at the top with a corrective and contestable thesis and wrapping up with a conclusion paragraph, this class helped me refine what I learned in high school concerning how to write an essay. I also learned more about the realities of censorship, a topic that is becoming more and more relevant nowadays with the advent of social media. Discussing the political and social realities of suppressing speech, this class felt like a political science class and English class combined, which I personally loved."

                "The strengths of this course was definitely the discussion portion of the class. However, at times, I felt the professor did not let students talk and sometimes only stated his opinions without giving us a chance to insert our own thoughts into the discussion.",
                "Strengths: the instructor was great and very understanding of student's circumstances. Weaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: Good introduction to college writing and critical analysis of texts, professor was understanding of students and very flexible with deadlines on papers, diverse readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much of an opportunity for discussion in class",
                "Strengths: I really liked that there was a mix between seminar discussion of the topic (censorship around the world) as well as how to improve our own writing. We did class workshops and had a variety of different readings (from court cases to New York Times op-eds) which ensured that the course never got boring.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There isn't anything too major! I would have perhaps enjoyed a little bit more lecture time dedicated to breaking down tips on how to write an essay, but I don't think this is too big of a deal."

                "Yes, if they need a writing credit I would say this one is not too overbearing. However, for more creative writing Id definitely look more in ENGL 115 courses.",
                "Yes, great introductory course for learning how to read and write analytically.",
                "I definitely would recommend Censorship and the Arts with Timothy Robinson. Professor Robinson is so incredibly kind and understanding. I enjoyed my experience in this class, and the essays we wrote were interesting.",
                "Yes! I found the material really interesting and thought it was a good writing course to take.",
                "I would definitely recommend taking an ENGL 114 course. For this one in particular, I really liked hearing the professor's thoughts on the subject and doing the interesting readings, but there wasn't much of a chance for class discussion compared to what I've heard about other ENGL 114 sections. Nevertheless, the professor was really understanding about deadlines and was always willing to give extensions or meet one-on-one to discuss any troubles. This was a good class to take to balance a heavier course load and have an introduction to college writing.",
                "Yes i would totally recommend! If you are not majoring in english and want a writing credit",
                "I definitely would recommend this course to another student! I feel like I got a lot of practice in writing (after all, four essays all over 1500 words is a good bit of writing to explore through) and it is a relatively stress-free way to get a writing credit. If you are interested in politics or censorship at all and are willing to put in a little bit of work when drafting and revising your essays, I would say this course is for you. Additionally, Professor Robinson is really interesting and has a lot of insights surrounding writing and beyond, so each class flies by!"
