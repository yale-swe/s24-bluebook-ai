    "Great professor but difficult to listen to 3 hour long lectures.",
    "The course's strengths are its focus on historical bias and the analysis of ancient materials, its weaknesses are mainly the length of each lecture and the volume of readings. It would be better if there are three lectures a week that are shorter and with fewer readings between each.",
    "The strengths are that the course covers a very interesting period of human history that more people should be aware of",

    "Yes it was a great intro into ancient near east studies."
