    "Basic microeconomics - the sunk cost and utility and rational consumer theory. Things like that. Also that I need to get more sleep and listen in class.",
    "This course teaches you the basics of microeconomics using ideal models. The math involved is minimal, but having a multivariable calculus background helped deepen my understanding of the material.",
    "I gained rudimentary microeconomics skills.",
    "I think I learned a lot through this class. It was my first econ class so I was introduced to a new way of thinking. It is a very utilitarian mindset, but interesting nonetheless and it yields valuable insights."

   "comments": [
    "There is a lot of material to go through and the instructions really rush through it. Maybe either cut the material down or organize more review sessions.",
    "I don't think I was really interested in the course material, but it was taught well. I think the grade weighting of each assignment was helpful to learning the material. Since the problem sets were weighted so lightly in the overall grade, it felt like they were a low-stress way to work out the course material.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, math-based explanations, personalized teaching",
    "The strengths of this course include the professor's lecturing and the problem sets, which were very well written to facilitate student learning. All lectures were as interesting as they could be given the subject material, and the professor was always willing to help students. The major weaknesses, however, include the fact that the exams are weighted very heavily. The problem sets counted for little compared to the midterm and final, which together made up a very large majority of the grade, and this made them seem inconsequential in comparison.",
    "I really liked the smaller classroom format, however, I would like to see the 15 person max per section as I was told enforced more strictly.",
    "The seminar version of this course with Professor Katerina Simons does not sufficiently prepare for problem sets and exams. The material deviates significantly from that presented in problem sets and exams. In class, we are given a very abstract overview of the course material. I walked away from each class understanding how the economic concepts fit into the real world, but not how to apply them in a problem. When it came time to actually answer a question, I found that I could define every term, but I did not know the steps necessary to solve the problem. \r\n\r\nThis is a substantial problem if you do not have previous economic experience. 70% of you grade in the class is determined by two exams alone. If you struggle on the first exam, an A and possibly a B will be out of the question. Unless you took AP Econ or something similar, avoid this class.",
    "Weakness: midterm was far too difficult",
    "Strengths: Small setting, opportunity to ask questions, and time allotted to meet with Professor as well as the grader. \r\nweakness: a lot of material, at some points we needed to rush and skip slides to finish it all.",
    "The strengths of this course are: Katerina makes this class super fun and interactive, including lots of games and buzz groups that I really enjoyed and got a lot from. The weakness is mainly the fact that grades are determined in large part by the midterm and finals (each 40%) which means that if one of those goes badly, it is hard to do as well as you might want in class. It would be nice if grades were distributed a little more broadly across a range of assignments. But that just might be a typical predicament in lots of yale courses.",
    "It moves quickly which is neither; it just means that it could be bad for people who can't keep up, but covers a lot of ground which is a strength for those that can. There could be more student accountability to make sure that they're keeping up with their work. The polls in class are all anonymous, and the problem sets are easily explained without imparting any conceptual understanding. More homework checks might benefit micro students.",
    "I found the material to be uninteresting, mainly because it is hard to connect the basic, very ideal models that we learn about in class to what happens in the real world. I took it as a social science credit and found it to be more of a boring pre-req you have to get through in order to be an econ major. I wish the lectures had been more stimulating, but honestly the curriculum is just not that interesting in itself.",
    "I felt like all of the material was covered with clarity but not with depth, meaning that I had a hard time retaining it.",
    "Strength: the seminar style provided the opportunity for question-asking, which I took advantage of and found very helpful. \r\nWeakness: toward the end of the course it felt like a lot was being packed into each class without actually going over the material in depth like we had been doing previously. Maybe space out better the material."

   "comments": [
    "No. Bad course",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to economics. The smaller size allowed us to ask questions and to do more in-class discussions, which really helped my understanding in many topics.",
    "Yes, if you need a QR or need to take it as a prerequisite.",
    "Yes, this is a great course that introduces the concepts of microeconomics in both an intuitive way and a mathematical way. I had a lot of fun learning the material and engaging in discussions with the class.",
    "Yes, if more as a necessity than something extremely exciting.",
    "I would recommend this course if the goal of taking it is to learn economics thoroughly and well. For students not interested in economics, this course might be a bit excessive and too in-depth. But if the student actually cares about the subject, or cares about class size, then this is definitely the course to take. Everyone in this course learns introductory microeconomics at a much deeper level than the students in the lecture version of this course.",
    "Yes!  I really liked the professor.  I thought she ran the class very well.  The structure was also great for me as well",
    "No, I would certainly not. In short: the material taught in class and problem sets do not adequately prepare for exams. If you do not have prior economics experience or are not a strong test taker, the class will be very challenging and it will be difficult to succeed. \r\n\r\nWith more context: I took Intro Micro because I believe that basic economic knowledge is an important asset for any young professional. I have no prior economics experience before this course. I applied for the seminar because I sought a more intimate learning setting, which I find to vastly improve my performance. I am also engaged in a multitude of extra-curricular activities, and often have early morning and late night trainings, which means that I rely on the information provided in class and do not have the ability go to office hour on a regular basis. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  I do not believe the appropriate tools were offered to me to succeed. The textbook was verbose and unhelpful, and the problems in the back of each chapter did not resemble exam problems. The class material -- while interesting -- again did not resemble what was tested. Even if you memorized every equation and the content of every lecture, you could still fail the exam. \r\n\r\nThat is my definition of setting students up to fail. If you do not wish to be set up to fail, do not take the Intro Micro seminar.",
    "This class was better than lecture in my opinion, and is really designed for people who want to learn.",
    "Yes. Great foundation in economics.",
    "Yeah, especially if you think you might be interested in economics! I thought it was a really interesting course.",
    "If they are sufficiently interested in the content, it could be a good course. But it's hard if you don't have the time to invest.",
    "Don't take this course unless you are interested in majoring in economics--the material is simply not that interesting and it shows in the lack of engagement I found in my seminar. I thought it would be somewhat interesting and new material, but it wasn't. The amount of work I put in was just not proportional to the level of intellectual satisfaction I got. Basically, don't take this if you are looking to just fulfill a distributional requirement or take an elective.",
    "Yes, but only if they are very committed to learning microeconomics. I found it not particularly applicable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I think it's important to be exposed to this type of way of thinking and viewing the world. You may not like it but it is at least valuable (I think) to identify that you don't like it. Personally, I found the material engaging and Professor Simons was a solid teacher."
