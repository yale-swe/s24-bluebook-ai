One of the most useful skills I developed during this course was the ability to read entire plays more quickly.",

I really enjoyed looking at theatre and performance from a scholarly perspective, as well as hearing from all our guest speakers, especially the practicing theatre artists.",

Plays are analyzed from a literary lens but from a cultural one as well and they are compared to what is considered theater in America today. In addition to written plays students analyze other aspects of performance such as religious rituals, organized protest, outfits and other attire and dance. This course intentionally decentralizes European theater as the foundation of all performance and looks at how other theater traditions have contributed to theater today."

                "I love how broad the scope is of this course our curriculum was truly diverse and covered many different theatrical histories without ever seeming surface-level or losing its focus.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed this course all-around. I loved that our discussions were allowed to go anywhere according to what aspects of the readings the class was interested in talking about, and I liked that there was some history and theory mixed in with the plays we read. Shilarna was an amazing professor to haveshe was always kind, funny, and understanding. Weaknesses: Honestly, the only weakness of this course was that our homework was sometimes posted late. I would have liked it to be posted at least a day before it was due, since it was usually a big reading assignment.",
                "Strengths: texts are gathered from a wide array of time periods and cultures, plays and videos are very interesting! (I can't think of a play that I didn't enjoy some aspect of)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some guest lectures were a little difficult to engage with, especially when they didn't focus their lecture on theater (some were on the cultures surrounding the theater rather than the theater itself), reading virtual copies of plays can be difficult but purchasing each text will be expensive",
                "I think the curriculum for this course is extremely well organized. I especially enjoyed weeks where we looked at modern adaptations within the tradition, such as Everyman and Everybody. I also appreciated the mix of materials (documentaries, performances, etc.).",
                "I really enjoyed this class because every student was very engaged and clearly wanted to be there. The class was also well organized to have a good mix of lectures and discussion based classes that were full of new information but also allowed each student to share their opinions. I also loved the guests brought in, it was so interesting to hear their stories and it made the class even more relevant and compelling.",
                "I really loved how each traditional text that we read was assigned with a contemporary text. This made the significance and evolution of the given performance form very clear. What made this class special was that it effectively dismantled the preconceived notions of what theater is and what makes \"good\" theater. This allowed me to taken in and truly appreciate each topic we analyzed. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "This class was my favorite this semester and I always looked forward to meeting!",
                "One thing I thought was very strong was the wide range of early traditions we covered. It allowed for great discussion into what different types of performances have in common and also provided a great basis of references for future forays into theater making. Similarly, I thought that the weekly pairing of early readings with a later work in the tradition and the mix of history, theory, and actual plays was both fascinating and really enriching. I love how the ideas in this class are so very, yet they all play together across the weeks so intriguingly. I also really enjoyed Prof. Stokes and that she was the instructor for the discussion sections. I can't really think of any weaknesses given the circumstances of this online semester.",
                "Reading two full length plays a week on top of contextual readings is a lot to manage. I do believe that this course does a great job of tying past tradition to present occurrences and practices."

                "The community that we created within this course was actually very good given the circumstances of COVID-19. Keeping a light energy during lecture definitely helped with the mood and with keeping people engaged over Zoom. I think that the parts of the class which were harder to adapt (performances, live readings, etc) were done as best as they could and I'm not too upset over what we missed by not being in person. The reading of \"Everybody\" was one of my favorite activities. Also, our virtual guests over Zoom were amazing and always brought great energy!",
                "I think this course translated really well to a virtual format. All of our discussions still felt very engaging, and I felt like I was still able to connect with both the professor and my classmates.",
                "The breakout rooms and discussion sections worked very well but the midterm project required collaboration on a piece, which was difficult to do because of the pandemic. It made everyone to think very outside of the box which was very stressful in the moment but the professor is very accommodating so it all worked out",
                "I thought that the discussion forums were extremely useful for deepening my thinking, and I learned a lot from reading my classmates' responses as well! In general I thought that classes ran smoothly and our discussions were productive over Zoom, although occasionally WiFi got in the way. I also think that the projects people produced for the final and midterm were super exciting an interesting to watch and incorporated remote students super well, so I really appreciated that we were still able to incorporate a performance aspect to our coursework in a completely remote format.",
                "I really liked that the class consisted of both lecture classes and smaller discussion sections that were all live virtually. This made each person attend the class and created a stronger connection between my classmates and I than we would've had if any lectures had just been recorded. The discussion sections also gave more students the opportunity to share their thoughts.",
                "The work outside of class was extremely time consuming, especially since we had lots of videos in addition to weekly readings. Unsure how much of this material would normally be viewed during in-person class, but managing the time commitments of this class was hard online, particularly because all of our work pretty much culminated in staring at a screen (which is incongruent with the modes theatre artists typically prefer). Additionally, because theatre discussion occasionally included a video of a performance, we had to opt for screen sharing every so often which was sometimes hard to operate.",
                "I think that this class worked great virtually. Although, disappointing there were not many performance projects due to being virtual I think Professor Stokes definitely adapted to and acknowledged the difficulties of  living in a pandemic."

I really enjoyed this course and it was a highlight of my week, but I also am deeply invested in the content as someone who loves theater.",

I honestly wasn't expecting to enjoy a survey of theater before 1700 as much as I did, but it exposed me to a huge range of performance traditions and really widened my understanding of the world of drama and theater, all while being very engaging and interesting. Also, Shilarna is a wonderful professor!",

That's 100% because this course was fantastic, and it would be hard for me to recommend it more highly. It made me rethink all the things I thought I knew about theater, in the best way. I especially recommend it Professor Stokes. She's a delight, she's insightful, and she's really interested in the students. The readings are interesting, but not overwhelming. This a fantastic class.",
                "Yes. I throughly enjoyed this course and it changed the way that I think about theater and storytelling as a whole. There are many structures taken for granted in theater and this course provoked me to question them and where they come from."
