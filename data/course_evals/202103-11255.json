I would say this course could be improved perhaps by maybe engaging with some current-day issues/topics in italy rather than older issues/literature.",
                "Great class to improve Italian but quite slow at times. We were reading quite advanced material at times so I felt quite lost for most of the course - but paying attention in class was helpful to understand the material.",
                "The main strengths of this course were the diverse and engaging curriculum, the clear assignments and feedback, and the amiable class atmosphere. I thought the theme of travel was very applicable to a wide variety of literature, and Simona did a great job of incorporating really diverse works. There was a great mix of literature and film, fiction and nonfiction, discussions and presentations, reading and writing, etc. In summary, this course has a little bit of everything in terms of humanities classes, which was really great as a STEM major. Moreover, the assignments (usually composed of weekly readings/movies and discussion posts) were interesting and clear, with a lot of room for personal reflection and interpretation. The occasional quizzes were generally fair and not too stressful, and the final project was a fun way to investigate a piece of Italian travel culture that you found interesting. Furthermore, they were all graded quickly and fairly, with good feedback to incorporate in the future. Meanwhile, class was very relaxed and fun, and the small size allowed me to get to know everyone as friends, not just classmates. On the other hand, the main weaknesses of the course were sometimes overly difficult readings and an occasionally spiky workload. Some of the readings were either very old, technical, or slang-driven, which made them difficult to understand without the English translations; these translations definitely helped, as they made it possible to do the weekly responses and participate in discussions, but it was not as fun to just read the English. I think these texts could be substituted for ones that are a bit easier, or maybe read in class together instead of at home. In terms of the homework, additional assignments (e.g. presentations, quizzes, etc.) sometimes compounded with difficult readings to make some weeks very intense, something that could be improved by lessening the regular workload (e.g. removing the weekly response or giving a simpler text) when there are these extraordinary tasks."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who feels proficient in Italian (either by taking L4 at Yale or via other means) and wants an introductory course in literature. It was a very logical step from L4, with much more focus on reading and writing as opposed to grammar but a still approachable set of works and group of classmates. The theme of travel was very interesting and allowed for lots of exploration, particularly via the open-ended presentations and final project. Its also a great choice if you want to learn more about Italian culture, as all the works are very informative and representative of their customs and traditions. Moreover, even if you have already taken other L5 courses, it would probably be a good course for further practicing verbal skills, though you may find that the other students have less experience."
