                "I really loved this class and the readings! I think one way it could be improved might be to look at a few more third world applications, or even just colonial world applications.",
                "This was a really amazing class. The readings could be enhanced by expanding the global and cultural breadth of the selections. The discussion was wonderful, but it could also be improved with less lecturing and more time for student contribution.",
                "I really appreciated the TF, who would participate in discussion like one of the students. I think the professor did a wonderful job selecting a variety of readings from different perspectives, as well as always supplying us with each text's background information and historical context. I think everyone was comfortable participating in discussion and we represented a healthy range of experiences. I would have appreciated more guidance and detailed feedback on my short paper, so I knew what to aim for in the final project. I think the TF or the instructor could have met with each of the students individually sometime in the middle of the term for a checkup.",

It was very interesting to discuss Rosa Luxembourg and Black Lives Matter in the same course, with equal focus on theoretical illustrations of successful resistance movements, and to critique or apply them in the context of social movements.",
                "yes! they syllabus is great and resistance is a very interesting lens to use to view history",

                "As long as you genuinely commit to doing all the reading (and mayhaps already have some thoughts about resistance), yes! The assigned readings, as a wide-ranging introduction to a number of theories and traditions of resistance, were generally well-selected and always engaging, and the structure of the course gave us a number of opportunities to explore our own interests. Above all, Professor Renaud was fantastic. I only wish I'd taken a class with him sooner! He's great at facilitating discussion and really cares for his students. And if you get to take this course, don't pass up the opportunity to go to office hours and engage in some (at risk of sounding incredibly pretentious) intellectually stimulating conversation."
