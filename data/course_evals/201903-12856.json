   "comments": [
    "I learned about the origins of the Constitution, judicial interpretation, civil liberties and civil rights, the American Creed (liberty vs. equality). I improved my analytical writing and learned to manage a heavy reading load.",
    "I learned to think critically about political issues and construct robust arguments in persuasive writing.",
    "Whether you have no idea what is going on in American politics nowadays or know you want to go to law school, Constitutionalism is the perfect class for learning how to understand American politics and judicial philosophies, from reading major works of philosophy to the most famous court cases that have affected the course of American history. I learned how to read faster, how to think critically, and how to participate in seminars constructively. The course load was so interesting that I enjoyed every reading we did, and the discussions always helped me make sense of what I didn't understand and more.",
    "I acquired important knowledge relative to the Constitution and how to interpret the constitution. It was also my first time reading a lot of the texts and my first. t time reading Supreme Court cases through an academic perspective, which I found super interesting.",
    "How to read supreme court cases and analyze their implications.",
    "A much deeper understanding of the American Constitutional system",
    "A great course that developed my writing and active reading skills. Discussion based and very engaging.",
    "I learned to read analytically and write persuasive essays. I also learned how to read case courses critically.",
    "I learned how to interpret the Constitution and other documents of law and how they can affect legal policy. I also gained writing skills, particularly in building arguments off other theories. I also gained skills in reading and analyzing constitutional readings. This class offered me a lot of insight into the assumptions we make about and reasoning behind government today and got me to actively think about our system."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: small class size, interesting (although heavy) readings, engaging discussions; weaknesses: heavy reading load, since there are only three papers and sometimes you won't get feedback on your most recent paper before you have to start the next one, it's hard to know what you need to improve on",
    "I wish we could've delved deeper into the Supreme Court cases -- sometimes we didn't really have time to process what we read.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed all of the content of this class. I can't point to a single reading that I did not find useful, relevant, and engaging, and every discussion and announcement alerted me to just how important all of the issues we were discussing were to the real world. At first, I thought skeptically, \"how could the -ism of Constitutionalism really be that important?\" but at the end of the class, it all connected. The course was designed beautifully in my opinion, and I was able to learn so much more because of how Professor Silverstein taught the course. If I had any feedback, I would just note that sometimes the paper topics were a little ambiguous, and I wasn't sure how to approach them without begging the question at times or even dancing around it.",
    "A strength is that Professor Silverstein is really good at starting discussion and keeping it going, so that he is not talking for most of the class. This is engaging and led to very good discussion and insight.",
    "The strength is the reading and Professor Gordon. No weaknesses.",
    "Very good for personal engagement in course materials. Workload however is constant and hard to catch up on if you fall behind.",
    "The teacher was very engaging and took the class seriously. The conversations were always very interesting. I liked how the teacher challenged our views and pushed us to question our own beliefs. I learned a lot.",
    "The strengths of this course were definitely in the discussion and in the knowledge of the professor. The discussions were intriguing and allowed the students to argue all sides of an argument to truly understand the concept. The professor was deeply insightful and led class in a way that allowed us to discover things rather than simply telling us. I liked that the class was heavily shaped by the students in it. The weaknesses of the course were probably the lack of immediate feedback after papers and the slight disorganization to the class timeline. I would have preferred knowing how I was doing in the class much more clearly. In the end, we never got feedback on our second papers, and it made it more difficult to work on the third."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The seminar-style setup allows for high levels of participation and really engaging discussions. Although there are about 100 pages of reading a week, the readings are very interesting. Prof. Silverstein is very accessible if you need help--I only went to his office hours towards the end of the semester and I really wish I had gone sooner!",
    "Yes, if you like to think critically about U.S. politics and learn more about the country on a constitutional level, I'd totally recommend it.",
    "YES YES YES. If you can get in, DO NOT DROP THIS CLASS. I came into this class slightly lukewarm on whether or not to take it, given its Coursetable difficulty rating, and I am so glad that everyone around me told me to take a first-year seminar. This course has been the highlight of my first term at Yale, and I could not recommend it more highly to any student, regardless of what you're interested in or how much exposure you've had to the themes of this course. Before I took Constitutionalism, the very idea of reading a Supreme Court case was daunting and intimidated me, but this course not only introduced me to the history and inner workings of the judiciary but also how to read closely and critically.\r\n\r\nEverything we read was engaging and stimulating, and every discussion we had was always lively and drew in participation from every corner of the room. This class looks really hard to a first-year student, just due to the sheer amount of reading, but in reality it's not too much. You get out of this course what you put in, and the more work you put in, the more you'll love this class. The readings at first are difficult, but my reading speed increased so much after taking this class, and I'm so thankful that Constitutionalism provided me with a foundation for all of my future reading classes.\r\n\r\nLastly, for those of you who can't get in through the lottery and find yourself on the waiting list, WAIT FOR THIS CLASS. SHOP UNTIL YOU DROP. You won't regret it. Every class discussion forced me to think long and hard about why I believed what I believed and changed my prior convictions so many times. This class presents both sides fairly but vigorously, and there's no BS'ing the readings here. \r\n\r\nI have learned more from this one class than I did all of high school, and if you can get into this class, take advantage of this great opportunity. The teaching is wonderful, and simply getting to have normal discussions about politics or even the weather with Professor Silverstein was definitely one of the greatest highlights of this class.",
    "I think I would recommend it because it was very interesting, but feedback on papers was super slow which did not help with writing the next paper and with the process of improving throughout the semester. Nonetheless, the class texts are super important and interesting and I liked the class overall.",
    "I definitely would",
    "This First Year seminar was my favorite course during my first semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in political science or the constitution",
    "Yes. The course material is relevant and engaging. Perfect seminar for first years looking to dip their toe into political science.",
    "Yes! A great class where I learned a lot and always looked forward to it.",
    "I would recommend this course because it teaches a lot of fundamental things about the Constitution and American law that anyone would benefit from learning. Students should be prepared to put in a lot of effort and that will lead to a highly rewarding class."
