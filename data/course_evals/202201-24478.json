                "I learned about the history of Jesuits in China pre-1800, how Chinese and European leaders and thinkers conceptualized music and science, and different musical forms in China and France.",
                "I learned how to evaluate philosophical readings and consider multiple perspectives.",
                "learned about music history in China and France, practiced getting a deep understanding of one instance of global historical contact",
                "Coming from a non-musical background, I learned to talk about music history with greater confidence. \r\nI also learned a great deal about the study and practice of global history.\r\nThe Jesuit-Chinese exchanges are one of the great episodes of world history that deserves more attention.",
                "This course taught me how to think about history critically and expansively, focusing on the multitude of lived experiences in each moment. I learned a ton about the role of music as both a facilitator and product of politics, identity and culture in China and France.  Highlights of the course for me was the discussion format where I developed my confidence in sharing my thoughts, as well as the final research project where I practiced the global history framework of expanded analysis.",
                "I learned about the cultural exchange between the east and the west during the time of the enlightenment. As someone who grew up in China, it was really cool to see that missionaries played such a big role in shaping the intellectual discourse in late Ming and early Qing China. Yeah",
                "Expanded my knowledge of music in China (along with my knowledge of Chinese culture and history in general) and deepened my understanding of the early intercultural exchanges between China and Europe.",
                "I learned how to analyze primary documents.",
                "I gained an understanding of the lens of global music history, learned a lot specifically about the mutual influence of French and Chinese music and culture in the 17th century and realized that the history of music in general can be better understood through a network-like perspective rather than thinking that musical cultures are separate from each other and developed in siloes."

                "The premise of the course is really cool and allowed for both people with more of a music background and people with more of a history background to engage with the material, while educating both types of people on aspects they weren't as familiar with. I think that maybe the syllabus could be tinkered with a little more to find more thought-provoking readings, but this isn't surprising since it's the first time the course was taught.",
                "I think it would be great if there were more diverse readings! I loved the listening examples and how weeks were integrated with eachother.",
                "The class format can be a little repetitive. Some weeks, the discussion was less lively. Maybe listening or video examples or some kind of group activity would help break this up.",
                "Brilliant instructor. \r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "A big strength for this course was the format with weekly readings, discussion posts, and in-class discussions. This created a very engaging environment and it was exciting to have each person in the class lead discussion at least once.",
                "Professor Jiang comes so prepared every class and I enjoyed the format of starting each session with a brief lecture then jump into discussion afterwards. I enjoyed almost most all of the readings though sometimes there is not much to talk about. This is not necessarily due to the selection of readings but rather their nature as a lot of them provide a descriptive historic account of an instrument\/an event without being argumentative.",
                "Really enjoyed the balance between professor-led and student-led discussions in this class. Overall, thought it was structured quite well.",
                "Student involvment was very interesting.",
                "I think the workload for this class was perfect, providing an opportunity to reflect on the readings each week that gave us complete freedom to focus on whatever we were most interested in. This made for very productive discussions, too, since we all came in with insights prepared (since we had to post our responses the night before)."

                "I would recommend this course, but I am assuming it won't be taught again. I think more classes that teach Western music history with a critically challenging context (such as the perspective of another culture, in this case, that of China) should be thought though!",
                "Relatively laid-back in the way of assignments, but all readings are meaningful and discussed. The best kind of class where your primary objective is to learn and not to BS the readings or spend lots of time practicing scholarly ability (as someone NOT aspiring to be an academic - this is rather refreshing, as history courses are usually designed for prospective historians in mind).",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The reading material was very engaging and I loved our class discussions connecting the reading material to broader questions surrounding history and music. Professor Jiang gave very clear feedback and the final research project was an exciting change to practice the global history framework of analysis we had been learning all year.",
                "Absolutely! This class was so interesting and was a great fifth class to take. would highly recommend to majors and non majors alike.",
                "Yes - many of the base assumptions of music in China are so fundamentally different from music in the West. It's really worth studying and getting an idea of if you have a passion for music. The historical information is good for anyone of any background and interest to know.",
                "Yes.  Interesting classmates, content, and Professor.",
                "This course is in fact a music course, but it's also very much a history course and should appeal to any music major or humanities student, really! Global history is very cool, and as long as you have some background in music and\/or history, you'll really appreciate the class."
