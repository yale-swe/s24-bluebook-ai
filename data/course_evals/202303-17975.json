Conversations in class had no structure which led to a lot of empty, fluff thoughts and comments coming about. It was never grounded towards a particular point or relationship to anything. Our class time felt like a book club. By no means do I want to be told exactly what to think, however, there was ZERO structure or support in articulating ideas within the \"book club circle.\"",

                "Totally. Learned so much about forming/articulating arguments. Its definitely a case of you get out what you put in. Discussions are only good if youre reading and rereading the texts, but if you do that then theyre excellent. It requires a high level of buy in. And grading is not light by any means."
