The course is somewhat split into two parts: the first half is Prof Vu giving lectures, and the second half is student presentations, where everyone must give a full lecture on a paper they were assigned to read. In the first half of the course I got to see some general probabilistic ideas and principles used by reserachers (first a general introduction to the probabilistic method (first and second moment method), then we applied this to random graphs, we discussed central limit theorem type results on convergence of distributions, low dependency type results such as Lovask Local Lemma, and concentration bounds with eg martingales). This was all very interesting, but the main skills I think I will carry forward are the ones I gained during the second half. I got direct exposure to many complex groundbreaking papers, and was challenged to deliver a lecture like a professor would. As someone that wants to go into academic research, this was really formative. I now feel more confident reading papers I find online, which makes it easier for me to understand what people are thinking about.",

                "The course contains slightly fewer than average number of problem sets for a math course (7 or 8, rather than 10-12), and the material is quite interesting. The opportunity to present at the blackboard proofs from a short math paper at the end of the course was new and interesting. However, the material is so advanced, even some of the most experienced students in the class my semester struggled with ultimately no success on many of the problems. Office hours were worse than useless. Lectures were clear but often unpleasant due to the professor's dismissive and somewhat rude demeanor. If Professor Vu tried to be more kind and understanding, and consider the impact of his unnecessary statements about how easy everything is (spoiler: it's not!), and the workload was reduced and spaced out over more of the semester (rather than bunched to the beginning), the course would be much better. Oh, and if we had received literally any feedback on the problem sets. Zero, zilch, zip, no grades, nothing. Then suddenly, a final grade was posted. That was weird.",
                "This is a hard course. Many people taking it (seniors majoring in math) acknowledged that this is the first time they are struggling so much on the problem sets and are literally unable to solve some of the problems. I remember using Hall's marriage theorem on one of my solutions to a pset problem, despite not having covered that theorem in class. I could not find a better way to solve it using probabilistic methods only. \r\n\r\nOf course, if you are looking for a challende, this is not bad (also keep in mind psets are only like 10% of the grade, so it doesn't really matter how you do). However, when I was taking the course, I didn't recieve useful feedback from the grader at all, and in fact still haven't recieved some of the grades for my psets, despite the course grade already being on my transctipt. It would have been nice to have office hours, a regular meeting with the grader/TAs, to discuss the problems, as they were all very thought provoquing and complex, and many of them had interesting generalisations to think about. In a course where being creative is so important, I felt like there was not enough value placed on problem solving on our hand.",
                "This course is a good idea and the professor Van Vu is obviously brilliant and further he is nice and good at explaining things. For what it's worth, I followed all the content well and found it interesting. But it is structured horribly and without sufficient teaching effort. A bunch of ideas stemming from the probabilistic method are shared with students, and we learn how to use them in limited ways. But there's minimal effort to give any context for WHY the probabilistic method works or compare it with other ways of thinking, or to tie together any of the 20 separate approaches we used. If there is nothing to tie the content together aside from being probabilistic and relevant to counting, I think it is probably more appropriate as a research seminar than a disjointed lecture. As a concrete example, the course started assuming we knew nothing about probability theory (most of us probably did but that's not my point), and then quite rapidly later introduced Doob's martingale to prove a form of the bounded difference inequality, and then all of a sudden Taligrand's inequality was thrust forward. But there was no effort to tie these into the broader theory of concentration inequalities; these were tiny pieces of a puzzle that we would never be able to apply independently because we were never given even a glimpse of the bigger picture in class. Sure, the class isn't about concentration inequalities, but I'm pretty sure the concept of concentration was never even mentioned. And also totally unconnected, and in one class the day before midterms, we out of the blue introduced eigenvalues and a proof of Wigner's semicircle law (using almost no probabilistic techniques we'd discussed until that class, but rather new ones never used again), and then never mention it again. How are we supposed to use all the piecemeal techniques from this class at all without beginning to see how they fit together with other concepts from graph or probability theory?\r\n\r\nI suppose this tying-together could've been done with homework or with our final projects (or exams but these were short and straightforward applied work), but the hw were either trivial or from the textbook and similar to class and the projects jumped around too much to give any sense of a comprehensive understanding. Or even a sense of understanding what remains to be understood. Although this class is proof-based, I feel quite similar leaving this class as I did leaving a differential equation class where we just memorized a bunch of techniques to solve differential equations with somewhat self-evident proofs, and as expected I forgot much of it soon afterwards with no greater understanding of the field. I don't really know what I was supposed to take with me from this class. The one exception to this, which was very well-taught, was the discussion of thresholds in random graph theory.\r\n\r\nSo altogether, this class is a great idea, and the lecturer is very bright and good at explaining things. However, I fear I did not learn very much that I can remember or know how to apply from this course even if I were to actually go into combinatorics (let alone a related field of math). Maybe a little more focus on some of the content, or more tailored homework assignments or project papers, could start to make up for this generalization gap. \r\n\r\nA final weakness is that the professor could be insensitive. For example, at the end of a student's final project, the student was told publicly by the professor that he'd understood \"nothing you've talked about in the last 35 minutes\" which must have felt extremely embarrassing  to be announced in front of the whole class. However, I believe if you study hard for this class then with any luck you'll do okay; Van Vu is nice and a fair grader, just a bit capricious.  The main problem is the disjointed feeling of the course, and if this could be worked on then the course would improve substantially. Until then though, there are better uses of your time",
                "This course has very good lectures and interesting content. However, there is very little feedback and interaction outside of the class time, and the problem sets are brutally difficult and often frustrating.",

The material is interesting, and Van Vu's lectures are clear, but his demeanor often makes the experience of being in the class unpleasant and awkward. I spent a fair deal of time in class distracted by feeling bad for the students he happened to be berating, or for the handful of students who inevitably would take to heart and get discouraged by Vu's comments about how \"this is so ridiculously easy that we must all have known how to do it since kindergarten.\" That kind of commentary, especially with a straight face and repeated often, has no place in a place of education, especially when dealing with an advanced and complicated topic like modern combinatorics.",
                "If you enjoyed olympiad combinatorics, take this course (instead of discrete)! If you want to do research in combinatorics, this is the course to take! Math 345 has really helped me transition from seeing combinatorics as something entertaining you see in high school competitions, as a serious research field. It is important to understand that the course is naturally spilt into two parts: the first half is Prof. Vu giving lectures, and the second half is students giving thorough presentations (or should I say lectures as well?) on papers they got to read. Hence, you get very direct contact with contemporary and groundbreaking research done using techniques learnt in class. I am very happy I took this class, it has been truly formative and insightful.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Van Vu expects students to be quite autonomous in their learning, and will tell you if he thinks you are not prepared for the course. You will be expected to follow the book on your own account, and I encourage you to read the papers other people are presenting on as well. Lots of complex topics are covered, and there are no real office hours to revise this. Psets are also really, really hard (senior math majors were saying they had never been so clueless in any class before, I remember using strong theorem we didn't cover in class in some of my solutions), but they are only worth 10% so you shouldn't really care.",
                "Before you decide to take this course, you need to know that the problem sets will be very difficult and you will not get much help outside of class. If you really like combinatorics, the class is genuinely very interesting and the lectures are engaging, but it is a punishing and frustrating class at times. About half the class dropped by the end when I took it, and if you want to succeed, you probably want to have a study group prepared.",
