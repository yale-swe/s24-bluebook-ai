He should give more useful assignments, such as the 2 home page redesign assignments given towards the end of the year. I also would have liked to get feedback on the 4th assignment so I knew how to improve for 5th (final) assignment, but there was nothing to go off of, so final grades are pretty up in the air as a result. It may be an easy, low workload class but be aware of the fact that you may not know how you are doing in the class until you get your final grade.",

                "If you actually want to learn about the title of the course, definitely not. If you want an easy CS elective, then sure. Despite not being a fulfilling course, I appreciated it for being an easy CS course. The homework assignments were a fun change of pace even though I found most of them to be a waste of time (other than the last 2 that were actually related to user interface). You could get away with not going to class for the most part, but he does hand out assignments and announce quizzes solely in class, so I attended most classes so I wouldnt miss those. In class you can just do other homework and be fine. So, I recommend it if you just want an easy class and are okay with not learning anything. Just be aware that your grade will be kind of up in the air at the end due to the lack of grades and feedback for the last 2 assignments.",
