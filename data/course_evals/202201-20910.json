Despite not being a fulfilling course, I appreciated it for being an easy CS course. The homework assignments were a fun change of pace even though I found most of them to be a waste of time (other than the last 2 that were actually related to user interface). You could get away with not going to class for the most part, but he does hand out assignments and announce quizzes solely in class, so I attended most classes so I wouldnt miss those. In class you can just do other homework and be fine. So, I recommend it if you just want an easy class and are okay with not learning anything. Just be aware that your grade will be kind of up in the air at the end due to the lack of grades and feedback for the last 2 assignments.",
