                "The topics discussed were very new to me and my peers, so in addition to improving our writing and presentation skills from this course, we also got to learn about many specific, interesting events in Chinese history along with aspects of Chinese culture. However, I do feel that homework can become repetitive because for much of the semester, we either had Perusall reading assignments or Playposit video assignments that become dry without greater assignment variety.  That being said, the end of the semester turned more towards presentations and projects, which I appreciated. My lone suggestion would be to scatter presentations throughout the semester in order to have a more consistent diversity of assignments."

                "As the topics discussed in class are predetermined and are quite niche, I would suggest any student who is considering the course to look at the syllabus before confirming their enrollment. Although many topics are unique, they could be disengaging or mundane to students depending on their interests, so I would advise to avoid the course if the topics do not pique one's interest and/or curiosity."
