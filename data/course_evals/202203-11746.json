The course is very much so focused on formalizing Blockchain with economic theory at all levels (starting from consensus mechanisms and going to concepts like valuation, security, MEV). I personally loved it and thought it was a great way to gain exposure to new models / ways of thinking. The workload was also very manageable (I had a lot of other stuff going on and this was a good complementary workload). If youre interested in more applied knowledge, then maybe not.",
