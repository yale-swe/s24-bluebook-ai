    "This course is an incredible experience. Getting to spend one semester focusing just on one work is a valuable experience in itself, but doing that with the Divine Comedy is truly incredible. You will learn how to read a text as initially daunting as Dante's Comedy, think about ideas that challenge your perception of faith and the world, and how to tackle writing about these topics.",
    "This course is an in-depth analysis of Dante's Divine Comedy, plus his Vita Nuova (briefly). I learned crazy things about the Divine Comedy that I would have never thought existed; focusing on one work for the entire semester is one of the coolest academic experiences you can have.",
    "Even if you have never taken a classics course before, you will gain a lot from this class. Professor Mazzotta does a great job of explaining medieval thought systems and conveying the complexity of Dante's work.",
    "I developed an insightful understanding of The Divine Comedy.",
    "I left this course with deeper and well grounded insights on Dante's poem; insights which I felt were my own, guided and elucidated by the expert knowledge and teaching of Prof. Mazzotta. This was a class that I was excited to attend every lecture of, and felt that I could contribute to and ask questions when unsure.",
    "Critical reading of Dantes works",
    "Gained a greater appreciation for Dante and The Divine Comedy.",
    "I learned so much about the medieval mindset."

   "comments": [
    "I would change nothing about this course. It is a well-organized, appropriately paced course that really allows you to dig into the text. Having a section on top of the already small lecture was also a very valuable time to discuss the intense, complicated themes introduced in lecture.",
    "Professor Mazzota (our actual professor, idk why he's not listed) is incredible! He's one of the world's foremost Dante scholars, so learning from him is an absolute pleasure in itself. He's also a bit wild (!!), and will constantly surprise you will bold theses, offers of wine, and hilarious asides about medieval culture and politics. \r\n\r\nHis lectures can be a bit scattered at times, so the main improvement I would like to see is perhaps a slightly larger amount of structure in the lectures themselves. He read a chapter of his unpublished book for us one class, which was INCREDIBLE. More things like that would be great. His lectures are also incredibly dramatic at times, which is so fun, so get ready to be surprised. \r\n\r\nThe section could use some improvement as well, as it was a bit quiet in terms of discussion, but that could have just been my particular section. We did have a guest short lecture from a grad student in section one time, which was wonderfulI would love to have a couple more of those.",
    "The lecture is incomprehensible (by Guiseppe)",
    "I can think of no weaknesses for this class. Professor Mazzotta has been teaching this class for a Long time, and yet it feels like the furthest thing from a repetition of the previous year's class. Professor Mazzotta always brings in new reflections and analyses of certain passages.",
    "The course was fascinating and engaging. I cannot think of how it could be improved.",
    "The strengths of the course stem from Prof. Mazzotta's lecturing, as he explains and expands on the poem and engages his class. The content was not easy, but neither is Dante nor Yale, and his knowledge and teaching was valued both in lecture and conversational form.",
    "Solid course. Lectures are a bit all over the place but thats half the fun",
    "Strengths: engaging, helpful and responsive TAs, genius professor\r\nWeaknesses: organization of the course and lectures",
    "The lectures are superb. Absolutely superb. I think the class would be better as a seminar so that there is more direct interaction with Professor Mazzotta (since, unfortunately, not many people signed up for it)."

    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. Dante's Comedy is one of the most impressive, beautiful, all-encompassing literary works. Reading the entirety of the Comedy is not done in most other classes, and I think that it is an invaluable experience for anyone even remotely interested in it. Through Mazzotta's lectures, you will be introduced to details and themes that you may never pick up on your own. The interpretations of Dante's Comedy are seemingly limitless, and this course is a fantastic opportunity to be exposed to just a small portion of them.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is incredibly fulfilling with a very reasonable amount of work. You will constantly be surprised about the depth and breadth of the Divine Comedy, and gain a deep respect for both Dante and Professor Mazzota (who was the actual professor in Fall 2017, not Moudarres). It is a lecture with time for questions at the end of each class (since it is a small lecture). \r\n\r\nThere is minimal reading (4 cantos a week, so roughly 30 pages), and it is enjoyable reading at that. The midterm and final were both quite doable (standard passage IDs, with a few extended short-answer type questions on themes). The paper is the only \"assignment\" of the semester, and is roughly 8-10 pages, due at the end of the term. It is 50% of the final grade, though, so be prepared. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to be constantly shook, and by the end of the course, you will most certainly have developed a love for one of the most incredible works of literature ever written {but what is the genre?? :) there are many answers}. In the words of the poet himself, in this course you shall learn that \"neither Creator nor creature ... is without love,\" and by the end of the poem you shall \"come forth and see the stars.\"",
    "no because i couldn't understand any of the lectures. poorly taught.",
    "Absolutely! After taking this class, it feels like knowing a few things about Dante's work is essential. What I like best about this course is that everyone will find something that they enjoy. If you are a poetry enthusiast, you will enjoy the complexity of language devices. If you love history and philosophy, you will marvel at the depth of Dante's reflections on politics, life, and the pursuit of knowledge. Even if you are a hardcore physicist you may find that Dante's conception of heaven and multi-dimensional space closely matches that of leading modern Scientists! In other words, no matter the kind of Yale student you are, you will find something really cool in this class!",
    "Yes, take it take it take it! Will be one of your favorite classes you take here.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, particularly if taught by Prof. Mazzotta. His knowledge and dedication are unparalleled.",
    "Solid class with an entertaining professor. The lectures are all over the place but thats what makes the course fun by listening to the nice thoughts that Mazzotta has",
    "Even though Mazzotta went off on tangents pretty frequently during lecture and was generally disorganized, the topic of the class is incredible. Definitely have a greater appreciation of Dante now and it was pretty cool to be taught by one of the world's leading Dante scholars (despite his disorganization).",
    "Yes, would recommend this course. Professor Mazzotta is one of the most passionate and engaging professors that I've had at Yale and even as a non-literature major he made it easy to keep up.",
    "Yes, yes YES! Please take this course. The material is too important for you to go through college without taking."
