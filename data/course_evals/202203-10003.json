Weakness: the class lacked structure, incredibly difficult to be in for almost 2 hours, also only received feedback on one work done in class. Professor Harris was not good at facilitating discussion, but the students in the class had very insightful comments and I learned a lot from them. Professor Harris also assumed everyone had knowledge of how to read and critique film, even though many of us told him it was our first film class."
