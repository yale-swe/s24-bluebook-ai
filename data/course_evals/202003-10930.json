                "I loved the pacing of this course. It never felt like too much work, and I never felt overwhelmed by the amount of information I was learning in class. I think the same format can be kept for following years.",
                "Strength: Great introduction to korean and very interactive with frequent break out rooms to practice speaking. Fun projects thrown in as well. Reasonable amount of work, but it relies on how much effort you put in. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Because of virtual format, there was very little in class writing practice.",
                "strength: the teacher is very encouraging, effective, and caring\r\nweakness: I expected to learn more grammar structures, but I guess it's the problem of the textbook",
                "Strengths: The course is fast-paced so a lot is learned in a relatively short amount of time.  However, homework and listening exercises never feel like strictly busywork, every exercise serves a purpose to reinforce vocab or grammar learned in the lessons and helps improve understanding in a meaningful way.  Partner work in class helps to learn the material in a casual, low-stress way, while at the same time help from the professor is readily available.\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any.",
                "I think this course was super helpful in providing a good foundation for the Korean Language. I enjoyed the structure of having class Monday through Friday and found many opportunities to practice the language outside and during class. I also enjoyed the use of breakout rooms to practice with classmates and the availability of the teacher to answer questions during these sessions.",
                "Strengths: Very dedicated teaching staff and plenty of resources. Office hours and TA are incredibly helpful. The hw was also not too much and very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I did often wish there was a sort of textbook schedule to follow for class. I remember in Chinese they would tell you which pages to read and what to look at before class so that when you went to class you could learn the material better. That would have been helpful.",
                "The class was lots of fun and I loved the different projects and units. It felt like the start was a bit slow but the pace quickly picked up. There were a fair number of vocab quizzes."

You can get what you want out of this class, whether it's a general overview of how to read Korean and some basic vocab, or a deeper understanding of the grammatical structures involved.  For the low level of workload in this class, so much can be gained.",

                "Yes, absolutely. The professor is incredible and goes to great lengths to ensure you learn and understand what you need to. It does require some personal initiative, however, as most language courses do.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Korean! Good teaching staff and always there to guide you.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to anyone who's interested in Korean or just wants to do a language credit. It's a great language and the class itself is a lot of fun. I also think it's probably easier than other L1 languages at Yale in terms of the workload."
