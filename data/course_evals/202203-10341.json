This class is unstructured and disoriented to the point that it felt like the professor was just making things up as they went along, touching lightly on as many topics tangentially related to international security as possible. I learned nothing new in this course that I hadn't already learned in other security classes offered at Yale with a specialty (ex: intelligence, theology, environmentalism, etc.). The only saving grace was the TF Josh.",
                "Insights into some of the theories underlying the study of international relations.",

I literally had no idea how countries thought about their relations with each other, why wars would even start, and what on earth was happening in Taiwan before taking this class. When I think about how much I have learned about the world and how to think critically about world issues in my two years in the major, this class is a big contributor to that accumulation of skills.",

                "Think about the analogy of the ship. To successfully sail the ship from one harbor to the other, you need both the broad, transferable, big idea knowledge built on theories and rules (navigation, etc)  of sailing the open oceans and the specific, context-driven, local knowledge to land the ship in the harbor. Pairing these two is a tricky but necessary balance!\r\n\r\nKnowledge: \r\nUnderstanding of rational explanations of conflict; the benefits and shortcomings of peacebuilding and aid; topics in nuclear politics\r\n\r\nSkills:\r\nThe ability to look at one topic through different lenses. e.g. what are the strengths and weaknesses of the different -isms of international relations? \r\n\r\nInsights: \r\n(1) People often think of poverty, inequality, ethnic differences as causes of war, but these issues exist throughout the world in peaceful areas too. In fact, conflict is the exception, not the rule, for all parties stand to lose in the destruction of war. (2) Successful ideas mix broad, transferable, theory-based knowledge with specific, context-driven, local knowledge.",

                "Strengths: Interesting discussion sections, students relatively engaged for a required course, professor gave a lot of effort, many subjects covered in a good amount of depth, loved Blattman's book\r\nWeaknesses: some expertise lacking, readings not always the most informative",
                "Strengths: breadth of topics\r\nWeaknesses: overly theoretical, abstract, and statistical. In my opinion lost touch with the actual concept of international relations.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The course is divided into neat, effective, and interconnected units which facilitate learning\r\n- Abstract discussions during lecture, often supported by probability theory or graphical analysis, are easy for students with little quantitative experience to understand\r\n- The instructor introduced games and exercises to lectures to engage students\r\n- Weekly discussion posts were helpful for student learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The reading is primarily 2017-2021 academic journal articles from nascent scholars rather than well-known books that have shaped international relations\r\n- Lectures sometimes suffered from an overabundance of theory and scattered remarks.",
                "This class did not have enough grades and the structure was too loose. I did not like not having a guideline for the response papers because I had no clue what my TA would grade me on. His singular comment on my four page paper was not helpful or insightful as to why I got points taken off. Also, the final paper lacked structure and that made it extremely difficult. The only prompt was one sentence long and was extremely vague. This paper was only difficult because of the lack of explanation as to what the teacher wanted.",
                "In terms of strengths, the course content touched on many different ways security can manifest itself worldwide, but it failed to bring everything together under a collective message or insight into int. security. I enjoyed sections where we could examine specific case studied more in-depth and discuss, but the content felt too broad to truly interact with in a meaningful, productive, and appropriate way.\r\n\r\nOverall, this course needs a major restructuring with an experienced professor who actually has a stake in the security topics they are lecturing about. Given that the content of the course can be very charged, the professor needs to be prepared to discuss the content in a responsible way. The onus should never be placed on the students to prove their communities are deserving of security. As this is one of the two required GLBL core classes, I was disappointed.",
                "This course assumes a lot of background knowledge on international conflicts. Instead of organizing the syllabus by weekly themes, it could be beneficial to spend the first half of the semester on case studies of specific conflicts so that everyone starts with the same general understanding. Since everyone had such different expertise in discussion sections, the conversations were often slow and difficult since some people would talk about conflicts that other students had no background knowledge on and therefore could not participate. The instructions for assignments were also unclear and led to a lot of unnecessary stress.",
                "I enjoyed the general topics of this course, like the Blattmann book a lot, and loved James' frequent use of real world examples and case studies. I also thought the use of in class polling was really well done. The course would have benefited from more information-heavy and engaging lectures as well as much clearer assignment instructions (we finally received detailed instructions for our papers DURING finals week when most of us had already written it). I also really don't think we needed that extensive of a focus on statistics. For any other group of students I think it would be great, but every student in this class was a global major and every single one is already required to take AQA for the major, meaning using lecture time to explain basic statistical concepts was not helpful.",
                "It's a core course, it has to cover a lot of main areas and policy discussions and it did so effectively.  The lecture-based structure of the course restrained it, but that is unavoidable.",
                "this course should not exist. it is legitimately the worst course in the entire major.",
                "Strengths: \r\nI really loved section with Walid - our debates were exciting and helped us develop high-level logic and thinking skills. \r\nI also liked that all of the assignments were open-ended and you could write about whatever interested you. I loved doing my papers in this class because I was learning so much from them. \r\nThe breadth of this course is also a strength - it's good to cover so many issues. I also think the structure of the course was generally well-thought-out and made sense to me.\r\nProf Sundquist is a very, very sharp scholar and his intentions were in the right place. I appreciate his humility and down-to-earth-ness.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLectures could have been a lot more engaging. My most engaging classes ask questions to the students every 7-10 minutes even in big lectures. There could be breaks where we discuss with a neighbor or more of those breaks where we take a moment to reflect on a question in the powerpoint. Prof Sundquist was going in the right direction by having some of these, but I think we need like 5 or more per class. Lecture attendance decreased throughout the semester and I think a key way to combat this would have been making lecture content somewhat tied to a grade (this is sad lol but I know all of my peers who didn't come to lecture would have benefitted from this) - ex through small pop quizzes in middle of lecture, or by having students write small reflections on lecture, or having us required to use lecture content in our canvas posts, something like that.\r\nAnother thing that could be improved to help keep lectures more engaging was a change to the approach of the slides. Many of the slides just had images on them, and I would often walk out of lecture not knowing what the key takeaways were or what we really learned from these small anecdotes we jumped around. James did verbally say some of these things, but having the key takeaway of what he is trying to convey to us as the header of every slide would drastically improve that which students absorbed from lectures and therefore their level of engagement.",
                "This course was poorly taught, poorly conceived, and only saved by the excellent TFs. The course's two foremost strengths were the readings and the TFs. The readings were interesting. However, the lectures were awful. Every lecture I left with less than one side of a page of notes. Everything tended to be extremely broad and centered on historical security crises. I am truly floored at how this course managed to not talk about current events (excluding section). There are SO many ways this course's content could be applied to 2022 and yet it simply wasn't. I also must mention the lecture on race. Horribly executed, ill-informed, and downright insulting. So embarrassing. The Global Affairs department MUST fix this course if it's going to be required. I was very excited for this course and extremely disappointed.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The Blattman book is one of my favorite's I've read at Yale and fundamentally changed how I think about war/conflict.\r\n- Reading responses and response papers were a productive way to engage with the course material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lectures and readings focused too much on individual studies at times. I think this made the lectures boring at times, and the readings, hard to relate to each other. It would have been nice to have one other book with a big central idea to accompany Blattman's.",
                "I liked the material, and Prof. Sundquist and Walid are both great! I think the course can be improved a lot. \r\n- I didn't like the focus on the scientific revolution of social science. Looking at graphs, talking about \"p-hacking,\" and criticizing research methods of cutting-edge studies didn't give me a better grasp of the basics of international relations or security.\r\n- By the end of the course, all I know about where I stand for a grade is my grade on one response paper, which is a bit concerning!\r\n- There was absolutely no comprehensive set of instructions for our final paper--just a couple lines in the syllabus and a couple slides.",
                "Strengths: the course started well with Blattman, and the overall structure of jumping to a topic or two per lecture worked pretty well. Also, the overall execution was pretty good given that it was the first time through with this instructor and syllabus.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/improvements: The biggest improvement this course need is a realignment of assessments and instruction. As it was constructed this year, the lecture content was never assessed, only readings, which meant a large portion of the class could skip or disengage from the lectures, which worsens the in-class experience and makes it less rewarding for those who do choose to engage. One way to remedy this would be to have quizzes about lecture content or make the lecture more socrative, like the AQA sequence, to include student participation more in the lectures.",
                "Wonderfully informative lectures and section as well as readings and topic areas were all well-executed.",
                "Strengths: The lectures were excellent and informative. We always went through the concepts assigned in the reading, which was helpful to make sure we had gotten the whole idea.\r\n\r\nWeakness: We had a lot of readings that perhaps could have been condensed, as some of the papers were approaching a similar theory with different case studies or from a different angle.",
                "Strengths: James is a great storyteller and made every lecture interesting. TAs did a good job of connecting the course readings to lecture, made themselves very available for office hours and discussion, and offered great feedback on assginments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course itself was very unstructured, which made it hard to connect concepts lecture-to-lecture. The readings were not discussed often in lecture and sometimes had little obvious connections to the lecture content, which made me question why they were assigned. The assignments were also very open ended, which made it also hard to see what value they offered in connection to our course on international security.",
                "The course was pretty weak overall in terms of the instructing  Professor Sundquist did not know how to approach topics related to race or gender and had just \"discovered\" W.E.B. Dubois having just graduated from a whole political science PhD from Yale which was very surprising. The course had really interesting readings and I actually enjoyed learning about international security more than I thought I would, but my TA Waleed did not facilitate discussion in a manner conducive to those who may have less of an international relations background in the Global Affairs major, and thus many women felt left out of the conversation. I think overall the course was really interesting and we learned a lot of surface level things about international security, but I feel like I came away with disappointment in the major since the grading scheme was really unclear and it was not very equitable the way people were graded by their TAs. For example, I ended the semester with only one grade in the books which was crazy."

                "I would not unless it is taught by a different teacher or they are really fascinated by the subject.",
                "Part of why this course was so frustrating is that we did not choose to be there. Yale has thousands of truly incredible classes (dozens of which are in the global major!) so the opportunity cost of forcing us to take a core for the major is really high. If Jackson is going to do that, there should be a really good reason. A poorly organized course with a brand new professor and no-one vetting the syllabus is not sufficient. None of this is a reflection on James- he is super smart and trying hard, just new - but this was a pretty bad class. It was disorganized, the assignments were unclear, and the lectures, while mostly interesting, did not actually teach me anything useful.",

The approach it used felt a little too theoretical at times and some of the readings felt a little unnecessary at times. Not sure that I would take it for fun, but overall it seemed to teach what it set out to teach.",

                "Yes, but I think Prof. Sundquist will need a couple years to get the course in order!",
                "I would recommend that Global students not be put off by the 225-275 sequence, as it really isn't representative of the rest of the major. Both courses need some time under the same professor to develop more engaging curriculums, but still have interesting content for people curious in learning about it.",
                "If the student is looking for a solid introduction to security and international relations, this is a great course for them to take.",

                "You have to take it if you are a Global Affairs major, and I would only recommend the course content since I was really uninterested in international security prior to taking the class but the readings made me really interested in learning about military history and its importance and things like the dominance subordinance hierarchy or how psychology interacts with international relations. If it is taught by a different professor and different TAs (more like Josh) then I would recommend the course to another student."
