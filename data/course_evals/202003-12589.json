                "Our small seminar size really allowed for robust discussions; Professor Habchi was also a wonderful discussion facilitator and made everyone feel like their contributions were substantial. A book a week felt at times overwhelming, but all of the literature assigned in this class was genuinely enjoyable to read, so it didn't feel too overwhelming. Can't think of any weaknesses other than that the first 2-3 weeks of the course might be difficult for students not familiar with critical\/postcolonial theory, as the theoretical readings the first few weeks were on the denser side.",
                "The syllabus is just so good, and Professor Habchi is very nice. Class never felt intimidating. As for weaknesses, I think more structure to class discussion would help over Zoom (purely because people are less willing to talk), although at the same time, I appreciated how free-flowing the conversation was. A novel a week is already a hefty reading load (definitely an enjoyable one), but I also sometimes wished that we had continued to put theoretical texts in conversation with the fiction. After the first several weeks, we weren't assigned any more theory (not to reinforce that arbitrary divide between 'theory' and 'non-theory'), which makes sense because we had 200-300 pages of reading from the novels. So I'm not sure what a workaround would be. Maybe even just making it a priority to ground our analysis of the novel in the theory we had read?",
                "The seminar discussions were fantastic and helped me engage with texts more effectively.",
                "The syllabus was great! I just wished we had more time to discuss the texts and more check-ins with prof.Habchi",
                "This was a great class! The readings were incredible, the workload was manageable, and I always gained a lot from our discussions. Hard to name something to improve."

                "Yes! Professor Habchi is absolutely fantastic, and facilitates class discussions very well. In the beginning of the semester, we learned about theories of colonization and diaspora which grounded our future discussions on literature. The essays were also great exercises to engage with texts and incorporate outside sources to deepen our analysis.",
