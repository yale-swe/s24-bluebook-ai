We covered some of the fundamental math for nonlinear dynamics, and we learned about specific models such as cell signaling networks, turing patterning, and Hodgkin-Huxley. At the end we discussed stochastic models in biology and discussed chemotaxis.",

                "Great balance of mathematical theory and computational modeling.",
                "Emonet should teach first. We are already overwhelmed at the end of the term and 4 others agree with me. Joe had the most straightforward instructions.",
                "Psets were quite long and coding was not taught well\/at all",
                "This course is really quite nice and interesting. I like the organization of the course in terms of exercises and PSETS, and the fact that we have three sets of professors was quite fun. \r\n\r\nI have only two weakness I think should be improved:\r\n1. Professors Howard and Emonet had wonderfully clear and self contained notes. Although I liked Prof. Damon Clark's lectures, I felt that his notes should be improved for clarity and being more self contained.\r\n2. The final project was essentially a sixth PSET. I wish we had more flexibility in choosing a topic for our final project.",
                "Assigning more teaching assistants, or adding peer tutors, to this course would make it feel much more accessible! \r\nMATLAB techniques weren't the focus of in-class instruction, but made up the bulk of assignments. \r\nOffering more time for coding help would really make a difference. \r\nTFs were great in person, but not always responsive to email. 2 office hours a week felt insufficient.",
                "Strengths: current mode of teaching is really great, the flow is very appropriate, and the difficulty of the content is okay.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: deeper level of dynamical systems should be involved. Some definitions (e.g., on bifurcation, etc) is not clearly explained. Also, some more textbooks and further\/supplementary reading should be provided-- there is no natural linkage between every module despite that within every module, the logic line is clear.",
                "Less homework!!!",
                "A major strength of this course was the publication of detailed lecture notes (especially in the first two modules) that allowed students to revisit the relevant content in full mathematical detail. Another strength was the pacing of assignments, which was frequent enough to review the material but not so frequent as to be a major burden. One weakness in my view was the amount of \"blackboard mathematics\" that was involved in the lectures-- it feels like exposition of basic algebra\/ODE work is best left to the lecture notes, as the derivations are both less time-consuming and easier to understand on paper. This lecture time could then be used to discuss both the intuition behind the solutions and significantly expand the course content itself-- it's impossible to judge, but I felt like symbol manipulations took up at least a third of the overall lecture time of the course. Another weakness in my opinion was the use of MatLab. I understand that it would be difficult to switch over the course content, but as a student who literally spent hours of frustration trying to make MatLab cooperate (with issues that sometimes confounded the TAs as well), I genuinely think it would be extremely worthwhile to make the change. The long-term trend in computational biology appears to be towards using python, and making the switch now rather than later will help the next several classes of students develop python proficiency and explore the course content in a more-intuitive and better-documented computational environment.",
                "Strength: Topics covered were diverse and involved a lot of different type of biological systems. Readings were helpful to get a broad sense of applications  of topics learned in research. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Lots of exercises and problem sets. Time requirement for class was high.",
                "felt that the lectures and assignments were disconnected.",
                "Wonderful course! All three professors were friendly, kind and good at explaining. The course was also very engaging, and covered exciting topics that are inspiring to research that requires mechanics modeling. The only suggestion I have is to open a following higher-level course to cover more materials in e.g. diffusion, regulatory feedback, signaling cascades, branching process, etc. for students who wish to dig deeper in the beautiful world of system biology. One semester is not enough!"

                "I would recommend this course if you have a strong interest in either neurological models or models of bacterial chemotaxis, as these subjects are explored in rigorous detail. However, if you're uninterested in those subjects, you may not enjoy a full two-thirds of the course, and the mathematical content of the first third could likely be obtained elsewhere.",
