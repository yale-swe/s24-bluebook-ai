   "comments": [
    "Prior to taking this course, I thought essays were five paragraph monstrosities. Professor Baynes-Ross taught me that an essay is less a formulaic paper than an effectively articulated argument.",
    "From this course, I learned how to write a college-level essay. I learned that there is a high expectation than what was expected of us students in high school. I also gained knowledge on writing research paper the different resources for doing research through the Yale Library system. I also got acquainted with the library resources here at Yale.",
    "Writing was much clearer and efficient thanks to this class.",
    "I feel more confident in my writing skills overall and gained experience in writing analytical, research and public argument essays. Specific skills that I developed in this course included organization and essay structure, language choice, and clarity in order to make more persuasive arguments. The readings were very interesting and diverse and helped shape my understanding of what it is to be a \"rebel\" in both human history and modern times."

   "comments": [
    "This course does well at acclimating students, particularly first years, to the level of writing and research that is expected of Yale students. I don't think there are any weakness to this course.",
    "Class conversations were engaging due to the interesting readings and student participation. The professor was always willing to give us extra time to review our essays one-on-one. Peer-reviews were good, but student engagement when it comes to giving feedback to one another could be improved."

   "comments": [
    "YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS",
    "Yes! The readings were super helpful and meetings with the professor regarding papers really improved my writing!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. This ENGL 114 section, in particular, was excellent. But from my understanding, all the sections in this course are great for students at Yale who want to prepare for the level of writing that can be expected in a Yale course.",
    "Yes, since most students will take a writing class, this is one of the best to take.",
    "Yes, it is a good course to take if you want to improve your writing skills because there is room for learning and growth. The class is interesting as the readings are very relevant to social movements in modern times."
