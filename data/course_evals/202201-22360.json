                "I do not believe this course was organized at all for learning. I talked to many students who reported that their Spanish had declined over the semester. Mine did too. Too often, our in-class work was simply putting some words on a Jamboard and then saying them aloud when called on. The class gave us no reason to try to learn vocabulary or new grammatical structures. There wasn't a single vocabulary quiz, and we were allowed to use Word Reference on the two exams. In other words, the class was easy because there was so little to do. For grammar, we barely learned any new structures, and none of them required more than a cursory glance before taking the test. L2 Spanish was more challenging than this course, and L2 Spanish was better for it. For the life of me, I do not know why this class did not have actual grammar and vocabulary evaluations. Everything just felt like filler between substantive lessons that never came. Or, put differently, this felt like some kind of experimental teaching style that didn't work out at all. If the point of the class was to increase our spoken skills, it failed on that aim, too. The final assignment, for example, was to create a script for a scene in a book we read and then act it out. But we all just the script off our phones, so how does that do anything for our conversation skills? Also, why are we paying hundreds of dollars for a textbook we didn't use at all? And finally, why did we go from doing less than 20 minutes of work a night to suddenly reading thousands of words in Spanish every night when we read the book by Garcia Marquez? Why would we cram that into a single week when it was by far the most intense part of the semester?",
                "Strengths: the course engages with a wide range of topics and students have plenty of opportunities to practice thinking about these topics in Spanish\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the work, though not necessarily challenging, can be quite tedious at times",
                "I feel like there was a lot of busy work and I did not engage in the course/materials a lot. With the class being 5 days a week and filled with lots of busy work assignments, I prioritized completing the homework over really engaging. I feel like we could have done more work on any grammar/vocab.",

                "Strengths: great curriculum, interesting topics and readings, by and large good and useful assignments\r\nWeaknesses: low incentives to work led to low class engagement. Very little feedback from professor. Course was in general unclear and disorganized."

So, take it if you are doing that, because you can't avoid it. But I'd say that you should avoid it if you can. It felt like a waste of time, energy, and tuition. The experience this semester suggests that--even more than L1 and L2 spanish--there should be an intensive version of L3 and L4 together for students who actually want to learn the language.",
