                "I now have a solid understanding of epidemiology.",
                "Basics of epidemiology, understanding of types of epidemiological research studies and aspects of public health research such as bias, variable relationships, and other topics relevant to consider in designing, executing, and analyzing research, as well as important skills to use in reading, consuming, and discussing the research of others.",
                "Was able to learn how to evaluate research more critically and how to start looking at research in basic concepts",
                "As someone who does not come from a clinical background, this was a crash course in epi for me, with invaluable insights into the design, implementation, reporting and pitfalls in clinical research. I will come away with excellent critical thinking skills in the medical literature context, and the concepts we covered have been immediately applicable in my area of academic and policy interest as well as reading daily media on COVID research.",
                "1) Learned how to calculate and interpret epidemiological parameters, including measure of occurrence, association, and potential impact;\r\n2)Identify the strengths and weaknesses of experimental and observational study designs;\r\n3)Understand the implications of various methodological approaches for internal and external validity of a study;\r\n4) Learned sources of bias and the conclusions draws;\r\n5) Apply the principles and methods of epidemiology to the design and analysis of new studies.",

                "This course was a very helpful review of epi concepts that I learned in undergrad several years ago. One of the most valuable takeaways is the ability to use a critical lens while reading published epi literature.",
                "How to critically evaluate the literature and to tease out good quality research. Additionally, I am able to develop the appropriate study design for the question I am interested in.",
                "I learned about various study designs, sampling techniques, calculating odds, risk, etc. Overall, we learned how to design an appropriate and valid study and how to interpret results.",
                "The main purpose of this course, which I think was absolutely achieved, was to be able to understand the study of epidemiology, including: study design, and evaluation of results. I feel now that I can read almost any epidemiology study, and acutely assess its strengths, weaknesses, and the meaning of the results presented. While I most likely will never have to read epidemiology studies as a part of my work, I feel that I attained a significantly broader understanding of the study of public health.",

Dr. Desai is a an exceptional instructor who presented course material in interesting and compelling manner.  This approach made the comprehension of key concepts easier to digest.",

She has a great personality and is always willing to help.She is very knowledge about the concepts and was able to explain in more than one way if I didnt understand right away. She attended every classes and answers questions after each class. She also add TA hours before assignment due. \r\n2) Read textbook and additional readings on Canvas.",
