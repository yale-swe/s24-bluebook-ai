                "The course is good as it is. The only suggestion I have is not to put time pressure on students in exams. The objective should be to test a student's mastery on the subject and time pressure unnecessarily puts stress on the students in the exam, which either leads to errors or inability to answer all the questions , even though the student knows how to solve it. It is unlikely that in the real world anyone has to solve problems on a regular basis with extremely tight deadlines. Those scenarios will be the exceptions and not the norm. Therefore, I would prefer that students are given adequate time to complete the exam by either reducing the number of questions or increasing the time allowed. Let the questions be tough, but give the student time to apply what they learnt in a less stressful environment.",
                "Strengths: helpful TFs, problem sets prepare you well for the tests.\r\nWeaknesses: pacing could be a bit off. Sometimes it felt like we took too long going over certain things, and we got behind.",
                "Strengths- JT is the best professor! Super open to questions, explains everything very clearly, and very easy to get along with\r\nWeaknesses- not enough time on the midterm, section should be recorded, instead of asking us questions sometimes JT should just tell us what the answer is (so we can take better notes), hard to ask questions\/office hours (you had to sign up for meeting times instead of just a zoom link for everyone with TA and JT)",
                "Well structured. Clear lectures. Helpful section. More OH would be good.",
                "JT teaches stats in the most exciting way possible. JT & both TAs were extremely helpful and available, even outside of their scheduled OH. The structure of this class as well as the resources available to students to review material were extremely well organized, even given the virtual setting. I wish problem sets were posted earlier to give more time, but honestly one week for each problem set was enough given the amount of help that was available. The problem sets themselves were also extremely useful, unlike problems sets in other QR classes where they have little or nothing to do with what's actually taught during lectures\/what comes up on exams. Overall a great class, definitely the best class I've taken virtually.",
                "Strengths: JT and my TF Brian Chung's energy really helped me engage with the class as a less naturally quantitative thinker. Going to office hours with JT when I could was also a very pleasant experiences and I feel that he was very invested in our growth as a learner, meeting us where we are. Weaknesses: I know JT mentioned briefly that many of these choices were related to his own pedagogical style, but taking the course in conjunction with the very differently organized class of ECON 116 was jarring. In ECON, some of the most useful resources were the class piazza board, peer tutors, open office hours where I could listen in to other student's questions and learn from them, and posting content from sections and pset corrections each week. I think I lost a bit of my engagement with AQA because I felt like I was going through the class alone with just one of my friends as a study buddy without those class features that foster community learning. I also didn't love the cold calling in class because sometimes I spent more time being anxious about being called on than thinking about the theory questions. While some may find this engaging or positive pressure to do the readings, it felt a little bit like it was stoking the infamous competitive culture of global affairs. This may seem overdramatic, and it really wasn't too bad getting called on when you didn't know the answer, that it did add on that mental component.",
                "This course is very good. JT is a great professor and manages to keep class engaging and fun. The TFs were excellent in section, especially at explaining confusing concepts.",
                "The strength of this course is undoubtedly JT! He is an excellent professor who actually cares about his students and the content that is being taught. JT also always offered several opportunities for office hours with him on a weekly basis, which were a valuable resource that all students should utilize when taking this course.",
                "I think this course does a good job of simplifying stats down to a level that someone with no STEM background could understand. This simplification is certainly helpful for many students in the course; however, I think it can be a bit of a drag for other students. It feels very slow and simple for students who have more experience in math and stats.",
                "I think the staff was the best part of this course.  I could see how the material could get boring, but the Professor and the TFs always kept it fun and interesting, making it a lot easier to learn.",
                "This course was nearly perfect in terms of learning Statistics. As an S&DS major, I learned so much from this class than the other Statistics courses I've taken. JT is a great professor; he's able to explain topics so well and is clear in terms of what he wants us to know for tests\/finals. I do not have any weaknesses for this course, other than maybe more office hours.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- A slow but methodical teaching of basic statistics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Problem sets are often much longer than necessary. About halfway through the PSETs, I feel as though I have a firm grasp of the material. I feel the PSETs are unnecessarily long.",

The exams are very fair - there are no surprises, so whatever effort you put in studying and on the psets is what you will get out of this course. The discussion section was incredibly helpful and really made the difference with practicing and engaging with the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: office hours were sometimes very unhelpful. The TFs and JT were cautious to not \"give away\" too much in their answers to students' questions which lead to many vague confusing responses.",

                "The strength of this course is JT, without a doubt. He is such an engaging professor and really makes an effort to make the content understandable. \r\nHowever, I feel that this course has weaknesses that can make it difficult. I personally found this course incredibly frustrating, because of a significant disconnect between lecture and problem sets. During lecture I would feel like I had a good grasp of the concepts, and I would use that understanding on the problem sets and proceed to get marked off for every small error I made, even if the intent was correct, with feedback that I couldn't understand from the TAs. Overall, I felt that there was a gap between what I learned from JT and the TAs expected, and as a result of this gap I was never able to correct my errors in understanding. In addition, the TAs scheduled their office hours on Thursdays, yet problem sets would be due the following Wednesdays, which meant that TA office hours were practically redundant since very few people had the time to begin a problem set that far before the due date.",
                "Very engaging Professor. \r\nMaybe more organization.",
                "The strength of the course was Professor JT. He's super engaging, understanding, funny, and helpful. He takes time to make sure that we get the material, and he's always willing to help. He also pushed us to understand what we were learning, but he usually took it slow so we could think and take notes.",
                "This course was strong in taking the information learned in lecture and extending it to problems by form of problem sets. This course could use some variety of assignments.",
                "Strengths; JT is incredible; his energy and enthusiasm, and sheer knowledge on the subject, made every class so lovely (even though it was statistics!). JT was always asking questions, calling on students, telling jokes and stories to lighten the mood and also ensure our engagement, and it paid off immensely. I cannot imagine having taken this course with anyone but JT, who not only enjoyed interacting and engaging with us, but also gave miraculously clear and thorough explanations of the topics we were covering. I feel like I learned so much!\r\nWeaknesses: My major issue with the course were the PSETs. They are gargantuan. They are so immense. I am not exaggerating. They took forever to complete and many questions felt like busywork rather than asking us to really engage with the lessons. The grading and expectations for them was also very murky; some PSETs were graded a lot more leniently than others, and as such it became pretty difficult to figure out how much to include in a certain answer, or what exactly they were looking for. Lastly, sometimes PSET grading would lag behind a lot, which meant we'd sometimes be doing work that required something we used in a previous PSET, but since it had not been graded, we didn't know if we were doing correctly (thus leading to more mistakes and points taken off).",
                "Strengths: the professor, the subject matter, the pace of the class was excellent, the students within the class are insightful\r\nWeaknesses: some of the problem sets questions were a little vague,"

For the class as a whole, it increased student participation and made it feel as if we were actually part of a class with fellow peers, as opposed to just mindlessly staring at an instructor on a screen. I hope that any virtual classes that I take next semester will implement a similar policy.",

                "The virtual setting was handled perfectly. The students were kept engaged in the discussion.",

                "I would highly recommend the course to students from various disciplines. First of all, the instructor is excellent. His command over the subject is very good and his teaching style and skills excellent. The course focuses a lot on improving our understanding of statistics in terms of a strong theoretical foundation. This will help anyone who wants to undertake some form of research or apply them in public policy.",
                "Yes. I was looking for another QR course as a humanities major, and this one was suitable. There is no complicated math; it's more memorizing the right methods with which to approach a question. Also, it prepares you to evaluate statistical information that you may come across in research or everyday life.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the material (or want a little background). the material was not too hard but the psets were long.",
                "Yes. It is a good introduction to statistics without the downsides of a larger course like S&DS 100.",
                "YES! I'd taken intro stats at Yale before but I don't think I really understood some fundamental concepts until this class. Super engaging, even in virtual form, and JT is always a fun lecturer.",
                "Yes. As a non-STEM major this course was an excellent QR credit. Although the math can be a little difficult at times, it is not impossible. Plus, the professor and TFs are always more than willing to engage with their students and clear up any questions.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It serves as a great introduction to statistical analysis - a skill that everybody should learn at some point - and you will not be able to find a better professor than JT to teach the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are a very non-STEM student looking to gain some analysis skills. For a student who has a bit more experience in STEM, I would recommend a more intensive course.",
                "Yes! Im interested in quantitative and social sciences, and this class was great in allowing students to see how they can overlap in an applied area (policy). Its a fundamental course to understanding research in social sciences but also research in general. JT does especially a great job in making the material easy to understand and answering all your questions.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in statistics and its application to everyday life.",
                "I would highly recommend this for all Global Affairs and S&DS majors",
                "If one does not seek to understand the theory, but just the application of elementary statistics then this is the course for you.",
                "Requirement",
                "I think this is a very doable math course even without prior stats knowledge. It's truly a straightforward course with a great instructor and great TFs so even if the subject material could be dull, the class itself is quite engaging.",
                "Yes, JT is a very engaging professor and I enjoyed the class. However, if you're not planning to major in Global\/take 122 you might want to look for a more comprehensive, self-contained statistics course",
                "Thorough course, learned a lot. Psets take a long time to complete. Having a study group definitely helped.",
                "Yes, it's a must take in my opinion. You take so much away from this class.",
                "As a foundational course in statistics, this course is essential for those planning to undertake quantiative research work in the future.",
                "I would, but only if they have an appreciation for statistics.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are required to take it, or if you have a strong understanding of statistics and believe it would be easy. If you're looking for a QR credit, there are other courses that are better.",
                "Sure, if its a major requirement.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who struggles with statistics and wants to improve. This class also helps to understand how certain statistics apply in public policy, which is valuable information for anyone who wants to practice or understand it.",
                "For a stats class, this is probably the best it can get; JT is beyond engaging and a spectacular teacher, and we also get to pick up some nifty STATA experience to boot! For prospective Global majors, definitely try to take this instead of one of the substitute courses, particularly since you'll get a head start on the STATA you'll need for AQA II.",
                "Yes, a very fun and not the most challenging stats class."
