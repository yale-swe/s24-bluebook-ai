                "Honestly, not a lot. Definitely got a bit more knowledge and understanding of manuscripts, and it satisfied an English major requirement, but all in all disappointing.",
                "I learnt so much about medieval manuscripts. From the details of how parchment was made to trying to decipher middle English handwriting there was so much we covered. I developed greater research skills and gained insight into the structure of successful independent learning.",
                "I learned SO MUCH about medieval manuscripts and how they were made, why they were made, who read them, and what was in them. This was probably the most in-depth dive into the actual process of book making I've ever experience, and that is what made this course so unique compared to the other English courses at Yale which only focus on the literature itself. I learned how to catalogue a manuscript and identify crucial components of the text including its script, rubrication, material, etc. I also learned how to assemble a bibliography about particular manuscripts and create an exhibit centering around a specific research question.",
                "I learned the fundamentals of codicology and manuscript study, including Middle English paleography and a number of fascinating case-studies on particular manuscripts. I began the course knowing next to nothing about how to \"read\" a manuscript, and left with a profound understanding of the connections between text and physical medium and how to interpret those connections in an extended final project. We also read some fascinating medieval texts I would not have encountered otherwise, such as the Ormulum or the Harley Lyrics. This course also helped my ability to plan and structure a long-term project immensely, one which steps beyond the simple close readings of other courses and instead forces one to dive into secondary sources and historical context to produce an original thesis.",
                "I learned a lot about Medieval book culture and really enjoyed our paleography practices. It was interesting to take an English class that was more devoted to material and objectivity than literature.",

                "Strengths: This type of class draws a really interesting mix of English students, literature students, art students, etc. that led to really interesting perspectives. It's also fun to have a course that can use the Beinecke and other library resources!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus was really dense. It seemed like every single class was just a powerpoint of manuscripts and the professor talking about cool things about them and then expecting us to have insights but none of us know anything about manuscripts lmao. Also the assignments were really unclear and we often found out last minute that her expectations were a lot higher than we understood them to be. I think the course needs a different structure.",
                "Strength: Prof. Brantley is amazing, super nice, and supportive! The course is structured nicely and if it was in person the Beinecke would have been amazing to go to and learn about manuscripts in person. Brantley also gives great feedback!\r\nWeaknesses: The class meets once a week so there is a lot of reading to do  between each one. Don't let it pile up or else it will be too much right before class. Not really a weakness of the course, just something to keep in mind.",
                "Strengths: Professor Brantley is fantastic. Rachel Wilson is fantastic. Both of these educators are so dedicated to student learning and so willing to help us out and create a warm, welcoming, and adaptable learning environment. I do wish that we started our final project sooner in the semester-- it was a lot of work crammed into a 3-4 week period of time and I wish I had a few more weeks to mull it all over. I did get pretty stressed trying to finish the annotated bibliography and the draft, but it was okay and it was all enjoyable work. This was probably one of the most enjoyable and intellectually enriching courses I've taken here as an English major.",
                "This course was well-organized in a way that can be sometimes frustrating for the student, but is also probably for the best. The first half of the course is breaking down the language and methods of codicology in the abstract in a way that can be less-than-enthrallingone class on scribal hands, one class on writing supports, etc. However, this trudge pays off in the second half of the course when you get to look at some fascinating case-studies with all of the knowledge from the first half of the course, and find yourself speaking with a greater knowledge of these subjects than you would expect. So, while I would have loved to look at a greater variety of noteworthy manuscripts to get more of a background in the \"Great Works\" of this disciplineespecially before planning my final project and picking which manuscripts to studythe organization of this seminar pays off in a really fulfilling way by the end. \r\n\r\nI only have two minor qualms with this course: the first is that the the multiple textbooks for the first half of the course were extensive, but had lots of overlap with each other, and so could feel quite repetitive. The second is that the other students in the seminar seemed unprepared for the extra work that a senior seminar entails, and quite a few students had strong objections to being asked to draft a secondary-source bibliography, among other elements of the final project deadline. These requirements seemed quite normal and appropriate for a \"historical\" assignment, especially for a senior capstone project, but the result was a number of classes being cancelled and the expectations for the course being curtailed in a way which seemed to cut into the learning one could get out of the course.",
                "This course seems like it was very manageable for someone who already had a background in Medieval studies/culture. For those of us who were new to the discipline, it was a little bit harder, but not inaccessible. I really enjoyed the first few weeks of class when we got the chance to really discuss the making of Medieval manuscripts, but the second half of the course, which was spent looking at case studies, seemed a little bit less structured. I wish that we had looked at more case studies while we were learning about the making of the objects so that there was a better flow of information throughout the whole course. I also think that some of the expectations around work were unclear and I would have really benefitted from an example of a manuscript description or a museum exhibition.",

Sometimes, links to online libraries didn't load very well, or it was difficult to look at the details of each manuscript. I did enjoy that we used Canvas to connect with everyone else by reading prospectuses and sharing photos of our manuscripts. I do wish that we had gotten the chance to look at manuscripts in the Beineke together, the class really lost a lot of impact without that experience.",

But for the few of us who love this kind of stuff, it was so enjoyable. You might even be surprised.",
                "YES! This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Take if you want to look at a bunch of really cool manuscripts and throw yourself into the world of Medieval book culture, and also read a number of cool texts along the way. This course teaches a whole new disciplineit's not quite a literature course, but it's not quite a history coursewhich is an exciting opportunity, but also one which necessarily asks for different requirements and new ways of thinking which one might not be used to. Overall, this was one of the most fulfilling experiences I've had in my time as an undergraduate.",
                "I would only recommend this class to someone who is already intermediately familiar with Medieval manuscripts, for a newbie there is a lot of catch up and it often feels intimidating and like a lot of extra work. This class would probably be really cool if you get the chance to interact with the objects in the Beineke as a class, but online isn't as fun or special. Often the project descriptions are confusing and could be clearer.",
                "Yes! Medieval manuscripts are such unique objects, there's really nothing like them. This course is an \"English\" class, but looking at manuscripts involves history, art history, theology, and more. And there is no one better to study them with than Professor Brantley, who is so passionate about them and clearly very interested in their multidisciplinarity."
