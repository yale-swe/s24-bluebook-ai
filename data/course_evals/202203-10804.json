                "The course focuses on introducing calculus at a slower pace. Main topics include limit definition of the derivative; simply derivative rules (excluding chain rule, which is MATH 111); generating graphs from equations; f, f', and f'' graph relationships; simple derivative applications and optimization; and the other elements that get you to these things. It's similar to the first part of AP Calculus AB and adds optimization. \r\n\r\nI took AP Calculus AB several years ago and vaguely remembered a lot of the stuff but definitely had to relearn it. They make an effort in the course, or at least my instructor (John Hall!), to explain the inner-workings of the math, which was great for me because I was able to think a lot more critically about the math in general.",
                "I have stronger algebra skills and I have many more strategies at hand to solve the same type of problems.",
                "The course built a strong foundation of mathematical skills and provided an introduction to calculus.",
                "New concepts in Math 110 that I personally learned that were different from AP Calc AP in high school was linearization and linear approximation. I had not talked about those concepts as well as invertible functions and the emphasis on rational functions. I am simply not a good math student.",
                "Community College Calc 1 and Statistics",
                "I learned about the importance of not just absorbing information, but being able to apply it in my own way to fully understand it",
                "I developed a knowledge about solving derivatives and limits using algebraic concepts I knew before and new calculus concepts I was taught. This course taught me how to visualize concepts and really understand the reasoning behind the math, not just the steps\/equation.",

                "Better quantitative skills.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: John Hall.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course time commitment is just very substantial. A typical week consists of a pset, two 75 minute lectures, a 90 minute mandatory workshop with a ULA, and two (short, frankly, but still) pre-class prep things. There are also four concept checks during the semester and an Algebra Gateway (which is pass\/fail, repeat until you pass). It was definitely very useful but it was a lot more than I wanted it to be because I took this as a QR credit.",
                "There are many resources and people to refer to ask for help and they are very patient. However, I do believe there are many little tasks like workshops,",
                "The course gave a slower paced approach to mathematics and took care to nurture the foundation of mathematical knowledge of students from various backgrounds. However, I do not think that my level of understanding or engagement with the course was reflected in my grade. The grading of exams tends to be confusing and harsh. Practice material provided for exams were from previous course directors who took a different approach to the course. This made studying for exams difficult and the practice material often heavily varied from the actual exams. I would recommend provided better practice material, especially considering how heavily exams count toward the course. I would also recommend standardizing notes and classroom materials as they varied heavily from instructor to instructor.",
                "One main strength of Math 110 is the pacing. I do sometimes wish we could get more worksheets that work on specific mathematical topics, since the p-set covers a broader range of concepts.\r\nAs a student that dropped into Math 110 at the middle mark of the semester, one main difference that I can point out between Math 110\/111 and Math 112 is that there are weekly workshops to attend and extra homework in Canvas on top of the p-sets. I personally did not even know about the extra Canvas homework until several weeks later. I did enjoy the workshops because we get more practice with TA that can explain the concepts well. \r\n\r\nI do want to mention that there were surprisingly no graphs on the final exam, yet there are numerous graphs that we had to graph on the psets. After taking the final, I feel that they make the questions on the exams harder, to the point that even if you are familiar with the content that you are being asked about, it is presented in a way I am not familiar with. It is just eccentric how the questions on the exams are designed verses the questions we practice weekly.",
                "More technical questions in class similar to the problem sets.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nOffice hour support\r\nGateways to consolidate content\r\nProfessor support\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n\r\nMaybe more gateways to further test knowledge",
                "This course was a good entry into calculus because it reviewed noteworthy concepts from prior math classes I've taken. However, I felt like this course lacked the in-class practice and explanation of all concepts. Some class periods felt a little redundant and not useful compared to what we were solving for the problem sets.",
                "Every week, it felt like the things we learned in class weren't the same as what we saw on worksheets. While I understand now this was purposeful, I wish there has been more guidance in the beginning to understand this. There was, alot I didn't know around how courses worked, and what the expectations were.there was a learning curve that held back me back.",
                "Strengths - great professor. Excellent teaching. Excellent ULAs. \r\nWeaknesses - PSETs are sometimes quite long though not often.",
                "The class is very thorough, and I liked that all the topics were connected and cumulative."

I originally was in Math 112, bu decided to drop down a level into Math 110\/111, which was definitely the right choice. For a concept such as Calculus, pacing truly does matter, and I like that Math 110 did not rush through complex topics as much as 112 did. Math 110 is also more beginner-friendly, which is definitely a plus.",
                "Yes, it is well taught.",
