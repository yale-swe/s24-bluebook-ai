   "comments": [
    "I learned the basics of writing a well written essay, and how to employ that knowledge in various circumstances. I learned how to read an essay well, and how to notice authorial techniques and apply them to my own work.",
    "I developed my writing skills.",
    "I learned an incredible number of writing tricks, techniques, strategies and other approaches to writing personal essays, place\/travel essays, profiles, cultural commentary and humor. This course is a great introductory writing course that can also help your creative writing and just building confidence in putting your ideas down on paper and expressing them in a lucid and interesting way.",
    "I learned to write with a message in mind instead of focusing on a hazier aesthetic\/emotion.",
    "I gained more confidence in my writing. I learned more about lead, didion details and other literary techniques to improve my writing",
    "Learned how to write essays in various styles for publication to a wide audience.",
    "Better understanding of nonfiction tools and a strong list of nonfiction authors to explore in the future",
    "I became SUCH a better writer. By the end of the course, I was able to write higher quality work in a much shorter period of time. I also got to write fun pieces that I never would have made the time to otherwise.",
    "I learned how to write better essays! I loved that this course was creative non-fictionI feel like that's the most common type of writing we'll have to do in life, whereas academic writing tends to be a bit niche. I learned effective writing techniques and to make sure that every word is purposeful towards my point."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I liked the essays that we read as it exposed me to different authors and styles of writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The actual class was not very engaging as we did the same thing each time.",
    "Strengths: You read many very good essays that you might not otherwise have. Because the five units in the class are quite different, you gain skills in applying general knowledge and techniques into unique situations. Professor Newton is a wonderful instructor, and gives extremely detailed, fair feedback on all off your work--for both the ungraded first draft and the final. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It seemed as if at some points class discussion was less about writing techniques and more about the content of the essays we read. Yes, they were all wonderful, but I wish we had spent more time working on foundational writing skills.",
    "This course was my favorite this semester, and it perfectly blended explicit instruction with student participation. Classes were discussion based and driven by students, but Professor Newton would write on the chalkboard and draw out key writing techniques that came out of discussion. At first, the workshop days where we would discuss 3 students essays were a little stilted and came across as reading pre written feedback rather than discussion, but I think as a class it just took time to get into the rhythm of critiquing.",
    "It covers a wide breadth of nonfiction writing, but I wish there were more chances for peer feedback and some more small, \"practice\" assignments so we write more than 1.5 pieces per genre.",
    "The course is very past faced and so I understand that only one draft is possible before the final but it would be nice to be able to have a second draft before submitting final",
    "The course moves quickly and I believe could benefit from having one less unit but the course does help you improve your writing skills greatly.",
    "Strengths: readings contained good variety, and the different types of essays forced us to branch out into new areas with our writing skills. The workload was manageable \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the time allowed for editing essays was short, which made it difficult to really analyze the small details we could improve on. Essay feedback was sometimes contradictory or hard to interpret . \r\n\r\nImprovements: more opportunities for students to share pieces they have found in their own time and enjoyed reading; more focus on technical elements of the pieces being discussed versus the overall message\/point",
    "Strengths: Readings are so enjoyable, and unlike in other classes, you are assigned an actually readable quantity of pages. I looked forward to doing the readings each week There is just the right amount of workload in that you are writing a lot, you are challenged, but you are not overwhelmed with work. You get great feedback on your writing and are forced to improve your writing greatly in a short period of time.",
    "A strength of this course was that I thoroughly enjoyed every reading. It's the type of essay that I would read myself, and this course prompted me to buy several collections of essays similar to the ones we read in class. I also grew so much as a writer, and Pam's feedback was so helpful towards pushing me to write the best essays I could! There aren't many weaknesses to this course!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! The wonderful thing about this course is the freedom in your content. As long as your work somewhat falls into the category of that particular unit (personal narrative, place, interview, cultural analysis, and humor), you are free to write about anything you want. Most of the assigned readings are incredible and class discussion is always engaging.",
    "Yes, I would. It was very fun to read and write personal essays.",
    "It really depends on their goals. A lot of modern writers enjoy playing with form and breaking rules, and this course feels like it's much more about the conventions of certain types of writing without as much room to take risks - risk-taking is not discouraged, but it's not taught or even mentioned in class. And since this is essentially a class on writing for The New Yorker, our readings and assignments are written like they're for a white moderate-liberal audience.",
    "Yes! I loved the readings and looked forward to them",
    "I would because it was very beneficial in improving my writing skills outside of a normal high school essay and I believe helped prepare me well for college writing.",
    "If you want to improve your writing skill and style, go ahead. If you need a writing credit, go elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who enjoy reading nonfiction, or who are curious about nonfiction but havent read much of it. Its a good introduction to the genre and some of the best nonfiction pieces. The course requires almost constant writing, as youre always either writing or revising an essay, so I would only recommend it to students who enjoy the writing process",
    "Yes. Everyone should take English 120, it is one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Yes!! Please take this class :) Even as a non-humanities major, I really enjoyed this class. However, you do get as much as you put in, so this is not a course you want to slack off in!"
