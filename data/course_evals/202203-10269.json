                "Definite strength is professor el-tayeb! Shes literally so fantastic, she really brings just a really interesting perspective of European and specifically german racism. She is so keenly brilliant, but really doesnt make her students feel stupid when making comments, whereas a lot of yale professors just love to remind their students that they are dumb in comparison to them.",
                "Strengths were that the discussion rarely dragged, that the final project can be whatever you want it to be (and I had a blast making mine), that more than half the grade is participation-based (and the Perusall comments led to a lively discussion), that the people are almost all smart and have intelligent things to say, and more. Weaknesses were that I don't think anybody really looked forward to coming to class each week, so a lot of it felt like we were going through the motions.",

                "No. This seminar feels like it should check off all of the boxes for an excellent class -- the material was interesting, the people knew what they were talking about, the class wasn't very hard. In spite of all of that, I didn't enjoy the class very much. I felt like I learned more about the topic the class was discussing when other classes I've taken have touched on this subject than I have in this class devoted to the subject. Our class discussions felt like a hodgepodge of whatever other ER&M classes people were actually thinking about brought into one class, which could be interesting at times, but didn't often feel like we were discussing the material. Professor El-Tayeb was a good seminar leader and had a good mix of letting people talk when we wanted to talk but contributing to the discussion in interesting ways when she spoke. I can't point to anything that I didn't like about this class, but it was far less than the sum of its parts.",
                "Yes! Amazing social science course for anyone in a visual\/performing arts related major, and just an awesome class overall!"
