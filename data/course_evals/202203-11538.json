                "Due to the nature of this course being a literature seminar, the readings each week could be heavy if not managed properly, but the instructor also adjusted accordingly to our feedback throughout the seminar and lightened the workload when she sensed we would benefit from it. The assigned papers were well distributed throughout the semester, and I think they were assigned at appropriate times to allow us to continuously develop our writing skills. The discussions were one of the greatest strengths of the class; the time was well spent discussing various aspects of the texts we read, and all students were well engaged (the instructor also worked to ensure engagement was high among all students).",
                "A strength that I enjoyed was the level of comfort with which everyone could speak and how unique yet familiar the readings were (often a book or supplemental reading was new to most of the class, but there was always someone who had prior knowledge or insight adding to the discussions).",
                "This course allowed for students with like-minded attitudes on the topics of hybrid identities and intricacy of sci-fi to come together in one room and discuss the endless questions that are developed within the passages. It allows the student to develop critical thinking and analysis while learning to express their opinions and building it off of others. This small section garnered a connection between students."

While this course is specifically titled \"Asian-American identity,\" this complicated topic can be touched upon many different identities. Additionally, it is a great writing credit that allows you to strengthen your writing ability without writing significant numbers of papers.",
