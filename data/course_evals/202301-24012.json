Short-medium essays.\r\n\r\nYou also learn how to write an outline for your papers, which was super helpful for me.",

Weaknesses: having two essays due during the last week was a little intense - one could have been earlier. Also, I really appreciated when lectures went beyond the readings rather than summarizing them, and would have appreciated even more critical reflection on the readings.",
                "I think one of the strengths is the course instructors, they all had a variety of knowledge that added depth to the class. I think a weakness could be that sometimes the readings proved difficult to engage with.",
                "This course was very well done. I think the material was presented in a good order, building in complexity as the semester went on. I also thought that the incorporation of both theoretical and real-world material was useful. The guest lectures were also interesting. One thing I might change is the pacing/style of assignments. Having two papers due close together at the end of the semester was a little more challenging. I think I would have preferred three slightly longer assignments so I could have given more focus to each.",
                "The course had great material and structure however I felt that there could have organized assignment wise.",
                "I struggled greatly on assignments, even when meeting with my TA, I continued to struggle and could not get a grasp of the course information.",
                "Strengths: Essays are good, not too hard, and have outlines. The outlines were super helpful  PLEASE keep making us do them. Lectures were interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Chetana was a fantastic TF, but section is section... Also, the essays were super packed at the end. The class would be better if we were only given a week for the outlines and did the essays earlier. Too much essay at the end.",

                "Yes, it is an excellent introduction to what comparative governments at Yale are like. The course was designed really well and allowed for easy engagement with the course material.  Despite the class being engaging and interesting, the 4 papers and weekly reaction posts make it a non-gut but enjoyable class. However, all the instructors and TFs were super supportive and helped me work through the ideas that I had during the class.",

                "Yes I liked it",
                "I would recommend this course if you're willing to engage with the professors. Before getting to know them I was not spending much time with the course materials and the essays were very difficult to write. As I opened up more and asked for help on my writing, I actually came to enjoy doing work for this class. The movie essays are especially fungreat excuse to watch a classic movie and interact with the class material in a flexible way.",
                "Yes! Extremely interesting topics every week. Super cool readings. Well organized course. Very helpful professors. Overall: crucial perspectives and insights on some of the most important topics to anyone interested in polisci/global affairs/debelopment work/epe/history (or anyone else). Take it!",
                "Yes, but only if you are interested in this topic as I found that the class was very focused. I enjoyed it because I was curious about this topic, though I wish we could have had one class on just looking forward, to discuss if state-making is even possible in the current state of the world.",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in comparative politics or want to be whet your appetite for academic political science, this is an excellent class. If you're just interested in understanding governance and the state, it's also very interesting. Makes reading the news much more interesting too.",
                "I am a sophomore, I felt this course would have served me well with prior knowledge to the political science department. Therefore, I would not recommend this class to underclassman, especially if one is not focused in the political science department.",
                "I would recommend this class to people that appreciate a very structure course as the instructors do a really good job of structuring the workload for this class so that its not too stressful.",
