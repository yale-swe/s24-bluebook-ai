One of the most important skills I learned was conducting research effectively. The course required me to identify credible sources, synthesize information, and analyze data, which helped me to improve my research skills.",
                "I developed a lot of insight into the world of academia (research) as well as industry (internships, entrepreneurial work).",
                "I gained more research experience, although that was just from doing research and not anything particular to the structures of this course. I also learned a little bit about how to give a 3-minute pitch, the resources available through OCS and Tsai CITY, intellectual property, and grad school, from various panels and guest speakers in the class.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: relatively relaxed, allows you to focus on your work.  Some of the guest speakers are really interesting. \r\n\r\nSome of the classes are on how to get a internship but they are at the end of the spring semester when it is too late to get one. Having these in the fall would be more helpful.",
                "This course did a good job of being hands-off. The research was primarily driven by the student and their advisor and the professor was mostly just there to provide a loose structure. This is helpful as the class is supposed to be focused on the student's individual research and the time spent in the class does not detract from that.",
                "WEAKNESSES: I received essentially no feedback to help me improve as a researcher. There were very few assignments in the course: a prospectus, a midterm report, and a final presentation. For the written assignments, we were given written instructions but little advice on how to write them, and the assignments were graded with no substantive comments. For the final presentation, we were given barely any instructions, and the only feedback was one or two questions about the content, and nothing about the delivery. I think this class could be improved by focusing a lot more on how to write and present well, and by giving us more extensive guidelines and then feedback on the assignments we do have. I also think it would be good to have more regularly scheduled check-ins, to make sure everyone is on track.     \r\nSTRENGTHS: I liked some of the guest speakers and panels, especially those on grad school and on OCS.",
                "strengths: we got to choose what we wanted to get out of the course and focus on those things, the course didn't assign much work that took away from my actual research, I really liked seeing what my peers were up to and learning more about different fields on engineering research\r\nweaknesses: the meeting time was a little inconvenient"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student but I would be sure that there is a specific reason for taking the course. Research is a long process so be sure that it is something that is ACTUALLY achievable in a semester of work where there will always be something pulling you away from this self-paced class. It will probably be something that is much smaller than you actually think is doable. Dream big, but also please be realistic or this class will not be fruitful.",
                "If you have research that youre planning to do anyways, and you want to get a credit for it, then yesthats what this class seems meant for. If you want to learn about research, such as how to write about and present scientific topics, then noyou wont be taught much about that in this class, and youll hardly receive any feedback on your writing or presentation skills. If youre doing it for your senior project for the non-ABET degree, then only take this course if you think your lab will provide all the structure and guidance you needthis class wont provide much of either.",
                "Yes. This course is a great opportunity to get credit for working on your personal project.",
                "I would highly recommend this course because it let me spend more time on my research and I learned a lot about communicating my research to other people.",
