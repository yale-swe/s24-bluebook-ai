                "This was an incredible class. Monique curated an extremely strong syllabus that moved historically from around U.S. independence to the present day, thematically from slavery and the beginnings of racial capitalism to the wars on terror\/drugs and U.S. global imperial migration policy and carceral governance. I learned an incredible amount in just a few short weeks, from historical information to new modes of analysis to working with primary sources.",
                "I developed the ability to think a lot more critically about the nuances of race and the way that we often view race, ethnicity and nationality as fixed and predetermined categories, and how this isn't necessarily historically accurate and often can be highly detrimental to minority groups. I learned a lot more than I knew going into the course about migration across the US border by different groups, particularly from Mexico, and I feel that my perspective on US immigration has been greatly broadened and developed overall.",

                "As the course was mostly dominated by students from Indonesia, I appreciate the historical references and contextual insights that were packed very densely into our learnings. I was mostly interested in the insights of analyzing the dynamics in the United States and how each group responded to one another."

                "Strengths: Monique was the strongest discussion leader I've had during my time at Yale, creating a safe but critical space to engage with the course materials. The assignments are extremely manageable and encourage creative and personal expression alongside academic performance; in consideration of the course's deeply personal themes, I think this offered the best way to engage with the material. Timely grading with useful feedback. The readings were selected extremely well and Monique often offered additional readings for interested folks, as well as introducing other materials in course discussions and presentations that strengthened class discussion and challenged us to interrogate our own biases, knowledges, and conceptions about race, immigration, science, and power. I wish this class could be longer.",
                "advantage:  relax and enjoyable class atmosphere; reasonable workload; the supper nice instructor; creative final project.\r\n Just one advice is  that it will be nice if  some examples are offered.",
                "Strength: communal, active based discussion.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lack of discussion feedbacks at times.",
                "I loved how densely packed each meeting was with the contents we were discussing and adaptable to the students. I believe it can be improved by more students participating more actively."

                "I could not recommend this course more, particularly if Monique Ulysses is the instructor. This is a highly specific history course in many ways, so it's useful to have a survey lecture or even APUSH and some knowledge on the last 50 years of U.S. history; however, but it's not entirely necessary because Monique was often willing to provide mini-lectures or some general background prior to discussion in class. In many seminar courses, it often feels like the professor is doing all the talking or that there's not a lot to say about the materials. This class is the complete opposite. You can literally keep discussing, even without generalizing to other historical moments or themes (even though this does usefully happen a lot), about the readings for the entire duration of the class. I learned so much.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Monique is a very passionate instructor who clearly cares greatly both about the complex subject matter of the course and the wellbeing and intellectual engagement of her students, and I found the weekly readings and topics very interesting (if occasionally emotionally challenging) and varied. The course was also very well-paced for a summer course and I did not feel rushed or overwhelmed by the content covered in class.",
                "YES!!!!\r\nI love this course!!!! This course is even fridendier to those who are not majored in History or other Art majors.",
                "I would, especially for international\/visiting students who wanted to know about dphow the diversity in U.S. was formed and nurtured.",
                "Yes, it is a very crucial course to understand the formation of United States as a society and is a course that could encompass a wide array of topics which would also mean the discussions might not be as deep but are very straight forward and widens the general idea much better."

                "I'd like to become someone like Ms. Monique who is able to bring students who lack contextual course understandings to be able to engage. Academic wise, I am more aware in analyzing certain 'why's' and 'how's' that currently shape the American society and United States as a whole. Coming from a diverse country, this knowledge is crucial to understand how a majority-ruling group interacts with other minority groups."
