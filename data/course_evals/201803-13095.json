    "overall a strong course",
    "Strengths = quickly improved essay writing skills, how to analyze books and texts\r\nWeaknesses = quick pace for readings, discussions sometimes slow and texts often not explained fully if struggling to understand",
    "Strengths- The discussion-based format was key in students development (understanding text, their applications, developing ideas, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses- Though we often were given feedback, I felt that some writing fundamentals should be explored within the course.",
    "The atmosphere of this class was one that I would love to replicate for Yale courses across the board. It was a space where I felt comfortable sharing my thoughts about the literature we read, and the small class size motivated me to stay on top of course readings and analyze things on a deeper level so I could contribute. Some of the readings, however, did not always seem to be related to nostalgia in ways that were apparent. However, the class did prompt me to relate nostalgia to many different concepts and see it in the greater context of the world."
