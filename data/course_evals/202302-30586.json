                "I learned how to write about a place with care and attention to detail. The environment (a beautiful village in the south of France, no internet) and the people (the wonderful people of Auvillar, pilgrims, 12 classmates-turned-friends) helped me grow not only as a writer but also as a person. There is something special about being in a space that is so charged with creative energy  I was constantly reminded of just how much I love reading and writing. \r\n\r\nOn a more practical level, I grew a lot as a writer and editor through the writing partner program. I also found our writing as a career conversations/panels very helpful. I learned how to sit down and just write, without having to wait for a stroke of inspiration.",
                "My writing improved ten-fold during this course. It taught me how to cut the fluff and get to the core of things. Anyone looking for their voice should consider taking Personal Geography. It is there to be found!!!",
                "I learned a deep understanding for the world of creative nonfiction writing. I learned to observe the world around me with more care and to think more carefully about little details which make places what they are. I learned a great deal about the craft of writing, navigating the professional world as a writer, thinking carefully about word choices and giving emphasis to every word on the page. I learned to be more creative with my words.",
                "I learned how to become a better writer and what specific career I wanted to choose for the rest of my life.",
                "I learned so much about writing nonfiction--writing about myself, the places around me, and constructing \"place\" in a much more abstract sense. The syllabus is extremely well-selected and frequently updated to span the wide world of travel writing and personal essays.",
                "I learned the skills of place, how to write every day, how to feel like a writer."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This is the most intense creative writing course I've taken at Yale. If you're serious about your craft, it will make you better. Colleen has amassed a monstrous and prolific syllabus; the reading and writing is expansive, interesting, and generative. The internet sabbatical (optional, but higgghly recommended!!) is also an incredible opportunity to (ironically) better connect with yourself, your work, your peers and their work, the town of Auvillar, the people of Auvillar, the places you travel, their personalities, their multitudes. Speaking of which: the people! The places! Likeminded creatives! France! Such a strong sense of community fostered in such a short amount of time. Your classmates and the peer review process are invaluable. Colleen's passion and understanding is inspiring. Emma is perfect.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much, honestly. I think weekend trips could be adjusted a little, just to give a clearer focus on exactly why we were taking them. They tended to feel either hyperscheduled or unnecessary. \r\n\r\noh another strength!! the pilgrimage!!!! such a phenomenal experience to have as part of a study abroad.",
                "Strengths: beautiful village (and the warm community of Auvillar), incredible food, weekend trips, writing partners (and just exchanging writing with friends in general!), Emma, internet sabbatical, apprenticeships. Colleen is also a wonderful professor who clearly loves teaching and is very open to feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We produced a lot of writing throughout the course, and towards the end of the program it definitely felt like the feedback we got on our pieces was significantly less in-depth. Maybe the micro/macroessay submission timeline could be tweaked to reduce the daily reading load? Additionally, although the syllabus has been updated to include more diverse voices, it sometimes felt like we did not engage with those pieces as deeply. I really appreciated our discussions about the shortcomings of traditional travel writing, and I hope that future classes will continue to challenge the genre.",
                "The class was very, very strong overall. Wonderfully engaging seminars, an engaged instructor, interesting readings, creatively interesting assignments, lovely trips, and much more. The class does an incredible job at making all writers really dedicated to their words and to the community around them. The class is very rigorous in the best way, in that it forces all students to immerse themselves in daily assignments. I was extremely happy with how the course turned out.",
                "Professor Kinder needs another course aid to help her with grading essays. thirteen daily two page essays as well as twenty six weekly five to seven page essays is far too much for one person to handle. As a result, even though professor kinder was powerhousing her way through all the essays, the feedback we received on our long essays was not entirely thorough. Personal Geography had another course aid in the past to help with grading the short essays and holding office hours. This should happen every year.",
                "A huge strength of this course is Colleen! She is a wonderful professor and advocate, and she did an excellent job guiding seminar & shaping the group dynamics more broadly. She picked an excellent syllabus, kept discussions lively & involved, and left little room for lulls or awkward silences in class. The location is also a massive plus--you get to experience summer in the south of France! Truly a once in a lifetime opportunity.",
                "Writing constantlyyou will, by necessity, begin to feel more comfortable with the act of simply sitting down to write/revise. There are very few opportunities to write at this volume with the structure and accountability of a Yale course.",
                "The pace of the course is really intense. With the incredibly intense work load, it being a new and foreign place, and being away from family and support systems it could be a lot at times. I think a lot of students at times (my new friends!) struggled with mental health during the trip. It felt often like too much, and with weekends being occupied with trips, and evenings with writing and continuous socializing, it was hard to find time to rest, and make sure the body was receiving proper care! That being said - it was a truly magical experience. Delving into the culture of Auvillar, the friendships of the others on the program, and the written page."

                "Amazing. Must do this study abroad. You simply MUST!",
                "If you're wanting to tackle nonfiction in a serious way, challenge yourself and your relationship with words, write and experiment and write some more, this is the course for you. If you're looking for vacation, free time, school-less summer: not so much. I'd especially suggest the course to someone who's interested in the sabbatical: willing to disengage from the internet and fully throw themselves into word work in Auvillar. If you seriously carry a torch for creative writing, for surprising yourself and pushing boundaries, absolutely take it. It's illuminating and engaging and hard work and so much fun. Do not take this class if you're doing it for the credits (they're kind of a fun bonus).",
                "Absolutely. I also highly recommend leaning into the internet sabbatical, if you are able to.",
                "Hands down. It's the perfect opportunity to focus on nothing but your craft for a month. The results are marvellous.",
                "Most definitely! What could be better than spending a month in France developing your writing skills with an inspiring group of students and a great instructor? I would recommend the course to anyone looking to improve their nonfiction writing skills, whether or not you have extensive writing experience. The course will give you the tools to explore the world through a different lens.",
                "I would. I loved my time in Auvillar, and my program was a completely unique way to immerse myself in writing both in terms of workload and community. It was a wonderful experience that I'll treasure forever.",
                "Yes! Truly could not recommend this course more. You will meet incredible people, travel to beautiful places, and watch your writing improve in the course of weeks. Colleen and Emma are the perfect people to guide you through this experience, and it will truly change the way you think about writing & learning more broadly.",
                "Yes! Overall a great experience, not only for the course and its writing aspects but also for the travel and cultural enrichment opportunities.",
                "I would recommend, but with the emphasis that it is a super intense program and to make sure to have supports going in. Especially since a lot of the writing can be very personal. And when writing about trauma - that is intense! It didn't always feel like there were supports set up in the program to help students through this. Professor Kinder is very kind when approached, and will work with students individually who are having a difficult time, so I would really encourage students to utilize that, and make the course work for them!"
