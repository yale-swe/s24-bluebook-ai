                "I learned so much about the way we view sex and gender in society through a very intersectional lens that included race, class, and social status. I thought this course served as an excellent introduction to WGSS, Sociology, and American Studies; we moved through a lot of information but in a very logical and interesting way. It was clear that Prof Almeling put a lot of thought into the structure of the class, and I thought starting the syllabus at the basics of these principle ideas of sex\/gender\/race\/sexuality and ending at the end of a life cycle was very clever.",
                "I learned so many cool and interesting things about our society and how we deal with sex and gender. From learning about female athletes with high testosterone levels to college campus culture, we covered so many genuinely interesting topics. This class opened my eyes not only to how sex and gender affect our society, but also how our society affects how we define sex and gender over time.",
                "I learned so much about the world in the class and how things are socially constructed.",
                "I learned SO much from this course! While I certainly gained some pure knowledge about the world, I'd say that the most valuable thing I gained from this class was how to think about and discuss the things I already knew. You'll often hear people say, \"Gender is a social construct,\" but you rarely get a full explanation for that concept, and thinking about how we've constructed gender throughout the life course and in the context of intersecting factors like race and class was really enlightening.",
                "Broader knowledge of sociology as a whole",
                "Learned a lot about gender norms and constructions that I hadn't learned of before.",

                "Definitely learned a lot about how sex and gender are interrelated and socially constructed. Learned how to conduct interviews and surveys for research purposes and learned a lot about the intersectionality of gender, race, class, etc.",
                "an overarching survey about the history of sex, gender, and sexuality in the US.",
                "This course equipped me with new perspectives of viewing the society from the lens of gender, sexuality, race, class and all the intersections. It also taught me about important sociology methods and important findings.",

                "very interesting to see how these gender constructs have been created",
                "I learned the difference between sex, gender, and sexuality.  I learned that sex and gender were once seen as one and the same. Sex and gender then became accepted as biological and cultural, respectively. Sex and gender today inform and reinforce each other. I learned about how sex and gender intersect with race, politics, medicine, business, employment, and households. I learned to re-evaluate my own assumptions and my own life. I learned how to be more compassionate. I learned how to be a more aware and informed young adult.",
                "understanding of the importance of sex and gender in society and the roles that they play",
                "A broad overview of sex and gender in society with a heavy focus on sociological research methods",
                "I learned a lot about how gender influences different aspects of society. I also gained skills when it comes to conducting interviews and surveys and using them to contribute to my research. Finally, I improved my writing when it comes to research papers.",
                "I developed knowledge, skills, and insights into the study of sociology - its methods, processes, terminology, goals, and impacts. Likewise, I broadened my understanding of the various roles and implications of sex and gender in society, and the intersectional ways in which gender affects our lives (all throughout our lives) in immense and often inequitable ways.",
                "I didn't really develop any kind of knowledge, skills, and insights by taking this course. It was very basic WGSS knowledge, which is definitely what the course was advertised as. I think I learned a couple fun facts though.",
                "I learned to assume a gender perspective in my analysis, as well as to understand how gender is formed. I also learned about different sociological methods of research and analysis.",
                "I was able to educate myself more about the genders and sexuality. At a time like this, it is important to make yourself aware about these topics and be considerate of other people's gender and sexual identity and I think that this class has given me the opportunity to do that.",
                "One of the biggest things I learned in this class is how to view the influence of macro vs. micro and how they influence one another. The research skills I learned throughout the course helped me have a better lens for looking at social issues and how they are interweaved with race, class, and gender.",
                "The concept of intersectionality stuck with me all throughout the course. Prior to it, I had no idea what it meant, but now I can pick up examples of it my daily life.",
                "I learned a foundation\/overview of the history of gender studies\/theory and the different waves of feminism, as well as a close look at a number of modern\/topical\/diverse issues, and the long-term final project taught me how to conduct a interview\/survey study and write a sociological paper on my research.",
                "I learned about the history of women's rights as well as intersectional issues like race, class, and sexuality. This class was very informative about all kinds of inequalities, past and present, that impact people in the U.S",
                "I gained a greater understanding of the way in which societal beliefs shape our world. I also have a better knowledge of social movements. For example, we learned about the feminist movement.",
                "I learned so much about how gender interacts with every crevice of society.",
                "This class developed many different lenses on many views on sex and gender in the world and the way it has developed over time.",
                "I absolutely loved this course! While the overarching theme was sex and gender in society, the course allowed me to engage with various concepts like intersectionality, inequality, and social constructionism. I learned how to think about concepts in a flexible manner, probed to look at issues through multiple perspectives\/lenses. Had I not taken this course, I would have never looked at sex and gender in the way Professor Almeling does in her lectures.",
                "Learning how to truly write a sociology essay for a beginner was a major skill developed in the course. This course also taught me how to think and question the world around me without immediately giving my opinion. That was a key learning. Throughout the semester, we delved into different sociological concepts and different types of gender inequalities. I feel as though we covered every important aspect of gender inequality that I can think of.",
                "I gained the ability to think critically about gender and how it affects people's lives. I learned how to conduct a sociological interview and a survey. I also learned relevant history regarding: medicine\/science, intersectionalism, gender scholarship and activism.",
                "interesting and illuminating readings and data presented in lecture about gender-related phenomena and biases in the modern day I hadn't considered before",
                "The construction of sex, gender, race, and sexuality and the cultural beliefs that uphold these constructions and potentially break them.",
                "This course has taught me the general topics of sex and gender. I've learned how society has socially constructed the meanings of sex and gender by looking at sex and gender through various aspects from the family aspect to the social aspect. We've looked at sex and gender and their intersectionality to race, income, and socioeconomic access throughout history to analyze how they are socially constructed by the society in place.",
                "It was fascinating to approach the most basic elements of American society from a technical, fact-based sociological perspective. That approach to understanding humans and their establishment of social norms, constructions and inequalities is extremely valuable.",

                "I learned a lot about sex, gender, and sexuality. It provided a great new perspective on how to view modern issues and does a nice job of including information on how sociological research is conducted.",
                "Intro to sociological research.",
                "I learned about core sociological concepts like the social constructions, intersectionality, and more. We learned about how concepts of gender influence society including science, parenting, and crime.",

                "Strengths: it's a great introduction to social sciences and gender studies, the grading is fair, the material is interesting, and it gives you a good foundation in methods. Weaknesses: I think this class would work better as a seminar, I got much more out of section than I did out of the lectures",
                "I thought this course did an excellent job presenting a nuanced view of all the topics we covered. Prof Almeling was incredibly knowledgable and made complicated topics understandable while linking them together as we learned.",
                "Strengths: Professor Almeling is passionate, kind, and a great lecturer. No weaknesses. Amazing class. I loved the structure, assignments, and material.",
                "Strengths: The readings were all very interesting, and Professor Almeling is so kind! She was always willing to work with us and was very conscious of the pandemic, both in terms of precautions and in terms of the stresses it put on students. I really enjoyed getting to do some small-scale sociological research for my final paper, and the way Professor Almeling structured her course made that research very accessible to people who may never have done research before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My friends were bothered by my referencing this course so much!",
                "strengths: interesting content\r\nweaknesses: disorganised, too many assignments, lectures not very content rich or helpful (not enough structure or content on slides etc)",
                "Strengths: Topics are very interesting and well taught\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the discussions and assignments feel very high school. Very simple and intro.",
                "Sometimes it felt like the lectures did not cover much material at all; I could watch the recorded lectures at 2x speed and get just as much out of it.",
                "The lectures and readings are outstanding. The professor and TAs guide you through every step of the paper-writing process. Honestly no weaknesses to speak of!",
                "strengths: assignments build up to final which was very helpful; conducting original research was really cool; manageable reading load\r\nweaknesses: as with any introductory survey course, lectures were very very broad though it was good to get to focus on a personal interest through research paper",
                "It's easy. The course readings are usually very straightforward and not hard to analyze or understand. If you have any familiarity at all with gender, sexuality, sex, class dynamics, race issues, etc even just from lived experience, the vast majority of the course will not be new information to you. This might make a lot of the lectures and readings not particularly interesting, but for the most part they're not terribly boring either so that's a plus. The (two) quizzes are also very simple assessments that essentially test whether or not you understood the lecture's general concepts. The major project throughout the course is also not difficult as long as you do not procrastinate. Choose a topic of research that interests you, it works wonders with motivation. Don't worry too much about the academic research (or sources) itself as the paper will mostly require the general concepts you cover throughout the semester and even then it is more broad concepts rather than specific articles\/authors\/research. \r\n\r\nOne of the major issues of the course is its incessant failure of transgender and genderqueer experiences. The readings are often extremely outdated and so are incredibly traditional, heteronormative, and binary in their discussions of gender and sex. This is carried into lectures by Professor Almeling who often tries and fails to be inclusive and use language that does not reinforce the gender binary. This is all especially disappointing considering the nature and content of the course which discusses the many problems and inaccuracies of the gender binary and the social construction of gender but still reinforces the binary nearly every lecture.",
                "Strengths were how the readings and the lectures coincided and were always very interesting. There was also a lot of support in terms of the assignments due.",
                "strengths: This is a great course for someone with little background in the field. It's very accessible and provides a great onramp for folks new to the fields of WGSS and sociology. Furthermore, the reading selections are wonderful and students of all levels have a lot to learn from them.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: This course is far too easy for someone NOT new to the field.  As a senior in ER&M, I found the course a bit too easy and not challenging enoughI relied heavily on the (really great) readings to teach me.",
                "The lectures were engaging and digestible. The sections for this course weren't super useful to understanding the course better. Basically, if you did the readings, the sections are only there to get participation points.",
                "Weaknesses: we could have had a little more guidance about how to conduct the final paper",
                "Lots of readings, but the lectures do a good job describing them and their connections and sections also help.",
                "The lectures and readings are genuinely interesting but are extremely surface level. Discussion section was definitely a weak point with poor engagement and questions that leaned towards normative opinions rather than empirical ideas. The best part of the course was when Almeling covered her area of expertise: medical sociology which was more in depth that other parts of the course. I wish the entire course was centered around this topic.",
                "Strengths: Professor Almeling cares a lot about students and it is clear that she puts a lot of effort into lectures, lots of opportunity for feedback, the research paper is a great opportunity to gain experience conducting qualitative research, super manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the TAs werent great, a few lectures could have gone more in depth with the readings and course themes",
                "Great survey course, loved it!",
                "The best thing about the course was its readings. Professor Almeling picked really engaging, powerful pieces that corresponded directly with her lecture material. This is probably the only class where I have been so excited about completing the readings, despite the fact that some of them were long. The professor and TAs have also been very understanding and accommodating about assignment deadlines.",

                "The strengths are the breadth of topics covered that are so essential to understanding how sex and gender intersect with race, class, and other institutions in our lives. The weakness was that I felt sometimes topics could be explained much more succinctly or concisely to allow more time for questions and\/or other topics.",
                "lectures can be a bit dry, feels like a lot of slide reading\r\nWorkload isn't too bad, all builds toward the final paper",
                "Strengths: teaches exactly what it says it'll teach\r\nWeaknesses: is a very introductory and broad overview",
                "I thought the strengths of this course were providing a broad overview of gender as it relates to institutions and individuals. Another strength was that the course was taught through an intersectional lens. I thought one weakness of this course was that the lectures could have covered more material. I feel like we never went really in depth in class and I wish I could have taken more away from the lectures.",
                "I really loved this class! It was very engaging and extremely interesting. It should stay exactly the same.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it was very well organized and full of information. The professor and TFs are very intelligent and great resources for learning. There are no weaknesses that come to my mind.",
                "Strengths: Workload, interesting subject matter, in general, easy class\r\nWeakness: This class was filled with contradictions. The professor would say birthing people (instead of women) but would also say blacks (instead of black people). Professor Ameling also created an unwelcoming environment by yelling at students for minor things like drinking water in an extremely hot room or arriving late to an empty lecture hall",
                "The class could go into more depth about the content in the readings.",
                "It focusses too much on specific cases than in general, grand ideas. I would have preferred to learn about more theory of gender as opposed to gender being applied to different scenarios. The Professor is amazing, however, and she delineated a history of sociology that helped us understand the points the readings were making.",
                "I find it very helpful that the lectures were recorded. I think that the course readings were focused more on the white community instead of having an inclusive background.",
                "Almeling was very engaging; her lectures wouldve benefitted from more information on the PowerPoint slides. It makes filling along a bit easier.",
                "One of the strengths is Prof. Almeling's sensitivity and attention to the well-being of her students. She used careful attention to the language in talking about gender, gave trigger warnings in advance for sensitive topics such as SA and police brutality and made those readings\/lectures optional, and throughout the semester was very generous with extensions\/grades\/deadlines and even reduced the page count of our final paper. \r\n\r\nThough we covered a broad overview of topics, I thought the readings in each unit covered very specific, diverse, and intersectional issues. I would highly recommend checking out the syllabus for Fall 2021 if it is available. Some of those readings include:  commercial surrogacy in India, \"a study of household decision making in Black, lesbian stepfamilies,\" a study of single black mothers on welfare, \"How Transmen Make Gender Visible at Work,\" and more.",
                "Good lectures, good content, discussions sections could be a bit more structured",
                "I thought the lectures in this course were fantastic. However, I didnt find the assignments particularly engaging. Perhaps having a few shorter ones responding directly to our readings and lectures would be useful. I also think there could have been better instruction provided in regards to the final assignment.",
                "Please make the final paper shorter as a standard, people are tired. Also, this class needs to do more work with Indigenous perspectives and perspectives of Gender from the lens of POC and not just people observing POC and marginalized communities.",
                "Less pages for reading",
                "I loved the content and structure of this course. The assignments were well planned out and it allowed students, no matter their level in sociological thinking and research, to engage with and produce content. The lectures were always recorded and made available online which allowed for flexible learning, especially during the uncertainties that came with COVID-19. If anything, some of the readings felt a little redundant and unrelated to the lecture content, so it might have been better to mark them as optional.",
                "The major strength of this course was that it was constantly engaging despite the fact that it was a large lecture. I rarely found myself getting distracted or feeling bored. The only real weakness I can think of is that I wish we had spent a little more time talking about the reading during class because I did not always feel like the homework that I was doing translated to the material we covered in class.",
                "strengths - interesting readings and topics, weaknesses - lecture went quite slow sometimes and the class didn't always feel intellectually engaging. not as much of a historical basis in the information presented as I would have liked",
                "The discussion sections were great. If someone struggled with a concept or needed flexibility\/support, Professor Almeling was very accommodating and helpful.",
                "It's taught by a cis, white, straight woman...",
                "Strengths of the course would definitely be how relevant the entire class is to modern day society. It discusses topics that are able to interconnect to the everyday lifestyle we are so use to today. A weakness is that the class is only an introduction class and does not go truly very in depth as I would want to see it.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TFs were great! This course was a good overview of how our society interacts with gender and sexuality. You get to do your own sociological research and pick your topic for it, which I found made the class more interesting because I could apply what I was learning in class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: We never went super in-depth with anything. This is an intro level sociology course, so some of the stuff seemed surface level. This is great if you have never studied anything related to gender or sexuality, but if you have a good idea about how gender\/sexuality play a role in society, then I would take a different class that focuses on a specific topic related to gender & sexuality.",
                "Strengths: Amazing lectures, organized well around course concepts \r\nWeakness: I wish my section was more engaging",
                "Strengths: great readings, lead to interesting discussions in section. Weaknesses: lecture was pretty straightforward. Didn't feel like there was much new information outside of the readings.",
                "Strengths: lectures easy to follow, interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: more engagement needed",
                "Strengths would definitely be the course readings; some of the course readings were very intriguing and I believe that was what kept us going with the course. There's also a lot of engagement in class despite it being a lecture, so that's also fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: more office hours with the instructor.",
                "I think overall the course was great. The instructor was excellent, resources were easy to find, and the structure was very engaging. I don't really have anything negative to say.",
                "A strength of the course was Professor Almelings teaching. A weakness was that it felt like most of the articles were historical. Some historical articles were appreciated, but more recent articles also would have been appreciated.",
                "Strengths are the professor and how organized the course is. Weaknesses are that it's a bit low engagement.",
                "This class is a great intro level for students looking to learn more in the WGSS, ERM, or Sociology fields. There was support to learn how to write a sociological paper, and discussions challenging notions of sex and gender. It does cover similar things of a lot of other WGSS and ERM courses on campus, not too in depth, but on a broad level."

                "Yes, I think it's a good introduction to social sciences, the material is really interesting, and the professor and TFs are all really knowledgable.",
                "yes very intresting.",
                "YES take this class! One of my favorites I have ever taken. Amazing teacher, material, culture.",
                "Absolutely! In fact, I've already recommended this course to many of my friends, and I've been paying it lip service all semester. It's a wonderful introduction to sociology and especially to the sociology of gender. I came into this class thinking I understood how gender is socially constructed, and I left with an entirely shifted viewpoint. While my fundamental beliefs about gender are unchanged, I now have a much more nuanced understanding of gender and feel far more prepared for discussions on how gender and society affect one another. This was definitely my favorite class of my first semester at Yale!",
                "yes if you want to learn more about sociology as a whole. Not a very specific class",
                "Yes, I would suggest you take if you aren't a WGSS major bc the topics are very basic but interesting. If you have prior knowledge in the area I would not take.",
                "It's a good fifth class - not too much work, some of the readings are interesting",
                "Absolutely! Amazing course that totally changed the way I think about institutions, relationships, and individuals along gendered lines. Prof Almeling is a wonderful lecturer and readings were excellent. My TA was also awesome and the sections were super engaging. The paper was also super fun to write and work on. On top of this, because the course faculty really break down and help you through the entire paper-writing process, the course workload feels quite light. Loved this class.",
                "yes as a fifth class or if you need it as a requirement\/want an intro to sociology. if you've already taken higher level wgss or er&m courses the content might not be engaging",
                "Yes if you want a low effort course. Absolutely not if you're generally interested in learning more about sex and gender or if you find the idea of reading \"foundational\" takes on gender that are incredibly outdated too exhausting. In that case, take a different course in WGSS that is actually taught by a WGSS professor.",
                "Yes! You will learn a lot and be able to think critically of how gender affects everyday life (it really does!)",
                "This course is excellent for providing fundamental readings, so I do recommend that other students with no prior knowledge of the topic enroll in it. This course may feel repetitive for those who already understand these concepts, but it's supposed to be an Intro course, so that's not the professor's fault.",
                "Yes, I will! This is the topic that affects all aspects of life and needs more learning and attention.",
                "Yes, I would",
                "Yes. It is a good introduction to sociology and the examples used in class make it very interesting to apply the knowledge learned.",
                "No. There are better WGSS classes that can give you an introduction to sex and gender in society.",
                "Not really sadly. I thought this course would be one of those unforgettable Yale courses and it was disappointing.",
                "It's an easy fifth course and I'm not sad that I took it. However, I went in with high expectations and wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is hoping for more than an overview of sociology.",
                "This is a really great introductory course, especially for first year students! Professor Almeling works really hard to make both herself and the course content accessible. The course is very well structured and the inequalities explored are incredibly important, but if you already have a background in any sort of feminist theory or have taken a similar course you may want to consider a different class. Would also be a good fifth class.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, this is a wonderful course that will teach you to look at the world at a different way. You practice looking at societal issues through the lens of sex and gender issues but also how they intersect with other actors like race and class. The class truly gives you a more layered understanding of issues and what things are the way they are now.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class because the topic is very important for everyone to learn.",
                "Yes, important topics were covered and the content is very interesting",
                "yes  workload not very high and content is pretty interesting",
                "Yes. This is a fantastic course to take to become a more culturally aware and informed individual.",
                "If you are looking for a relatively chill class that has relevance to modern society then yes. Not the best lectures you will ever go to but definitely not the worst",
                "Yes. If you do the readings and go to class, which isn't necessary to receive an A, you will get a lot out of the class. \r\nIt made me consider becoming a WGSS major.\r\nThe material is all very interesting and having it synthesized into the structure of this class is (even if a student knows a lot of the material) a class worthy of your time.",
                "I would recommend this course for another student whose interested in gender studies or sociology. This course is perfect for a student who wants an introductory course.",
                "Yes! Definitely. It was an amazing class.",
                "Yes, I found this course very interesting and thought provoking. I wish I could take it again and continue to develop the insights I gathered this semester. I left nearly every lecture wanting to continue the discussion.",
                "Yes, I would recommend because the class is definitely introductory and would be great for an easy A if it's not introductory for you. Even though I loved to hate on the class it was my favorite class of the semester.",
                "Yes. The material taught greatly widens your perspective on everyday situations and is well executed.",
                "Yes",
                "I would if theyre interested in sociology and its methods. I think the course is a great introduction to the discipline. If the student is interested in more philosophical and ideological conceptions and theorizing of gender, i wouldnt recommend it as much.",
                "I would recommend this course, it is a good introductory class.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great introductory course that anyone interested should take.",
                "I have already reckoned this course to my peers. The workload was manageable and the material was engaging.",
                "Yes! As an introductory WGSS class. (My friend found it sometimes repetitive of gender theory\/history of feminism she'd studied in other classes.) I thought lectures provided me a great overview while the readings also dived into enough specific topics that I have a lot of leads and insights I'd love to pursue more in-depth in future classes.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in gendered and racial issues, this is a very good intro course.",
                "Yes! I think this course was great for expanding ones understanding of gender and other social categories. Its also a great class for anyone interested in sociology as a potential major.",
                "Its really interesting, and I think its a great start to unpacking gender.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of their major or area of study. This class truly shifted the way think about sex and gender, and I think more people need to take this course! Professor Almeling was an incredible lecturershe always made the lectures engaging and concise.",
                "Yes. This class was extremely impactful to my Yale experience. Whenever I called home I would talk to my mom about what we were learning. The course load was very fair and I always felt the support of my professor.",
                "I took this course because I was interested in sociology, and it was really helpful. I found all the readings quite interesting, and the lectures helped me to understand the importance behind them. I also really liked how discussions during section were structured, and found it to be more useful than the lecture.",
                "Yes. This course was an excellent introduction into the field of sociology, and we covered many important topics through a deep analysis of history, literature, and science.",
                "Yes, it's an amazing class. It quietly changed my whole relationship to gender. It's a panoramic survey that involves histories of science\/medicine, examinations of queer relationships, discussions about workplace dynamics, etc.but the real strength of the class is how it makes you think about gender in the context of power, and allows you to reimagine the role you'd like it to play in your life. It's honestly just a very clarifying experience, because it shows you how things you've been told 'are just that way' can be changed. Which is very freeing. There are so many messed up ways that gender\/sexuality\/race have been used to ruin lives, but there are also so many ways that they can be points of community and strength and this class does a good job balancing these realities.",
                "Yes I would.",
                "Absolutely! The content discussed in this class is wildly interesting and have managed to make its way into daily conversion with friends who also have taken this course. The readings are quiet heavy, but the content within the readings sometimes make up for the amount we have to read per week and the professor is very accommodating when it comes to deadlines during the pandemic.",
                "sure, if you need a social science credit or are new to the material. for someone who's taken wgss classes in the past, lecture could get a little boring but I liked a lot of the readings",
                "Absolutely! The readings are very interesting and you learn a lot. The research project allows you to focus on your specific interests, and its a great entry project for sociology.",
                "The content was good, but a cis, straight, white educator should not be teaching this course.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is a simple course that does not require too much, but the information that is taught is extremely relevant and has taught me things that I have never thought about before or knew before attending this course. Everything I've learned is in my every day life. I see all the topics in real life, and it effectively has a good message and inspires me to look at life with an open mind. Sex and gender is something that we often take for granted today, but this class has taught me how to truly dig into its meaning and its implications. The way we socially construct these topics influence the everyday lives for everyone from the micro level to the macro level. I truly think this is the best class I've taken this semester.",
                "Yes! Even as someone who rarely takes classes in the social sciences, this course was so universally applicable to every aspect of life, especially in understanding how real structural and statistical information can inform beliefs about the way to fix things.",
                "Yes - to get intro sociology experience in an organized\/focused way - if youre interested in sex and gender.",
                "Maybe. Interesting readings and low workload. Section was the best part because we could discuss things. Lecture seemed really straightforward and like I already knew a lot of the info from being an observant member of society. Maybe would recommend the seminar version of this class instead of a lecture. It was still semi interesting if younger looking for a more chill social sciences credit.",
                "Yes; great intro level sociology course",
                "Absolutely! This is such a good course that I think everyone should take at least once. Love how the most basic terms are deconstructed beautifully.",
                "Absolutely. Even if you aren't interested in sex or gender, this class will change the way you think and view the world.",
                "I very much enjoyed this course and I thought it was very interesting.",
                "yes",
                "Yes! It provides a great and clear understanding of how gender influences so many aspects of our society and how we're raised.",
                "Yes, for an introduction to sociology course this is perfect!",
                "I would recommend this class to a student who is looking for an intro of WGSS or ERM, whether that is a younger student, or someone outside of those fields of study. I wouldn't recommend this class to a student who has taken some classes in either of those departments, because many of the readings are repeated from other classes and it becomes redundant."
