If you do the readings and really engage with them, you can get a lot from this course. I think some of the readings (in particularly the small world readings, the 'bowling alone' readings and the readings on degree and betweenness centrality) changed how I see the world.",

                "The class represents a very interesting, rigorous, and easy-to-follow introduction to social network analysis. From my point of view, the course is following this good trend: we first learn through lectures and readings about the theoretical concepts (such as small-world networks, centrality as power and status, structures as role systems, etc.), and then we have hands-on assignments or projects, based on those theories, that we solve using powerful social network analysis software (e.g., UCINET, R, or Pajek). The course successfully established social network analysis as a distinct and robust social scientific paradigm. I gained an appreciation of its potential to offer novel insights into various sociological issues, from community cohesion to political activism.",
                "This class greatly enhanced my ability to create and understand networks, especially in relation to various sociological concepts. By the end of this course, I  was confidently able to look at large data sets and create adequate networks to represent them (or specific attributes within them).",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - small class size, very detailed assignments and expectations, helpful Professor, lot of feedback and scope for improvement\r\nWeaknesses - 2 hour classes sometimes felt a bit long and could be shorter or bi-weekly instead",
                "The strengths were the professor - Professor Smangs was a super nice professor who was very willing to work with all the students.",
                "I think that one of the strengths was giving us time to really think about the material. With a few targeted readings every week and the opporunity to do reading responses, it was one of my favorite ways to learn new material - self-motivated, on the whole. I think that maybe the single session on the Thursday can be quite long and it can be difficult to make sure you concentrate for all that time, but having a break in the middle of it really helped.",
                "Strengths: Smngs is a very nice, personable professor who truly wants us to succeed, and his passion for his work is truly palpable. This was my first sociology class ever and Ive learned quite a lot about social network theory, as well as using social network measures to manipulate data in UCINET. This class also was not very stressful and heavy!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although Smngs is a great dude, he is not a great lecturer. The pacing of this course was not great, it felt very slow and boring during the almost 2 hour long lectures. And yes, lectures. Although it is a small seminar and we are required to submit discussion questions, we never had discussions. Therefore, my engagement was pretty low and I got by without doing more than the 4 readings that I was required to do for my discussion questions.",
                "The \"Social Networks and Society\" course excelled notably in providing engaged and supportive instruction, with the professor offering detailed feedback and extra explanations that greatly facilitated learning. The practical and relevant nature of assignments, rooted in real-world data, showcased the direct applicability of social network analysis, enhancing our understanding of its significance in various contexts. Additionally, the personalized feedback and the opportunity for extensive office hours were instrumental in deepening our grasp of the material. The collaborative community fostered among classmates further enriched the learning experience.",
                "I think this course could be improved simply by meeting more times a week. While one dense session of learning a week could be beneficial for some, I felt that our classes were too few and far between for some smaller concepts to adequately stick. I think another session a week (so, two short sessions instead of one big session) could greatly enhance my ability to engage with the course.",
                "Amazing professor - very welcoming to all students and their needs. Made classroom environment very welcoming.",
                "Strengths: a structured introduction in to social network theory allowed students to gain a solid understanding of the field and what exactly it is. Assignments were clearly laid out to facilitate the student's learning and lessen stress, which allowed for a more open discussion during the seminar.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the assignments and grading breakdown changed than what was advertised, which had to do with a greater number of students taking the class than expected (for example, the class was too large to do presentations, so there were more assignments). The software used, called UCINet, is not available on Mac OS, which means that students with Macs had to use alternative methods such as Python or running it on a VM.",
                "Professor was highly engaging and really helped walked us through difficult materials.",
                "Weaknesses: Some readings were hard to find or access online.\r\n\r\nStrengths: The professor was able to describe the courses material clearly and in detail.",
                "Strengths -- The professor is very engaging and willing to help with all assignments and final papers. This makes the course load not intimidating at all. It is also a great beginner class into networks and makes for an excellent 5th class. \r\nWeaknesses -- the software network can be a pain to use if you have windows but free trails for window parallels make it easier."

                "Definitely. This was one of my very favorite courses that I've taken at Yale so far. Dr. Mattias Smngs leads very engaging discussions for a very interesting syllabus with an interdisciplinary nature that applies to all areas of society. You will end up seeing everything through the lens of social network analysis, thinking of power and influence as more robust and applicable concepts in any given scenario.",
                "Yes. Learnt new concepts and social network analysis softwares. Professor was really helpful - wanted you to learn and do well in the course. Readings were quite manageable and interesting.",
                "Yes! A perfect Sociology seminar to take that doesn't require much work throughout the semester and has a very nice professor.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! I learned so many interesting things. It was really fun.",
                "No unless it was taught very differently",
                "Im not sure I would take this course again, but maybe its because I am just not interested in sociology? This was a guttier class though, and a very easy social science credit.",
                "Absolutely, I would highly recommend the class to other students. The course offers a comprehensive introduction to social network analysis, blending theoretical concepts with practical applications in a manner that is both engaging and intellectually stimulating. The professor's dedication to providing detailed feedback and additional explanations significantly enhances the learning experience, making complex concepts more accessible and understandable. The skills and insights gained from this course are not only academically rewarding but also have the potential to be beneficial in a wide range of professional fields. For these reasons, I believe this course would be a valuable addition to any student's academic journey.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student interested in the various methodological approaches social scientists apply to sociological phenomena. While the focus on the sociological concepts was definitely not as pronounced as I had expected, the methods you learn to graph data and the significance those graphs have on effectively analyzing social trends is extremely pertinent to sociology in the modern day. I feel that it's a great tool to have going into the future.",
                "yes definitely if you are interested in sociology!",
                "I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in learning about social network theory as a concept, and not necessarily the technical aspects of it.",
                "Absolutely, both new and challenging for me. Yet very helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in network theory and its applications in the real world.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting course especially for introducing network analysis and phenomenons around it -- influence, status, spread; and the various mechanisms networks distribute information."
