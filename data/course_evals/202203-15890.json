            "comments": [
                "The weakness is letting kids that took calc BC take the class and teaching knowing that they have.",
                "They definitely need more peer tutors at office hours. There were times when office hours would get really crowded and there were only 1 or 2 peer tutors available, which was really inefficient. The grading of exams also did not provide good feedback if you missed a question. There is also an extreme inconsistency of teaching quality across the various sections, so if you get an instructor that doesn't teach well, you're pretty unlucky and will have to do a lot of learning on your own, whereas if you get an instructor that's really great (like Rachel, the course head), then you will be much more prepared for exams. Another weakness is a lot of the busy work assignments. In addition to the PSETS, there is some busy work (e.g. explorations, learning strategies, etc.). Although they usually only take an extra 10-20 minutes, they are pretty unnecessary, but they are good buffer points. One of the strengths are the review sessions that are offered in preparation for the exams.",
                "There were times when this class felt long and it moved too slowly. I would have like it to move slightly faster and to slow down when students had questions.",
                "I think there could be more individual help because it felt pretty generalized but it was helpful to have scheduled reviews with different teachers before exams.",
                "A major weakness of this course lies in the fact that each section is taught by a different instructor. This means that there is a wide range of teaching styles and consequently some students are at an advantage if they have a professor whose teaching aligns with their style of learning. \r\n\r\nA strength of this course is the peer tutoring as it is available practically every day of the week, meaning help is always accessible and available.",
                "The step by step walkthrough of the topics was very helpful and allowed me to gain insight on the true nature of what we were studying. Perhaps more in class review of example problems could be helpful.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed the way the classes themselves were organized, especially around exams - there were lots of resources provided to ensure students were prepared for them. However, I think the classes could be more consistent. For example, I thought that Rachel's worksheets were very useful when learning the material, but I know that not all the sections utilized them.",
                "The problems sets could be weighted more. It feels like they dont matter to your grade and yet they take multiple hours a week.",
                "This course provides each student with plenty of assistance throughout the semester. I appreciated the nightly peer tutor sessions, the pre-exam review sessions, and the availability of professors during office hours. One way in which the course could be improved is if additional practice problems with an answer key were provided for each lesson so that students may receive additional practice throughout the semester or an answer key to the problem sets once the deadline for the problem sets have passed (at the moment, the only practice we can do with an answer key is the practice provided right before an exam, and if it is possible to practice with an answer key to check our understanding throughout the semester that would be great).",
                "It was a fun course however some of the topics were slightly difficult",
                "The class instruction felt very estranged from the homework and exams.",
                "cj was a very good teacher, it could be improved by making office hours more accessible and by getting rid of explorations",
                "I thought it felt a little disorganized at times, and like the pace at which we covered topics was inconsistent",
                "One strength is the course director, Rachel Diethorn, who gave tons of information and was an incredibly positive and helpful course director. One main weakness was the individual section teachers  Although I see the argument for grad students teaching because it allows for smaller sections, I would have preferred one big lecture with a better teacher. It would be great to maybe have an option between a bigger lecture and smaller seminar classes (like how the economics department sets up their intro level classes). I though another big weakness was the amount of true and false on the exams. Though I understand that true and false questions are easier to grade, I thought they accounted for way to much of the final exam (one exam had 4 questions each worth 5\/100 points), especially since they dont take any partial credit.",
                "Strengths: small class sections, taught at a fast pace",
                "This course has a significant amount of assignments. Psets every week, yet they only count for 10% of the total grade. Majority of your grade hinges on exam performance. Your level of engagement with your course is impacted by the strength of your instructor. From my experience, I ended up going to other sections taught by Rachel Diethorn as her teaching style was significantly more beneficial to my learning compared to my assigned instructor. If you have a choice in section preference, choose professor Diethorn.",
