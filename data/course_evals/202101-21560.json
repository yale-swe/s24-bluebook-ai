                "This course is very relaxed and you have the possibility to learn about topics that may be interesting to you. The only drawback is that we had to present three times throughout the semester, and the presentations could be on pretty complex topics.",
                "Listening to 1.5 hour presentations over zoom was very tough. It would have been much better in person.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed that the course was student-led.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Bergemann is an amazing professor. He's crazy smart and well-accomplished, but also very friendly and approachable. He always seemed very attentive to our presentations and made an effort to interject his own expertise. He also suggested we meet in-person for the last class and brought us brownies for it! Dr. Lindenbaum was also really solid and a super smart individual. He definitely cared significantly less about the class though. It was nice having a course second semester senior year with all my fellow econ\/math majors. I really enjoyed the fact that there was a separate econ\/math section -- it felt like I was seeing all my peers for the last time. The class also has a super manageable workload (three presentations over the course of the semester) and the grading is thankfully super generous (which is really welcome after a tough major). Lastly, I LOVED the textbook. Very clear and thorough yet not overwhelming. The textbook was the right size and difficulty for the class. I felt like I could understand to some degree all the concepts I had to present on.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The whole structure and premise of the class. Truthfully, this class sometimes felt like a waste of time. \"The present three times over the span of the semester\" format led to the following: no engagement for 12 weeks and a ton of work for the 3 weeks one presented. I genuinely had no idea what was happening the weeks I didn't present. Further, all my peers are really smart, but it was tough for us to present on material we were neither particularly passionate about (this isn't our thesis) nor particularly knowledgeable about. We ended up basically regurgitating what the textbook said. Lastly, the discussion posts every class were unmanageable. Most courses have a discussion post once a week which I think is much more maintainable. Because we were supposed to do one after every class, no one did them in general. It's tough to put effort into writing one (and read an outside paper) for every class session.",
                "The course is very relaxed and low pressure. The student presentations were good, and so were the discussion posts. The readings were usually interesting as well!",
                "The course would have been much better as an in-person seminar. The discussion post assignments were mostly fruitless.",
                "Each student presented a topic from the textbook with a partner several times, and everyone was encouraged to write a discussion post on each topic. I learned the most during my own presentations. I did not really enjoy the discussion posts, but I appreciated that our professors recognized our difficulties towards the end of the term and indicated that we did not need to catch-up on ones that we had missed.",
                "Pretty chill and tends to be interesting.",
                "Strengths: Everyone gets to present a few of the topics from the book, which helps facilitate conversation in class. By the end we were are chums. Weaknesses: Textbook does not provide much mathematical depth and feels a little outdated.",
                "Having this sort of broad survey of topics is honestly very wonderful. At first it felt a little elementary but towards the end of the course it was nice to see things fit together and talk about modern research on those topics in the discussion posts. I also enjoyed researching the topics and finding papers by Prof. Bergemann and how he's really impacted the fields we were studying."

                "It is a required econ and math course. I would recommend it anyways as it is a pretty relaxed environment where you learn a lot of interesting concepts. The class is also quite small so you become quite close to the other students.",
                "I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but it's not the worst required course in the econ\/math major. It's honestly not the most fruitful class and you will probably take away very little but that can be fine senior spring. If there was an alternative or I was able to substitute the class for something (even if it was more challenging), I probably would have. Overall, the \"student presentation\" format of the class isn't really productive to learning. Truthfully, this class sometimes felt like a waste of time. \"The present three times over the span of the semester\" format led to the following: no engagement for 12 weeks and a TON of work for the 3 weeks one presented (don't underestimate the amount of time it takes to put together a class-length presentation). I genuinely had no idea what was happening the weeks I didn't present. Further, all my peers are really smart, but it was tough for us to present on material we were neither particularly passionate about (this isn't our thesis) nor particularly knowledgeable about. We ended up basically regurgitating what the textbook said. Lastly, the discussion posts every class were unmaintainable. Most courses have a discussion post once a week which I think is much more maintainable. Because we were supposed to do one after every class, no one did them in general. It's tough to put effort into writing one (and read an outside paper) for every class session. \r\n\r\nAt the same tine, the course is low workload -- three class length presentations and discussion posts every class for the whole semester is not bad at all (especially because people really stopped doing the discussion posts). The professors are also very generous with final grades and I think most of the class received A's. I appreciated this because it showed how considerate the professors were about our virtual energy levels at this point in our Yale careers. It's also VERY uncommon for econ and math department professors who tend to ignore the outside world\/state of the world when setting expectations. The professors themselves are really dope and are just a great energy to be around senior year. I wish they would have been more involved in presenting material in class as I know they were both incredibly knowledgeable. Dr. Bergemann in particular was super approachable and kind and seemed genuinely engrossed in pour presentations even when no one else was. He also brought us brownies on the last day of class. \r\n\r\nAll to say, this class won't change your life but it is not a bad way to round out a really challenging econ and math major. I will say: there should be an alternative to this class. This class fell at the same time as two other classes I have desperately wanted to take since my first year at Yale but had never gotten into previously. When I asked the DUS, there was literally nothing I could substitute for it. It's not a productive enough course for that to be true. I could understand if this was a more core theory requirement.",
