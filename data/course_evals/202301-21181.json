The communication was also a little difficult during the course; due dates were only communicated during class, but it wasn't too big an issue. A few of the seminars also weren't all too engaging as it was mostly the professor talking for the whole 110-minute slot.",
                "This was a leminar, meaning Professor Siu spoke for almost all of it. I would have preferred more time for us to engage and discuss, perhaps by having students present on the readings at the beginning of class",
                "The last few weeks could use more in-class discussion on the readings.",
                "I think there could be more discussion in class, although I like the lecture part really well.",
                "I enjoyed the content of this course quite a bit, and found the readings engaging and informative. However, I believe this course could be improved by facilitating more active student engagement in the classroom. Right now, the class dynamic feels very much more like a lecture, and in most class periods, there isn't much opportunity for student discussion or critical analysis of the materials. I think I would have felt more engaged in the classroom if we had had a chance to participate more actively."

                "Yes! You learn so much about what it means to be human from taking an anthropology class like this. This class is also fascinating because you learn about Asian cultures from a very different lens than is traditionally applied in Western anthropological studies.",
                "Yes, if you are interested and will be able to start the final paper early. As someone with no background in anthropology or east asian studies, I felt out of my depth at times, though that's somewhat expected from a higher-level class. It's very easy to be disengaged if you are otherwise busy, but if you care you will definitely get a lot out of it. Just be really careful about that final paper; it really becomes an issue if you procrastinate.",
                "I would if they were interested in learning a bit about Professor Sius takes on anthropology. However, she does lecture quite a bit and it can get repetitive.",
                "Yes, the class explores the layers of history behind modern world cities, and for anyone interested in East Asian Culture and Urban studies, this class should not be missed.",
                "Yes. This is a great class for people interested in cultural anthropology, especially with non-Eurocentric favor.",
                "Yes, but with the caveat that it feels a lot more like a lecture than a seminar class.",
                "Yes, great course!"
