The speakers are very engaging, and beyond the opportunity to ask questions during the forum that normally concludes the second half of the webinars\/panels\/workshops, students are commonly provided with their contact information should they want to continue the conversation with the speakers more. While I appreciated the weekly reminders for upcoming events, I think it would be helpful to have a more comprehensive list or calendar with all the events so we could plan ahead to attend specific events, rather than squeeze them into our weekly schedule.",
