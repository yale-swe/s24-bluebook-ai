I also learned a lot about the political, social, racial, gender, and sexuality dynamics throughout the 20 years (roughly 1960 to 1980) we covered in the course. Through the weekly reading responses, I was able to delve deeply into a passage or several passages in the text we were covering that week and explore the ideas that had the biggest emotional impact on me. The midterm paper and final project allowed me to explore these ideas even further. Our class discussions, while virtual, were always engaging, well-paced, and balanced. Honestly, it's hard to sum up what skills I developed--it was just such a lovely course. I looked forward to and enjoyed every single reading and class meeting. There is so much to learn from Baldwin."

Professor Mirakhor puts so much thought into her selections and would change the syllabus based on our conversations.",

A huge strength is definitely Professor Mirakhor, who is a great moderator in discussions, possesses a wealth of info about Baldwin, and offers her time for private meetings with students generously. By constantly pushing me to refine my ideas, she has helped me think and write better."

We were only six students and one professor, and I found this size to be perfect, at least for online learning. We had plenty of opportunities to voice our thoughts in each class meeting. It is one of my favorite classes, if not my favorite class, I've taken at Yale."
