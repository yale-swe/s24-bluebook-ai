The primary skills I developed were researching and familiarizing myself with a lab before conducting it, and then carrying out the lab, taking necessary measurements and completing all of the relevant investigations. I learned how to use equipment such as an oscilloscope, an optical table and a particle accelerator. Finally, I learned how to present the results of the labs in a thorough lab report, and I learned how to analyze error.",

My ability to synthesize experimental processes and results into a concise report was improved dramatically, and my understanding of several phenomena in physics was improved in the way that only carrying out hands-on experiments can cause.",

            "comments": [
                "Fun and interesting experiments (at least, the ones we chose; there's a few that are notorious for being on the more difficult side). There are a few experiments that require a LOT of data analysis which really isn't too fun to do. The first few weeks are a bit rough, but you kinda get into the hang of writing a 9-15 page lab report (with pictures) each week, honestly. It sounds bad, but I never really paid attention to page count, they just end up being that long after a night of writing. Overall I think it's a better time than 205L (from how hard I heard it is from other students who took it this semester) because you already have all the data analysis / error propagation skills.",
                "I like that students get to choose the experiments theyre interested in from a big set of possible experiments. This allowed me to choose labs I genuinely found interesting, and made the course a lot of fun. I also think the lab manuals are generally helpful and a good guide to students.",
                "Experiments are very interesting, lab reports get a bit tedious.",
                "This was a very strong course. The biggest strength were the premade lab experiments. There were enough of these to have ample choice between them, and the lab sheets were very well-researched and informative. The principal weakness of this course was the lack of introduction to the equipment. This was due in part to  the circumstances surrounding covid, as I had taken the preceding course, 205L, remotely.",
                "The strengths of the course mostly lie in the lab investigations, rather than writing the reports. However, there are several labs with poor equipment that is very fallible, which can be frustrating. Writing the lab reports is also quite difficult, as there are a lot of skills that not everybody has that are not taught. Also, there are no office hours that I knew about.",
                "Strengths is that in order to do well you have to know what you are doing but that can also be a downside.",
                "Very good labs. Some were a bit too long to complete during the class period though",
                "Most of the labs are set up very well. A few of them have outdated experiment guides that need updating. I enjoyed the rigor of the weekly experiments and reports, HOWEVER, given the amount of time I devoted to this course, it should have counted for a full credit instead of a half credit. In-lab time was 3 hrs per week most weeks (the same as my full credit classes) and the lab reports took anywhere from 5 to 15 hours, depending on the level of data analysis required. Something I loved about this course was our ability to choose our own experiments; it really allowed me to do experiments that corresponded to my interests!",
                "This course was really well-designed. The lab guides are great; the feeling that the homework is all relevant and meaningful and not contrived whatsoever (as was the case on 205L) is great; my TA, Kirsty Scott, was awesome; and the resources for the experiments seemed top-notch to me. The length of the period to carry out experiments and the pace and the flexibility to choose which ones seem interesting -- all great. The only weakness I can think of (and it's really a weakness in my work ethic) is that there's nothing to guarantee that the students have to engage with the lab guide before the lab. So maybe a tiny pre-lab assignment, just some basic questions about the lab guide, a little quiz like that or something, would encourage students to read through the guide before class, and that would help them get more out of the experiment, and make the experiment process more efficient.",
                "It was great to be able to choose certain experiments from a large selection, so you could focus on what you thought was most interesting. The structure and organization was also great.",
                "A wide variety of available labs makes the class enjoyable for anyone. \r\n\r\nThe setup for the some labs can be quite difficult, and I wish there was a bit more support. The workload outside of the class is massive, as most of the labs require their data to be analyzed outside of lab. A little support on the data analysis or a common lab at the beginning of the semester to teach programming and data analysis would help greatly."

                "It's a prerequisite for quite a few majors, but otherwise it's really a fun course! Especially if you get a chill TA and good lab partner. There's really no lectures or material to be learnt besides the background info and theory for the experiments if you took 205L already. That being said, the difficulty of each experiment and lab report differs pretty wildly, there's for sure some lab reports that take drastically longer than some. The selection of experiments (you get to choose your experiments!!) my partner and I went with was pretty great in terms of how interesting they were and workload: \"experiment 1\", charge-to-mass ratio, Planck's constant, digital logic, electric field plotting, x-ray diffraction, momentum conservation, and superconductivity.",
                "I would recommend this class if it is a requirement for your major.",
                "Definitely, it's much more fun than 205L. Especially try to take it with Kirsty, she's awesome.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning how all of the experiments in physics textbooks are carried out. It is a great way to learn how experiments are designed, carried out, and reported afterward. It is also great preparation for future experimental work in physics.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone who does not have to take it for the physics major. However, from what I hear, it seems like this course is more interesting than 166, so I would recommend the 205/206 sequence over the 165/166 sequence.",
                "Not unless you need it. This was a very difficult lab compared to other labs.",
                "Absolutely. Every lab was incredibly fun to complete and the community within the class was tight knit. This was a top notch course; one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! This is a great lab course. Would definitely recommend to any physics major or for that matter any science major who needs lab experience. Excellent tips are given regarding writing lab reports, so anyone looking for a course in scientific writing should also consider this course.",
                "If you've taken the prerequisite 205L, I definitely recommend 206L. You get to do a lot more really cool experiments; you get to choose your own lab partner for the whole semester, and so there's not the uncertainty of whether you'll be working with someone you get along with each week; the workload is much lower than the first lab course in the sequence; and carrying out experiments like these really help you solidify the physics concepts you learn in the theoretical classes.",
                "Yes! Some of the lab reports require a lot of work, so starting them early is important. You have a lot of choice in what you focus on and the work expectations are very reasonable.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as long as they get advice and are careful about their experiment selection on the first day. The superconducting experiment was definitely my favorite and did not have a ton of analysis associated with it.",
                "Yes! The freedom in choosing your labs is amazing and the labs are so much more interesting than those in 205L. And you get to work with Yale's particle accelerator. However, be prepared for the workload outside of class."
