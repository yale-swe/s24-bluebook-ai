                "This course was in some cases good and some cases needs MAJOR revision. I love Professor Dolgova---she's absolutely the sweetest lady and a good instructor, but she is also disorganized in a way that was frustrating. I felt like I was never really sure what to study and what exactly I was learning. Feedback was good on homeworks but not as much on tests and more importantly I didn't feel like I really understood what I was going to be tested on. I wished this course was organized more like Third-year Russian which has a very defined structure. I know that the point of this class is that it's flexible to the students' needs but I would have preferred knowing exactly what skill we were working on at a given time and exactly what vocab I should be studying on a regular basis. Another big issue was the lengths of the homeworks. At the beginning of the year, I spent usually around 3-4 hours on homework 3 times a week which is just too much for a course that's only 1 credit. The homeworks were longer in this class than in Third-year and that was 1.5 credits. The class talked about the length to Irina and she changed it but after a few weeks it was back to being very long again, and often it was very long in a repetitive way which made me feel like I was wasting my time. If I could describe this course in a word, it would be \"messy.\" That being said, I do really love Irina and think she's the kindest human being. I was just often very frustrated by this class.",
                "Strengths - the course is engaging, the material is interesting \r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the work was unclear or at least what was required of students. Grading system seemed quite opaque",
                "Strengths: I like the material, syllabus and pace. And Irina is a fantastic teacher and very responsive. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The homework is hard to keep track of and know exactly what to do. It can be a little last minute.",
                "The main strength of this course is its immersive feeling. Homework takes myriad forms - from watching Russian movies to reading Russian reports on AI developments - and it really puts you in the Russian mindset for its entire duration. This immersion is also effected by the quantity of the homework (there is a lot of it). The professor is also very sweet and kind. The main weakness of this course is probably the lack of organization in the syllabus and class materials.",
                "Strengths: Relative immersion in Russian language; only Russian is spoken in class. Good longer-term focus on concepts and small quizzes to check learning is more conducive to internalizing information. Good feedback on homework and assessments (if turned in on time), and fair grading of assessments (points off only for skills that are specifically being tested). Course can be slightly molded to students interests in what topics are discussed in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could be better organized in terms of information to learn and information about class (what homework is due when, where exams are, general syllabus information). Oftentimes too much homework.",
                "The strengths of the course were the succinctness of the professor in answering questions and explaining specific rules of the language in a way that was not confusing. This cleared up a lot of previous confusion for me which I did not realized had fossilized.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved with more vocabulary recall exercises. I enjoyed assessments with rendering expressions, and there was one instance where we had to recall as much vocabular and construction as possible. While this was not as enjoyable of an assignment, it definitely highlighted areas of focus."

                "Take this course if you need to take this course for Russian major\/RSEE\/certificate, but I would not recommend taking for fun. The workload was high and the class was frequently frustrating.",
                "If a student enjoys studying Russian and is keen to improve their Russian to L5 then this is an ideal course. The instructor is good and the content and class discussions are interesting.",
                "I think it's a great next step in your Russian journey. I enjoyed it more than L5. Irina is wonderful and the class is a lot of fun. Love the movies and scenarios we stimulate. \r\n\r\nIt is a little hard to keep up with the homework, it can be confusing at times, but Irina is very helpful and will work with the class.",
                "Yes, I would. This class is a good bridge from elementary, textbook Russian courses to advanced, literature and film-driven courses. You will get a mixture of classic textbook work and modern movie homework. It is a lot of work, but you will see results.",
                "Yes -- I thought the class was really well-taught and a lot of effort went into crafting the materials (many of which were brand new and tailored to the class' interests) for the students. I know that there were some worries about scheduling\/timeline of the class but I felt that Prof Dolgova made it so that we were never stressed out by grades. She is a really caring instructor, incredibly accommodating, and very very kind. I could feel myself learn and get better throughout the semester, and I had a lot of fun in the class. \r\n\r\nOther than that, it felt incredibly rewarding to be able to discuss \"current\" topics in Russian and to be reading articles and writing about your own reactions to them. Language learning is cumulative, and this felt like things slowly coming to fruition in the best way.",
                "Id recommend this course to students who would like more practice speaking Russian for a broader range of topics, but not for students who would like to learn grammar specifically; earlier L5 courses are better for this.",
                "I would highly recommend that students looking to get the certificate take this course. For me it was more enjoyable to discuss more current Russian culture."
