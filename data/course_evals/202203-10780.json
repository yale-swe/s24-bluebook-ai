                "Taking this seminar was truly helpful in getting exposure and access to the professors in the Cognitive Science program. I really enjoyed meeting other peers in the major, and it was a really effective seminar. It was a very hands-on class that was very open for feedback from the students.",
                "Strength: the people we were able to hear from\r\nWeakness: too long",
                "When people ask about my most \"Yale\" experiences, one of the experiences I tell them about is that in my Junior Colloquim. \"We read CogSci studies by the most talented and prominent professors in my field and then talk to them in class. We get to hear them explain their thinking and ask them questions.\" This course was one of my best experiences at Yale.",
                "The guest lecturers / professors were great and the course was well organized. It was the right amount of work for a half credit course.\r\n\r\nThe course blocks were pretty long and classmates were not really as engaged as I had hoped. This wasn't really a symptom of the course and the instructors, but maybe there was a difference in tone that could be set by the instructor. \r\nEach class meeting was also pretty disjointed from the others, but it made it hard to put anything from the whole course altogether.",
                "Strengths: a variety of topics offered across the semester, introduced us to potential faculty advisors\r\nWeaknesses: not much student engagement\r\nImprovements: could have fostered more discussion, in that half of the class or the last 30 minutes of class was us talking without the visiting professor present, so we could see how it could incorporate into our research more directly. this could also let us know the other classmates more and bounce ideas off of each other. in general, would have liked more student-to-student discussion and interaction, which could have started at the beginning of class with just a conversation and splitting into groups of interest",
                "Strengths: interesting professors, very nice to meet other CogSci majors.\r\nWeaknesses: it's a very long course and sometimes the readings were a little unnecessary. I also wished that the course would foster a bit more of a community among majors -- I know of other departments that are much more tight-knit.",
                "I thought this course was very helpful. Only thing I'd say is to include some more neuro-focused speakers.",
                "Strength : appropriate amount of work\r\nWeakness: class session is too long to stay engaged",
                "Great professors invited to speak.",
                "Strengths: low workload, it's cool that we were able to hear from so many different professors. this class has a lot of potential.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was really boring. the topics presented were really niche within the fields. I wish the lecturers had focused on more general concepts within their fields rather than super specific topics that very few people would be interested in. also, the format of the seminar made it difficult to participate in discussion -- the discussion was more between the students and the lecturer than among the students, which made it hard to stay engaged. I think reading responses should be due at the beginning of class",
