                "The course was a great survey of the period between the two World Wars. I learned a lot about the factors that lead to the rise of Hitler, French and British appeasement, and Stalin. You really get out what you put into the course here; the overall class is somewhat unstructured, but if you are willing to put in the time to do the readings and engage with the student presentations, it's worthwhile. You could theoretically doze off, do nothing and probably still be fine, but it's just not rewarding as a class then at all.",

                "Very informed reading and instructing. Could have had more engaged discussions that encouraged doing the class readings.",
                "Strengths: Listening to Paul Kennedy and the opportunity to do in-class presentations\r\nWeaknesses: the readings are quite repetitive and honestly, there isn't a lot of motivation to do them since there are no required reading responses or anything like that. The only assignment in the entire class is the 25 page final paper, which is brutal at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Professor Kennedy! He is truly the world's leading scholar in this subject matter and his insights are fantastic. He will always make time to see you in his office and for an older professor, he is a fast email correspondent which I really appreciated. \r\nThe presentation style format of the class was interesting (every class 3 students present on different perspectives of the event being discussed that day... for example, the Munich crisis from the perspective of the British, German, and Czechoslovakians). When you were the one presenting I found this was great because you learned a lot about the specific event and nation you were discussing; however, listening to other people's presentations with little follow up from Professor Kennedy sometimes gave you a lopsided view of these historical events. Additionally, every student did two presentations but they weren't graded or anything so you don't get feedback/a grade on what you should do differently the second time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class really has no handholding or structure, for some that's great and for other's it could be a waste of time. The final paper (the entirety of your grade... no really, check the syllabus there is no grade breakdown and no other graded assignments) could use a few check-in points along the way to better aid students to take on such a lengthy assignment (25 pages!). Maybe an annotated bibliography or rough draft for feedback? Additionally, if you aren't proactive with readings, organizing meetings with PK, and staying on top of the work yourself the class kind of slips by before you've realized. I wish I would have put a little bit more into the class, mostly because I didn't realize how loose the structure would be. \r\n\r\nI also wish the class' seminar was a little bit more conversation-based. PK is so fascinating to listen to, but I can probably count the number of times I spoke in our 20-person seminar on one hand, and I was one of the more active students in the class for sure. I'm not even sure if Professor Kennedy knows my name.",
                "More engagement with assignments",
                "Professor Kennedy is a gem. He is so wise and engaging as a story-teller and instructor. He begins every session with a 15-20 min narration of how you got to that day's point. Even if you did all the readings, you still get something new out of it. The student presentation part is also nice because everyone gets to practice speaking and historical argument, but it would be better if a few presentations were in groups. The fact that it is only one paper grade for the class can be intimidating but Professor Kennedy is super helpful."

Professor Kennedy is a great storyteller and is great at advising you on your research paper, but the class itself is really not the most engaging. The workload should also be spread out rather than the final paper comprising 100% of your grade.",
                "If you are willing to be proactive and want to dedicate time to the class, absolutely. PK is such a gem and by listening to him you learn so much. If you want a class that you can also do no work for except one long paper at the end, this is also your class except I wouldn't recommend doing that. PK is such a fantastic lecturer that you should let students who want to put in the work do so. Seriously.",
