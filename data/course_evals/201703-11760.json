   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Exploration of diverse and uncommon vocal repertoire, in this case from the inter-World War period. Examination of vocal technique, language-learning, diction for singers, International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and the personal and historical context of the studied repertoire. \r\n\r\nI believe I improved tremendously in my pursuit of the study of voice through this course, especially through the mindset and approach that Prof. Lalli takes to help us learn the repertoire, which was quite difficult.",
    "In this class, you learn elements of sight singing, dictation, and IPA. Additionally, coachings with Sara Kohane and master-class-style weekly classes with Lalli help you with performance and give you hints and pointers towards personal growth as a performer.",
    "I learned about the composers that we studied and the era that they existed in, both musically, politically, and historically. I learned a lot about diction, improving my skills in German, Spanish, and Sweedish. I also was about to learn some IPA through this practice. I learned more art songs and practiced them with the coach, allowing me to not only build up my repertoire but also improve my technique.",
    "I learned about how to interpret and perform music in different languages and genres. Additionally, getting to hear professional recordings and listen to classmates sing was a great way to further develop my skill set.",
    "This class is a fantastic way to work on repertoire.  You'll be exposed to songs by composers you might not otherwise sing, and you just might find a gem!  Professor Lalli is definitely a gem, so take this class with him!",
    "This class was truly a wonderful experience. I feel like any person looking to learn more about the process of being a serious singer should take it. Being forced to be consistent in memorizing music, and especially non-English language repertoire, is a great exercise. Also, you get a semester of vocal coaching for credit.",
    "I definitely gained more confidence when performing in public after singing in front of the class almost every week this past semester. I was exposed to new languages I probably would never have been otherwise.",
    "I got experience singing in English, German, Swedish, and Spanish. I also became familiar with new composers. I also improved my music learning skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved nearly everything about this course - I felt it was a tremendously productive period for me as a singer, and that I gained an incredible amount of experience from it.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for improvement would be more lecture-seminars and fewer masterclass-type classes. I felt that more could be gleaned from the \"academic\" side of the music, meaning historical context and knowledge of the composer and the general style, rather than having to listen to classmates (who were not always the most competent) two hours, several classes in a row.\r\n\r\nAll complaining aside, this course was excellent and tremendously rewarding.",
    "I don't think anything about this class should change! It's great.",
    "The strengths are the individual coachings with Professor Kohane -- this is where the real learning happens and it's incredibly helpful to get this attention. The main weakness is the class time when everyone is together because I didn't always feel like Professor Lalli gave the most helpful feedback to students (or sometimes just none at all). The important thing about running a class like a masterclass is that when you give feedback to one student, it should be a learning moment for all students.",
    "This course is organized very well and affords one the opportunity to coach both with Sara and Lalli. It is also set up such that one can learn from the songs of all the other students in the class.",
    "I don't really know what could make the class better. It's pretty outstanding.",
    "This class was a great performance opportunity and a ton of fun. We got a bunch of individual feedback which was great."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you're serious about your study of the voice, especially in the \"classical\" (as the word is widely understood) style. The experience I gained, especially in the preparation of text and the necessary attitude towards vocal performance, was invaluable and I plan to take this class at least once more during my time at Yale.",
    "Take the class! Especially if you are interested in performing!",
    "If you're looking to build some repertoire and have individual coachings on that repertoire, then this class is perfect for you. I don't think you will improve dramatically in technique from this course. If you want to work on diction and learn more foreign languages while building repertoire, then this is the perfect class for you. Lalli doesn't always provide the best feedback in class, but the coachings with Sara Kohane can be really really helpful. She's great. Lalli is great too -- he really cares about his students and will be your number one fan -- but he doesn't always give you the best feedback for improvement. He understands how to perform and will help you with that, but Sara Kohane in her coachings will fix all of the nitty-gritty things.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another vocal music student. It's a great way to expand your repertoire and ability in an informative but low-stress environment.",
    "I could not recommend this course more highly.  Professor Lalli is an absolutely incredible person and educator, so don't miss this opportunity to get to know him.  You'll get some excellent rep experience, and the coachings with Sara are invaluable.  It's probably about 15% more work than you'd expect; it says in the syllabus that you'll sing in class every third week, but that's not true - plan to sing every week.  But don't let that scare you, because this class will make you better at learning music.",
    "Yes!!! Take it if you want to take your singing to the next level.",
    "Yes, definitely. Was a lot of fun and prof. Lalli is great",
    "Yes! Professor Lalli and Sarah are amazing! It was so much fun and now I have a ton of new repertoire. It was great!"
