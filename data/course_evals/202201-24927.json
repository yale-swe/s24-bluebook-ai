                "The course was somewhat poorly organizedthe syllabus didn't really have an arc or sense of cohesion to it, and class sessions often felt like they jumped around without relating to each other. Also, we had a small class, but discussion usually wasn't facilitated in a way that encouraged flow. I think the syllabus could be tightened and given more direction so that the core questions of the course could be better addressed."
