I'm grateful for having been able to participate in a space that pushed my own understanding of how design can be a tool for uplifting people and underrepresented narratives and subverting the status quo that has led to their underrepresentation.",

Fugitivity was a new concept to me when coming into the course, and I feel like this class turned my understanding of how to approach the problems we face on its head. I am really grateful I had the opportunity to not only be part of the class, but be part of the community the class helped create."

                "strengths: engages a range of topics and making processes, such as weaving, zines, typography, etc. I also found it an incredibly refreshing and welcoming class space, one where I could discuss identity and spatial politics in tandem with one another. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the hybrid format makes collaboration difficult, and the majority of projects are group assignments. If you're someone who likes to work alone--especially on creative work--this course might feel a little frustrating and hard to fully engage with.",
                "The strength lies in the topics explored in class -- through discussion, guest speakers, and student presentations. Because the class included a cross-mingling of people from different schools, backgrounds, and ages, the conversation was all the more wide-ranging; each session allowed students to gain a strong understanding of various viewpoints. The format of the workload and selection of groups was also successful for the most part, pushing students from Spitzer and Yale to work together, each bringing varying approaches to the same material. That said, the number of group projects was at times difficult to balance. There are logistical constraints in working across geographies -- even if just between NY to NH -- which is made all the more burdensome when students are following different school schedules. Aside from issues with collaboration and pace, the workload -- readings and mind-mapping notes, written responses after each module -- at times resulted in my disillusionment with the course.",
                "strengths: compelling and culturally relevant subject matter & readings , enthusiastic and caring instructors, creative deliverables, intercollegiate, unique pedagogical approaches\r\n\r\nweaknesses: early meet time, group assignments difficult across schools bc of unaligned academic schedules, final project timing inconvenient for finals week, perhaps too quick of a turn around on some of the projects?(not sure abt this point, but just remember wishing i had a bit more time to invest in some efforts, though i believe the fast pace was an intentional decision)",
                "I have no complaints. This class was great.",
                "This class pushes you to think creatively, and is grounded in the fact that it is centered around project based learning. Dissolving the boundaries of the institution this class connects people between different schools, and facilitates deep collaboration that is directly connected to utilizing the content you learn. I think the one weakness I could think of would be the need for more time. Often the class was rushed by time limits, which didn't allow for people to present when expected to, and prevented us from covering the entirety of the planned curriculum. Otherwise, the class was amazing."

                "While I enjoyed my classmates and the professors, I felt that this course was too disorganized to get a solid grasp on. The feedback during criticss was often very confusing and detached from the project that was presented. I found it a little frustrating at times, but it was overall a good space to be a part of during the semester and especially at the YSOA.",
                "Yes, I think the value of the conversations from the professors, students, and invited guests alone serves as a worthwhile addition to both college and graduate studies. More courses like Fugitive Practices -- taught by Black, Brown, and Indigenous practitioners and academics -- should exist in institutions of higher learning.",
                "yes because it was in many ways unlike any arch class i have taken in a positive way, it brought me out of my comfort zone which was a considerable intellectual challenge in itself, and really asked us to challenge our thinking",
                "YES. This was the best class I have taken at YSOA and it was wonderful to see and feel so much diversity amongst the students. I was hesitant at first about the hybrid format with the other school involved in this class, but I think it actually elevated the class discussions. I really enjoyed meeting students from CCNY. Curry and Jerome were great, they were very involved in class, gave invaluable feedback on the projects and created space for everyone to engage in very important issues - topics which are rarely, if ever discussed in other YSOA classes. \r\n\r\nThere needs to be many more of these classes at YSOA. This was a great class - thank you Jerome and Curry!",
                "I would recommend this course enthusiastically. It was a true joy to take, and I learned so much. I am really proud of the work I was able to produce individually, and with my classmates. And I feel like this class will push anyone who takes its understanding of the world."
