In addition to perspective drawing, figure drawing, abstract drawing, mark making, ink drawing, subtractive and additive drawing, etc., we also had the opportunity to learn about different artists and their styles ranging from Michelangelo to modern/contemporary artists.",

It was a little discouraging at times to be one of the only beginners in a \"Basic\" Drawing class, but I understand that there's only so much you can do when selecting people through Instructor Requests during registration period.",

Weaknesses: some in-class drawing time was converted into critique time, and we would also sometimes run out of time for critiques near the end."

If you are struggling to fulfill your humanities/arts (Hu) credit or want to take a fun (and very different) course during your time at Yale, this course is the one for you. It doesn't matter if you've never drawn in your life before. I was a total beginner and took away so much!",
