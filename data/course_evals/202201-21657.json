                "I learned a lot of representation theory, as well as a smattering of other topics including Cayley-Dickson algebras, knot theory, elliptic curves, and hyperbolic geometry. In terms of skills, I learned how to prepare and deliver multiple math lectures, particularly how to give enough background appropriate to the audience while allowing myself enough time to present the main results. In terms of insights, I learned that I do not want to do pure math for the rest of my life.",
                "Was exposed to a wide range of math topics some of which I found very interesting. Presented a topic over 2 lectures, which was an experience I had not ever had before - it was very fulfilling and just a cool thing to do.",

Most students will understand that this (learning how to give a two-and-a-half hour talk) is the real purpose of the class and will give excellent informative talks that are a pleasure to watch and give a taste of a new part of math that is most likely beautiful, fascinating, and something that you have never seen more than a passing glance of. Other students will not give this class its due diligence and fall flat on their faces in a spectacle that is terrible to behold."

            "comments": [
                "I enjoyed the structure of the class, which involved every student preparing and presenting a week's worth of lectures on a topic of their choosing and then giving feedback to other students' lectures.",
                "Strengths: It is by design a fun and relaxing course, and it's very nice to get the chance to present for the other students. The topics are all super interesting by design and it's really fun to get to learn and present, and the professor is kind and understanding for students with all different backgrounds (even if it should be clear what the prerequisites are; it came up a few times that many students didn't know complex analysis, which is fine since it's not a required class for the major). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Naturally in a course such as this, the different knowledge levels of the various students will be pretty obvious and might cause some issues. I was aware of various students expressing discomfort at this and questioning the purpose of this class as a result. A big problem is also that there are huge differences in the amounts of preparation that students put into their presentations. That is inevitable in such a relaxed class. Perhaps there could be a better feedback system built in, wherein a student gives the first half of their presentation, and before their second day, gets some feedback in order to improve.",
                "Strengths: I think this course gave me the opportunity to take a deep dive into an area of mathematics I had never seen before and see a lot of other cool math from my peers in the math major who I've known my entire time here. Also, the experience of writing up my lecture notes was my first experience in writing a large-scale math paper, which was cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course was poorly organized. There were no deadlines, so the timeline of when we were supposed to have our lecture notes ready and return feedback for classmates was confusing. It ended up being a lot of work reading and giving feedback to everyone's lecture notes crammed at the end of the semester, since Professor Frenkel didn't impose deadlines to space it out throughout the semester.",
                "I think its a really good course for what it is. It doesnt promise to be detailed or in-depth on any topic, but it has a lot of breadth and its really fun to listen to your classmates lectures. Also, the sense of community is nice.",
                "Overall, this course offers a lot of flexibility for the students, which is its main strength. However, there were a few structural weaknesses. I think the course could be improved in two main ways. First, since the math major has many paths toward completion to allow students to focus on the topics that interest them the most (which is great and should not be changed), not everyone comes into the seminar with the same mathematical background. As a result of this, there was sometimes a wide disconnect between what the professor or the student presenting a topic assumed everyone else was familiar with and the truth, which I think made it harder for the presenters to present, and of course for everyone else to follow. I think this could be improved if, at the beginning of the course, the professor collected a survey from the students about which classes they had taken/what topics they were familiar with (regardless of what the professor expects). This could then be consolidated into a list of background topics which presenters can assume the audience is completely familiar with, partly familiar with but would need a quick review, or needs to be explained entirely. This would have aided in both lecture preparation and the smoothness of lecture presentation. My second recommended improvement concerns the material covered in the course, given that it is all student presentations. While I understand that one can take either the math/econ seminar instead or take this class a different semester which has a slightly different topics list, it is mostly understood that the math/econ seminar skews very strongly toward econ and scheduling or other constraints might prevent a student from taking the other math seminar. Therefore, many (I would guess most if not all) students in the class are not taking the class because they are most interested in the topics assigned to this course (e.g. for this semester, it was \"Groups in Math and Physics\"), but rather because this is their only chance to complete the major requirement. Given that it is a senior seminar where students are supposed to present a topic which interests them and capstones their journey in the math major, I think more flexibility should be given in allowing students to choose their topics. For example, if a student wants to do their presentations on Analysis or Combinatorics in a way which does not discuss groups, this should be allowed. I think showing students the beautiful diversity that math has to offer is the most important take-away from this course (and indeed the major itself), and that is simply impossible to achieve if every topic must be discussed from the lens of group theory (despite it being a wide-reaching field). Moreover, for those who have not done math research or will not be going to math grad school, this course functions as one of the only times to formally invest oneself totally in a math topic, and it's hard to get that experience if you don't feel that you have agency to choose the topic which interests you most. If students work on topics which they find the most interesting, they will naturally invest more time and energy into the research and preparation, and the lectures will be better overall. If there is concern about tying together the disparate nature of a wide variety of topics, I think the order of topics could be more carefully decided such that similar topics occur together and there is still a sense of cohesive flow.",
                "This course gives a lot of freedom to its students; the point of it is to quasi-independently put together a two (some semesters four) lecture series on a topic in group theory of your choice. However, there are other parts of this course that could have done with much more structure. For instance, each student is required to turn in a set of lecture notes that everyone else is supposed to read and return lecture notes on. The first couple of students were allowed to turn theirs in a bit late, but then everyone else was supposed to turn theirs in the week that they gave their lectures. However, this did not happen  the first couple of students turning their lecture notes in a bit late cascaded into everyone else turning in their lecture notes sometimes over a month late and over half of the lecture notes being submitted in the last 10 days of the semester. Hypothetically, this would have meant that everyone would have been required to read over 100 pages of math in the last week as people were preparing for finals, but fortunately the responses were organized even more poorly (I did not receive responses from about half of the class), and it seems like Professor Frenkel probably did not care, so I guess that this is fine as long as uncertainty does not stress you out? Also, *please* give practice talks to know what you do and do not know how to present and to make sure that you will actually be able to fit your talk into the time that you have and do not awkwardly have to end in the middle of a proof of some lemma. You can really tell who has and has not given practice talks; it is painful to sit and watch as the latter group struggle through. Build in an extra 15 minutes for people asking questions, Professor Frenkel interrupting you constantly, people coming in late, etc. Also, it will be assumed that you have taken 310, 350, and some type of representation theory before taking this course. You really should have taken 310 and 350 at some point in time if you are a math major; if you have not, do not take this class. If you have not seen representation theory, then you are like most other people in the class, but you might want to read up a bit on it. I guess that all of this goes to say that the weaknesses of this class are mainly ineffective setting of expectations and organization of assignments by Professor Frenkel."

                "The experience of learning a new topic, presenting the lectures, and writing up lecture notes is a good experience, and I learned a lot from my peers' presentations, plus it was far less work than the senior thesis, so I do not regret taking this class. However, if you want to go to mathematics graduate school, the senior thesis is more work but you get more out of it.",
                "Well, its required for the major if youre not doing a thesis. I am not going into math, and I was pretty conflicted about whether to take this class vs. the math-econ senior seminar. Im super glad I chose this one, I think it was much more intellectually interesting than the math-econ would have been and it was just a fun time.",
                "You have to take one of these seminars, and if youre even a little bit interested in group theory, take this course. You definitely need to have taken 350 for this course, and it helps if you have some knowledge of representation theory going in, but the biggest thing is group theory.",
                "If the student is a math major, then trivially yes. If not, no.",
                "In short, yes. Take the other Math 480 if you have not seen both group theory and complex analysis at some level. In long, asterisks. Many asterisks. I enjoyed this course and got a lot out of it. Professor Frenkel is incredibly generous with his time and resources. He will help you work through proofs, discuss the structure of your talks, etc. However, he is also generous with everyone elses time. What I mean by this is that if you are giving your talk, Professor Frenkel will have no problems with having discussions in the middle of your proof either by way of encouraging other students to ask questions (good), making interjections (sometimes helpful, sometimes jumping ahead to what you are about to say, sometimes about how you should restate what you just said by putting the word Theorem in front of whatever you just said), sometimes having you wait for late students to come in, and sometimes having not very quiet chats with a particular student who sat near Professor Frenkel who would rather talk with Professor Frenkel in the middle of your lecture instead of either waiting to ask him after class or asking you who poured your love, sweat, and tears into the lecture that the particular student decided to talk over and was encouraged to talk over by Professor Frenkels behavior. Again, I quite enjoyed the course and got a lot out of it, but in protest of this rude, unwelcoming, and unprofessional behavior by a couple of people who should really know much better I marked the Overall Quality of the class as Poor. (Were I not protesting, I would mark the class as Very Good.) Given the other choices for the mathematics senior requirement (Senior Thesis/Seminar with other professors or the econ department) this is probably the best choice as long as you have seen complex analysis and group theory before. Just brace yourself for an incredible amount of rudeness. I can only write this review with so much candor because I and everyone else in this class will no longer be at Yale next semester."
