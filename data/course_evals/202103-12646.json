                "When you begin to make sense of a reading, there's a great sense of satisfaction. But the material is hard! And sometimes, discouragingly so. Hard to say how much of this difficulty is just the consequence of taking a German critical theory class. I could see this class potentially working better with slightly fewer protagonists \/ critics and a few more writers\/artists  more paired thinking between criticism and art\/literature could be productive, I think.",
                "The professor and TA offered ample office hours to discuss in groups or one-on-one, which was very helpful and appreciated. I also felt as though I gained a background in works that I will continue returning to throughout my life and academic career, and which I hadn't gotten a chance to thoroughly discuss in other classes. I also enjoyed that the class gave me a chance to work somewhat independently and figure out how my own interests related to the course material\r\n\r\nThat said, I felt as though participation was difficult and strained. When I did participate, I wasn't sure if I was saying nonsense, and the lack of response from peers often made me feel yet more confused. I think that part of that was the result of the huge class size. I hope that in future iterations of this course, these issues will get ironed out. Overall, the course was still wonderful and I'm glad I took it!",
                "Would definitely teach in a predominantly lecture setting for the next course! The midterm and final paper writing processes were very well handled, although presentations could have maybe been more focused or interactive in the first half of the course.",
                "This course has wonderful readings with interesting questions. However, as a seminar it was challenging with often dissapointing discussions and unclear directions.",
                "Strength: This course's reading involves materials from many disciplines, such as literature, philosophy, and social science. It benefits students from many different majors. Also, it gathers students from all kinds of disciplines, which makes the class discussion excellent.\r\nWeakness: Some of the reading materials, such as Benjamin's writing, are very hard to understand. I think some introductions for beginners will be helpful.",
                "It did feel like we moved quickly, the class was large so it was hard to get into all the details. The readings are dense, and I do think some sort of supplemental lecture might be helpful. However, Prof. Wetters is really accommodating and supportive, so would definitely recommend",
                "The readings provided a variety of interesting questions to be discussed in class. However, since everyone in the course was at a different level of familiarity with the material (there was a pretty even mixture of both undergrads and grad students in the class), the course could have better supported those who hadn't been exposed to much critical theory in the past."
