It was also nice to have guest speakers come in occasionally.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that you only get to work with your thesis advisor for one semester, in the spring. I think it would have been helpful to have an advisor in the fall, or for both semesters to offer more guidance, which could further lead to having more time to working on a formulated project idea.",
                "I think the thesis advisors should be assigned before the spring. It would've been much more helpful to get started on our projects with advisors right after turning in our proposals in the fall. Personally, I got the bulk of my thesis work done over winter break which is an exception but I felt that other students would benefit from additional time with their advisor.",
                "Pretty cool to see what other art majors are working on.",
                "Strength: regular feedback and helpful professors\r\nWeakness: timing. I didn't really like having class from 7-9pm. The feedback in the group discussions were also not very helpful given students' varying expertise and areas of study.Scheduling time with my advisor sometimes was difficult as well."
