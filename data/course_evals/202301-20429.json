The professor goes over several key concepts repetitively to drill them into your brain. The homework is helpful.\r\nThat being said, the textbook element of the course is slightly painful at times because it is gimmicky, made an excessive amount of mistakes (problematic for student learning), and slowed down the learning.",

It is a difficult course with lots of homework but I think that level of work ensures the student remains semi-immersed in Russian and greatly increases proficiency."
