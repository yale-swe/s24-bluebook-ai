    "I developed the ability to more critically analyze arguments and more clearly understand how various political theorists see the world and approach the question of what it means to be human. I also developed stronger paper-writing techniques that will definitely serve me in the years to come.",
    "foundational h&p",
    "Critical thought regarding readings; Tracing themes throughout texts across eras;  Critical and Moral Thought both about my actions and the actions of the political system in which I take part; Development of comparative arguments across texts",
    "Major works of Western political philosophy from 1500 to the present.",
    "I learned how to not only approach the texts in a nuanced manner (i.e., playing close attention to the arguments and the contexts surrounding the works), but also how to better organize my papers so that the central arguments are clear and each point flows to the next in a logical way.",
    "DS H&P has greatly improved my writing skills and ability to read more comprehensively, effectively and quickly. The seminar-style classes allow us to develop our speaking skills.",
    "I especially learned not just the content of each work we read but also how to engage the works with one another."

   "comments": [
    "This course was taught in such a way that really allowed students to understand each argument presented by the given political theorist.",
    "cutting nietzche, more than 1class on arendt",
    "Weaknesses: often did not effectively grapple with key questions of the texts; instead got bogged down in fundamentally unsolvable details.",
    "The course is very rigorous, which comes with benefits and weaknesses. The final exam portion is the most worthy of criticism, as any quote based examination is asymmetric with the rest of what DS is about and should be reexamined. For instance, the final could consist of more essay questions or there could be a final essay for each DS course rather than a strangely formatted final exam.",
    "Just like all of DS, the course is well organized and has essentially no weaknesses, as they've had 50 years to perfect the structure and timing of the course.",
    "The relatively little amount of time given to each work is a downside but there's really no way to circumvent that. Yet, given the small space of time, I still felt that I was able to engage with each of the works in a thoughtful, detailed manner.",
    "DS as a program is excellent with breadth, but not with depth. That is okay, because it is still the best way to get introduced to western intellectual tradition.",
    "Strengths: really passionate and engaging teacher, content was interesting, readings were hard but doable\r\nWeakness: We went a little too fast through each book, so even if i could keep up with the readings, it just didnt\/doesnt stick in my mind."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. The professor was incredible and I felt I really learned a lot.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with a distinct interest not only in politics and political thought, but who would like to understand the interaction of these topics within the broader strokes of the western canon.",
    "Yes; the books are interesting and engaging and the political questions it covers make for easy discussion.",
    "Yes, but only if they are deeply interested in the subject matter. If one is not truly interested in political thought, then it will be a drag considering the amount of reading and depth of section discussions.",
    "Absolutely! DS is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Amazing books, amazing professors, amazing classes.",
    "Yes, but only if you are willing to do the work and are passionate about the subject matter.",
    "Yes, because it taught me a lot about how to think critically about political structures and see them as inextricably tied to my life, as before I have seen them as separate"
