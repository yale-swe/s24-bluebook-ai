                "The better question is what knowledge, skills, and insights did I not develop by taking this course?\r\n\r\nThis course increased my knowledge of many of the great writers and philosophers anyone involved in academia today ought to know including Milton, Wordsworth, Kant, Blake, and many others. In reading these texts I improved in my close-reading and analysis skills and I feel better prepared to read and digest challenging texts in the future. \r\n\r\nBeyond skills and applications within academia, this course has revealed to me, or at least made me more aware of, the deep necessity for the Sublime and wonder in every day of my life. I am more aware not only of subtleties, but of the power and meaning of subtleties. Of how we are grown and stretched and in desperate need of what is beyond.",
                "This course has taught me the framework of a life worth living, the structure for successful and elegantly straightforward essays, and the multiplicity of a perspective upon any form of art. From the sources that we observed, I learned of dissecting poetry in a way that I had never thought of myself being interested in (Now, I find myself wanting to write poetry myself when inspired!). Professor Soles created a really inviting atmosphere within the class that also taught me to be confident in what I have to say (something that can be very intimidating when coming to a place like Yale).",
                "Close reading skills, connecting and synthesizing ideas from different time periods and contexts, group discussion, essay writing",
                "I had a systematic and chronological understanding of \"the sublime\" through this course. I learned a lot about philosophical and literary theory about the sublime, as well as read many sublime work through poems! I also learned some visual arts theory for the very first time in my life, something I didn't think I would be good at or interested in, but in the end unlock a whole new area for me. We even watched the amazing movie Ghost in the Shell! If you are looking for an interdisciplinary course of literature, philosophy, visual arts and film studies, this is the one! This is also a course that would give you much academic freedom. Professor Soles always gives out amazing thought-provoking prompts and encourage us to creatively apply the theories we learned in class to other context. What's even better is at the end of the course we got the chance to do a creative final project in any format we wanted: creative writing, film, visual arts, mixtape, etc. This is a class that teaches me what is sublime, how is sublime achieved, and why we should study it.",
                "We learned how to close read poetry, philosophy papers, and art critiques while applying our own analysis of rhetoric and judgement to the theme of sublimity, and navigated our own definition of what it truly means to be sublime along the way.",
                "I learned how to better view and appreciate \"the sublime\" in my own life. I also really enjoyed learning about different theorists\/ philosophical thinkers and definitely gained a lot by being exposed to their different views and ideas.",
                "This course has been my favorite course at Yale and has sparked my interest in humanities, english, and philosophy all of which I hope to further explore at Yale. I gained a much deeper understanding of the philosophical, literary, and artistic concepts thanks to the genius organization of the course, it's readings, and discussions."

            "comments": [
                "The course had incredibly interesting subject matter and had a perfect balance between sublime theory and sublime art.",
                "This course is excellent. The breadth and depth of the material, from theory to poetry to art, is excellent. More time might be spent on art, howeversignificantly more time was spent on theory and poetry. Greater analysis of art itself, rather than theory in relation to art, might be helpful.",
                "This course is really amazing at class discussions, and this helps all involved students learn how to build original ideas based on the comments of others. I think this course was really good at not being too overwhelming with essay assignments, and yet, in every essay I wrote, I felt like I was improving\/learning something new instead of being overwhelmed. I would say that this course can improve at including a greater variety of sources (i.e. different art forms or also different origins (Eastern sources))!",
                "engaging content and really interesting range of readings, incorporation of differing opinions and points of view, it felt like we were developing our ability to discuss on an academic level as a class, it was a visible progression throughout the semester and this was very rewarding. Soles was enthusiastic with the content he clearly chose with great intentionality, and the discussions reflected the time he put into making these intimidating texts approachable and useful for first years in particular. At times the discussion strayed away from the texts for a little too long so that we could not cover them fully, which would be one of the main weaknesses.",
                "Strength:\r\n1. First and foremost, Professor Soles is THE SWEETEST professor I met at Yale. He is so funny and engaging and we definitely had lots of fun and inside jokes in class. He also remembers our birthday, he brought us his mom's homemade cookies and many other snacks, and each time I met him for office hour he always genuinely asks me about my life. He is a professor that not only cares about your academics, but you as a person. This class definitely feels like an anchor to me.\r\n2. Professor Riley is an amazing instructor. Some of the reading material can be challenging, but professor Soles always manages to break it down into the most simple language while retaining its meaning. He also gave me tons of feedback that really helped me to plan out my paper and improve my writing. He read my work very carefully and always came up with insightful questions. He is also a very understanding professor, very considerate of situation like being an international student, deadline conflict and stuff. I would definitely recommend any class with professor Soles!!!\r\n3. The curriculum is very well structured. We first learned the theory of the sublime, and apply them to poetry and visual arts, and finally our own projects. Therefore at the end of the class I have a very good understanding of the sublime, and am even able to connect it to the materials I read for other classes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1. This is not really a weaknesses of the class, but I really wish we have more time to discuss and read! Two classes per week doesn't feel enough.\r\n2. The only thing that I think could be improved is that sometimes we read a lot, but we only got to discuss some part in class. Maybe the class could be improved by having a clear discussion outline at the beginning of the class and really sticking to it, and keeping track of time. But overall the class is really great!",
                "The course strengths are that a broad variety of literature types are covered, and class discussion is always engaging and insightful. Professor Soles is incredible at making everyone's voice heard and leading discussion such that we stumble upon answers ourselves. I sometimes wish that we had more time to cover the course material so that we could go more in depth and give the literature the time it deserves, but given that it's a first year seminar with a lot to tackle, I think the course does a great job at introducing us to the world of sublime thinking and leaving us to continue living in it.",
                "strengths- Professor Soles is extremely understanding and accommodating, but not in a way that allows you to \"slack off\" but instead to help you become more passionate about what you're doing. Part of this was understanding that in our essays\/ assignments, for example, he cares more about you learning something new and potentially teaching him something new than just a perfect academic paper that is reciting basic things without digging deeper. He helps you gain an appreciation for the course, the course material, and the assignments. The material was always very intriguing and engaging, I always had new thoughts to share in class and found myself thinking in ways I never realy had before. I also found myself applying different concepts I had explored outside of the class, whether in a different class or just amongst conversation with friends, to ther class discussion. I always felt like my voice wanted to be heard and everyone else also always had incredible insights and things to say, so the the class was really something exciting to look forward to. We also spent some classes outside, which i LOVED\r\nweaknesses- the class tended to go later than the end time, usually averaging 5 minutes over",
                "I believe that this course is truly the best of Yale.",
                "I loved all the texts we read in this class, and I looked forward to writing each of the essays. I think it would have been helpful to try to make more connections between texts, particularly because we looked at so many perspectives on the sublime; it would have been nice to take a day or two at the end of the course and talk about the ways in which things we read at the end of the semester relate to things at the beginning, because the way the sublime appears changes so much between Longinus and Ghost in the Shell."

It is an incredibly rewarding class and I can honestly say my outlook on life has changed because of the content matter, my fellow classmates and their unique insights, and of course Professor Soles. This not only challenged me intellectually but also was very philosophical and fulfilling. I can confidently say that at the end of my time at Yale, this will be one of classes I gained the most from.",
                "Yes. If you are a lover of the humanities, this is a great first year seminar to introduce you to Yale and to teach you about the Sublime.",
                "Yes. This course drastically increased my ability to think both abstractly and clearly, and to articulate that which is seemingly beyond articulation. I think I will always remember this class and all that I gained from the readings, the writing assignments, the words of my professor, my own engagement with the course, and insights from my classmates.",
                "Definitely. I think this course teaches you far more than the title suggests. It extends to the way you view life and reframes how you consider the events and objects occurring around you. On the opposite spectrum, however, I think this class teaches you how to properly incorporate passionate ideas into structured academic essays, in a way that retains creativity and targets academic learning.",
                "Yes to any student who is interested in multiple disciplines, such as English and the Sciences and wants to develop their skills as critical readers and constructive discussers, this course is a very interesting way start that journey without being tied to one very strict area of study.",
                "Yessssssss!!! I would recommend any class with professor Soles. He is funny, knowledgable, understanding, and has extremely warm personality. If you want a class with professor who remembers your birthday and brings you cookies, who makes great pun jokes and enjoy YouTube video like double rainbows, who cares about your life and mental well-being, who can explain Kant's theory so clearly within like three or five minutes, who has so much knowledge about literature, philosophy, religion, and arts, please sign up for any course offered by professor Soles!",
                "I would highly, highly recommend this course to all students hoping to explore what it means to live a fulfilling, sublime life, and how to recognize, or even create, sublimity in our own world. The readings are all valuable and intellectually stimulating, and I can almost guarantee the essays will be works of art the students are most proud of, given the open ended prompts and the many avenues one can take to describe the sublime realm.",
                "yes! you can really learn and gain so much that will carry you throughout college, and the more you apply yourself to the class the greater the gain.",
                "I would recommend this course and any other course taught by Professor Soles."
