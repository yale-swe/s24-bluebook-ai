                "learned about the different field in BME, very insightful",

                "It is interesting for BME majors.",
                "strengths: very interesting guest speakers, tailored to our interests and lots of opportunities to ask questions and learn more about biomedical engineering\r\nweaknesses: some of the guest speakers' presentations were too technical, would've preferred they focused more on their career journey instead of the specific things they were doing",
                "I thought the course was very well organized and that Professor Rodriguez did a great job in lining up great guest lectures that offered great advice!!",
                "Strengths: light coursework fosters career exploration. There's lots of guest speakers-- students, professors, and professionals-- who talk about their work and it was always a treat listening to them. It's a nice break from your other BME classes, as there's not much work and all you really have to do is be present and engaged during the one class period per week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much advice on applying to med school as a BME major. Most of the advice centered around BME research and working in industry or consulting after graduation. I wish they brought in more guest speakers who applied to medical school (not MD-PhD) after their undergraduate studies in BME.",
                "strengths: speakers that came in, the engaging assignments",
                "Strengths: invites a wide range of professors, students and professionals into class to speak with students. Almost all of the presentations were incredibly engaging. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Besides the group orject, I did not feel I really got to know the other students in the class. Would be nice to do more assignments with others or do ice breaker questions or something at the start of class to get to know my peers -- especially bc this is the first time all of the BMEs are really together.",
                "A huge strength of the course was the format of having guest lecturers each week that were often members of the Biomedical Engineering faculty at Yale or other relevant biotech employees. This made the course function like a series of TedTalks which was super engaging and interesting. I came each week excited to learn. No weaknesses!",
                "More inclusion of industry and biotech speakers. I feel like this class was very premed-dominated, and polls throughout the semester reflected this, but I felt that didn't allow for as much diversity within the other applications of bme.",
                "Strengths - Guests were brought in to speak about the various tracks of biomedical engineering. We had multiple panels with Yale College BME seniors and grad/med students doing something related to BME. The class only met once a week. The work was pretty minimal. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The discussion posts were due at 11:00PM because Professor Rodriguez wants to ensure we made thoughtful posts, but I think theyd be just as effective if the deadline was 11:59PM.",

It was super interesting and an extremely light workload (which aligns with its status as a half credit class).
