It's cool finally making sense of the tricks that directors use to establish continuity, and turn a otherwise \"virtual\" experience, into something immersive.",

                "A great introductory course to learning about different styles and techniques across cinema. The screening list is a wonderful selection that exposes students to many genres and directs attention to specific aspects of the medium (i.e. sound, mise-en-scne, genre, etc.). Overall, this is a great course to develop a working knowledge of cinematic vocabulary and basic-intermediate analysis skills that you build upon as the semester progresses.",
                "From the class, I gained technical insight into the filmmaking process and can now identify different concepts learned in the class when analyzing films. Additionally, the class provides students with exposure to numerous highly regarded films, some of which have become my personal favorites.",

It has exposed me to great works of cinema from a great variety of genres and epochs, as well as prominent literature."

            "comments": [
                "This course is a time sink. Be prepared for 2 50 min lectures + 50 min discussion section + 3 hour film screenings every week. It gets a lot. I felt as if I was spending more time attending this class than any other class, perhaps combined. The lectures are fine, but would help if the slides contained a bit more information as opposed to just Professor MacKay mentioning about crucial concepts once and never having the opportunity to revisit it (lectures are not recorded + slides have limited information, just film clips).",
                "No weaknesses, except that I personally did not feel particularly engaged with certain readings/films.",
                "Strengths: there is a lot of meat in the course; the close analysis assignments were genuinely helpful in improving the skills; most of the films screened were at least interesting to think about. Weaknesses: not a lot of variety in terms of accessibility / country / decade in the films, I wish there are more contemporary films or asian / african / south american films; the lectures are helpful usually but sometimes go on tangents that could've been spent teaching us the important materials; the theoretical readings are quite dense and difficult at times, some of them I feel like are too abstract to be good intro materials for students",
                "Strengths: Love Professor MacKay. Really interesting films. Enjoyed attending class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt confused as to the theme of the week and how the films connected to the readings. Felt hard to reach the page limit of the papers given the prompts.",
                "The syllabus is very well planned, covering a wide range of films across different time periods, themes, and concepts. The film screenings in Alice Cinema are so cool, some of the films are displayed in 35mm (not digital) so there is insane picture quality. No major weaknesses, except that there are no recordings and missing a class means you might have to figure out a lot of the content, and a lot of the things that the professor talks about are not elaborated on the slides.",
                "MacKay is a wonderful professor whose lectures are well-planned out and easy to follow. The screenings are around 3 hours long, which can seem daunting, but the great films you'll watch make up for it. Assignments are spaced out with enough time to craft a paper, and there is a lot of freedom around the topics you can write about. I think that is what makes this course so wonderful - the guidance it allows in developing sharp analysis skills while also giving students the freedom to bend those skills to the topics that most interest them in their analysis.",
                "The films studied in the course are generally very good, surprisingly global, and from a wide range of genres. In general, the workload for the course was predictable and not too taxing. However, certain readings were difficult to understand and discussions in section did not help to clarify the author's arguments. Additionally, some screenings were very long, lasting more than 3 hours. Finally, the guidance regarding what to study for the final was very vague. Although, the exam itself was not unreasonably difficult.",
                "A strength is the selection of the films. Theres a wide variety and most are really incredible. Prof MacKay is great but lectures can ramble and be a bit difficult to follow.",
                "Professor MacKay taught a very engaging introductory course that got me excited about taking more courses in the film department here at Yale. \r\n\r\nThere was insufficient storage on Canvas to house all of the video clips and lectures, so materials were purged throughout the semester, making it difficult and stressful to review everything when preparing for the final.",
                "Strengths: Professor MacKay was very interesting and had a lot of insight into the films and the theories we were learning. I found the readings to be interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt relatively euro-centric, meaning that nearly all the films and theories that we learned were European or American. There was only one Asian feature-length film and only two African feature-length films, yet tens and tens of films in Europe and America. I wish that there was more diversity. I also felt that this course wasn't very well-structured, it felt like a bunch of tangents and not very clear-cut.",
                "The course greatest strength is the enthusiasm and passion of Professor Mackay, who teaches in a very compelling manner. The readings are interesting, for the most part. The TA sessions are engaging and allow us to delve deeper into the films watched in class and connect them to the assigned literature. \r\nThe course's main weakness would be the clarity and structure of the powerpoints. They may benefit from clearer structures (table of content, titles, bullet points)"

                "Yes. A time sink based on amount of class time per week, but the relatively short assignments makes up for it. If someone is looking for a writing credit with a decent interest in film, this course is right for you.",
                "Yes, but mainly to film and media studies majors. It is a relatively time-consuming class.",
                "If you are curious about film, especially writing about film, yes. Also highly recommend for first-years. This is the class I learned the most from this semester, though sometimes the work / learning curve gets tough. However, this class only works if you put the time into the screenings and homework.",
                "Yes if you are interested in film. Don't expect a humanities gut.",
                "Yes! This class is such a good introduction to the world of film. Even if you're not a film major but enjoy watching movies (like everyone), you should still take this class; it'll make you notice all the small details that make up a film and appreciate how it came to be.",
                "Sure, it was very fun and low maintenance",
                "Definitely recommend! If you are taking this for a writing credit, the assignments might seem a bit intimidating at first. Overall, however, this is a great course for filmmakers and film lovers alike.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student as a good introduction to Film Studies at Yale. The class provides you with the technical understanding and a solid foundation to then apply what you have learned in your papers. On a week to week basis, the class is generally not too time consuming. Plus, the course studies some of the best movies in film history, forgotten classics, and other hidden gems.",
                "Yes, if you have a genuine interest in film. Probably not the best for a senior gut or fun class.",
                "It's a prerequisite for the film major, so yes, in terms of fulfilling your major requirements.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone keen to observe cinema through an academic lense. It is an exciting and engaging course."
