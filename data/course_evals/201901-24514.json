    "Greatly improved my watercolor skills and learned about the history of watercolorists.",
    "It was a fantastic creative outlet and honestly one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "I learned both practical painting skills with watercolors like wet-on-wet and how to analyze, observe, and discuss art, as well as a bit of the history of the art of watercolor.",
    "A great way to learn painting!",
    "Watercolor skills",
    "I not only developed an understanding of the watercolor medium and important watercolor artists throughout history, but I also learned a lot of life advice and culture from professor van doren",
    "An appreciation for watercolor and a strong interest in continuing to paint with the medium after college",
    "We learned several different watercolor techniques, including wet on wet, using colored paper, gouache and abstract painting."

   "comments": [
    "Very relaxed structure allowed students to pursue what they were most interested in. Wonderful Professor.",
    "Learned to think more creatively about my work and life in general.",
    "I would have liked some more explanations of different watercolor techniques and more explicit hands-on learning instead of just being sent off to paint. I think that works really well for people with more experience than me though so I understand if that's the purpose of the design.",
    "Strength: focus on the fun of creating art\r\nWeakness: most lecture examples focuses on European techniques",
    "The course is the first art course Ive taken at Yale, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The course could be organized a little better  we didnt end up going on a field trip as originally planned in the syllabus, but overall Prof Van Doren organizes many great outings and painting spots around campus and New Haven. \r\n\r\nWith something as subjective as art, I think the techniques of watercolor were taught pretty well. I do think that the class couldve benefited from a more standardized teaching of what the various watercolor techniques were, to be taught at the beginning of the course. A lot of the learning I did in how to paint just came from pure trial and error, and it wouldve been beneficial to have some extra guidance at the beginning of the course."

    "Yes! Loved it!",
    "If you're able to get in, I strongly recommend taking this class. It was a great switch-up from my normal problem sets and classes and allowed me the breathing room that I needed at the end of my time at Yale.",
    "Love this class, wonderful do take if you can get a spot!",
    "Absolutely! If you can get in its a must before graduating. I would recommend taking it as a Senior because its a very chill second semester class.",
    "Yes, completely. Dont let a lack of artistic experience intimidate you and prevent you from taking the course  all skill levels will benefit from taking the course, and if you put in the effort, youll do fine in terms of grades."
