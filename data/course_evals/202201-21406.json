My one suggestion is that perhaps the lowest essay score could be dropped in grace calculations, because I though my essays from the beginning of the year sort of dragged down my grade, even though I had to try harder to write at that point.",

The readings were entertaining, not too long, and helpful in terms of reading for craft. The class had relatively constant work, but I would say a manageable amount.",

I enjoyed the in class discussions and received tons of detailed feedback from the professor. The essays were carefully chosen and provided models for non-fiction essay writing. I would caution that the course is a lot of work (more than many of my other classes combined)."
