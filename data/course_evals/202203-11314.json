I've learned how to better read math textbooks, how to solve completely foreign problems, how to explain my thinking in a logical manner, and how to write proofs through trial and error. I discovered tons of math notation taking this course and, importantly, use mathematical induction in the majority of my proofs.",

It requires a lot more intuition and working through examples on pen and paper, proofs often felt like ingenious magic tricks, so it was an excellent course for developing this approach",

                "The course excels in delving the student into new material on a weekly basis and challenging them with every problem. The one huge weakness of this course is the book. The book is massively difficult to read and feels pretty condescending to the beginner in discrete math.",

                "The content for this course is interesting and a nice way to ease into proof-based math, but as a 3rd year math student, I was pretty bored. We went pretty slowly, and we didn't approach the subject matter with a lot of rigor. I don't want to say make it harder, but it felt like we could have gotten through a lot more material.",

I think there could be a lot more clarity in review material and practice/study material as well.",
                "The course content is engaging, especially if you are interested in learning about graphs and how to write rigorous proofs, which are expected of in higher level math courses.\r\n\r\nThe class was poorly timed; we had weekly Psets that were due on Friday, but the course always lagged behind schedule so it was only after Wednesday that we learned what we needed to solve the Pset. Grading was generally slow, and so was the course note updates.",
