    "shaped my understanding of morality, made me a more empathetic person - definitely has consequences on how I live my day-to-day life!",
    "I learned a lot about free will from a psychological and neuroscientific perspective, and also picked up a general understanding of some of the historical background of the free will debate along the way. Also learned some general neuroscience not necessarily related to free will, but interesting all the same.",
    "A better understanding of what it means to think about a topic scientically as well as from a psychology point of view",
    "I learned a lot about various scientific, sociological, and even logical arguments against the existence of free will. We considered some possible definitions of free will, learned about a few major historical philosophical positions on free will, and read and\/or watched videos of modern scientists and philosophers discussing the issue of free will and determinism. By engaging with this material, I developed quite a few insights about the issue of free will, how it is approached today, and the strong and weak points of deterministic arguments.",
    "The cultural, neural, and political and philosophical debate around the idea of free will. It's fascinating, even though it may be a topic that is not often discussed in regular conversation. But I learned how it really permeates all aspects of our lives, from our individual interactions to institutions like the justice system."

    "great readings which we have to engage with because of weekly reading responses. class discussion wasn't well moderated - I'd often come to class excited to discuss some aspect of the reading but wouldn't get the chance.",
    "The Ravven reading at the beginning of the semester is tremendous and fascinating, one of the most exciting and compelling assigned readings I've ever encountered. The Gazzaniga reading is OK and the Harris reading is laughably bad and just a repetition of his video lecture. I think the latter readings could be replaced out with something better, maybe a compatibilist perspective or some counterpoint to the echo chamber of \"free will doesn't exist\" perspectives presented. Discussions ended too quickly. There were some days when it was hardly even an hour of the 2 hour block. I think including some different perspectives into the readings could really liven up the discussions. I think it's fine for the class to be premised on the idea that free will doesn't exist, but if it that premise is true, it shouldn't be an issue to present more opposing perspectives. Where was compatibilism all term? It seemed like the class was only focused on arguing against libertarian free will.",
    "Very personalized attention, incredibly interesting, and well taught. The only weakness would be the fact that there's a lot of work in the finishing weeks",
    "The readings for this course are fantastic. Professor Brown also prepares very informative and interesting presentations.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is anathema to the course, but I believe that considering some serious work(s) in favor of free will would benefit this course. Too often it felt as though we were making straw man arguments against the existence of free will, which I felt may have been due to the fact that we weren't considering very many nor very impressive defenses of free will, or even definitions of free will. I understand arguments for determinism and the perspective they take. I wish I could have engaged more with the perspectives taken and arguments made by compatibilists and other free will proponents. I also would have liked to at least touched on the subjects of free will and determinism as they are treated in existential philosophy, in some way. Nonetheless, I understand that Professor Brown is a neuroscientist first and foremost, and he does an excellent job of discussing the questions surrounding free will and determinism from this perspective."

    "really amazing readings and course content that will shape your worldview. prof brown is obviously brilliant but he's not a great seminar leader - he doesn't do a good job of leading student discussion, often repeats the same rants, and never returns feedback on your reading responses. the class definitely had an impact on me but it's not without its flaws.",
    "Take this course. I think the material is fascinating and really thought-provoking, plus THB is a really kind and pleasant prof (even if he's a little dismissive of opposing viewpoints and not always that invested in discussions). I think the quality of this course could go up or down quite a bit depending on the students--if there were some students with a really strong background in free will who weren't so quick to accept the truth of determinism, the sessions might be a lot livelier.",
    "Absolutely! The course is incredibly interesting and can help shape your perspective on the world around you",
    "My recommendation of this class completely depends on the student and what they are seeking. This course takes a rigorously scientific perspective on the issue of free will. In fact \"the science of determinism\" may be a more apt name for this class. It is primarily dedicated to learning about various arguments against the existence or even coherence of free will. Some are better than others, and we spent time discussing the merits of and issues with these arguments. The readings are certainly interesting. If you are interested in free will from a philosophical or religious perspective, this course has probably little to offer you. But if you would like to learn about what modern science has to say about issues of free will and determinism, this course has a lot to offer you. Regardless, the readings and discussions in this class will definitely push you to think critically about issues of free will and formulate your own opinions on the matter.",
    "Yes! It gives you a completely different perspectives on a lot of different elements of society and life in general and Professor Brown really facilitates discussion well."
