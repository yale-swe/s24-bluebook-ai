                "Strength: William Zhou is a very caring and understandable Professor! \r\nWeakness : Works aren't much but a bit more to be remembered and keep track of weekly and daily - bit confused when trying to predict my grade at the end for too many works to take into account",
                "Really well-organized, it is always clear what homework we need to do by when. But not set in stone; professor Zhou is really considerate of students' workloads so when some students voiced out that there was too much homework, he took off some of the default assignments for certain weeks. It's a really engaging course with textual, video, image sources all in authentic formal Chinese mapped directly to informal Chinese equivalents. The professor gave us a bonus handout with common formal Chinese grammars and news phrases as well as stepped through the texts word by word during class which was super helpful for getting used to the way Chinese write news. I hardly needed to study for the exams with how much professor Zhou trained us to convert informal and formal Chinese in our brains.",
                "Strengths: The different units were on very interesting topics. I liked the small class size of 8 students. The course is well-organized.\r\nAreas for improvement: Perhaps more opportunities to speak in class could be added, though I am glad that we didn't have to do a formal presentation each week, that would be too much work. But something similar to the  assignments could create more low-pressure opportunities for practice."

                "Yes",
                "Yes, this course was super fun. There was some variation of Chinese level among students, but you get out what you put in from the class, so more advanced students could still benefit from more practice with the formal register, since Yale's L1-L5 classes mostly focus on casual, colloquial speech and writing.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning to speak more formally, or better understand official news reports\/articles in Chinese."
