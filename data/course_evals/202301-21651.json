                "Strengths: weekly assignments heavily relate to course teaching. Great music examples. Student work and songs in the homework were brought up in class. Weaknesses: None",
                "the biggest strength of the course is that you're able to connect it to the music that you like so it's very open. the only weakness is that it gets a little awkward and quiet at times, probably because of the seating arrangement",
                "Strengths: fun and very doable assignments. Weaknesses: none",
                "Only thing I'd change is to spend some more time on instrumentation/arrangement and a little less on covers/interpolation. The format of the class where much of the time was spent listening was a real strength. I also like how examples were used spanning so many genres and time periods, from Irving Berlin to Carly Rae Jepsen . . . and more Carly Rae Jepsen . . . and even more Carly Rae Jepsen.",
                "I think the lectures could be more engaging and more intellectually challenging. It was too easy to coast in the class and not put in much work. Requiring more engagement would've made it more fun."

                "Would definitely recommend, especially as a lighter 5th class to take if you are interested in how songs are constructed. This course is very much what you make of it, as you can spend as little or as much time as you want on the assignments (which are always really interesting and topically relevant to the lectures). The final project, which is to fully analyze a song of your choice and present on it to the class, is really fun. Professor Adam is super knowledgeable in this space and you will learn stuff that will make you better appreciate the music you listen to.",
                "yes! it would probably be a little helpful to have knowledge of chords and things like that though",
