                "Strengths: well organized, practice in all areas of Hebrew (listening, speaking, writing, etc)",
                "Dina was the foremost strength of this course. She's an incredible Hebrew teacher -- organized, knowledgeable, fun. Her love for Hebrew--both the language and the course--is palpable. The Padlets made the assignments easy to follow, and there was always an exciting activity at the end of class. The audio and video clips, especially the songs, just illustrated how far we've come; by the end of the semester, I was able to understand half of the songs! The exams were challenging but fair, and the homework seldom felt dull. Adi, the HEBR 110 TF, was also an incredible addition to the course; I always looked forward to the discussion sections and small-group meetings, for Adi always made things engaging and lively. The Hebrew tables enabled me to use my Hebrew in a more conversational context, and the cultural events were a nice touch. Overall, this course had more strengths than I can even hope to enumerate. \r\nThe only weakness was the sheer amount of material after Week 10; it felt like the vocabulary was growing exponentially when we really just received the same amount of words per week, and I don't know why that is. With some extra self-studying, though, I was fine. So, for those looking to take the course, just remember to continually practice!",
                "Strengths: Dina (Professor Roginsky) is incredible; extremely organized; good mechanisms for making sure you know vocab; assessments are very fair and test knowledge well; great community-building activities\/extra events\r\nWeaknesses: My section had a high number of students, so it was a bit more difficult to get individualized attention at least during class, but there were breakout sessions with smaller groups to learn more. Also, Dina was aware of this and actively encouraged some of us to attend the other section so that she could give more individualized attention. So this really wasn't the course's fault just a lot of people (rightfully) wanted to take Hebrew!",
                "The strength of the course was Professor Roginsky. She is clearly very experienced and good at teaching Hebrew. She is incredibly organized and engaging. There are no weaknesses. The only \"con\" of this course is the higher workload and daily homework, but that is necessary in an L1 language course.",
                "This course was amazingly taught. The teacher, Dina Roginsky, is phenomenal and engages me daily. I loved all the activities from the speaking portion, the songs, the video projects, the diary entries. I honestly couldn't imagine a way that the class could be taught better.",
                "Strengths: As an L1 course, it definitely lays a strong foundation for your future Hebrew learning."

As Dina writes on the syllabus, you will learn so much in fifteen weeks, from speaking to listening to reading to writing. The class is great, the professor is incredible, and the community is close-knit. What more can you ask for?",
                "Absolutely. Everything about it - instructor, TA, course design, assessments, homework - is super optimized and you learn so much. Especially if you are Jewish or have a specific reason for wanting to learn Hebrew that makes it even better, but I know of people who are not Jewish and took Hebrew and really enjoyed it.",

                "YES. If any students are somewhat interested in learning Hebrew then I highly recommend this course. The teacher will make sure you are not falling behind and help guide you to be a proficient Hebrew speaker by the time you are done with the semester.",
                "Yes if you are interested in Hebrew. Prof. Roginsky is an excellent professor."
