I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of many complex processes from a molecular level, as well as a better ability to predict what will go wrong when certain steps are interrupted. I also improved my ability to design experiments to study different processes and learned about many experimental techniques.",

                "Strengths: very organized teaching team! The amount of resources available was also great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: THis class felt like it would never end. The weekly quizzes were relentless -- being able to drop 3 quiz grades was so helpful",
                "I was incredibly grateful that this course provided study guides/review sheets for each lecture which helped me review key topics. These guides also had review questions that were very useful in making sure I understood the concepts at hand. One thing that could be improved would be that sometimes for quizzes, I would lose a point on something very technical (such as not stating explicitly that ATP hydolysis was the source of energy even though the question may have already suggested that it was so).",
                "This class goes at a very fast pace and is not designed for students who may be dealing with other things or courses. There is not much accommodation for students and there is far too much material and too much detail you must pay attention, as they never specify what information is important for quizzes or tests.",
                "Lecturing was high quality. Sometimes quizzes were stressful. Having weekly quizzes were important to keep you on top of material. I do kind of wish there was maybe some sort of homework or some other assignment we could do",
                "I thought this class was extremely interesting and we learned a lot but I was overwhelmed at times. I wish we spent more time connecting the different topics and identifying which components of a complex system were actually important to memorize. Trying to synthesize all of the information for the final was very difficult and I would have found it almost impossible to do had the quizzes and exams been closed note.",
                "The strength is definitely the weekly quizzes. This is the only way to manageably test you on the incredible amount of content you are faced with in the course. Unfortunately, the grading for the quizzes was very unpredictable, and took a sharp downward turn later in the semester. On the last couple of quizzes, it got very challenging to determine what, exactly, the graders were looking for and how much detail to go into in the limited time available. Also, the final exam at the end of the course completely undid the awesome quiz format. It is completely impractical to be tested on all of the course content at once and it was ridiculous that we couldn't go back to revise our answers, despite that being a Yale final exam requirement.",
                "The course is fast paced, but it is clear the professors want to provide an engaging learning environment. They are very good about posting slides and their study guides in advance. The fact that lectures were recorded this semester was also incredibly helpful; I was able to rewatch several before the final exam. The weekly quizzes are also very fair, and I appreciated how they ensured I stayed engaged with the course. One of my best experiences in a STEM course as Yale. The final exam was well-written, and I appreciated how the professors made it challenging in spite of it being open note.",
                "The lecturers were all passionate and the course material was relatively interesting. Sometimes it was quite fast paced and a lot of reading was requires. The weekly quiz format was a great way to understand the material and familiarise oneself with the exam layout.",
                "It was extremely well organized and structured to facilitate learning. The material was very fascinating and engaging, with many applications in the real world.",
                "Strengths: Extremely comprehensive\r\nWeaknesses: Quick paced",
                "The grading for quizzes was slightly nitpicky, but they really helped when it comes to staying on top of the material. The teachers are amazing and the textbook is very straightforward and helpful.",
                "Great professors and TFs. The handouts were very helpful. Weekly quizzes were also helpful for keeping me on top of material. A weakness would be that the material was a bit uneven  some weeks were harder and more packed than others. Reallocating time a bit would be helpful, even if this meant some class periods we went over two units while for others we went through less than one.",
                "This course is the best course I have ever taken at Yale. The organization is outstanding. You can really tell that the professors prioritized their students. Grades are entered extremely quick and professors put recording the lectures and uploading them immediately as a priority. There are fair opportunities to improve your grade. You learn so much about the cell and the emphasis on applying the knowledge as opposed to only memorization is very successful. TAKE THIS CLASS! Do not be dissuaded at all by how much the workload appears to be, this class will change your entire understanding of cell (and frankly, mol) biology. There are no weaknesses.",

                "This course was such a great foundation to biology. The course was very organized, and I learned a lot of the details I needed to in order to apply them in the future to research. We talked about experimental design, which is going to help in the application of the material. The professors and TFs are very receptive to questions, and they make sure you have all the resources you need to succeed in the course, such as the study guides and the many practice questions. The study guides enhance understanding and help organization, and the discussion sections help to understand the questions since the material is very dense. My only suggestion for improvement of the course is to maybe have psets in addition to only the quizzes and the final. Exams were stressful, although the questions were always interesting and enhanced learning.",

The weekly quizzes are relentless and it's important to stay on top of the material week to week. Sometimes this class can feel overwhelming, but there are no \"surprises\" to this class or in the grading scheme and professors and TAs are consistent in grading and posting lectures/slides.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it to anyone interested in biology at virtually any level. There's plenty of overlap with other courses, but I thought MCDB 205 provided an excellent overview of how cells function as the basic unit of biology. It's not particularly easy (especially since it probably won't be open-note in future years like it was for the online version), and there's a ton of content; however, it's well organized so that attending lecture and reviewing the handouts should prepare you for the quizzes, with the textbook available to help with the finer details for the curious.",

However, it is very clear that I learned a lot from it and I think overall, the material was very interesting to learn given that cell biology is also such a foundation topic to understand.",
