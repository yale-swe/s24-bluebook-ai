I developed the ability to hone in and look closely at the narrative I wanted to build and the story I wanted to tell. I also learned a lot about how stories of refugees and migrants are presented, and how different forms can elucidate different pieces of their stories - and how some parts will always remain opaque.",

                "Strengths: I loved the content of the course and the at it was taught! There was a strong emphasis on learning and being careful and generous. Weaknesses: since we were moving a bit slow and specific, we didn't always cover as much as ground as would've been nice.",
                "This class had a fantastic selection of readings, all of which Leah Mirakhor helped us understand much better with her insights. The final project was flexible and enough that we were able to really write and create what we cared about   for many of us, it was exploring our own personal family migration stories and their context.",

                "Responding to each other's discussion posts before class made online engagement much more meaningful compared to just posting each week on a Canvas wall bereft of actual conversation. Also, workshopping our final projects within small groups and then presenting to the larger seminar made it easier to track progress as well as build confidence in my choices as a writer."

This makes for an unparalleled seminar experience, one that stood out during a pandemic semester and remains one of the best classes I took during undergrad.",
                "Yes absolutely, TAKE THIS COURSE! This class was amazing, I have never taken an English-style narrative class before unless I had to for WR credits, but I loved this class. The readings were all very engaging and just simply good books.  Professor Miraakhor is amazing, one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Very introspective class and if you care about migration this is wonderful to take. Plus I think this class will make you think about serious issues in a way that is provocative and needed for our time. Not superficial, not a class you are forced to participate in, a class you want to be in!",
