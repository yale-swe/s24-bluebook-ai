                "- I enjoyed the course\r\n- reasonable amount of work\r\n- interesting lecture, that approach concepts in an intuitive way.",
                "Strengths\r\n- The course exposed me to a wide array of optics concepts and applications.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- For an introductory optics course, this class tried to do too much. My goal in taking this course was to become proficient in solving basic problems in linear optics. I wanted to master the essentials and leave advanced topics for other courses. To my dismay, Prof. Cao dashed through the essentials to save time for applications. The five assigned problem sets also didn't give me a lot of practice. The final project, which focused on applications, was quite time-consuming. This class is a seminar in the trappings of an introductory course.\r\n- The homework, which was mostly quantitative, did not reflect Prof. Cao's stress on learning concepts and developing physical intuition. I would have benefited from longer or more frequent problem sets that contained equal numbers of quantitative and qualitative problems.\r\n- The oral midterm, a rarity at the intro level, cannot have been very useful in evaluating the performance of students, especially those who prefer to think on paper. The test was quite short: most students were given 15 minutes. Every student was asked different questions, making it hard to compare the test results of any two students. I suggest replacing the oral exam with a 75 minute written exam that includes a uniform set of qualitative and quantitative questions covering a range of topics. In the future, Prof. Cao can help her students prepare for the midterm by providing sample questions. For example, she could pick one or two topics and write several questions of increasing difficulty. This would have helped me determine the depth at which I needed to understand each topic. \"Study everything\" has never been useful advice.\r\n- The final project was unwieldy. An 8-10 page paper, in the format of a scientific journal article, is a large assignment for an introductory course. I appreciate that Prof. Cao wanted us to see how optics crops up in engineering and basic research, but the project did not substantially improve my understanding of introductory optics or improve my ability to solve standard problems. \r\n- All of the final presentations were held on the same day. In the future, presentations could be delivered on two separate days during the first week of December.",
                "The course covers many topics which is really useful for someone looking to explore optics. The guest speakers and lab tours were very much appreciated, and I thought the presentations at the end of the course were great. I would repeat these activities in future classes. \r\n\r\nI think one weakness might be that the notes are fairly rigorous in term of math and sometimes difficult to follow on the powerpoint slides. While the textbook and online supplementary readings are certainly helpful in this regard, it might be better to either go through some of the math more thoroughly in class on the board, or assign specific readings each week and focus more on the concepts and takeaways in class. At times, it felt like we were trying to go over too much in class. \r\n\r\nOne more weakness is the fact that the homework was sometimes not closely related to what we learned in class. It might be helpful to again assign specific readings for the chapters in the book each homework assignment will cover. The level of support from the Teaching Fellow was fantastic.",
                "There was a lot of valuable information in the course and it was presented concisely but it sometimes more detail would be appreciated. Slides are very effective for a large portion of the class given its introductory nature and the need for visual aids but for material like derivations slides are not an effective media. Trying to follow a derivation in any meaningful way at the pace it can be read off slides is not possible.",
                "The topics are covered at a very fast speed. Although it is not a problem for me, some students might find it hard to digest."
