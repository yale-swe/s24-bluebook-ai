                "I learned a lot about what the world surrounding the Mediterranean Sea looked like between the years 360-100 BC, with a strong focus on the Greeks and Macedonians. I learned how to analyze historical sources and contextualize them in their societies and time periods, developing the ability to critique information from antiquity.",

                "I learned to think critically about the rise and fall of the Hellenistic world, the legacy of Alexander the Great, and the impact his empire exerted on this often-overlooked period of history. Essay assignments asked us to consider thematic questions about cultural fusion, historiography, periodization, the role of women, and other important topics about this world.",
                "you learn a lot about hellenistic history, which spans a long period of time and is quite complex. you learn how to write for a history class, do citations for complicated sources.",

                "I learned how to write essays on historical documents with primary sources. In high school, I never read old primary sources to the extend that we did in this class. It was a very cool experience to read directly from the people who lived during the Helenistic period.",
                "This class taught me a significantly wider scope of history than I expected. I came in expecting to spend most of the term learning about Alexander The Great but instead, the course went a lot further and deeper. I thoroughly enjoyed this."

                "This course contains a lot of interesting content, and allows you to learn about a wide range of topics, but the readings are sometimes confusing or dull. This course could be improved by having the readings and lectures go more hand-in-hand, as sometimes it felt as if the readings did not match the lectures, or I could find not the significance of a reading relative to what we were discussing in class.",
                "Strengths: really amazing TAs who were great at leading discussion sections and helping with papers; Professor Manning was also great and did an awesome job being flexible according to what interested the class the most.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As the semester progressed, it became obvious that my classmates weren't keeping up with their readings, so the discussions got less interactive. It might make sense to do some kind of reading check or other assignment that forces people to keep reading.",
                "This course offered an interesting and engaging foundation in Hellenistic history. The primary sources examined were useful and illuminating and the essay questions were helpful for thinking through broader themes. I especially appreciated the discussion of ancient Alexandria and Greeks instituting vestiges of Hellenic culture while living abroad.  My only note is that the material could at times be presented in a somewhat sporadic fashion, particularly in the week themed: \"Armies, pirates, resistance and the role of climate change, and Religion.\" All fascinating topics, but we didn't really have the chance to delve into any one of them in depth when the material was so expansive.",
                "Weakness: essay topics were much too vague and had far too narrow requirements in terms of only pulling from assigned sources.",
                "the teaching fellows were a huge strength of the course -- they helped clarify a lot, breakdown the complex and often very long readings, and guide students to what was more important and worthy of attention. you could also tell the tfs cared about the students' well-beings, which mattered a lot in the difficult pandemic semester. the lectures were often hard to pay attention to, maybe exacerbated by zoom? but they did not make sense. there seemed to be no organization to the powerpoints, they weren't in chronological order, or organized around place, they just felt very random, so it was especially hard to follow them. the readings were also excessive at times to little benefit for our knowledge. the discussion sections were great to talk about the highlights of the class and be able to think more critically in a smaller group about what we were learning.",
                "Both the Professor and the Teaching Fellows really drove this course and made it very engaging. The only way it could be improved is by spacing out readings a bit more so as not to have extremely heavy readings weeks and then some that are extremely light."

                "it was nice that the lectures were recorded and powerpoints made available when writing the papers for the class. that way, a student could review anything that was discussed and could have been missed due to internet connection issues and other like issues. i also think the willingness to help and grant extensions by the tfs was really great and important during an especially challenging semester for every student and instructor.",

Overall, I would recommend this course with the warning that this course, although titled Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic World, only directly focuses on Alexander the Great for 25% of the course, and does hardly discusses ancient Greece or ancient Rome.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed this course!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, provided they have a serious interest in learning more about Hellenistic history and are willing to engage with the primary sources as well as the very thorough, comprehensive secondary literature.",
                "i might in a non-pandemic semester recommend it, but i'm not sure if it would be more engaging enough to still take it. if you are interested about hellenistic history and know very little - this is 100% the course to take. if you're just kind of interested in history, looking for a distributional credit, there are probably more exciting and engaging options.",
                "I would recommend this class. I took it because I needed another humanities credit, and I learned some interesting things about life from 300 BC to about the first century AD.",
