                "KNOWLEDGE: Extensive, though sometimes seemingly repetitive, introduction to the history of data, data visualization, critical data, and visualization theories. There's a wide variety of topics in the course readings including data history, critical thinking, personal data visualization and self-quantification, and much more. The concept of capta is particularly useful.\r\n\r\nSKILLS: I am infinitely better at evaluating data visuals nowI have a toolbox of actually productive questions that I can use when making a graphic or evaluating an existing one. Also, I made a map in ARCGIS and it was easily a top 10 breakthrough moment in my Yale career. But it was very difficult.",
                "I learned SO MUCH in this course. On the theoretical side, I learned a lot about the digital humanities and the politics of data visualization that I had never really considered before. I also learned how to use Adobe Illustrator and ArcGIS, which are two great skills to have for my future resume.",
                "Skills: I became way more proficient with Illustrator and ArcGIS. That's probably the most valuable aspect of the course\r\nKnowledge: ability to critique data objectivity and historical knowledge of how data visualization has evolved",

                "This course offered insight into the theory behind the practice of data visualization.",

                "Learned to think more critically about what the design of a map can tell us about the values/biases/assumptions of its creators/historical context. Learned about major moments in the history of information graphics and different approaches to data/data visualization (e.g. how were the politics of data perceived in early 20th century Austria versus 19th century England). Learned how to use Adobe Illustrator and QGIS/how to make nice-looking maps and graphs; improved my design intuition.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Not all of the readings are great but there are some that are wonderful, and many of the visuals that we had to look at in the second half of the semester were supremely fun to look at and generative for thinking about data visualization. The projects were useful and interesting and I think the visual essay as the final assignment is definitely the right choice for the course. Prof. Rankin provides insanely useful feedback on our own ideas about the readings in class and on projects, and he is extremely structured in a way that is not rigid or overbearing. The people in the class were also really interesting and gave me tons of new insights.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was simply not enough in-class emphasis on mapping software or Adobe Illustrator. Many students including myself often felt at a loss for working with ARCGIS and we would've hoped that more time be devoted in class to working with the software; for example, having us download all the same shape files, datasets, etc and making a map step-by-step in class. The readings were, at times, very long.",
                "This course was very well designed for it being the first time this course was run. I think the readings were very good, aligned with the practical skills we were learning, and built on each other very well. I didn't read anything that I thought was irrelevant, which is a rarity in these seminar courses. There could have been a little bit more time devoted to tutorials for the various softwares, but I also understand the learning by doing method. I also really appreciated the classes where we looked at our peers work and got feedback because it both gave me ideas for my future visualization and helped me to see the amazing things my peers were doing.",
                "Strengths: you can produce visualizations that you're really proud of and improve significantly over the course of the term\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Rankin really throws you into the fire on the visualization assignments. They take a long time, and although I appreciate that approach to learning the software, I wish Professor Rankin had a little more appreciation for how time intensive it can be",
                "Strengths: I learned so much in this class and am coming away with actual visualizations that I made (and am proud of!) and can now show to others. The readings were some of the most interesting I have done at Yale. Professor Rankin gave excellent feedback, and the studio-style critiques were a fun opportunity to learn from my classmates' work. Weaknesses: Seminar discussion sometimes felt too unstructured, and occasionally the assignment critiques felt a little too intimidating.",
                "Prof. Rankin is really cool and has a lot to offer both as a historian of science and a data visualization practitioner. I really connected with the ethos behind this class, but I don't think it was executed as well as it could've been. I think the biggest thing I'd change would be the structure of the syllabus; the first half of the course is currently 100% devoted to theory and philosophy, while the second half is focused on history. This doesn't really make sense to me, because theory and history have the greatest value in conversation with each other. We never referenced any of the philosophy we read once we got to the history part of the course, which was disappointing because we read some thought-provoking works. Pairing theory and history works in the same week would definitely improve the course.",
                "Strengths: great introduction to data visualization theory and the wide variety of approaches plus the rich history that it has. Weakness: discussion was not always fruitful and it was hard to understand the relevance of certain readings or discussion topics to what we were supposed to learn. Rankin was also not the most responsive to emails, and while not completely a weakness, you should be prepared to learn a lot about the data visualization programs yourself through experimentation rather than learning it in class.",
                "I felt like this course was walking the line between being a seminar and being a workshop, and therefore wasn't really effective in either regard. I entered this course hoping it would be a workshop and that I could gain some expertise in Illustrator, Excel, ArcGIS, etc. However, Prof. Rankin only gave us very fast tutorials at the end of our first few classes of the semester, and rather than walk us through a demo, he just said \"this is the so-and-so function, and it does this.\" I talked with others in the course and this frustration about the lack of being taught how to use the programs was common. When we brought it up to him he said that he didn't know of any tutorials that existed, which put all of the legwork on the students to teach ourselves the programs. As a result, a discrepancy emerged in terms of who had more technical know-how with the different programs when we had to present our work to the class.",
                "I really enjoyed the data processing and data visualization assignments we were given. I found the practice helpful to apply some of the theories we read and discussed in class. On their own, the readings and discussions were often too esoteric for me to get anything super helpful out of them. The in-class discussions helped a little, but the practice assignments were the best. I think if did more in-class workshopping of each other's projects I would have enjoyed the discussions more. When we focused on just the readings, I sometimes felt directionless.\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, I think this class could be improved by being more practice-oriented. Different kinds of assignments (illustrations, group projects, mapping, visualizations relating directly to the class readings, tracking our own personal data) would have helped me feel more engaged.",
                "I think the structure of the class could be significantly improved. We were shown the tools to produce graphics, but were offered little to no guidance at all on how to implement it.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Rankin is the best discussion moderator I've ever had. It was clear that everyone was doing the readings (probably because of the discussion post requirement) and most people participated consistently throughout the semester. Rankin did a great job encouraging people to speak and offering his own (always valuable) insights. Readings were usually interesting and covered a broad range of relevant subjects; certain themes reappeared throughout the semester but the discussion was rarely stale. \r\nWeaknesses: This class definitely throws you in the deep end -- most of us didn't have much design background, and Rankin expected us to produce high-quality graphics for all three assignments (and is not the easiest grader). The final paper is ~10 pages of writing in addition to 5-10 graphics, each of which takes a couple hours, so it requires a lot of time and effort. This is probably a more effective way to teach design than to walk us through the software step by step, and Rankin was always very helpful in office hours, but be aware that this course demands a lot (and gives you a lot in return).",
                "Strengths: Getting to create our own data visualizations on any topic of our choosing Weaknesses: limited/weak guidance on how to use certain softwares like ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator. I would recommend dedicating a whole class to learning how to these tools instead of just 10-20 mins at the end because there was a significant learning curve.",
                "The readings in this class were very diverse and interesting (although at times difficult to grasp individually). I would say one improvement that could be made to this class would be to have more hands-on demonstrations of graphics/graphic making during class--- Professor Rankin has such a cool website and I wish he had explored it more with us in class.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of the course was its approach to class discussions, which were always robust and insightful. Readings were wide-ranging and helped to provide a nuanced view of the history, practice, and theory of data visuals. I think that one area of improvement for the course could be in the teaching of visualization tools and techniques. Limited time meant that many skills had to be learned independently, without clear guidance or support. Workshops could be organized around shared exercises that all students could complete together (this could be in real time, or given as guides to be followed later), and a greater emphasis could be placed on making sure all students have access to the same tools (i.e. software) and information sources for creating visualizations."

                "Yes! This is a great course that straddles the theoretical and the practical. It will stretch the thinking of data scientists and humanities kids alike, and contained a great diversity of students in the course. The course is very thoughtfully set up, and you will learn actual skills that you can put on your resume, which is always a plus.",
                "Not unconditionally, no. If you take this course, you have to be prepared for a lot of time spent on the visualizations around the deadlines. It's nice seeing the end product, but there were times for me when the stress of the projects and the time demand took away from the fun I wanted to have. It's a great class if you have the time for it and you really want to get better with Illustrator and ArcGIS, but I don't think it's for everyone",
                "Yes, definitely. But be prepared for a lot of work-- it doesn't seem like a lot of assignments, but they really take a lot of effort. Worth it, though!",
                "I'd recommend it but not super strongly in the course's current iteration. Since it's the first time it's being offered, I'm sure that Prof. Rankin will improve it in ways that better support his goals. I appreciated having a space to seriously think about and critic data visualization, I don't think there's other opportunities like that on campus. I just don't think we dug into the meat of what history of science has to offer.",
                "Cautiously yes. On a week-to-week basis, the readings were generally interesting, but the theory was very hard to understand at times and the class discussion did not help clear it up + were relatively unengaging. The data visualization projects in the first half of the class were engaging and a great way to apply the things were reading about in class. However, the last half of the semester felt very unevenly paced and the lack of deadlines/structure for the final project (i.e. 10 graphics plus 3000 words, no other guidance) led me to be a little confused about what we were supposed to take away from this class. Overall, I took a lot of big, influential ideas away from the course and appreciated the extra experience with data viz programs, but the week-to-week course structure did not give much.",
                "In its current form, I probably wouldn't recommend the course. The discussions felt a little circular and disjointed from week to week. I think that there needs to be more alignment between the written assignments, the in-class readings, and the final project. A more cohesive narrative between lectures might also be helpful.",
                "If you are interested in data visualization I would definitely recommend this course. If you are not .... proceed with caution. The readings are a real deep dive into the nitty gritty of data visualization, they can be a little boring if you're not interested. But, in general I'm glad I took this class. I think I learned some practical skills, know a lot more about data visualization history, and feel more equipped to represent data and critique others.",
                "No. It is way too much work. It takes 10+ hours per assignment because we did not receive much guidance on how to use the tools Professor Rankin showed us. A lot of the readings were also pretty theory-based, which it not for everyone.",
                "Yes! I thought this was the best seminar I've taken at Yale. Students were consistently engaged and professor moderated discussion well. I learned some practical design skills, gained some abstract insights into the politics of data visualization/thought more about my own data collection and media habits, and learned about the fascinating history of data.",
                "It definitely depends on what you're looking for. The class wasn't what I expected. I thought it was going to be a lot more hands-on and much more guidance on how to use specific softwares to make graphics, but the majority of in-class time was spent discussing readings which I didn't really enjoy. However, I understand how these readings could be useful in guiding us in making our graphics, but they were just very heavily theory focused. I think a better title for the course would be \"Philosophy of Critical Data Visualizations.\"",
                "Without a doubt. This has been one of my favorite classes I've taken in my time at Yale.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to all students with an interest in presenting and understanding information (which should be everyone). Having a critical perspective on the visualization of data, one that questions its purposes and impacts, is essential in a world where data is all around us. The skills gained are useful in various fields, spanning the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields, and I think all students can benefit from being more informed producers and consumers of visualizations."
