                "I liked the structure of this class, which was composed of a workshop and literature review each week. I loved the poetry that we read each week, but I do wish that the students were able to talk more and facilitate class discussions.",
                "strengths include the professor and class setting, feedback from the professor on our writing and how to improve (extremely helpful!!), the readings were phenomenal and well-structured, communication through slack\/miro\/google docs was useful, writing a poem every week helped students understand how to organize their thoughts into poems and develop skills in poetry writing; weaknesses not many, some prose readings were confusing\/we didn't discuss them often in class, we would go off topic sometimes, some students were not accessible for poetry groups or returning workshop feedback",
                "The biggest strengths of this class were definitely Professor Gorin and the classroom environment he cultivated. There was never any sense of \"competition\" among the students, and it was always a welcoming and open atmosphere. Professor Gorin's reading list was carefully crafted to facilitate learning and discussion of various topics in poetics. However, at times, I felt the reading list was too expansive for the limited time we had in class. There were some readings that we simply did not have time to discuss.",
                "strengths - one-on-one meetings where the professor gave valuable feedback and recommendations on poetry and readings for us to improve, round 1 of workshops when peers actually spent time writing feedback letters, regular poetry pod meetings. also having multiple weeks to revise our series\/sequence poems was great because it felt like I had a body of work to keep reworking - I feel like my earlier poems would have been stronger too if we were also assigned to revise something we'd previously written. \r\nweaknesses - not sure if prose on syllabus really got its time of day in this class; perhaps I would have gotten a better understanding of the prose if we did spend time discussing it, but most of it did go over my head when I read it before class so I wouldn't have been able to say much about it during class; also felt like the second class on Beyonce's lyrics to demonstrate repetition wasn't a productive or exciting use of time...and class often went overtime which can be frustrating with students' other commitments (and Zoom fatigue starting at a screen for the duration of class!). many peers also stopped writing feedback letters by the second half of the course (some hadn't offered feedback in the first round either) which was a bit of a bummer since getting feedback is super important as we first start out with poetry writing.",
                "I loved the workshop aspect of this course. I think that paying closer attention to if students actually meet in their prescribed small sections would be beneficial; mine did not meet too frequently and I feel I would have benefited from more frequent workshopping on my work with my peers."

I do think Miro was helpful for interactive live learning, but I'm not sure that Slack was totally necessary. The one-on-one meetings with Professor Gorin were really helpful. I was a little unclear about the expectations for and frequency of the small group meetings, but I did enjoy the ones we had.",
                "this was the best course i took this semester, everything succeeded and i would not want anything to change drastically; the readings were manageable, with some confusing prose the exception (suggestion: discuss prose going into class briefly if difficult before poetry), the slack channels, google docs, and miro boards were great for organizing classes and student work",
                "This course was beautifully adapted to the pandemic. Discussion and workshop meetings were as close to in-person as they could be.",
                "using Slack and Miro was pretty great; would like it if we could do something about Zoom fatigue since the seminar is pretty long - perhaps insert a 2 minute screen time break, like in a class session between 2 workshoppers so that we can refresh a bit since I do get a sense of the class getting dulled out when we try to linger on something too long. a quick break away from the screen can generate new conversation. setting up poetry groups was also great because it allowed for students to get to know each other outside of class time - more organic interactions!"

                "YES, YES, and YES!!! This was such a wonderful course. You will learn so much about reading and writing poetry. Especially if you do not have an extensive background in writing poetry, but you are interested in the craft, I highly recommend this course. It will introduce you to and teach you about what makes a poem \"good\" and how you can apply those things to your own writing. Also, Professor Gorin makes himself super available to meet with you outside of class to discuss your poetry and your progress in the course. Professor Gorin's comments during classes and workshops were always so insightful in helping us think about different topics in poetry.",
                "YES YES YES!!! If you want to be in a supportive environment where you can be exposed to lots of different types of amazing poetry (both famous people's and your classmates'), then this is the class! A few of the gems of this class that I don't think you get just by reading the description is a: a close cohort of poets that you weekly revise with (a subset of the class), David's creation of a customized list of poet's for YOU and what you've liked so far, and incredible access to David to talk about poetry, art, life, etc. This class was by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, if you are committed to the idea of fostering a community around poetry and personal growth -- this class is for you!",
                "yes! you have got to take at least one creative writing class at yale before you graduate, and this class could be that for you! this is a supportive atmosphere made up of peers and a wonderful professor to help you start writing poetry no matter where you're starting from. yes, some students already write poetry before taking this class, even though it's an introductory course, but no reason to be intimidated because we're all learning from each other, and all perspectives are valuable in our creative process. you get what you put in with this course, so get ready to invest time in reading and writing poetry and wrestling with challenging questions that make you grow as a poet while you're in this class.",
