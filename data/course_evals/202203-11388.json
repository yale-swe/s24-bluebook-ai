                "very intuitive. It would be better if instructor can provide more supplementary reading materials",
                "This course had so many strengths: comprehensive notes with writing/background/diagrams in addition to math. The lectures were clear, well-paced, and built upon each other like a story. No weaknesses to report.",
                "Overall this is a great course. The material is laid out in a logical manner and builds on itself. Using the textbooks to augment lectures was easy as the correspondence between them was clear. Homework also reinforced and explored class content well and was helpful for developing a strong understanding. Frequent references to real devices, materials, and everyday phenomena are great for connecting and contextualizing insights from class.",
                "The course was really well constructed and the instructor was very enthusiastic about teaching the course. The level of the assignments was perfect; they weren't too hard or too easy. The teaching fellow was also very helpful. The instructor took regular feedback about the course and made sure students were satisfied. The lectures were delivered enthusiastically, and were really clear and enjoyable. I don't have too many suggestions about improving this course.",
                "Strengths: the teacher is well prepared for the fundamental theory and very skillful in answering related questions.\r\nWeakness: the slides sometimes involves too much words, it could be improved by highlight some key words or give some summary slides."

The insights gained in this course are a great complement to studies in electrical engineering, applied physics, and materials science, as they form a great foundation for understanding solid-state phenomena.",
