We analyzed multimodal art (i.e. film, podcasts, poetry, plays, literature) and the diversity in material selection reflected how spanish is used in the everyday world."

Weaknesses would be the that the daily assignments felt like busywork at times and not really helpful to the larger unit or improving spanosh ability.",
                "The strengths of this course is the discussion based class which allows everyone to practice at their own pace. All the students are working to improve their own skills, so it is a safe space to work on your own skills as well. A weakness of the course is the group projects which often had a bunch of seemingly unnecessary requirements and specific formats to follow.",
                "The strengths include very strong engagement with students and unique set of course material, including a deep focus on Spanish art and culture. Only weakness is that sometimes professor is a bit harsh",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed the course units designed to encourage students to discuss interesting topics and enhance learning about these topics in spanish. The multimodal project-based learning made the course more engaging and it didn't feel like the work was ever too overwhelming as a result. Profesora Glenski also provides SO MUCH FEEDBACK! It's wonderful and reflects that she really cares about our learning! Even on the smallest homework assignments. And she makes herself so available for student office hours and meetings. Weaknesses: While Profesora created a wonderful classroom environment, at times, students made the classroom environment stale because of lacking participation (so raise your hand and contribute your thoughts to make the course more fun for you and your classmates!). Additionally, I was hoping for more in-depth lessons on tenses."

                "This is a great course to fulfill your language requirement, and you will do well as long as you participate and complete the routine assignments. The class also had a substantially lower workload than L3.",
                "Honestly its a fine class. I have learned the best way to learn Spanish is to go to a Spanish speaking country. You may not retain a lot of what is learned here. But not too much work and very pleasant low stress class thats generally fun and a break from other more intense math and science and English classes",
                "Of course! You'll improve your conversational Spanish and grow more confident in your language skill set. Not to mention that you get to learn about fun units through enjoyable projects."
