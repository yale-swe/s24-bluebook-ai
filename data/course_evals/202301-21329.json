Sometimes there was a lack of organization, but much of this was because students were disorganized rather than the Professor.",

                "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in current controversies in sport, and wishes to think more widely about the implications of sport and the Olympics in the modern day. The focus on ancient history of the Olympics at the start of the course gives you an appreciation of the meaning of the Olympics and how it has changed and evolved over time, and whether current issues are straying from the original intentions of the competition or not. The mix of student athletes and students was complementary to the course, meaning multiple different perspectives were brought into consideration.",
