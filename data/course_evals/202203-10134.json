You learn the history of a field which is good context, but it doesn't give you a strong sense of how the field is at in the present day unless you dig further yourself.\r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses is the way course material was delivered in lecture. The notes that Prof. Duncan reads from are very hard to interpret and the lectures can be hard to follow. It's much better to teach yourself from the textbook/ensure you read the textbooks ahead of time. There are also many resources online which help in understanding concepts. I would recommend that they get rid of the current notes format that Duncan uses. Staib's approach with slides is easier to follow. A mixture of clearly organized slides with writing on blank white paper/ipad works well. Also, they could use videos/other online content from the internet in lecture, then unpack it.",

                "Great class and setup",
                "The jump from lectures to pset was a little difficult, sometimes it felt hard to find direction when solving the math problems on the homework. The midterm and final were quite difficult as well, and I wish there was more guidance on how to do the math in lectures.",
                "Strengths: course goes very in depth into image processing and contemporary methods of analysis. Grading for both exams and problem sets is very fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Entire course is lecture based but unless you are somewhat familiar with the material beforehand, it becomes very difficult to understand what is happening for the entire 75 minutes. Also for second half of semester, homework questions differ drastically from the material covered in lecture, so psets become very challenging and require significant extra commitments.",

Unless they change the format of lectures, though, I wouldn't recommend it unless you hit all those criteria. If you do, then definitely take it!",

                "If you are not a BME major and this is your first time trying a BME course, I would recommend starting at an easier course and working up to this one. I am sure with prior experience in BME, this course is manageable, but for someone who took this as their first BME course, I had to put in a lot of extra work just to grasp basic concepts and catch up to the rest of the class.\r\n\r\nUltimately, understand that this course progresses at the pace of a grad level course because the majority of students will be BME grads. So, if you're an undergrad, be prepared to put in a lot of work.",
                "This is an excellent course for someone needing image-processing concepts in future pursuits. Even though the class covers a lot of material, always supplemented by attached additional readings, one still gets introduced to a handful of essential concepts if not going in-depth on specific topics.",
                "Yes. Although the data-driven method is popular now, the idea of traditional medical image analysis is still inspiring and important to students."
