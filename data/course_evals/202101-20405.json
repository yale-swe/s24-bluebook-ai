She also doesn't marry herself to the textbook the way other professors do, and I found this much more engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: same as every Yale language class  class every day, especially on zoom, feels",

She has an effectively structured course with no busy-work that many other classes have. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly I there aren't any glaring ones, but sometimes the films were difficult to watch\/complete"
