                "I really enjoyed the research portion of the class. I was able to delve deeply into the topic I was interested in with the help of Professor Tsu.",
                "Professor Tsu was an absolute gem, as well as guest lecturer Professor Cohen. Both were incredibly insightful and definitely the greatest strengths of this course. However, not being able to hear enough of them was, in my opinion, the primary weakness of this class. Many meetings consisted of the class going around and asking questions, which was definitely valuable, but something that I felt overshadowed many aspects of this course. I just wish I could've heard Prof. Tsu and Prof. Cohen deliver some more lecture-style material (since I felt as if there was almost none). This is not to say that this class should be in lecture formatthe course definitely benefits from a small class size and a discussion-based stylesimply that I wish I could've experienced some more structured content, rather than primarily responses to various, semi-related student-posed questions.",
                "I think this course is excellent! Professor Tsu and David Cohen clearly are experts at the forefront of the field and they have so much to teach all of the students. Together, they give an incredible course and invite guest lecturers who are similarly brilliant. Sometimes, I think it would have helped if the homework expectations / assigned readings were a bit more clear or made available via PDF to the class.",
                "The course is a bit sporadic and its really difficult to know how you're doing/what is expected of you. However, this does allow for some interesting pivots in conversation that I felt I benefitted from.",
                "The topics and readings were interesting, and it was great to listen to both Prof Tsu's and Prof Cohen's (guest professor) expert knowledge in their respective areas. However, the seminar didn't really focus on the readings we had, and was rather Q&A-based with either professor depending on the week, which could stifle discussion and conversation among peers. I found the abstract feedback session very helpful, so I do wish there were more workshops and general guidance on writing the final research paper, given that our whole grade is basically dependent on that. I would have also liked to see more of an emphasis on how all the topics we learned about connect with each other.",
                "I felt the course was too detached and was simply a collection of reading assignments. The course did not have many conversations or discussions about the relevant topics. Students were assigned readings, then classes themselves were fragmented sessions in which the teacher addressed reading questions from individual students, often with no coherent overarching message.",
                "Strengths: David Cohen, visiting professor from Stanford, actually ~taught~ the class. I have no earthly idea what Jing was doing or thinking. When he'd lecture, I'd actually pay attention (although after an entire year on Zoom it was quite surprising they still had no idea how to use Zoom? Sharing your screen is not that difficult what the hell) and write everything down that he said. He actually DID answer the questions we posed, whereas Jing never... actually.. answered them? Like um, why did we even ask if you were just gonna be like \"great question\" and not answer?  I ended up answering some of my peers' questions myself along with another classmate b/c the profs just would blatantly disregard the qs and go on tangents. WEAK: LITERALLY EVERYTHING. How is this even a course. How is she a tenured and named professor, not to mention the chair of CEAS? Teaching is a skill that Jing does not have. Class started late, class ended legit hours early, readings were assigned two days before they were due (including two books equaling 950+ pages together that no one actually read), and the only assignment is a 20-25 page research paper WITH NO GUIDANCE AT ALL. Just \"write\" and \"save all of your sources in a zip file\" and then you don't even get any feedback from there. No way to gauge how you're doing in class either."
