    "This course was very well designed, with information presented with just enough redundancy to stick but not so much as to waste time, and with assignments selected to cover a broad range of potential subject matter students might need to read without becoming arcane to those outside the selected fields. The professor and TA provided clear and constructive feedback on translations."
