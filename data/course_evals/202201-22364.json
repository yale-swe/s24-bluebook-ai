Profesora is incredibly nice and supportive to all students.",

It would be nice to spend more time in discussion and small group discussion and cover less topics. The group projects were also a mess because we really struggled with time management and proper distribution of work.",

I think the course syllabus could be reformed so that things are less chaotic towards the end of the course and there are less projects assigned so close to one another.",
