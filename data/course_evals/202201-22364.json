Topics range from discussing artistic representations of witches, films of indigenous communities and presentations on post-truth and fake news.",

The classroom environment is incredibly welcoming for students with all backgrounds in Spanish, and feels incredibly comfortable and inclusive. Students do not feel afraid trying to speak Spanish. Profesora is incredibly nice and supportive to all students.",
                "The course is very immersive in culture and language and is very engaging, but I had trouble keeping up with the pace of it as well as the size of the class. It would be nice to spend more time in discussion and small group discussion and cover less topics. The group projects were also a mess because we really struggled with time management and proper distribution of work.",

                "It was a very positive environment to practice Spanish!",
                "The course allows students to engage with a variety of resources (i.e. books, documentaries, plays) in order to explore the vibrance of Latin American culture and the Spanish language. I think the course syllabus could be reformed so that things are less chaotic towards the end of the course and there are less projects assigned so close to one another.",

The class content and work is paced extremely comfortably to give students time to absorb material and apply their knowledge in reflection. The assignments are not too taxing or difficult, and I think they assess understanding of the content well.
