                "A study on the themes that run through the past millennia or so of literature, and although I am still not great, a better ability to close read passages.",
                "The syllabus for DS Spring Literature is truly amazing. I had such a great experience reading the literature and learned so much from the curriculum. The lectures further deepened my understanding of every subject in a way I really appreciated. I wish we could go more in depth as it is definitely hard to be limited to 1 week only for texts so rich, but that inspired me to want to keep reading and rereading the texts, which I know I'll keep doing for years :)",
                "I learned a lot about the Western Canon in literature and how it developed over time. I think I improved my ability to analyze quite different works of literature in varied ways, and I think I was able to connect literature with varied disciplines through this class.",
                "A broad overview of the western literary canon.",
                "I read a lot of books that I might not otherwise have gotten round to, and I'm very glad I did. Everyone should read those classics. I felt I learned more from other people in this class than from the professor.",
                "Before this class, most of my literature papers were simple and thesis driven. Throughout this class, I was able to experiment with more creative structures that I believe really helped my writing flourish.",
                "Learned about literature writing and discussing great western literary works.",
                "I developed a greater knowledge of literature and the ways of examining literature.",
                "I learned how to be a better class participant and discuss in better was, as well as how to look at texts as a whole and write thematic papers rather than close reading papers.",
                "I learned to close read literary texts carefully to develop insights. I learned to write more concisely and succinctly. I gained an appreciation for the breadth of the western cannon. I gained fluency in modern western literature."

                "The way Directed Studies models their literature courses is a bit tiresome. I understand it is for the purpose of learning the western canon, but reading Don Quixote in two weeks is not exactly the best plan. Granted, you're definitely supposed to read the books beforehand. However, especially in the case of, like, the greatest novel of all time, it's kind of hard to expect us to even read that within a month, thoroughly. There were books that were very engaging and others that definitely just seemed riffed off of other books that we were expected to have grand insights about that frankly seemed a little bit repetitive. We also were expected to have background knowledge of a number of things that I was specifically not privy to, such as the genius of Paradise Lost: perhaps I was just out of the loop, but my knowledge of the Bible and other facets of the western canon did not allow for optimum enjoyment of that book, but maybe I'll come back in a few years and I'll like it. The strengths of the course are that I can now say I have read all of these books, as I know they're a crucial backbone to a lot of the books that are written today and a lot of references are made to them. I think we can look at a more diverse range of authors in the future, and focus on not only how the books tie back to old western canon references but how they twisted those expectations and perhaps made for a better and more widely ranged literature spectrum.",
                "Very fun texts, although, by necessity, DS feels like cram studying each week.",
                "I wish lectures could be recorded and made available as resources to return to! I also wish there could be some sort of content warnings before we read texts that contain blatant racism, sexism, or anti-semitism, as the majority of our texts did (particularly anti-semitism I don't think was ever addressed in conversations or lectures, but was present in almost every text we read). Besides that, no weaknesses! A truly amazing course that I already miss.",
                "I think the reading responses and papers were very well thought-out and organized. I thought on occasion, the focus on disparate reading responses made class discussion somewhat disjointed - I would have preferred to have a main focus of the class and integrate reading responses more naturally.",
                "This was an absolutely amazing course, the only thing that I would change would be to extend it in order to fit more essential works into the curriculum.",
                "Weaknesses: more historical context, and felt the professor was holding back a lot of insights he had.",
                "Towards the end of the semester, i these writeups gradually began to feel more like a chore than was being filled in for a completion grade than a true intellectual exercise. Despite the 250 word suggestion, many students (myself included) routinely went way above that. Despite writing some thousand or so words on a weekly basis, these write-ups only constituted a small part of our grade for the semester. This sometimes made it feel like these write-ups could only hurt ones grade, and not actually improve it. I believe that the write-ups could reasonably be decreased to once every other class, or have their importance in grades be increased.",
                "We had twice weekly reading responses which were great and let us flesh out an idea before getting to class also Hagens gave lots of prompts for the papers and a lot of flexibility in choosing our own prompt.",
                "The course was very good. The books, with some small exceptions, were pivotal books that will enhance my knowledge. I think there could have been more historical context for the readings.",
                "I absolutely loved this class! I wish that we learned a little bit more about the formal literary movements (just like a basic in this country at this time this was the thing that happened)"
