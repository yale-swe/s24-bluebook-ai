                "I learned so much about the history of photography, the problems of history as it relates to photography, the challenges of photography in relation to race, migration, child labor, land rights, environment Also, I learned so much about collections at Yale and how to access them if I need to! It was a truly unique experience.",
                "Learned to look really closely at photographs; learned to write well about them. Learned so much about the material history of this medium (and also just about what 'material history' means). learned to access yale's collections and navigate them.",
                "A thorough understanding of the material histories of different forms of photography. You learn about the diverse origins of different photographic forms as well as how the archives remember the materials, nations, and bodies involved in building the medium.",
                "I learned so much about material (marxist!) approaches to visual arts. I'm not a HSAR major but highly recommend this course to anyone interested in deeply and fundamentally political photo theory. The writing assignments encourage a close and attentive reading of photographs. I was a bit resistant to this approach of looking, as I tend towards theoretical claims rather quickly. Both Professors are deeply invested in what one can learn from looking carefully; I appreciate this insistence on lingering and questioning as it pertains to viewer engagement, and I hope to carry this approach to photo analysis beyond this class\/semester.",
                "Absolutely fantastic class! I went into this course not knowing anything about photography and learned so much about the history and social and environmental implications of photography. I also gained a lot of primary and secondary source research experience while doing the final paper.",
                "I learned so much about photography, but also about material theory, capitalism and art, art and the environment, the idea of an archive, and so on. I also think that I got better at writing about art."

                "strengths:\r\n- two absolutely fantastic professors who are very clearly interested in helping us learn as much as possible while simultaneously maintaining an environment that is relatively low-stress, fun, and conducive to anyone's individual curiosity\r\n- wide range of topics within photography, all of which were accompanied by material examples from Yale's special collections\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- not many, but I did sometimes think our class discussions strayed a little bit away from the readings and\/or we did not have enough time to discuss so many rich texts (though this is just a tradeoff that had to be made between finding time to look at materials and discuss the readings. really, I wish that the class could have been longer so that we could do both!)",
                "Strengths: The class dynamic was amazing. Both Professor Raab and Professor Angus and every single student in the class were interested in the material. We were moving around the campus to another collection each week. The learning was always tactile. Reading were interesting and related to the objects that were waiting for us in the collection. In the end, we ate a photocake with a photograph of our class holding the photograms we made in the Lens Media Lab on it. YALE HIRE PROFESSOR ANGUS PLEASE AND THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS CLASS A LEGEND WITH PROFESSOR RAAB. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: n\/a. Final writing assignment was a bit tough. But its okay. The class itself had no weaknesses.",
                "collections-based nature of this class is incredible! feedback is very comprehensive. very discussion-based. met really cool people. improved can't think of anything!",
                "The course is amazing, 10\/10 recommend.",
                "I cannot speak highly enough of the Professors and their generous approach to pedagogy. Both Professor Angus and Raab have so much historical knowledge and the depth of class conversation was repeatedly astounding. The class itself was made up of students from all disciplinary backgrounds, which -needless to say- made seminar discussions exciting and so fruitful! I appreciate the breadth of working professionals we interacted with and learned from. Visiting West Campus and talking to Paul Messier et al. was a definite highlight of the course.",
                "Strengths: Definitely Professors Raab and Angus. They worked well together and were very kind, knowledgeable, and helpful. The weekly field trips to different Yale collections kept me engaged with the course materials and excited to come to class every week. As someone who is not a History of Art or ER&M major, I felt that this course is very welcoming to outside perspectives. I was able to tailor my research to very specific interests while fulfilling the requirements of our assignments. I also loved my classmates. Our classs atmosphere was welcoming, and our discussions were always fascinating. \r\nWeaknesses: none"

                "yes 100%! this easily makes it into the top five courses I've taken at Yale, and is potentially the best seminar I've had. Prof. Angus and Prof. Raab worked so well together and wonderfully facilitated class discussion. there was a great mix of very intense, intellectual discussion with more fun periods in which we would just look at some very wild and cool artifacts from Yale's collections. I felt that I really was able to grow as a student in this class and was exposed to new modes of analysis that made me look at photographs in a totally new light.",
                "YESSSSSSS. If its miraculously offered again, dont miss this chance.",
                "Yes absolutely! To anyone interested in photography, has you think in a whole new way.",
                "I highly recommend this course if you are interested in the technical histories of photography, enjoy an immersive style of learning, and actually want a seminar where you really engage the readings with the work you see in Yales collections.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes!",
                "Definitely yes! Material Histories of Photography is a very fun course that steeps you in so much knowledge about the history and cultural influences of photography. The field trips we went on each week really helped me engage with the course materials. Our two field trips to the Lens Media Lab were especially exciting (we made cyanotypes and used the darkroom on our second trip!). Professors Raab and Angus are so kind and created a class atmosphere that was super welcoming. They even got a cake with a photo of our class printed on top to celebrate our time together.",
                "YES!!! One of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. It is simultaneously fun\/playful and also intellectually rigorous and engaging. Each week you get to see new items in Yale's collection. The professors and other students were great and really engaged with the material."
