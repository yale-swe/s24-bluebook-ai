                "Professor Caines is great and very kind. The class is pretty well structure, but I thought it was harshly graded in a completely unnecessary and nit-picky way. The quizzes were also very hard to prepare for because a lot of the quiz content was not on any problem sets. I found that very frustrating and stressful.",
                "This class is interesting but the fact that this is supposedly oriented towards non-STEM majors is a lie. There are significant physics concepts that, with no background in physics, make understanding lecture material extremely difficult. The TA grading the practice problems was often extremely unfair in grading, and the practice sets themselves often asked insane questions that are unanswerable.",
                "Well taught, psets spaced out well and engaging",
                "Strengths - very comprehensive, cool material \r\nWeaknesses - the grading on the psets was ridiculous.  Sometimes I felt like I was expected to volunteer details about complicated concepts that I would have had no way of knowing or understanding. The psets were very very long especially in the beginning of the course.",
                "For a science credit this was a solid course - I learned about a bunch of ideas in quantum physics and the work was not too bad (class met once a week + homework took max 2-3 hours a week)! One thing I thought could be improved was the layout of the lecture slides\/presentation of content - sometimes it was a little confusing how things were explained, and it could have been elucidated by making clearer connections between slides\/topics. One other weakness was that points were taken off on homework assignments (mine and other people commented on this as well) for minute details\/things that were barely covered in the reading.",
                "The material is very interesting, but ultimately falls flat because of the format of the course. It would be better as a twice a week, shorter lecture. I think the grading of the homework assignments could also be a lot better. Since we're graded on our understanding of material before we've even learned it in class, grading felt much more luck of the draw (did I happen to guess all the points that were included on the answer key even when questions didn't specifically ask about them) as opposed to a reflection of how much effort I put into any specific assignment. It would be better if readings were assigned before class and then homework assignments were due at the end of the day after class. That way, we'd still be familiar with the material before class, and we'd be graded on actual comprehension.",
                "Really really liked the breadth.",
                "Strengths - it was nice that it was a small ish class, and the Professor was clearly interested in the content. It was also a good introduction to many topics. I liked the marking scheme as it didnt rely on just exams or just weekly homework. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the psets were often marked arbitrarily, and points deducted according to a very specific marking scheme. I think the students who had some knowledge of quantum physics benefitted a lot more. The level of detail we learnt about each topic varied.",
