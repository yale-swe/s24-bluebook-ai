I really enjoyed getting to learn a bit about a lot of things.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Often we rushed into doing example problems before I (and I think my classmates) really understood the material conceptually. I think shifting the balance to spend a bit more time of the conceptual portion of the content (what was happening, why it was happening, where it happens in the real world, why it is important) would help me feel stronger going into example problems.",
                "The way this course was taught was very efficient. The lectures and short homework assignments were very effective in understanding the material before the exams, but luckily it also didn't take too much time out of my day to complete.",
                "I appreciated the homework assignments being after every lecture instead of one problem set as I was able to cement my in class knowledge better. The questions on the examinations were much harder than the practice exams, which I found frustrating.",
                "The strengths of the course was that the topics where very well explained in class and where taught at a good speed. One thing that I wish I had better access to was the explanation of the extra practice problems for each lesson.",
                "It didn't seem like we had enough homework, which made the actual learning very independent.",
                "The course was my favorite out of the courses I've taken so far.",
                "This course had the most online resources out of all my courses to further reinforce what was taught during lectures. The professor was easy to understand and her teaching method was one that allowed for the easiest comprehension on my part.",
                "Strengths: canvas had so much valuable information that was great for studying, the layout of the course material was spread out quite nice and it was easily charted on canvas. \r\nWeaknesses: the discussions were not immensely helpful to me. I prefer office hours.",
                "Strengths: Small section and great student to teacher interaction. Content was easy to understand, and if not there was also help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none"

The course is taught well, has many resources to learn the material and seek help, and has a smaller class size to allow for a better connection with the professor and ask questions.",
