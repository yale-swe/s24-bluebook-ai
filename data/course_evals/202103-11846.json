                "Adriane was a great professor that truly cared about her students, but this class was taught at a level that was way too difficult for an introductory physics class. Adriane will swear that this is the only way for her to teach us physics properly, but I think the level of engagement that was required for this course was just too much for an intro class.",
                "Strengths: AMAZING professor. she cares so much about every single student even though it is such a big course, and you can tell from the beginning and through the end that she really wants everyone to learn things that they can use, whether they're a physics major, premed, engineering student, or anyone else. All the office hours that she and the TAs and the peer tutors had were super helpful, and I felt so supported in this class.\r\nWeaknesses: not necessarily a weakness, but it is hard. the psets take a lot of time, so you have to be willing and able to put that time in. also, for me, I think it could have been helpful if we had some easier problems on psets as well as the more complex ones, so that we could make sure we had the information down first, and then figure out how to apply it to new situations.",
                "The strengths all lie in the outstanding teaching prowess of professor Steinacker. She rocks. If not for the obvious time and care that she shovels into the class, this would've been a miserable course with the difficulty of the psets and exams. Professor Steinacker, along with the availability of office hours and the strong community among students, made this class an overall positive experience.\r\nWeaknesses - the difficulty of the problem sets lent itself to the engineers of the class, not the premeds. This would not be a problem except that the majority of the class is premed.",
                "In the beginning, it was hard to figure out how to utilize office hours. However, after visiting once, it was much easier to utilize. I think most of the peer tutors were very helpful, though sometimes I heard one giving out incorrect information.",
                "The course is very good at teaching mechanics, which is its goal. The strategies used by the instructor are effective, and you'll learn a lot by taking this. There is a lot of work, but this is necessary to really understand the content.",
                "Some lectures were too focused on the proofs/derivations of some formulas. As a result, there was sometimes less class time devoted to actually applying these formulas, which were the subject of the PSETs and most problems we had.",
                "The strengths of this class are that the material is presented really well in lecture and is tied into really cool real-world examples. \r\nThe weaknesses are that the problem sets are really difficult and take a long time, and the reliance on trig/calc was a bit more intense than I would've expected.",
                "Strengths- The professor is very compassionate and tender-hearted. She obviously cares about her students and wants to see them succeed. The office hours are a tell-tell sign of this. \r\nWeakness- The exams were way too difficult this semester. They felt much harder than the p-set problems, which were VERY hard as is. The exams were humbling, but I guess thats also just a part of learning physics.",
                "Strengths: THE PROFESSOR. Professor Steinacker is by far the best professor I have had during my time at Yale. She is absolutely in love with physics and it is so clear to everyone. At the same time, she truly has a unique teaching style -- she is dynamic, engaging, and passionate beyond anyone I have ever seen. I learned so so much from her course. More than anything, I would encourage anyone to please take a class with Professor Steinacker. Beyond the amazing professor, this course covers so much important material which is really crucial for anyone studying STEM. There is a great foundation in math which I really appreciated, and there is such thorough exploration of the material.\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing!!",
                "strengths: institutes concepts previously learned in the week's lectures into the homework to solidify understanding, uses interactive example, ample peer tutors available\r\nweaknesses: too much work. I had to go to office hours every day of the week and it took away from time I could be working on other class work",
                "This is a hard course, but the professor, TAs, peer tutors, and reasonable grading make it very fair and a great course. I can't think of any ways that it could be improved. I am so glad this is the physics course I chose to take.",
                "A large strength of this course was the constant examples being shown in the lectures and the availability of peer tutors and office hours. A weakness was the large size of the lecture and limited interaction with the main professor.",
                "it's really hard -- but there is a lot of support available if you take it!",
                "Great course that really helps you learn physics. Lots of work but it's worth it to put the time in, because you will come out feeling accomplished. Hard course but not hard enough that it breaks you down. Lots of help available with office hours and peer tutoring.",
                "The content is very difficult but the professor does a great job explaining it. The amount of office hours is appropriate and very needed to do well on PSETs. I think the PSETs were a bit too hard, and that I would fare better by having more questions that were easier. The exams were also difficult.",
                "Strengths:\r\nGrading system favors effort and application to the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nKnowledge of physical concepts and connections are not stressed enough during class time. Essentially, only math and example problems are taught in class while physics is explained in office hours. It should be the other way around.",
                "This course was very interesting. However, I feel like I was somewhat inadequately prepared for the midterms, which consisted of rather complex variations of the problems we did on PSETs.",
                "Strength: Prof. Steinacker is a gem. Yes, she is passionate about the subject of physics - but even more so, she is passionate about helping students live and breathe physics. I have never met another professor who is more invested in her pursuit of teaching - whether it is hosting late office hours, answering late-night emails, or having the patience and kindness to hold in-depth, conceptual review sessions. Although I am a biology major and I've always been a fan of physics, Prof Steinacker seriously made me reconsider what I wanted to do as a career because she made me realize how much I love the problem-solving and math aspect of physics.\r\n\r\nWeakness: That being said about Professor Steinacker, I think a huge emphasis of the class was on math. Although I understand that math is inherent and necessary if you are to talk about physics, I wish this course was a little less rigorous in math and more rigorous conceptually. By this I do not mean to dumb down the math - I simply think that spending hours on a pset for algebraic manipulations is not productive in forwarding my understanding of physics concepts. Additionally, grading for psets and exams seemed to be extremely subjective/inconsistent across the board among TAs.",
                "I am a pre-med, and this course is required for medical school, but this is beyond the difficulty of any other intro class I have ever seen. I will never use any of the material that we learned, and the class felt pointless at times. We had an orbital mechanics problem on our final exam... I asked myself when I will use that in my medical career and still do not know the answer to that question.",
                "Professor Steinacker is great and makes class fun! I think watching short videos introducing the topics before class would be helpful.",
                "For me, the lectures spent too much time going over the specifics of doing the calculations for a given problem, making it difficult for me to engage with the material. I often felt like we were just being given an equation without really understanding intuitively why that equation would mean a certain physical concept, which means that I didn't really get an intuitive sense of what things like torque actually are when you're using them in a problem, and also meant that I frequently didn't understand why certain equations were used for certain problems, or how to read a problem and turn it into useful equations.",
                "Very difficult to fully understand content with many other intense courses. This course requires a lot of time and is very quickly paced.",
                "I feel like this course is more for people who already have a physics background coming into it. The professor does not teach concepts very well or at all, she just teaches the math. This is great for those who have seen the concepts before, but I had not, so it was very difficult for me and I had to teach myself nearly everything. I was talked to like I was stupid for asking conceptual questions. So, a lot of material was covered effectively, especially with the math aspect, but I wish that concepts were explained better and that I wasn't talked down to just because I have a different background that others. Also, the notes that were provided by the instructor were not as effective as I think they could have been. The review sessions were great and very helpful, however.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- lots of detail into subjects \r\n- opportunities to practice problem solving \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- goes fast",
                "Strengths: Professor is extremely passionate about teaching physics and very engaging. Content is well taught and expectations are made very clear. Grading is extremely lenient.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Exams are brutal. Difficulty wise they are more difficult than review questions for exams but less than that of psets. Though lenient grading makes up for it!",
                "The course was well organized and covered a lot of topics. Office hours were absolutely incredible and certainly greatly contributed to my success in the class. I really hope that these are kept by all future instructors. There are plenty of peer tutors who are easily accessible and helpful. Notes from every lecture are available on canvas which was incredible if you missed something or needed clarification. One negative for the course itself was that many students took the class without an interest in physics or physical science which altered the class to where it often felt like it was being taught to premeds when this is not the course for physics in biological sciences. It was very frustrating to experience this when I specifically took this course because it was NOT marketed for that purpose. The classroom in SPL was intolerably hot almost every day, and this was honestly distracting and draining when trying to understand lecture.",
                "The lecturing is very good. Overall, the course seems to place too large an emphasis on calculus and on trying to make problems unnecessarily time-consuming. It's good for problems to make the students think deeply about the concepts being learned, but making students solve messy integrals or do Taylor series expansions to approximate functions seems unnecessary. I like that the lectures focus on \"proving\" or deriving the core formulas of physics and then doing some examples. But the lectures moved too fast, and much of the problem sets just seemed like \"busy work.\" From an engineering standpoint, the problem sets were good practice for the real world, since they introduced a lot of complexity into the basic formulas we went over in class. But they should be simplified slightly so that students can just focus on the core concepts.",
                "The course has an immense amount of support in the form of office hours and study halls so that everyone from different physics backgrounds can succeed in the course.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was Prof. Steinacker -- she is so passionate about what she teaches, and she cares a lot about her students' success. Also, I felt like effort was heavily rewarded in this course. The problem sets and exams are structured in a way that lends itself to genuinely understanding and breaking down the material.",
                "Prof. Steinacker is a great lecturer. She is so passionate about the class and so knowledgable that she gets the information across very efficiently. Her notes are posted online which is a huge asset because sometimes we just blew through material and people would give up understanding in the moment. Psets are generally very tough - 100%s are attainable but only if you go to office hours to get your answers checked and/or are already a physics god... It is a bit frustrating that most students felt that they couldn't possibly get through a pset on their own, since office hours shouldn't necessarily be an essential part of a course (to be fair, the class doesn't have a section). That being said, there are so many office hours at various times of the week that you can basically always count on getting help and it is not difficult to seek out. There's also additional small-group support if you don't do well on the exams. The resources are plentiful, but the class is really quite tough. The exam questions are just as hard/sometimes even harder than the psets, which can make you feel a bit helpless since very few people can do psets alone. You do have the option to do corrections (as all classes should have!) for the midterms which is great for learning from your mistakes. Even though I struggled, I still learned a ton because the resources for learning were so strong. But I wish it were possible for us to cover fewer things more in-depth so that I could have gotten more confident in my physics knowledge overall.",
                "Weaknesses: \r\n\r\n1. You cant truly learn from class. You need to review literally everything in your own time \r\n\r\n2. The PSETs are so tough and they take points off so easily",
                "Steinacker is a great professor and the problem sets and exams were very fair. Lectures were very engaging and fast-paced; I would have preferred a slightly slower-paced lecture because I often found myself more focused on copying down what she was writing than trying to understand what she was saying. Overall, it was a great course and Steinacker was an excellent lecturer.",
                "Since the classes are usually of large sizes, it is difficult to ask the professor questions.\r\nI greatly appreciated the smaller groups that were formed to help smaller groups of students understand the material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker. Professor Steinacker was an amazing instructor whose passion for physics and teaching was palpable every lecture and office hours. She is undoubtedly the kindest and most enthusiastic professor I have had at Yale so far. She truly cares about each student in the class and wants to see them succeed. The problem sets were challenging and pushed us to take what we had learned in lecture a step further. They helped me truly understand the topics we learned in lecture and feel prepared for exams. Help was easy to find in daily office hours and study halls. Professor Steinackers teaching style is clear and easy to understand, and she provides her notes after each lecture. Weaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: excellent peer tutors and study halls. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: pretty fast pace, sometimes feels rushed; brutal problem sets. You definitely need to invest a lot of study hall hours into this course, I don't think it's something you can really do on your own time.",
                "Strengths: organized very well, many office hour options\r\nWeaknesses: fast pace of course \r\n\r\nThis class could be improved by posting the example problems before lecture to get more familiarized with each scenario.",
                "The psets have nothing to do with what we learn in the classroom. Unless you spend hours at office hours or are some kind of super genius, you'll never get them right. They're not even thought-provoking, they just have very specific ways to approach them that do not come intuitively to most people.",
                "this course is very well organized",
                "Strengths: lectures were clearly organized, and faculty and student support are very high. I appreciated that lectures were posted online, so that one could also refer to the faculty notes when studying for various exams. Professor Steinacker was always available for additional help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: inconsistent grading among TAs on both exams and problem sets.",
                "Strengths: The support is there! Steinacker and her peer tutors hold soooo many office hours literally almost everyday.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PSETS take so long. Each pset took me at least 10 hours a week.",
                "Exams did not represent material covered in homework.",
                "Strengths: There's ample opportunities to receive help outside of the classroom, including peer tutoring/ office hours every day of the week. Professor Steinacker also offers test corrections, which are very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: The class is not catered towards people who have not taken physics before, but is the only intro class offered. Although Professor Steinacker introduces topics, these are often brief and the PSETS assume you already have a lot of this knowledge.",
                "It's a pretty standard physics lecture course. Lecture material and problems sets were generally quite challenging, but the class offers so many great resources (office hours and peer tutor hours, multiple sessions almost every day), which is incredibly helpful. If you make an effort to take advantage of these resources, it should pay off.",
                "Strengths: plenty of office hours and study hours to work on the psets\r\nWeaknesses: some exam questions were worded in a very confusing way",
                "The professor was this course's greatest strength. She was extremely passionate and thorough, which i loved. Her exams were not necessarily easy, but they were fair.",
                "This course was taught by an absolutely excellent professor: That is its #1 strength. Weakness is that it is much to in depth of for an introduction to physics for pre-medicine students who do not need to explore such advanced concepts with a calculus background.",
                "A lot of work needs to be put in and sometimes you may not see the results from the get-go. Teaches a lot of perseverance. It is difficult to understand what exactly is being asked for sometimes.",
                "Steinacker is great, but psets are a lot of work.  Lots of office hours and peer tutor support, which was very helpful.",
                "This was a tough class with a very heavy workload at times.  I appreciated the rigor, but the difficulty and demand of the weekly psets often made fulfilling my other coursework demands difficult.",
                "Strengths were the professor making lecture very engaging. Problem sets required a good bit of time and thinking but for the most part were reasonable.",
                "Prof Steinacker is a highlight of the course. She goes at a very fast pace so it might be best to familiarize yourself with the concepts ahead of time. Office hours are very helpful and well-staffed. The course is very algebra-intensive.",
                "I feel as though the class was a little too challenging in the math department. Being corequisite with 115, we still went of multivariable in class and also, I felt as though many of the problem sets were more a test of algebra and calculus knowledge and problem solving. Often I felt as though the expectation of the math proficiency was too high considering the supposed corequisite level of the class.",
                "Something I would definitely consider a strength in this course is how well instrumented the academic help for students was throughout the semester - this includes the availability of peer tutors, T.A.s, and even the professor herself. This was very helpful, and completing all the assignments wiped have seemed impossible without this help. That could be a weakness as well, simply because it required so much time, and balancing other heavy classes is not easy.",
                "Id say the strength of the course was that the PSets were always enough of a practice for the exams and I really do have a solid understanding of the concepts that we were taught. However, I feel like the course couldve gone through Kinematics a lot faster in the beginning and spent more time on the last topics which included Moments of Inertia, Torque, etc. All of the topics covered in the last few weeks of the semester were very difficult and they couldve been gone through at a bit of a slower pace I think.",
                "Strength: challenging\r\nWeakness: challenging",
                "The course is set up to enable students to improve with time. In particular, revisions on midterms removes some of the stress involved with such assessments and encourages the analysis of one's own mistakes.",
                "The course was a really big time commitment - completing the homework definitely required spending a lot of time in office hours and studying with classmates, so weeks when other classes had large time commitments or schedule conflicts prevented me from going to office hours, the homework was very difficult to complete correctly and on time. Having the online lecture recordings was really helpful in preparing for the exams, and in retrospect rewatching the lectures would likely have helped with the homework as well.",
                "I felt that concepts were explained well in class but that it was often difficult to apply the equations we'd just learned to our problem sets. It would be helpful to have more example problems worked out for us.\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to have complete practice exams for the midterm and final, in addition to review sessions and assorted review problems.",
                "In-class lectures and the professor's notes were effective in learning the material. The professor and TAs also provided clear feedback and guidance during office hours.",
                "Strengths: availability of office hours \r\nWeaknesses: the blackboard could be hard to see from the back of the room, and it is difficult to follow along the lecture when were lost or got caught out by a small thing",
                "this was a fantastic well taught but very challenging course",
                "I think the problem sets could have been modeled more like the exam questions. Unfortunately the problem sets were so difficult that many students, myself included, felt forced to go to peer tutors for help, and ultimately were not able to practice on their own, which made it difficult to identify areas to study further in anticipation of a midterm or final.",
                "Strengths: grading is generous, lots of available opportunities to get help from TFs, instructor, peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: most time consuming course I've ever taken, it often seems like problem sets are not possible to do without going to office hours",
                "The psets were very difficult and lecture went very quickly. Otherwise I really enjoyed the challenge of the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker is a very good lecturer. The peer tutors in peer tutoring study hall were excellent.\r\nWeaknesses: It's a lot of content to cover in a semester, especially for students who have had absolutely no prior physics exposure."

            "comments": [
                "It's probably a requirement. You'll get through it.",
                "Yes, this course is well taught by Prof Steinacker, but you have to put in the effort!",
                "Yes, if you really want to learn physics. If you're reading this, you're most likely deciding which physics to take. I don't know anything about 200, but between 170 and 180 what I've always heard is that 180 is harder but much better taught. I definitely think that's true with Professor Steinacker, and in my opinion, that's worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to learn physics, that has prior knowledge in the topic, and is also adept with calculus.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning physics or need to take physics to fulfill a requirement. Even if you have physics experience, you can definitely still learn from this class. If you have taken AP Physics C in high school, this course will probably still be challenging but it will also feel like a lot of review at times. I did still learn things, though, and it was really good at solidifying my physics knowledge. However, taking 200 might be better for someone who feels very confident in their physics background.",
                "Yes and no. It's painful, but you look back and realize just how much you learned and how cool it is. Professor Steinacker is wonderful, and if you have a chance to take it with her, do it. It's worth the pain in the end.",
                "Yes, but be prepared to put in a lot of work. Also, go to office hours!!",
                "Yes - the lecturing is really good and the office hours are a helpful/good experience. It is a tough course though, so be prepared to put in the time.",
                "I would not. Unless you are a physics major, this class is too much physics for someone like a pre-med or otherwise. The exams were overly difficult and the psets were not much easier. This class is well taught however, but it is just the material that is overly difficult.",
                "YES! Please take this course! It is taught fantastically, and the material is so important (and so engaging!) for anyone with a STEM major. The exams are super fair -- definitely not a piece of cake, but absolutely fair. And, the problem sets are very helpful in reviewing the material.",
                "The professor was good and clearly interested in the success of her students",
                "YES! If it is taught by Professor Steinacker. Be prepared to put a lot of work and time into the psets, but go to the office hours and work with Professor Steinacker - you WILL understand the topics if you do that. Her exams are very fair and she provides an unbelievable amount of support. The TAs and peer tutors are also great and super helpful. The grading is completely reasonable so you can focus more on learning than on the grade. Take this course! Even as a premed!",
                "Yes, it's challenging but develops a good foundation and intuition for physics.",
                "Yes.",
                "Great course in which you'll actually learn a lot of physics. Steinacker is so enthusiastic and actually wants her students to learn. It's a tough course that demands a lot of time, but you feel supported throughout the whole process and will come out of it feeling accomplished.",
                "Yes, there is a lot to learn but it will not be easy and I would not recommend it if you have other PSET intensive courses.",
                "Not really. If this is a prereq for you, try to find something else. This course would be more properly described as a math course with physics problems on the psets. If that's what you're looking for, then go at it. If you actually want to understand the physics and apply it to your psets, then this course is probably not for you.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Not only did I learn physics, but I also brushed up on my math skills simultaneously .",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was extremely manageable coming in with an AP Physics background. If you do not have a physics background but are looking for a challenge, I would highly recommend if Prof. Steinacker is teaching.",
                "No it was extremely difficult",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student unless it is required for your major or pre-med requirements. The averages of our midterm exams were 60% and 50% respectively. Does that mean the entire class was not studying for these exams? Does that mean we are not knowledgeable in the sciences? The answer to the aforementioned questions is a resounding NO. The PSETs were difficult and almost impossible to complete without the help of a TA... how is this good practice for us to learn the material? The exams were unfair and asked us to complete tasks and problems for which we have never seen before. The exams did not allow students to portray their learning and mastery of the material, and it felt pointless at times to study.",
                "Yes, because of Professor Steinacker.",
                "The problem sets do take a lot of time, but there are many peer tutors and office hours to attend to get help. This class was kind of difficult, but overall alright.",
                "Yes, it is well taught and very interesting. It is also super fundamental to other engineering and physics courses",
                "Yes definitely! Take this over Physics 170 if you have the math and physics background (do we weary that even though no prior physics knowledge is necessary, it is extremely helpful as the class moves rather quickly)! Compared to other premed courses like gen chem and orgo, even though the content is hard, the class is very organized and taught well!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in physics or physical sciences. It is well organized, well taught, and well supported. I will say, however, that students who are not interested in physics but need the requirement or students who are more interested in biological sciences (...looking at premeds here), please take that designated course (PHYS 170 I think) or expect and prepare for a rigorous, math-based, physics course.",
                "I would recommend it only for students who did not take AP Physics C Mechanics in high school. Otherwise it will probably feel like a waste of time. Be prepared to do unnecessarily complicated problems for homework, and petty math like messy integrals. The course is just a review of AP Physics C Mechanics with more calculus. Personally I wish I had taken PHYS 200 since it's less work and covers some new topics like relativity. It seems like this course assumes students have taken AP Physics in high school. The classmates I spoke to who had not taken physics before were really struggling.",
                "Yes! This course builds fundamental skills and knowledge applicable not just to physics but engineering, medicine, and other subjects.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you need/want to study introductory mechanics, especially if Prof. Steinacker is teaching it. I'm personally not the biggest fan of physics as a subject, but Prof. Steinacker genuinely made me enjoy learning it, and I came to find it interesting by the end of the semester.",
                "If you need to take physics, you will learn a ton in this course. The support from Prof. Steinacker, the TAs, and the wonderful Peer Tutors is second-to-none for a Yale science course. That being said,  you may not thrive even if you utilize all of the resources, because the material is just that tough. So I wouldn't recommend this to someone just looking for any science credit...you will probably regret signing yourself up for so much work unless you have a super strong physics and math background to start. But if you have to take it, don't dread it. The psets are genuinely fun sometimes, especially when you have a breakthrough and realize you know how to work through a tough problem. Lecture is pretty engaging because Prof. Steinacker has a talent for teaching and wants students to enjoy the material as much as she does. I took this as a premed needing physics and don't regret it because I think I learned more than I would have in 170, but if you hated calculus or will have a super heavy course load at the same time, I'd avoid 180.",
                "No. Dont take this class. It sucks.",
                "Yes. This class is a great opportunity to learn the fundamentals of physics and, more importantly, problem-solving and critical thinking skills.",
                "No, unless it is a prerequisite. After taking the class I feel I will not really be able to apply any of the content in the future.",
                "Yes. This course helped develop my love for physics and taught me new and fascinating topics and techniques. I would especially recommend the course if taught by Professor Steinacker; she is truly fantastic. Students who enroll in the class should know ahead of time that it is math-heavy.",
                "Definitely don't take this course if it's not required. The content is not particularly intellectually challenging but the workload and the exams are brutal. PHYS 200 is a better option if you're looking to explore the field of physics.",
                "No unless you need to take it. If possible take it with Adrianne. The psets are no joke and take a lot of weekly time so plan that with your schedule carefully.",
                "I mean if you're thinking about this course, you probably have to take it. It's hard and it doesn't get better with time, but you have to do it. My advice: go to office hours whenever you can.",
                "yes! The course is organized so anyone can learn the material regardless of background",
                "Yes! This class is a great introduction to Newtonian mechanics and is very clearly and effectively taught. Most people take this class because they need to satisfy something for their major, but I could not recommend it more.",
                "Not really unless you have to take it for your major or are premed.",
                "No, but I also think it depends on how much physics preparation you have and how much you like the subject. If you've had the physics background for it, this course will be a lot of work but will be manageable. If you have not had the physics preparation for it, I would caution you against taking the course. Lectures are hard to follow along if you haven't already taken physics. You will probably be fine, but it will take an immense (and I really do mean immense) amount of work. Good luck!",
                "I would highly recommend taking this course with Professor Steinacker if you can. She is the absolute best. You can tell that she genuinely cares about her students and really wants them to succeed in her class and in life. As someone having taken IB physics before, this class did not necessarily cover a lot of new concepts for me (with the exception of some gravitation and orbital concepts, among others), but it did cover a lot of the depth that I didn't get in high school (especially mathematically) which I can confidently say solidified my knowledge of the subject. However, If you are planning on taking this class, 100% go to office hours for all problem sets. Not only is it a great chance to meet Steinacker (she loves meeting her students), but it will almost definitely help you finish faster and avoid stupid mistakes (her problem are often notoriously long and the average grades on them are very high, so even a small mistake can cost you).",
                "yes",
                "Yes! If you're choosing between physics 170 and 180, and Adriane is teaching 180, take 180 (as long as you are comfortable with integrals and derivatives)!  Adriane is truly a gem and her amazing teaching makes the class worth the workload.",
                "Only if it is required for your major, or if you are strongly interested in learning physics in depth.",
                "I would for the professor, she is what all professors should strive to be. The course itself: only if you need to because it is hard.",
                "Yes, A lot of work needs to be put in and sometimes you may not see the results from the get-go. Teaches a lot of perseverance. It is difficult to understand what exactly is being asked for sometimes.",
                "Yes, it was a prereq for me, but it made me find out how cool physics is.  The workload is a bit brutal though.",
                "Yes!  Steinacker is a very dedicated teacher who works hard to make physics accessible to everyone.  I'm not a big math person, but I left the class with a greater appreciation for the study and the thinkers who helped shape our understanding of the world (and the universe) to what it is today.",
                "I took one year of AP Physics during high school and found this class quite challenging. Although Prof. Steinacker says she is teaching as if we have no prior experience, I think it would be extremely difficult to keep up / do well in her class without having any physics background. But her Canvas notes and office hours were great resources. This class is definitely not an easy A; the psets were often very challenging and seemed impossible to me without the help of the TAs at the study hall sessions, and the exams were at a similar caliber (but without any help, of course).",
                "Yes, especially if it is a prerequisite, but could also be interesting just to learn about the subject matter.",
                "I would take this course only if its a prereq for your major. You wont go too in-depth into the physics principles themselves and the problems are more algebra-intensive than conceptual. As a prereq, its a good course.",
                "Really good introductory course. You're probably taking it because it's required, but if you actually enjoy problem solving and math you will for sure love the course.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone who enjoys working through physics/math problems and wants to be challenged in this field. It could help them learn a lot.",
                "I would only if they need to take it. The course is incredibly demanding and difficult and unnecessary if the student is not looking to be a STEM major or is not required to take it. However, I have still thoroughly enjoyed it, but mainly because I am a prospective Physics major.",
                "Yes, if you are able to spend the time every week in office hours, you will be able to gain a lot of physics knowledge from this course.",
                "This course has a difficult workload and it can be very hard to grasp the concepts at first, but it teaches students important things about physics.",
                "This course is essential to any student interested in the sciences and/or engineering.",
                "Yes! Adrianne is absolutely the best person to be teaching this course. It feels very rewarding when I can figure out the process to solving problems",
                "yes, if it is for your major or your very interested in physics",
                "I assume you have to take this course as a major requirement, otherwise, there are more enjoyable QR credits. This is the most time-consuming class I've taken at Yale, as you have to spend many hours a week at office-hours/study halls to understand the problem sets. Although the exams are hard (midterm 2 had an average in the mid 50s), exam corrections are available for the two midterms.",
                "I would recommend the class with the note that it is a lot of work.",
                "This class is really hard. I heard that the grading for intensive physics is much more forgiving so if you have to take intro physics for your major, consider 200 or 260 if you've taken any physics in high school, especially if you've taken AP physics. That said, I did learn a lot from this class, it's just that the grading is harsh."
