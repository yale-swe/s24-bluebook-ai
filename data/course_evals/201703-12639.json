    "This course gave me a far more nuanced understanding of terrorism, introduced me to terrorism scholarship, and made me more well-versed in debating over how to address the issue. I learned how to define terrorism, work with terrorism data, and present over a particular aspect of terrorism.",
    "You learn a lot of the theory behind terrorism, especially specific cases that might just appear inn the news and everyone assumes to know",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of what exactly terrorism is, its causes, and possible responses.  Would definitely recommend for students looking for a deeper understanding of a very interesting topic.",
    "This course further developed my understanding of the tools used to combat terrorism and the serious flaws many of them have.",
    "I learned the political theory to terrorism."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very engaging instructor, interesting readings, plenty of time for discussion, useful and productive preparation assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: Often the discussion would go off on a tangent, with two people going back and forth over one thing. This is great, but sometimes this would take so much time that we would not get through the presentation or cover important topics.",
    "Strength of the course was that discussion never ran out because it was such a current and sensitive topic. A weakness that I saw is that the course was always structured as to be a yes or no which I think simplifies the situation.",
    "This was a great course.  The reading material was interesting, and the syllabus topics were well chosen and planned.  Class discussion was usually good, although sometimes debate on particular topics would dominate the class, and therefore we would not cover everything from the reading in class discussion.",
    "While the material discussed in the course was interesting and relevant, I found the structure of class sessions to be unorganized and unstructured, especially compared to other Political Science seminars at Yale. Because so many students were enrolled in the course, discussion was often roundabout and I often felt like we were just teaching ourselves. This format has worked in other classes but only with the insightful guidance of a professor, which often felt lacking here."

   "comments": [
    "Pretty good course. Professor Weir is great and there isn't a single weekly topic that wasn't interesting. Several interesting guest speakers. Some occasional weekly assignments and a 12-15 page final paper. Each class is assigned to a student or pair of students so you don't actually end up hearing *that* much from Professor Weir. My only point of criticism is that you receive no feedback about your performance in the course throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, it is a great chance to discuss contemporary issues and the scholarly questions involved with them. You get to critically-engage with a diverse set of materials and have active and energetic discussions with your classmates. Be sure to have do the readings before class starts and to do your best on the assignments.",
    "It's a super cool course. The professor is also really cool and knowledgable. It's definitely worth taking a course that is on something what is so current and interesting.",
    "Absolutely, super interesting topic, great professor, reasonable workload, 10\/10!!",
    "This is a great course for people who both have and have not studied terrorism in the past. The course focuses on building a foundation for understanding terrorism, but there is the opportunity to dive deeper into the theory and compare it against real world examples for students who have a background in the subject.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, the professor is excellent and the syllabus is very interesting.",
    "Yes! This class allows all opinions to be shared, and Professor Weir is just the best.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other Yale students. While the material is appealing and interesting, the structure is poor."
