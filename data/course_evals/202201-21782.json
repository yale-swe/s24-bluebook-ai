                "The course breaks down the topic of ethics into several issue areas and components that comprise the field as a whole. I thought the textbook was a really useful resource, because it offers a clear framework and structure to work through individual issues. This was very helpful because you quickly realize that any ethical problem/dilemma is a thicket of connected issues and problems, and I really appreciated having some scaffolding for understanding the most relevant issue at hand. On a personal level, I learned how to think through and systematize my arguments about ethics. This includes identifying the most interesting criticisms/thoughts that came to mind, and articulating why I instinctively felt a certain way about the topic.",

                "Strength: I think Shelly is an amazing teacher and he really made each lesson worthwhile and interesting. I was constantly astounded by how quickly he could catch, clarify, and rearticulate the points my classmates were making in really clear and obvious ways  this was incredibly useful in this class because it's hard to express your ethical positions clearly. Shelly could ask questions that lead you to find out what you believe and why you do so, which made all the discussions more productive than they otherwise would have been. He is also a really committed teacher and was always available to talk about our papers and our work in class, and I thought that he was truly invested in our learning (and you know that he's been through all the conversations we had in class millions of times). \r\n\r\nI know that he's been described as a harsh grader, but I felt that my grades, whatever they were, were deserved. He also engages and expands on your work so much  I'm half convinced he writes responses that are longer than your essay just to prove a point  that there's really nothing to say about it. I am not a philosophy major so I had some hopes but no illusions about how I would do in the class. I did Credit/D/Fail the course and I'm not particularly devastated about my grades. In any case, it didn't seem that everyone was the verge of failing or that he's determined to tear your argument apart or anything.",
                "Strengths: high standards can be motivational, pushing students to work harder and engage much more deeply with the course. Extra readings and seminar discussions can be really interesting and thought provoking.\r\nWeaknesses: lack of TAs means that there is little support beyond going to Shelly's office hours, which can sometimes be very scary and disheartening. I think I would have appreciated a bit more support in this course (more carrot and less stick!). Especially given the extent and level of detail of Shelly's comments on every paper (some can be longer than the paper itself!), it would help to have guidance in implementing his suggestions and critiques, as it is quite overwhelming to approach on one's own.",
                "This was probably my favorite course Ive had at Yale. And I was absolutely bodied by it. Incredibly tough, but incredibly rewarding. Have no complaints."

                "Sure, if you are interested in ethics. I haven't taken very many philosophy classes but I think a key difference is that this class is not about recapitulating or analyzing the arguments of other philosophers, but rather about putting across your own argument in its most polished, persuasive form. In some ways this is harder because you have to think about what you believe in, but it's also very freeing. I don't think I've had a lot of classes that encourage you to think about your own reactions and to take them seriously the way this course has, and I think that it's worthwhile for this alone.",
                "Yes, but only if they are very interested in normative ethics, and if they will not be too disheartened by Shelly's very strict/merciless grading. Students should approach this class as if it were 1.5 credits.",
                "Yes. If youre on the fence, do it. Do yourself a favor. Youll come out of it a better thinker and writer. Theres nothing else quite like it. Sitting in a hot seat for a semester changes a man."
