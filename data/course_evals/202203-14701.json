                "I think this course gave a good overall insight into the early history of Western philosophy. It introduced philosophical thinking but did not have a very rigorous emphasis on proofs. We were definitely exposed to the biggest ideas in ancient and medieval philosophy.",
                "With no prior philosophy experience, I built a strong foundation in the discipline in this course. I found myself exploring new ideas and concepts that were explained thoroughly and clearly.",
                "This course enabled me to think more critically and logically about the subjects at hand. With DS philosophy, you really get to explore how to create and support an argument and how to write a philosophical paper, building the foundation for later philosophy courses if desired. Furthermore, this course really taught me to think abstractly amongst other things, for it emphasized thinking about thinking in ways I had never explored before.",
                "- How to perform a philosophical analysis\r\n- How to analyze philosophical texts from the perspectives of both language and content\r\n- How to read and dissect philosophical texts and arguments\r\n- The joy and value of reading ancient philosophy",
                "Taking DS Philosophy this first semester was most fruitful for me in the raw material which we learned and read from; it was such a wonderful experience charting the path of human thought, and the culmination in the reconciliation of rationality and religion at the end (with authors like Aquinas, Maimonides, and Ibn Sina) was especially important to me.",
                "I developed my logical thinking skills, discussion skills, and writing skills in this course. Philosophical analysis and dialectic was very new to me and it changed the way I approach ideas and helped me literally analyze ideas in a critical way, probing the arguments and assumptions they stand on at a level of rigor and detail I had never known before.",
                "DS philosophy succeeds in covering a lot of dense material over a short span. The take aways are familiarity with who the classic philosophers are, their key ideas, the key images they use that continue to be alluded to in Western thought and writing, and an understanding as to how a philosopher uses rhetoric and how to dissect a philosopher's rhetoric to identify the premises and possibly caveats of the argument.",

                "It covered a lot of material, but half of the time it just didn't make sense.",
                "The discussions we had in seminar were awesome. Lectures could be improved by providing the handouts or slides beforehand to review.",
                "I think the strength was the breadth of knowledge we got, which covered many different philosophers and works. The course could be improved by putting a little more emphasis on the arguments to prove claims.",
                "This course really excels in the syllabus materials, since very rich sections of the texts were chosen. Professor Grimstad also explained all of the daunting topics very lucidly.",
                "The strengths of this course include the seminar set up, which allows you to really dive into the more difficult aspects of the reading and get to listen to others opinions and build a deeper understanding of the material. Some weaknesses were in the difficulty of the material itself, but this cannot really be helped. Excellent lecturers helped to make the material more comprehensible for students, and the DA philosophy department was incredibly helpful and supportive.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Amazing lectures\r\n- Amazing seminars\r\n- Amazing readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Slightly too much reading! (But of course I understand that that may not be able to be amended)",
                "The strengths were the clarity with which the mail philosophical concepts were explained and pointed out. And I think it could be improved with more detailed feedback on the papers.",

                "absolutely. prof grimstad is amazing, and everyone should take at least one class with him",
                "NO. I feel like taking a philosophy course on its own in the future is more helpful than DS philosophy; nothing made sense and since we were going at so fast of a pace, all of the concepts were either condensed or explained poorly. There are a lot of pretentious students who have taken philosophy before and like to show off by referring to obscure concepts or name-dropping random philosophers, and it can be confusing and irritating sitting through class.",
                "Yes, Professor Grimstad made philosophy fun",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but the caveat is that they have to be interested in all elements of DS. I dont think it is a good course to take if you are only interested in the philosophy and not the literature or historical and political thought.",
                "Yes! Philosophy is such an overlooked field, but I think the critical thinking skills it fosters can be applied to all aspects of academics and life.",
                "Yes- although philosophy was difficult for me, I dont regret taking the course whatsoever. It provided me with a foundational knowledge on important ancient philosophers that shaped modern thinking and really sharped my understanding on how to formulate an argument.",
                "Absolutely. Every single text was fascinating and led me to visceral reactions. I felt the texts led to a level of engagement I had never known before. I loved thinking them through and then thinking through my own thoughts on them. Even if I hated the content of what I was reading, I still found it so exciting to read and analyze them. There truly was not a dull moment.",
                "Yes ! DS Philosophy is a class which has something for everyone, as it not only teaches on foundational philosophical texts and schools, but also it gives its students an opportunity to become bona fide philosophers and take an honest jab at first comprehending then evaluating the different philosophical ideas which have guided thought to this day.",
                "I would recommend DS Philosophy if you want to become well-versed in the history of philosophy and the Western intellectual tradition as well as in developing GOOD critical thinking skills and are prepared to make the best out of a program that requires a lot of compromises between the amount of reading you do, the quality of essays you write, and aspects of your personal well-being such as sleep and social life. It is possible to do it all successfully, but sometimes one of these aspects has to be sacrificed to an extent and that's OK. The important thing is to learn to recognize when it is worth it to sacrifice which.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much and Professor Grimstad cultivated a warm environment where everyone asked lots of questions and learned from one another."
