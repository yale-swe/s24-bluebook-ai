                "This was a small seminar so it really helped us practice close reading, thinking on our feet to respond quickly, and speaking up. It also asked us to think about Black religions as really intersectional. Some of the religions and movements we studied were ones I wasn't familiar with at all, so I appreciate learning about them even more. We also stretched our understanding of Black religion-- how it can operate almost secularly, or how it might have political aims but pretend to shun politics. Discussions\/assignments definitely helped me to be a more critical reader.",

                "I really liked the creative assignments! They were definitely a strength of the course and helped break up all the other assignments I was assigned in other classes. Wish assignments gave us more room to develop our ideas.  Another strength was the way Professor Turner kept us engaged with the readings through discussion activities and even bringing in the authors-- it's one of the first classes I've been in where we had authors visit.",
                "Strengths= LOVED the discussions, and they were structured well and very intimate in our small group. Also I really enjoyed the assignments, which didn't all fit the same style but offered different options for demonstrating your understanding. I felt the assignments really helped me to explore the core concepts in new ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses = could be the pandemic talking, but sometimes the readings felt very long. At times I struggled to connect the readings to each other, because of the density of the texts.",

                "Yes, would recommend this course! It's a really unique class because we had people from all different majors and class years, and everyone was able to participate and bring their own experience to the table for better discussion. I learned a lot about both Black religion\/politics today and in the past, and a lot of material that isn't going to be covered in other history courses.",
