Having never taken a philosophy course in the past, the proof-like formula opened my eyes and provided a concrete argument to fall onto and guide my essays. Additionally, when I first heard that 5 pages would be little room for a philosophy essay, I was surprised. Having written 5 page essays last semester, I had never had the issue of too little room. But after having taken the class, and having gone even over 3 pages extra in my essay before cutting down, I am very happy to say that I really did learn to expand my thoughts and work out every little detail.",

The content was definitely interesting, but the most valuable thing I took away was definitely the analytic mindset it helped me develop. Ethicists think very systematically about arguments, breaking them into premises and then interrogating each one (which often involves breaking them down even further into sub-arguments). Section and the papers give you the ability to try your hand at that style of thinking, which is very valuable; it isnt entirely unlike what you might see in other subjects, but its very rigorous and important to practice."

You learn how to structure an ethics paper and to think philosophically. Professor Kagan is incredibly intelligent and an engaging lecturer. Weaknesses: you're graded on improvement. I worked really hard the whole semester to do well, did every reading, had an A in section participation, got a decent grade on the first paper, but did worse on the 2nd paper which lowered my chances of an A. I ended up Cr\/D\/failing but still learned a lot throughout the semester. So while I have no regrets about the effort I put in the course, I do feel like the philosophy of grading on improvement doesn't actually reward students as effectively as it is believed.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is a very clear lecturer and breaks down complex readings into intelligible theories\r\nWeaknesses: there's a big range in engagement in sections",
                "very engaging--everyone was able to participate in lectures to get a consensus of people's thoughts about certain hypotheticals. I enjoyed the specific conversations that we had",
                "Strengths: Shelly is really fun to listen to and his lectures are always super engaging. Weaknesses: grading can feel harsh but it's really because the material is difficult",
                "Strength: listen, Shelly knows what he's talking about. He made us test a lot of abstract concepts with very tangible examples, and I think that's probably the best way to do it.\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1.) Please give us an outline at the start of class. Half of the time, I had no idea what I was supposed to be taking notes on. Was something a tangent or the main idea? Is this a key example we're going to spend all of class on? How would you define this term? I never knew. Literally, a single slide with a numbered list and sub-bullets would work wonders.\r\n2.) The lack of correlation between lecture, section, and readings. It's really hard to be a busy little Yalie and motivate to do the readings and you know there is zero incentive to do them. I didn't do a reading after week 2 (I wanted to, I swear, but I was busy), and I don't think I missed any conceptual stuff. \r\n3.) Stop clinging to the grading curve of the Yale blue book. It just discourages people from caring about your class by incentivizing taking it Credit\/D\/F and doing the bare minimum. Also, all the TAs giving out unnecessarily low section grades at the first check-in just to turn section into a bloodbath felt gratuitous.",
                "Lectures can be hit or miss. Personally I loved my TA, so section was always awesome. However, lectures, reading, and section are essentially never all on the same sequence, so most weeks you'll find yourself jumbling between topics, which can get a little confusing.",
                "First and foremost, Shelly is a legendary lecturer. Everyone knows that. He doesn't disappoint. He's the best lecturer that I've ever seen and the best lecturer that I'll ever have. He's also very accessible to the students in his course. He's quite humble, too; I was reading the other day that he's somewhat famous in Korea. Who knew?\r\n\r\nThe course seldom directly addressed the assigned readings in either the lecture or the discussion sections, which sadly caused some less-motivated studentsmyself includedto stop doing the readings (sorry, Shelly!). This is actually quite regrettable in retrospect because if I could've found the motivation to do them, they would've been very beneficialboth in terms of the course and my performance on the papers and my broader intellectual development.\r\n\r\nIt's widely understood that the grading standards in this course are tougher than for any other course. That is truealthough possibly confounded by the fact that many students take the course Credit\/D\/Fail and are less motivated to put meaningful effort into their papers. For instance, I received B+ on my first two papers (I don't know about the last one) but only really spent 23 hours on each of them, whereas a philosophical paper merits far more time than that. What's perhaps less discussed is that the standards for section participation are also higher than other courses. This makes the sections an unpleasant experience for the introverted and shy folks among us. The sections were, in any case, quite enlightening; I still chose to sit through mine (largely without participating) even though I Credit\/D\/Failed the class and didn't need to be there based my paper grades.",

                "Shelly's lectures are among the best lectures I've ever had at Yale, and I'm a second semester senior. He makes an active effort to involve and include the students in his lectures, for example by polling them on their ethical intuitions. Shelly also always stays after class to talk to students and answer individual questions, and I had a number of interesting conversations with him this way. The students in the course also tend to be very engaged, making for a great section.\r\n\r\nI wish there were more contemporary readings assigned, particularly shorter papers that were roughly of the style we were expected to write papers in.",

                "I really wish there had been more guidance with how to navigate writing philosophy papers. I also feel like the readings we were doing didn't always match up with what we were discussing in lecture or section that week. I think sections are the biggest strength of the class. However, we weren't really ever given feedback on what we were said during section, so it was hard to figure out what kind of logic was \"wrong\" until getting back our paper grades. I think the course could be improved by more teaching during section rather than it being a facilitated discussion among students.",
                "Kagan is a good lecturer. The readings are also a decent length and do overlap well with what is covered in class. Participating a lot in section can be annoying but as long as you show up and pay attention in class you'll be able to speak\/ follow along. The grading can also be harsh but as long as you run your outline by your TF you'll be fine.",
                "Strengths are the weekly discussion sections and the paper assignments, which helped me learn and become a better thinker. It could be improved by making the lectures more engaging -- maybe with some handouts or writing on a blackboard, or more interactive where students can share ideas.",
                "Good overall",
                "Lectures are entertaining and easy to follow. Discussion sections are useful for thinking through  challenging ideologies. Structure of submitting and working on paper is poor as discussion section leaders are not always paper graders. TAs not very helpful.",
                "Pretty standard course with a lecture and discussion section. Discussion sections were well organized and relevant to lecture material. The topics covered were pretty broad and some lectures only seemed to scratch the surface of the topics at hand, but were always useful and informative.",
                "Shelly is a great lecturer and super interesting. I would recommend just recording them on your phone and taking notes after class so you can fully engage with some of the cool ideas and hypotheticals he talks to. Section is hit or miss, so maybe generalizing those more would be good. Grading also tough",
                "Prof Kagan is a wonderful orator, however, I often found the path of his arguments difficult to follow. For an introductory course, it would serve better to lay out the foundation clearly before diving into hypotheticals, as in ethical egoism says this...  (There was some of this, but there could have been more). Additionally, the last class left me feeling confused about the purpose of the course.",
                "I feel like the course discourages learning because Shelly tells you at the start that you arent as smart as you think and doing well will be hard. I know my friends and I put our all in papers just to be told that it is because of the grading system that it isnt reflected in our grades. This makes it hard to put in effort when the professor tells you its almost impossible. It is also hard when others have written philosophy papers before and you are being compared to them.\r\nI think the entire class needs to be restructured to actually teach ethics without such high stakes.",
                "Variability between sections is high",
                "I think Shellys lectures do a good job of engaging us as he walks through each of the theories we discuss, and I really relished the opportunity to talk through these issues with my peers in section. I also appreciated the fact that readings werent too long, so we could focus on absorption rather than page turning. My one suggestion is that we get more guidance on what Shellys looking for in a philosophy paper earlier on (perhaps with a sample paper), since I really didnt know what was expected until one of my friends sent me a sample A paper before the second paper. I also think theres a lot of variability between TFs in terms of guidance and feedback (Daigle seemed like she provided a lot more).",
                "course outlined well, but grading is too harsh",

                "Strengths: Lectures were very engaging, TFs helped a lot with papers, and the content was very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were a lot of discrepancies with how TFs operate with their students. I had a great TF who was willing to meet with me a lot on papers with individual meetings, some TFs held writing workshops for their students, and other TFs barely helped their students during meetings. I appreciate that TFs can choose how they want to help their students, but it is difficult for others to succeed for those that have TFs that aren't as supportive as others.",
                "I thought that everything about the course was strong. Shelly Kagan is a phenomenal lecturer and turned some rather dry material into a really compelling lecture day in and day out. The workload was manageable, and with the help of the TFs and Kagan, the work itself was also perfectly accessible. I thought that there was a great balance of depth and understanding. For example, none of the paper prompts were overly complex by themselves, but they allowed for a lot of interpretations and incited a lot of thinking without getting us bogged down in trivial details. All in all a great class and one I'd recommend to anybody.",
                "Strengths: lectures are very interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Sections feel like such a pressurized environment that it's hard to actually learn rather than just focus on getting a good grade. I feel as though if section wasn't graded so harshly, it would be easier to actually listen to my classmates' thoughts, rather than simply sit there hearing them in the background as I think of something to say.",
                "The strengths are very interesting lectures and engaging TFs! Shelly is a great lecturer who always involves real world applications to make abstract subjects very tangible. One of the downsides is that the readings are rarely brought into lecture or section, so it kind of makes them pointless. Another is the horrendous grading policy. The majority of people get Bs while only a few select will get As, so it makes the class very hard to do well in. I think a more traditional grading policy would sway less people away from taking the class because the topics are essential to forming a strong personal ethical system.",
                "It doesn't make sense to me that readings, lecture, and section aren't even supposed to cover the same material\/work together. I also think that while Shelly is a great lecturer, a little bit more organization or an outline for lecture would help me understand the material better.",
                "I wish discussion sections were based more off of readings and focused on how we could write our papers.",
                "Nothing to be improved, it was a wonderful course",
                "The lectures from Professor Kagan where very engaging and thought provoking. However, the class feel less enjoyable when it asks students to write their own papers. There are not example essays provided and the TAs are not allowed to look at rough drafts to see if you are heading in the right direction. Ultimately throughout my time I felt like was set up to fail my first paper. Professor Kagan does provide a sheet on what an ethics paper should be. But the sheet is more of how an ethics paper should be organized and its way to long to the point were by the time one reads it they forget the point of the sheet. Ultimately, when writing papers students are largely abandoned. I do not think the class is \"difficult\" rather the class leaves students alone to figure things out. While this is enjoyable when it comes to thinking about one's opinions, it's not enjoyable when it comes to writing papers which are basically how you get your grade. I felt even now at the end of the course I do not know what a good philosophy paper is or what makes a philosophical argument good. The papers therefore were extremely stressful and for an introductory course somewhat harmful to my views on taking more ethics courses in the future. There should be more writing support not just 30mins with a TA where most of the time will be spent just wrapping your head around the prompt. E",
                "Lectures are brilliant, Shelly Kagan is the best lecturer I have had at Yale (albeit this is only my second semester). However, there is major discrepancy across grading papers and evaluating section performance depending on the TA.",
                "It was a good course and if you are engaged with the material and meet with your TA it makes the learning experience better.",
                "lectures are awesome, section could be more helpful in terms of learning how to adequately write papers",
                "The mixture of lecturing and discussion section was a great system to teach new ideas and then review them and allow for questions and practice. Although we did get useful handouts outlining the theories discussed in class, which was very helpful in the essay writing process, having a source on canvas to go over the key points of lecture might also help with review and essay writing.",
                "Strengths: Shelly is the best lecturer I have ever had. It was truly a pleasure to go to class. Every lecture was very well organized and was always engaging. The readings were of a reasonable length. I loved that Shelly was willing to answer so many questions after class. It was helpful for getting things clarified, and it was fun to think more about what was discussed in class. Weakness: A lot of the readings (particularly Mill and Kant) were really hard to understand, as they were supposed to be. But I think I got really bogged down in definitions (such as a priori), so I wish I had some sort of additional aid (like an introductory essay that would have helped better understand the readings) so I could focus my attention on the philosophical argument instead of on deciphering the text. Often the reading became easier after Shelly's lectures, since he explained the arguments in a much more accessible way.",
                "Strengths - no exams \r\nweaknesses - super harsh grading, not very engaging, sections are not enjoyable and require much participation, if you participate in section 5-6 times in 50 minutes you get a B, not an accommodating class",
                "I wish the course had more written out and hand out materials. Sometimes I was lost in my notes because the professor spoke fast. With such hard material it would help to have more handouts for the very basics.",
                "This course is difficult, which is odd for being an introductory course. The standards need to change in order to be improved. Nonetheless, the content itself is great and at times can be intellectually engaging.",
                "A strength is definitely Shellys lectures. Shelly is a fantastic lecturer, both because he is extremely animated and because he is very skilled at using examples to illustrate concepts clearly. \r\n\r\nI also really appreciated how Shelly made himself available to the students in the class. He always welcomed questions during or after lecture and offered for students to meet with him outside of class, which I did twice  hes not one of those famous professors who says hell meet with his students and doesnt, he actually follows through, and I really appreciated that. \r\n\r\nSection was a strength as well. I had a really incredible TF, more on her later, but section was structured to be extremely interactive and I thought it did a really solid job reinforcing the material from lecture. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness, one that youve probably heard about but nonetheless holds, is the grading. I get where Shelly comes from on this: yes, grade inflation is very much a thing (https:\/\/www.gradeinflation.com\/) and I understand that as a professor he has the right to curve the class however he wants to. (If anything, he probably gets worse reviews for insisting on the harsh grading, so I have respect for his conviction here.) \r\n\r\nThat said, prepare yourself: The papers are graded very harshly. A mere 15% of the class got an A or an A- on the first paper. Shelly insists that in the end, he rewards improvement and is somewhat nice with grades. But still, Im the type of person who cant help but be stressed by this sort of thing. Maybe the harsh grading made me work harder than I otherwise wouldve, but still, I would say it definitely impeded my ability to enjoy the class."

                "no.",
                "I would if the student is sure they are interested in philosophy, and if they have a background in other philosophy courses.",
                "No unless it is required for your major. I think the grading is incredibly unfair. GPA matters for a lot of grad schools and you shouldn't have to turn in grad-level work to get an A on a paper.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as long as they have time for it. The papers will take time even though they are 5-pages because you have to follow a certain format and you have to make sure that you're really thinking through your argument. I would suggest trying to follow a thought-process that your TF would agree with (go to their OHs religiously if you end up taking this class!) because they are the ones grading and advocating for you when Professor Kagan brings all the TFs together.",
                "It depends what matters to you. If you're looking to take an interesting class and one that you'll probably think about long after it ends, you should. If you're gonna spend the whole time stressing about your grades, I wouldn't. Obviously, if it's a prereq\/requirement for your major this isn't super relevant.",
                "Yes. It is a fun course, especially going to discussion section after hearing Kagan's lectures",
                "For anyone interested in moral philosophy, I would 100% recommend this course (maybe take in Credit\/D\/F if you're worried about your GPA).",
                "No. Take it if it's a pre-req. This class could literally be three sheets of notes and I would feel just as smart.",
                "Yes. Essays aren't that difficult, as long as you make sure you meet with your TA often, and that you really understand what a philosophical essay is actually like. Find out exactly what your TA is expecting of you, and the class will be a relatively stress-free and enjoyable experience.",
                "It's a great course that you should take, so long as you're sufficiently interested in the material to pay attention in the lectures.",
                "yes a good intro class",
                "Absolutely. If you want a class that you know you will get an A in, dont take it. If you want to learn, grow, and understand Western ethics at its root, take this class.",
                "I would if it is credit\/d\/failed",
                "Does your heart burn with a desire to consider what really matters? Do you feel duty bound, or emotionally pulled, towards thinking ethics is one of the most important things you could possibly try to learn? If so, you should take this class, and it doesn't really matter what major or year you're in. Just take it.\r\n\r\nThis class will not give you an answer to ethics; all it will do is raise more questions (assuming you haven't already asked them yourself). But it will give you a better idea of what the important questions are, and how to think about them. If you put in effort on the papers, you will also learn to think better.\r\n\r\nIf you mostly want an interesting class or some kind of credit, I can't really assess whether you should take this class, because that's not why I took it. It's not very much work if you credit\/d and don't really try to do well. But why would you do that? Are you really going to choose ethics as the course not to take seriously?\r\n\r\nYou ought to behave ethically, and to do that you ought to figure out what \"behaving ethically\" means, and so therefore it seems you ought to do something like taking this class. You can start thinking about ethics in many ways, but most of them don't come with the side effect of a Yale College course credit or discussions with Shelly Kagan.",
                "Absolutely. You get out of this class what you put into it. I loved it. Take good notes and do not take notes on a computer. It really helped me to conceptualize the lectures to write on paper.",
                "Yes - great course and Shelly is amazing",
                "No. Not at all.",
                "Intro to Ethics is without a doubt a 10\/10 course I would recommend to any other student. I would go as far as to say it should be required for all Yale students to take at some point in their time here. Shelly Kagan is famous for his harsh grading, and while there is some truth to this, most papers are graded by your TAs so you will probably receive a fair grade.",
                "Would recommend this course if you are planning to take it credit\/d\/fail.",
                "I would. The class is not nearly as hard as rumored (as long as you have your TF read your outlines). Kagan is also a very good\/ clear lecturer and the paper topics are fun to write about.",
                "I would recommend, with the caveat that it is really hard to get a good grade in the course, and so it might be good to take it Credit\/D\/Fail to avoid stress. At the same time, the harder you work on the assignments, the more you learn.",
                "Yes with the intention of credit D-ing the class. Although the topic is interesting, very little is done to help us understand the intricacies of the ideologies. The professor claims at the very beginning of class that many of us will not know how to write a philosophy paper and will do poorly on the first one. Yet, TAs and professor do very little to address paper writing and help through the process. Rather, we are left just failing with little feedback.",
                "I kind of just randomly decided to take this course and it was very worthwhile. Definitely not easy, but worth the time.",
                "Its a good class to find out if you are interested in formal philosophy, because it requires a lot of abstract thought. I still like philosophy but realized that majoring in it is not for me from this course",
                "Not unless you have to take it",
                "No, not unless it is a prerequesite. It is not designed for learning and is a bad introduction to philosophy.",
                "Sure for a major req - for fun if you are ready to commit",
                "I would. I think the topics we discussed were interesting and important and Shelly does a good job of walking you through the material in an engaging way. I also think the sections are a great place to exercise your critical thinking and discussion skills and both section and the papers provided us with the opportunity to do philosophy rather than hear what some dead, old, white people have had to say. I will say, try to find someones old sample successful paper if you can, because I think the guidance going into the first paper isnt enough to know what theyre looking for.",
                "Yes, for pre-requisite and to learn more about ethics",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The class opened my eyes to moral ways of thinking I had never considered. However, I would classify it as a challenging course.",
                "Yes! This is a great intro course to learning about ethics and morality. Shelly does a great job of keeping students engaged and interested during lectures.",
                "I would and already have. Well, I would at least recommend that they take at least some course with Professor Kagan, even if it's not Ethics. That man is electric, and even though he's the \"hardest grader at Yale,\" that's reconciled several times over by his lecturing capabilities, not to mention that his philosophy behind being such a difficult grader is understandable.",
                "Yes. I think it's a great quintessential Yale course. Professor Kagan is an incredible lecturer and the fact that he teaches so fluidly (no notes, logical progression of themes) make it a different class than most, as well as a fun challenge.",
                "Yes, but be wary of the grading policy. Its common advice to take the class credit\/d\/fail, which I would agree with.",
                "If you want to do intro ethics, do it to it.",
                "No!! Stay away. I hated this class. Grading was incredibly inconsistent. Your grade depends on almost entirely on what teaching assistant you get, so good luck. During lecture, no one paid attention. Everyone was shopping online or doing other homework. PRO TIP: Just create a Google doc, share it with a bunch of friends in the course, and take turns taking notes. That way, only one person at a time has to listen to Shelly Kagan's rambling, and your time will be (fortunately) better spent doing other things.",
                "Absolutely. Especially so with my TA. Section was something that I found myself looking forward to every week. The section for this course has to be my favorite class I have taken in all of Yale so far.",
                "If you know how to write an ethics paper going in, you will have a good time. If you are bad at writing, then be warned there is very little support. Ironically for a introductory course, you will not be told what makes a good philosophical argument or what makes a good ethics paper. What makes the class difficult is simply figuring out what an ethics paper is because no one will tell you. The thinking and philosophy is fun but not when it comes to the essays.",
                "Yes, if you wish to learn about morality and ethics this is probably the best way to do it. Worse case scenario, you CDF it and itll be one of the most worthy courses to use one of those. However, choose your section very carefully, since the TA single handedly determines your grade. The papers are definitely harshly graded but if you seek sufficient guidance from your TA and regularly follow lecture, I dont believe it should be hard for anyone to receive a reasonable grade (B+) in the course but if you wish for more, it would require some good amount of dedication but all you need to demonstrate is your ability to individually present unique and critical analyses.",
                "Yes highly",
                "yes, but know it is hard and requires a lot of commitment. if you are interested in ethics though, you should definitely take it",
                "Yes. As described above, my essay writing skills improved significantly over the course of the semester. While reviewing my essays, I learned how to read from the perspective of an \"outsider\" who knew nothing of the subject, and made sure to define, elaborate on, and clarify what might make sense to me as a student but was actually difficult to understand from someone not versed in philosophy. I think that this skill can be applied to all forms of essay writing, and that's why I think that even stem majors would take a lot out of this course.\r\nThis course also introduced me to various theories of how the world works, some of which I spent days on afterwards just trying to wrap my head around, such as determinism. I had never considered the morality in my daily life and what system I use to justify what I do - it was usually just what felt right. Having a list of moral theories encouraged me to reflect on my motivation for acting as I do, and I think that this type of self reflection should be experienced by everyone.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Simply because Shelly is such an incredible lecturer. Even if you're not interested in the content, I think you'll find the course interesting just because of his lecturing. But if you're not convinced, do yourself a favor and show up to at least one of his lectures before you graduate. Another great thing about this course is that you get good feedback on your essays, and learning how to write a tight argument is an invaluable skill. People will complain about the harsh grading, but if you put in the work (internalizing what you learned in class, spending a lot of time thinking about your paper, maybe rewriting it) and talk to your TF, then I think you can get a decent grade. He also counts your later essays for more if you show improvement. So please don't let grading be the thing that stops you from taking the class. Lastly, it's a good idea to spend some time thinking about the nature of morality (utilitarianism isn't as crazy as it seems).",
                "If they want an easy class, no. If they want an intro ethics class, yes. If it has nothing to do with their major, no.",
                "yes",
                "I am unsure if I would recommend this course to other students for the sake of being an introduction course. The standards felt unrealistically high for an introduction course. Knowing nothing about philosophy and then taking this course, I feel inclined to step further away from it.",
                "Overall, yes, because of the fantastic lectures and because this course intellectually challenged me like no other course Ive taken at Yale. But be warned about the grading. Also, note that its not just papers: Section is also graded based on the quality of your participation. I get why Shelly does this, but also, be prepared for sections that feel adversarial because of it. \r\n\r\n(Also, maybe this is just the nature of philosophy, but the class being graded largely based on papers means how well you understand the material isnt that highly correlated with your grade. Rather, its about whether your TF liked your take on a few slices of the material in your papers. This might work in your favor, but its worth knowing.)"
