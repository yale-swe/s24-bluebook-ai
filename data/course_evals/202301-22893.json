                "SUCH A GREAT COURSE. Learned and improved in writing to much. Loved the feedback and engagement of the seminar style. First time taking a creative nonfiction writing course and I really enjoyed it",
                "I learned how to write more clearly and efficiently while also learning different writing techniques.",
                "I became a much better writer. The essays are flexible in topic, so you can basically write whatever you want however you want. That allowed for a lot of freedom in writing which I enjoyed. Because of this freedom, I learned how to be funnel creativity much more than I would if I took a class on academic writing.\r\nI also learned about what a good essay is.",

                "Strengths: Interesting readings, careful feedback on writing, translating readings into methods that we can use in our own writing.\r\nPoints of improvement: perhaps less reading would allow for a more careful evaluation of the techniques that each author uses",
                "readings were very fun and essays helped me learn a lot. I just wish there was more time available between receiving feedback from our first drafts and when the final draft is due so we can work on improving our essays more. Examples of good essays would also be helpful just to have an idea about what the expectations are",
                "I adored 120! And I'm not an English or humanities-adjacent major! I thought that the seminar style format of the class worked so well, and the essays that we read and wrote during the semester were fun and interesting. Additionally, being able to turn in and receive feedback on an ungraded rough draft before being graded on a final piece relieved so much of my stress. Ms. Jones always facilitated productive discussions, and working with classmates on their essays helped us grow closer to one another. The classroom vibe was great :) \r\nOccasionally, the reading load was a bit heavy, as we often didn't have time to discuss every piece in class, but each essay chosen by Ms. Jones was both relevant and educational.",
                "It was a brilliant course I loved it",
                "It was a pretty solid course I dunno what could be improved.",
                "Strengths are the seminar style and Ms Jones. Shes is very nice and gives great feedback on essays!",
                "No weakness, the strengths were that the essays were spread out so it was a manageable workload.",
                "Strengths: freedom to write how you want, fun\/interesting readings, fun\/interesting essay prompts, intimate and friendly classroom setup, not too demanding of a syllabus\r\nweaknesses: the way we talked about the readings could be boring sometimes. This is because we would analyze their literary moves rather than just talking about what they wrote, which sort of beats the soul out of a writing piece through over analyzing and misses the point by not talking about it.",
                "The topics for each essay are very interesting, and the readings that accompany them are sometimes very interesting. I think the readings are not always very strong, and oftentimes it felt like the essay we were reading could not really be applied to the essays we were expected to write due to a gap in experience, thematic nature, or simply length.",
                "I enjoyed the peer review structure of the class, as I thought hearing from other students on my own piece was incredible helpful, while I also valued getting the chance to read and learn from my peers' work. I think the class is too focused on reading and analyzing writers' works; while it was incredibly helpful, I think we devoted too much time to talking about the pieces in class, and we could have benefited from doing more writing exercises in class. I also thought that while I got a lot of feedback in my papers, I often felt that I didn't completely understand why some of my papers would get one grade and others would get another. More clear feedback as to the reasoning behind the grading would be helpful."

                "Yes! If you need a writing credit, and enjoy self reflection, 120 is the way to go. We had a mix of all grade levels in our section, and the fascinating blend of personalities and life experiences to learn from made this class the most personal academic experience I've had at yale so far. Be warned, though, that drafting and editing can take a large amount of time if you're a perfectionist about things like I am.",

                "YES YES YES! My favorite course this year and it was such a nice break from traditionally academic research papers. The essays were all so fun for me to write",
                "Yes, it is fun and allows you to write about yourself\/experiences.",
                "Yes because it is a good writing course that isn't a higher level one.",
                "Yes. Great and fun way to improve writing. It's incredible to write for fun (which is what I would call doing the essays) and then have a experienced expert professor give you feedback and help you with your questions.",
                "Not necessarily, the topics are interesting, but the overall course was not very engaging. If you are an english major, yes potentially, but for those not interesting in pursuing an english degree and simply wanting to explore the department, it seems like there are more fun, engaging courses offered.",
