                "I learned so much about cytoskeletal-related diseases in this class. I also became very comfortable reading scientific papers by the end of the class which I think is a crucial skill for anyone interested in further STEM work. I found that my writing about scientific papers also greatly improved and I became more efficient as the class went on.",
                "I developed a skill of reading and analyzing primary literature in the cell biology field.",
                "I learned about different experimental techniques used in the field of cytoskeleton and different pathologies that can result from dysfunctional cytoskeletal components. I practiced reading papers every week and scientific writing through the reading responses and spotlight article.",
                "I learned a lot about the way that other systems interact with the cytoskeleton such as signaling pathways, osteoclast functions and others. In particular, a large portion of the class was dedicated to methods and we learned how transgenic mice were created, how the Cre-Lox system works, different forms of immunoblotting, imaging and more intricate details about the actual limitations of different methods when analyzing different types of tissues, when cell cultures or model organisms are more viable etc.",
                "Developed knowledge about different cytoskeletal components, defects in these components, and their implications for human disease. Developed skills in reading, understanding, and discussing scientific papers in the field."

            "comments": [
                "I thought it was a perfect level of intellectual challenge while also not being a lot of work. There was equal opportunity for everyone to participate every week and there was good feedback on the assignments. If more classes/seminars like this were offered before senior year, I think that many students in MCDB would greatly benefit from them!",
                "It is well-designed with weekly papers to read and reading responses due for half of them. In class, we walk through the key figures and discuss important methods and results, which is a good structure. The class meets once per week, so it is a long time. Altogether, it is structured very well.",
                "Strengths: the class and Dean C is very encouraging of learning. The course focuses on building skills rather than memorization.\r\nWeaknesses: More feedback and clarity could be given on the reading responses. Also, most classes involved dividing up figures and explaining them to the class, which made the class feel like a lecture. I wish there was more discussion and questions asked to challenge our thinking of the figures. I also think it would be more beneficial for learning if we could have the presentations uploaded to Canvas so we can continually keep track of different cytoskeleton and experimental concepts we learned.",
                "The strength of the course is really the Professor. She manages to keep the class very engaging and makes presenting on the papers less stressful. Prior to discussing the experiments in the paper, two students present on background information and the methods.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for the course is to keep a running list of the methods we've done before and perhaps a refresher for classes even if we did discuss it previously.",
                "Strengths of the course were that it was very well-organized and I received clear feedback on each writing assignment. I liked how the course was organized by a different paper/topic/disease each week. I really liked how students were required to submit 5/10 possible reading responses throughout the semester, since this allowed us to put a lot of effort and focus on the ones we chose to submit. The seminar setting allowed us to break out into pairs to discuss figures, which helped us understand them better.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses or suggestions; a great MCDB seminar to begin with"

                "Yes, this is a great class, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
                "It depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking to learn how to read scientific literature and are not very familiar with different techniques, then this class will be helpful. It was more difficult to really learn and synthesize material about the cytoskeleton since the papers were so in depth, so it was sometimes difficult to see the broader picture. Most classes felt like a lecture since half the class was a pair of students presenting a paper, and then the other half of the time, we divided up the figures and explained what each figure was in detail.",
                "This is a great course to actually dive deeper into topics we've explored in other classes, and especially in the bio module. Most importantly, this class taught me how to be able to read a paper and understand it. When the class first started it would take me a day to really read a paper and understand it and by the end I could go through a paper in 2-4 hours depending on the length.",
                "I highly recommend this course to any MCDB student who is interested in learning more about the cytoskeleton. The seminar setting contrasts with most MCDB lecture courses, so reading and discussing papers with peers was a special experience."
