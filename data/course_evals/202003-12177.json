                "Professor Sanjabi was very organized with her course handouts. I would suggest making some of the readings we translate less dark or outdated. I understand psychology is easier for beginners to translate but theres some great French literature out there that would be fun and worthwhile to work on, especially since the translations take so long. \r\n\r\nI would also suggest being more organized about how we reviewed homework. I did almost all the homework and we reviewed only a small fraction of it. I struggled in this class and would have wanted to check and go over and clarify translations I spent a long time working on so that I could address mistakes and better learn.",
                "the class moves incredibly fast, which is to be expected for a course of this nature, but the professor was incredibly willing to stop to explain concepts further. I wonder if it would be possible to have regular vocabulary tests\/quizzes just to make sure people are keeping up."

                "I would recommend if you really want to work hard at it. If you are dedicated to learning French you will learn to read it with Professor Sanjabi. The workload is not too much busy work, leaving time to go over the textbook carefully and practice extra things that interest you or that you need to work on more. I also tried to practice with a copy of the Count of Monte Cristo, which I enjoyed far more than some of the random psychological or colonial translations we did for homework. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I struggled with the courseI had no French experience and many of my classmates did. The class description does say its intended for people with no experience. My academic and preprofessional background is in political and military science, and I felt that the class and classmates were a bit judgemental of my lack of art history\/renaissance\/classics background. I was also the only undergrad in what is listed as an undergraduate course. I didnt really feel welcome in the class, but all that being said, Professor Sanjabi is dedicated to helping her students learn and improve, and I am happy with what I learned and the foundation the course gave me.",
                "definitely, but i would caution them that they will get out of it exactly what they are willing to put in. additionally, i would recommend that they take a basic french class too. i struggled a bit and that's with a couple years of (rusty) french under my belt. i don't know if i would have survived without that."
