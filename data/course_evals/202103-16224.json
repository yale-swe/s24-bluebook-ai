I also learned the importance of the experimental design process and how to collaborate with group data from experiments. If you want to learn how to write a professional and actual lab report take this course. Unlike other labs that you've probably taken, you'll actually be able to walk away from this class with the ability to think critically about the scientfic process and how to work in a research lab setting.",

                "Very interesting labs",
                "Strength: Professor Moreno was a fantastic professor! She truly cares about students having an enjoyable experience with learning about research in a lab and that you walk away from the course with applicable skills. Additionally, the course is very well structured so that you have a clear idea of the expectations of the course and are able to focus on learning the materials not the grading. Weakness: nothing really, I think that this is one of the best structured and organized lab courses that I've taken in Biology at Yale.",
                "WEakness: too much emphasis on lab report details.",
                "I love each of the experiments that we did, and I really appreciated the collaborative aspect of the class. I haven't taken a lab class before where everyone in the section participated in the planning and orchestrating of the experiment. One thing I found challenging was with meeting the expectations of the lab report and lab notebook. Oftentimes, I would get points off for things that we were never told we needed to include, such as a reflection portion in our lab reports or insight in our lab notebooks. I wish the teaching staff could have made more clear how we needed to write/organize our lab reports/notebooks instead of just giving us a generic framework (intro, results, figures, conclusion). I also wish we could have focused more on how to write the materials and methods section of a lab report, although I understand that much of that section would have just been restating the procedures that were mentioned in the lab handouts.",
                "Overall, I think this course succeeded in highlighting the various protocols that one could encounter when performing scientific research. I had fun with most of the hands-on activities. However, I do think that there was a lot of writing involved (hence the 0.5 WR credits, although where would students get another 0.5 WR credits...?) so hopefully this course could get a full WR credit with 1 more lab reports added."

                "Yes! Professor Moreno is lovely and makes the class very fun",
                "It is a lot of work, especially for someone who is new to biology labs, but it pays off.",
                "Yes for students who would like an introduction to biology lab skills.",
                "Definitely! If you've never had research experience in a lab setting, (i'm talking actual lab experiences not Gen Chem or Orgo labs) consider taking this course as you'll walk away with actually useful skills. You'll learn the basics from pipetting techniques to keeping an organized lab notebook (wish I had this skill before work in actual research lab). Also, I can't really think of any other course in which you actually are exposed to so many research models and techniques in person. It is one thing to talk about and read about these research models and techinques, but a completely different experience to actually use them in a lab setting. Even if you have lab experiences, this course as a writing credit will teach you how to effectively articulate science and write about it as well.",
                "Not if its a 5th class. SO much work. Lab reports are so detail-ridden. Each lab session was really cool tho!! Although, each lab takes all 4 hours which is not so fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if a student is looking to gain more practice with writing lab reports and notebooks, especially if they are considering a senior research project or, more generally, a career in research. I would only warn that this class takes a LOT of work, not only with the post-lab assignments (writing reports and notebooks) but with the pre-lab assignments as well (reading through handout, sometimes taking pre-lab quizzes).",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any freshmen/sophomores looking to get a basic understanding of lab techniques. Looking back as a junior, I wish I had taken this course earlier since if you join a bio lab at Yale, you will encounter most of these techniques anyways and will have to learn that on your own. This is also a good lab for juniors/seniors looking to fulfill the MCDB major requirement."
