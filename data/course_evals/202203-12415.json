                "This course does an excellent job introducing you to a large selection of the math needed for physics by solving problems in physics. Sometimes we would have problems that took multiple class days to finish, and by the time we were finishing it it was easy to lose sight of what we were doing in the first place. In general though the psets did a lot to help solidify what we learned, although they were quite long and difficult. Office hours were also very good, and things like test corrections made it so that we did not have to worry about the grades too much as long as we were keeping up with the work and learning.",
                "very strong course. Main strength is teaching style. Professor uses every class period to solve illuminating example problems.",
                "I really wish there was a bit more introspection on \"where we are in the course\", e.g. what we can solve, what techniques to apply when, etc.",
                "Strengths: you form a great community with the professor, TA, and the students through office hours. We struggled with the psets together and were working together for around 6 hours a week. It's a lot of work but you learn a lot and make new friends doing it. Weaknesses: sometimes there were a few errors in the psets which would keep us from being able to complete them in office hours. This is a class where you need to attend office hours to complete the problem sets.",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that there were very few people which meant you could easily work closely with the professor and TA. One weakness is that there is a lot of material condensed into the course."

                "Absolutely -- the smaller class size with Prof. Mochrie was awesome. Couldn't have asked for a more genuine and kind-hearted teacher.",
                "Yes if you want to learn more in a semester than you've ever learned in a Yale class. You have to put in the work and the time, but by the end you'll be able to do all different types of problems and really master them.",
