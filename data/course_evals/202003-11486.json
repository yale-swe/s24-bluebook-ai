But by the end Prof Mallete seemed to realize it was a lot and allowed us up to 3 skips, so I assume next time will be different.",
                "Strengths include the interesting subject matter and the freedom to explore projects of our choice for our assignments. A weakness was that the seminar felt very quiet over zoom, and that some weeks' material felt like just intro WGSS material without the connection to religion that I had hoped for.",
                "This course was awesomea super interesting exploration of queerness and religion. One thing that might be helpful is including more introductory readings on theologylots of students had prior knowledge of queerness and the readings were more queer-focused than religion-focused, so it was hard to get started with the theology side.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mallette! Very sweet and brings multimedia presentations (art and videos) to class that compliment the readings \r\nWeakness: A few of the articles were very dense and it was tough reading through them, but most were amazing + scholars I hadn't read before"

Wendy is great about bringing in videos and photos to help provide context and break up some of the denser reading. I'm so grateful to have read all of the pieces on this syllabus. While you will have to devote time to really dive into and understand some of the readings, it will be worth it.",
