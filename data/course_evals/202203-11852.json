The only weakness is the quantity of homework some days, but he tries to balance it out.",

                "YES! TAKE YIDDISH! Especially as a Jewish student, this course was incredibly meaningful in addition to being intellectually gratifying. In general, it's like taking a language class plus getting a really good cultural background for Ashkenazi Jewry. I definitely think people who are looking to start a language for the distributional requirements should strongly consider taking it, but also I didn't even need the credit and I'm so glad I took the course anyway!! It was a fun challenge that didn't have to do with the other classes I was taking. (Although, as a history major, much of it felt quite relevant and fun.)",
