I also learned about how exchange rates are linked with trade, GDP, inflation, etc. Very helpful class in understanding macroeconomics and how trade affects different countries' economies and balance of payment.",

                "Strengths: the class builds step by step toward a complete model for international finance. The class also follows the book pretty closely, everything is very logical. I really like the pace of the class. We also have a good amount of homework practice to test our knowledge. Prof Fieler's office hours are very helpful.",

                "Strengths: expectations are pretty clear and it's not too demanding, and for a boring topic the class is relatively interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture was sometimes monotonous. Also it was always hard to hear and see.",
                "The first part of the occurs on the current account was not particularly useful in my opinion, but the exchange rate and money market analyses seemed very practical.",
                "This course is well-organized, and the main strength is definitely Professor Fielershe was clearly very knowledgeable about the topic and always willing to help answer questions during office hours. Her care for students definitely showed throughout the semester! Main weakness is just the early time slot in Watson, which I think made lectures a little less engaging in general.",

Even though this class is at 9 am, I'm so excited when I go to class and ready to learn, because I know Prof Fieler has so much to offer and teach us.",

                "Yes, definitely. This is a great senior seminar that is engaging, interesting, and not that stressfulProf. Fieler really wants you to understand and enjoy the material, and she does a great job at achieving both of those ends.",
                "Yes. You get a pretty solid foundation in international finance, it's appropriately challenging but not super hard, and it's relatively interesting.",

                "Yeah I wouldthis is a straightforward Econ senior seminar taught by a good professor. Like a lot of other Econ classes though, this class is fairly theory-heavy, but there are some lectures devoted to more real-world events involving international trade / finance towards the end of the semester, which I found interesting. Not too demanding in terms of work either, other than the 3 exams, which account for most of the grade. Overall, if youre looking for a solid credit in the Econ major where the course expectations are clearly defined, I would take a look at this class!",
