                "After taking this course, I not only refined my historical analysis, but also developed my writing skills and knowledge of American history. As an American who grew up abroad, I was super excited to take this course and gain a better understanding of the ways in which immigrants have contributed to American history thus far. Prof. Akiboh was amazing at moderating the discussions, and she made it super easy for everyone to participate & learn the material.",
                "Through Dr. Akiboh's course, I was able to identify the recurring themes within U.S history. Although I have previously taken a U.S. History course and learn about U.S history on my own accord, I gained new insight about U.S. history every week during her course. This course also made me better at articulating my thoughts and connecting my insights with the course themes. This knowledge will undoubtedly serve me in the seminars I take at Yale for the rest of my college career.  Additionally, this course made me better at analyzing primary sources and taught me how to identify the most significant information needed to comprehend a topic.",
                "I really enjoyed this course because it built upon my basic understanding of American history and, ultimately, altered the way I view American identity. I really appreciated that Professor Akiboh did not white-wash the history of the United States and helped the students understand points of contingency which are commonly presented as inevitable in U.S. history classes. Throughout this course, I also learned how to navigate class discussions in college as well as how to make my writing more concise.",
                "I became more comfortable reading and interpreting primary sources. I also improved at incorporating them into my writing, which I struggled with a lot at the beginning of the semester. This class gave a great view of history from the founding of America to the present, but focusing on the stories that have been forgotten. It paralleled my high school history course in terms of time period, but added incredible context to what I had previously learned. Every day I left class amazed that I had not previously known what we learned that day.",
                "Developed a strong knowledge on reading and understanding historical events and pieces",
                "Improved my writing and historical analytical skills.",
                "In this course, we learned about marginalized identities in the United States and how the concept of identity has changed in the US over time. We aimed to understand ideas of exclusion and inclusion within the United States, as well as think critically about what it means how certain groups were excluded over time.",
                "I improved my analytical writing, my active reading, and discussion contribution skills throughout this course. I also greatly deepened my knowledge of American history through a critical lens of identity. This course was extremely interesting and insightful, and each class encouraged every student to think deeper about the text/ sources, themselves, and world around them."

                "Strengths: great readings\r\nWeaknesses: discussion was lacking at times",
                "I really love the discussions/ seminar structure of the class, it was amazing to get the chance to take a seminar during my freshman year. I also loved the diversity of the sources that we looked at, as it gave us a more holistic view of American history. I don't think there is much room for improvement of this class, I loved it.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Akiboh is great at guiding the conversation and has an extensive knowledge on the course content that allowed us to gain greater insight on the content. Assignments are very meaningful and truly help you understand U.S. history and its continuity. She is also very accessible, if you wish to get greater assistance from her. She also proves very clear feedback on material!\r\nWeaknesses: Some primary documents can be very boring, lengthy, and difficult to understand. However, class discussions bring clarity to the premise of the documents. \r\n\r\nDr. Akiboh's course is very well structured in its current formatting. There isn't anything I can think of that will improve it.",
                "Strengths: Challenging in a good way, improves writing and discussion skills, wonderful community of students, knowledgable and passionate professor, well-structured course\r\nWeaknesses: More small group work before class discussion",
                "The readings were really well selected. Each reading felt impactful, and even the weeks with a little more reading were super helpful. You definitely did not have to do all the readings, which made participating in class really accessible. The professor is brilliant and asked us provocative questions that sparked fascinating conversations. At the beginning of class, I think we could have used more guidance in facilitating conversation. We definitely got better as the year went on, but at times, it felt like we were just going around the room and pointing out things we thought were interesting in the text, and not really engaging in conversation with each other.",
                "The content and the workload was challenging but rewarding. I enjoyed the reading and while I felt like it pushed me to work hard I never felt overwelmed.",
                "Strengths: Almost everything about this course was incredible. The readings were super fascinating and were some of the best sources that could have been picked for every week's topic. The discussions were very interesting and thought-provoking. The professor was very helpful in giving context before discussions and creating a safe and wonderful class environment. The assignments helped us get a lot of insights and they were very fun (especially the last two!) I truly enjoyed this course! Every minute of it was enjoyable. You are never bored but you are also never burnt out because there is so much support from everyone and the way class discussions are arranged is so interactive and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only that sometimes the readings were too long and it got harder to know what to skim (it wasn't always clear).",
                "A strength of this course is that the readings and the written assignments are very engaging. A weakness is that discussions are overly moderated.",
                "A large strength of the course was the professor and the seminar setting. Professor Akiboh provided valuable insight and was helpful in guiding discussions while also being careful to let students still control the topics being discusses and what aspects of identity we chose to talk about in a given week. Throughout the course, we covered a large amount of content while providing appropriate coverage and depth to each topic presented. I think that one drawback from the course, while unavoidable due to the nature of the content we were discussing, was that it often felt very dark and depressing. Professor Akiboh, however, was always available to talk to and made it clear that she was someone we could go to in order to discuss and talk things over with.",
                "This is a very strong course. The writing assignments are interesting, challenging, while also being manageable. The homework assignments are also engaging and interesting, although sometimes they can be slightly overwhelming in length. I also appreciated the weekly journals as they were a great chance to reflect. The class discussions were mainly directed by students and served as a great way to practice discussion skills while learning and deepening our knowledge."

It provides insight into specific parts of US history that I have never learned about previously. It also gave me the opportunity to discuss ideas that I have been interested in for years, in a classroom setting.",
                "Yes! This course is great, even if you have taken a U.S history course. It is comprehensive and concise at the same time. The class conversations were very enriching and made me excited to come to class. The course discusses aspects of U.S history that are often neglected. Dr. Akiboh's clear feedback allows you to improve during the semester and makes you a better historian.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Akiboh is an amazing professor that really cares for her students inside and outside of the classroom. Additionally, her feedback is detailed, structured, and helpful and I appreciate that she makes herself available to discuss her comments. Her diverse selection of sources keeps me intrigued the entire class. Lastly, this course challenges my annotation, writing and discussion skills.",
                "Yes, definitely. The professor is brilliant, gives excellent feedback on writing and class commentary, and assigns papers that give you the freedom to pursue whatever you are interested in. I can't imagine not knowing everything I learned in this class. Each day felt impactful and every time I came to class, I felt like it was very important I was there.",
                "Yes because I found it interesting and enjoyed the way it was taught",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE NOW! IT IS SO SO GOOD! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! Hands down my FAVORITE class so far at Yale. EVERY American Yalie MUST take this class. It is so insightful. It truly opens your mind about what kind of country the United States is in a way that NO history or apush class has ever been able to accomplish. I swear you will not regret taking this course. I really really enjoyed the readings, the discussions, and the assignments (all three!!!) So basically every aspect of this course (even the weekly reading journals!) was essential and helpful. I looked forward to this class every week even though it was an afternoon class (when I'm personally usually more tired). This just goes to show how GOOD this class is. I cannot begin to explain how much I love Prof Akiboh and her style of teaching. It has been so helpful for me. She is an INCREDIBLE professor. I learned so much but also never felt like this class was too burdensome. The professor on the first day of class stressed how important it is for her that this class not become her primary source of concern/worry. It never did. That was because there was an active effort to make sure students felt seen and heard in this class. And the topic is so so so interesting and relatable. If you identify as American in some way- this is part of YOUR history!!!",
                "Yes, this course was very intellectually stimulating.",
                "Yes, this course covers fascinating concepts and aspects of American history that are not often covered by traditional history classes. This course is vital for anyone interested in socio-cultural history and how it intersects with politics.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student as it is a great way to improve your historical analysis and writing skills while learning about a fascinating and important topic."
