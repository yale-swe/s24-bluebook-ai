The student presentations add a nice change of pace to the class as well. It might be nice to have more time to discuss the content in class as a seminar format.",
                "A strength of this course is the ease of it as a simple lecture twice a week with no weekly assignments, just learning and note taking. Each class is a powerpoint available on Canvas and very organized from the start of the semester so it is very easy to follow. A weakness of it could be the lack of student participation as even though it is a small class of only about 15 kids there is no real participation it is taught as a lecture.",
