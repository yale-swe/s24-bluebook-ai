                "I learned so much about ballet's history and present! With the resources Daniel provided, I feel like I learned to intelligently verbalize my own thoughts about current issues in ballet.",

                "I got to learn all kinds of different choreography from incredible teachers. There was so much variety in the course, which kept us on our toes, literally. I enjoyed getting to learn and talk about ballet history, and give our input for where we predict ballet to be going.",
                "I learn both technical and historical aspects of ballet, but my vision of what ballet could be was also broadened greatly!",
                "This course taught me so much about the state of ballet today and what we as the next generation can do to help democratize and diversify the art form.",
                "I got to continue my ballet technique work while learning new choreo that challenging my brain to pick it up very quickly. I also got to learn about what's going on in today's dance world and the problems the indust industry is facing/how to tackle them.",
                "Reviewed ballet technique, learned about ballet's current artist and leaders, learned about the recent history of NYCB",
                "I learned an enormous amount about the evolution of ballet through Balanchine and Robbins and modern-day choreographers. This class renewed my appreciation for ballet and my love for the art form. I looked forward to coming to this class every single week, and I truly enjoyed learning the choreography to various ballet pieces from the very people that performed them!",

                "Strengths: small workload, very well established and knowledgeable professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: The course structure (warm-up, discussion, guest speaker) worked really well for engaging students and communicating the week's topic. The weekly discussion posts were great as a primer for the upcoming class, and I really appreciated the opportunities to engage with the material directly, especially when NYCB dancers came into to teach us choreography firsthand. I learned so much through this class in a way that was completely different from the more traditional classroom setting.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: It's both studio and discussion based so there's a great variety in the work. Weakness: I'm not really sure if there are any!",
                "A class I actually looked forward to attending every week",
                "It was just amazing to be able to get inside these works and to be taught by dancers I had idolized since I was 12. I don't think any other class experience could come close to that. Daniel's ballet warm ups and corrections were incredible, too. The class was definitely the most engaging to me on the weeks when we had dancers in the studio teaching us choreography. The Zoom conversations were excellent too, and certainly not a weakness, but couldn't quite compare to learning Agon from Sara Adams!",
                "It's a very engaging course and that's a good thing! It's fun to go to the studio every week and get the chance to dance. And the assignments are interesting and achievable.",
                "This course is so much fun and really engages you for the entire class period. It provides the coolest opportunities to meet talented artists, and I felt respected as a dancer constantly. The course is not very stressful, but still has high expectations for final papers and projects.",
                "I felt that this class was INCREDIBLE for someone who was a dancer looking to learn more about technical and historical aspects of the dance. It was formatted in a way that was incredibly engaging and just challenging enough that it was possible to still follow while you learned a lot. I do feel like at times the class felt a bit large, but other than that I had no criticism!",
                "Amazing course, I am amazed by Prof. Ulbrichts ability to lead every class with high energy and foster thought-proving conversation, truly inspiring",
                "Strengths are that this is one of the most fun classes at Yale. Yale really needs to increase it's dance classes, we have a whole theater school but almost no academic dance courses. This class also exposed me to new styles and choreography. While I might not enjoy watching some of the more contemporary ballet styles, doing them in class I gained a new appreciation as they often are fun to dance. The main improvements would be to have an updated syllabus that outlines the actual assignments before shopping period ends but definitely before a couple weeks into the semester. It would also be nice to get feedback on our papers.",
                "This course was really great. I feel like I got a great overview of the US professional ballet scene. The best part of the course was getting to learn from principal dancers, choreographers, and leaders directly. Daniel was so warm and welcoming, and his passion for the art form was truly contagious.",
                "I can't think of any weakness of this course except that you can't retake it! I adored this class from beginning to end, and its greatest strength lies in Daniel's passion for dance and his desire to expose us to the various facets of ballet.",
                "I found this course a refreshing break from typical Yale courses: the hands-on approach to studying dance is special and extremely effective. Professor Ulbricht's professional experience gives him a unique perspective on the industry. The only weakness of this course is the balance of work throughout the semesterwhile the workload very reasonable throughout the semester, it ramps up suddenly for the final. This is a perfectly acceptable course format, but it would help to have that feature more clearly explained in the syllabus and/or Canvas site so that students are not caught off guard.",
                "The strengths were that we were able to take ballet classes in the studio and that the teacher was able to bring in dancers from New York City ballet to teach us choreography."

Daniel's approach to teaching this course is so grounding, and each class inspired me to reflect on my own dance experience and how I would like to engage with dance after college. This course is truly a gem, and if you have the space and opportunity to take it, please do!!",

                "Yes! This class is amazing and you get to learn choreography from dancers in NYCB and hear about their experiences, also get to choreograph",
                "YES!!!!!!! I truly think this course would be amazing for everyone, but especially if you were a serious ballet dancer and really miss that part of yourself. Not to be dramatic, but having even just two hours a week to learn ballet choreography felt like it revived part of my soul. This course did so much to keep me happy and in touch with myself this semester.",
                "I definitely recommend this course! Daniel is an amazing teacher and knows a lot about ballet, historically and in practice. It's like a perfect class, you should definitely take it if you like ballet!",
                "Absolutely, especially to people who love dance and want to study it academically. It's such a unique class in that it brings guest artists all the time that you otherwise wouldn't have access to. Daniel is also a wonderful teacher who really cares and always brings a lot of energy to class. I really enjoyed this and wish it wasn't just one semester!",
                "YESSSS 1000%%% (though I wouldn't recommend unless previous dance experience was had)",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, this was a really fun class and I'm glad I got to take it. The class itself is usually a short ballet technique class followed by either learning choreo with a guest dancer from NYCB or a q&a with a guest. If you're a ballet dancer definitely take this class, it's fun and a good time. The only nocks are that the syllabus basically doesn't say anything so it was a big surprise when we found out about a 6 page midterm and 10 page final that we hadn't expected to have to do.",
                "Yes! You might not get in if you don't have some technical training, but if you are able to take the course definitely take the opportunity! Taking time to dance and think about art was such a gift for me this semester. I strongly recommend taking the course if you can!",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone with even a small level of ballet experience. From a technical standpoint, Daniel gives incredible corrections for barre and center which help improve you as a dancer. He also forces you to question ballet's place in the modern world and how we as dancers can ensure it retains relevance in years to come, both topics that I felt made me grow on a personal level. If this sounds even remotely interesting to you, I would audition to take this class.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student with a love of ballet. It's a wonderful and fulfilling experience not only to study works of Ballet Now, but also to experience them physically.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student, especially for those passionate about the arts."
