                "This course focused on music in Jane Austen novels but also encompassed so much more. Music was the medium through which we discussed the social and cultural norms of Regency Era England, talked about character and plot development, and examined more complex themes. It was a great way to also think about late 17th to mid-18th century composers and the music Austen herself would have consumed.",

                "This course was truly incredible.  The workload was good, and I was always excited to do work on readings and assignments for this class. \r\nI loved the progression from historical context, to the novels themselves, to how the novels have been adapted.   \r\n\r\nPossible improvements: there probably isn't time to add another novel (the course is very well-paced), but that would be fun.  Also, I loved discussing clips in class, but since not everyone had seen every adaptation, I think it would be beneficial to also choose one adaptation to dive into more deeply.  Everyone could watch it and then analyze it more closely in class.  Last, it would be great to spend more time analyzing the music itself, whether adaptation soundtracks or Austen's collection.",

                "The assignments were fun and engaging. The readings were always manageable, and the secondary readings always added to the week's topic. Seminar was also always enjoyable as it was a good mix of discussion, text analysis, and then visual\/auditory elements.",
                "Strengths amazing discussions!!! A really engaging subject matter that still relates to modern day.\r\nWeaknesses none!",
                "The strength of this course was the ability to freely discuss our thoughts and ideas about the course materials. This might also be a weakness of the course as it does not allow for a multi-faceted approach to learning the material, but I didn't mind.",
                "A weakness would definitely be the fact that it was over zoom. Definitely gave students an opportunity to disengage. However, the professor asked very thought-provoking questions and kept the course very interesting.",

                "Yes!  I cannot rave about this course enough.  If you love music and\/or Jane Austen (and I love both), you should definitely take this course, because what you learn is fascinating.  I looked forward to class every week because it was so fun to escape into the world of Austen.  Then after each seminar, I would tell anyone who would listen about how much I loved the course.  The topics and assignments were creative, worthwhile, and genuinely exciting.  Also, Professor Peritz is so engaging, kind, and understanding.",

                "Yes, the course was a fantastic humanities course. Even if you don't have a strong musical background, you should still take the course. It shows how literature, music, art, and other humanities disciplines can be combined, resulting in really rich discussions on contemporary and historical issues. I loved getting to read Austen novels with a completely new perspective that made me appreciate them all the more. Plus, Professor Pertiz is fantastic.",
                "Yes!! It was a fun and engaging introduction to music theory using Jane Austen's most famous novels and somehow also managed to remain culturally relevant and interesting. Overall a great course, exciting even for those without a musical background.",
                "Yes! It was an excellent seminar, even online. I looked forward to reading the novels every week, and gained insight into female musicality during the Regency era.",
                "In a heartbeat! It's fun to time travel to the 1800s with Jane Austen... and the subject matter sparks some really powerful discussions.",
                "Yes! This class was extremely thought-provoking and informative and I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of interests represented in the class.",
                "Absolutely. This course was extremely interesting. Such a nice group of people. The class size was small enough where I knew every face on the computer and allowed for the professor to check in on each of us to give feedback. Not a ton of work to do in this class but the readings and discussion topics were engaging.",
