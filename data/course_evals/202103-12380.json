                "Strengths: I personally had an amazing experience with this course because I was very interested in my research. I had a ton of advising and guidance both from my PI and my graduate student mentor, which was super helpful. I also had a very clear plan for when/how to conduct my research which I think really helped in this process. \r\nWeaknesses: Not much! I think that this course is terrific for anyone who has a clear research interest!",
                "A strength is that it was really flexible and a weakness was that the professor didn't communicate with us that much, but I guess that's because we mainly corresponded with our individual PIs.",

                "My only recommendation would be to provide a more thorough framework of the expected assignments earlier in the semester as well as a rubric for grading to assist the mentors when evaluating at the end of the term.",
                "The course is structured well for what it is. It fully allows the student to focus mainly on the work in the lab while making sure there is an assignment to ensure that research is being conducted.",
                "Strengths: I think this course would benefit from weekly check-ins rather than an all-encompassing end-of-semester report and presentation.",
                "Normalize not working 20+ hours for no pay. I understand its for credit, but JESUS a small stipend provided by the department wouldnt hurt, dude.",
                "The strength of the course is being able to work in our lab. It could be improved by offering more feedback throughout the course, especially specific feedback on our scientific writing.",
                "The strength is that the research is completely guided by the student and the PI. The weakness is that there is no way for the student to know how they are doing until their grade comes out, since so much of the grade is based on two assignments.",
                "Strengths: flexibility with PI\r\nWeaknesses: the non-PI professor of this course was very specific about writing our proposal and paper to the extent that I was unsure why they were more particular about my research than the PI himself"

                "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, but only if the student has a very clear research interest and plan. Truthfully, I think this course is better suited to students who have already had some preliminary experiences working in a research lab. Having guidance from your lab members is very important in this process, and this is best achieved if you already have some sort of prior experience in a given lab.",

                "Yes, for those looking to conduct research during the school year. The 10 hour a week level is not hard to meet if not slightly low in terms of getting significant data in some fields of research.",
                "I would say: it depends. I spent way more than 10 hrs in lab/week, because that's what felt necessary to make meaningful progress in my project. Even then, I didn't progress as much as I would've hoped. I guess that gives you a general sense what actual science is like, but still found it a bit hard to manage on top of an otherwise rigorous course schedule. That said, I learned a ton, and it's pretty cool to apply the knowledge from this major in a meaningful way as an undergrad.",
