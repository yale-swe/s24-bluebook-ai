Sometimes lecture slides were a bit confusing so I would often go to office hours as well.",
                "Interesting content, not very engaging. Perhaps more technical homework assignments.",
                "Strengths - very engaging lectures, exams are very solidly based on the course material\r\nWeaknesses - the 4 homeworks are each on an individual paper so there wasn't much integration of knowledge before the tests",
                "I found the content that defined this course incredibly interesting and I looked forward to each and every class!",
                "Well structured lectures but you should keep up with lectures",
                "The course couldve been a bit more organized and engaging but The material was good",
                "Strengths were that it was interesting info and format of the class was pretty good. Weaknesses are with the way info was presented - lectures werent recorded making it hard to review and professor talked too fast",
                "Lecture slides are easy to follow, but class was not recorded, so it was difficult not being able to go back and listen",
                "The course is poorly structured. We had two tests, both of which were non-cumulative and worth 25% of our grade, but one covered 5-6 lectures while the second covered 12. The lectures are also not recorded, and the slides are have minimal context, so if you are sick or contact-traced, you have to find time to attend office hours or carefully read the textbook to get caught up.",
                "The pacing and lecture style in this course was overall pretty good: I felt like I could process the material but we also moved through material quickly. This course could be improved by adding more student participation, possibly through sections.",
                "Strengths: course content easy to follow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sort of hard to engage, and course notes were never published/course recordings/livestreams so if you missed due to illness it was impossible to catch up. I think the professor should offer livestream/class recordings.",

                "I appreciated that the slides were posted, but sometimes they were lacking some descriptors; the presenter comments would have been helpful.\r\nHomework was a perfect balance of easy to complete but also forced me to synthesize what I had learned in class.\r\n\r\nIf we had a non-cumulative final, it should have been during the last week of classes and not Finals period!!",
                "Slides could be more informative",
                "strengths: covered a wide variety of topics\r\nweaknesses: prof wasn't enthusiastic about technical content which made us less enthusiastic. course covers way too much intro psych content vs the content that I actually wanted to learn\r\n\r\nhow it could be improved: reduce lecture to 50 min (we would end early most days anyway) and add a section",
                "Strengths: this class was well organized and the professor was very available to help via email or zoom or even in person after class. The course was interesting and accessible to people who don't have a strong background in psych but were interested in the topic. I felt that the assignments were fair and expectations were clear. I love that this course didn't have a section. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class reading was very backloaded and it got a little overwhelming towards the end. The class is graded on participation, but the forms of participation available to use in a lecture outside of attendance can be a little intimidating for those who don't have a strong psych background because of the difference in prior knowledge in the class. I hope that office hours and etc can count towards participation as well, especially for those who might be more reticent to speak up in class.",
                "I think Sam was a great lecturer and a professor who was very considerate of the needs of his students during this time. I really appreciated his flexibility and willingness to make accessibility adjustments to the course as needed.",
                "The professor is very organized and the content is explained clearly. Be warned, the first quiz is more of an exam. It caught a lot of people off guard.",
                "The lectures were slightly difficult to understand--sometimes the concepts were talked about in such specific detail that it was hard to grasp the broad scope of things.",
                "I really enjoyed it!",
                "Strengths: Topics were interesting, there was not too much work, and the work was always enjoyable, feeling like I had truly taken away something from the course\r\n\r\nWeakness: can feel slightly like just a number in the course",
                "The pace of this course was very practical for student learning. However, there seemed to be a moderate amount of overlap with AP Psychology, and I wish that this course would have focused more on the neurobiology of various memory subtypes.",
                "The course is very intuitive, everything that was on the lecture slides or reading was seen on the test at some point and there were no trick questions, all the content was pretty straightforward. If you have taken a basic psychology course before, then the course content would be pretty familiar. There is only lecture without section, and the way information was organized and delivered on the slides in class were concise and easy to understand."

                "I highly recommend this course! Prof. McDougle is a very engaging professor and his lectures are always interesting and filled with great real-life examples to tie to the lecture content. The lectures reference related studies in psychology and neuroscience which really aids learning and the varying examples of research studies help improve your understanding. The class has 1 quiz and 2 tests/exams, spaced throughout the semester, so the courseload doesn't feel too heavy at all. I personally think this class is one where you can enjoy every part of the learning process, from lectures to readings, and I recommend this class to anyone with an interest in memory!",

                "yes, it is one of my favorite courses at Yale! I believe any student would find this interesting no matter what major they are pursuing.",
                "I truly would. Professor McDougle does a great job covering the basics of learning and memory for a psychology or neuroscience major.",
                "Yes, it was a great intro course to \"Brain\" (Cog sci, psych, neuroscience) without being either too technical or too theoretical.",
                "not really. Even if you thought the content was interesting, the course was hard to follow and it was basically intro psych.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot, and the course was really fair.",
                "Yes! It's interesting and you learn a lot about learning. It's also potentially an interesting and different perspective for those into education studies!",
                "A good lecture to fulfill a credit for Cog Sci or Psych! Some of the class was definitely review on what I have learned in past courses, but I came away with some interesting new knowledge about learning and memory! Sam is great and I really appreciated that it wasn't an overly stressful course while still facilitating learning.",

                "Absolutely! It was interesting, well taught, and had applicable material.",
                "Yes. This course sufficiently covers the basics of learning and memory, as well as many classic, foundational experiments and case studies (i.e. Patient H.M.).",

The exams are pretty easy if you pay attention in class and study a few days before the exam, so it should be pretty easy to do well in the class.
