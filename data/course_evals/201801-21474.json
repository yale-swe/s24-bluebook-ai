   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about pdes! I also learned a bunch of other cool stuff that Stefan thought was worth teaching :)",
    "This class covered a very wide array of topics. It went much more into some theory behind differential equations and their applications rather than just solving different types of differential equations.",
    "This course was not only a good introduction to partial differential equations, but also did a good job of connecting PDE's to current research.",
    "The first day of class, Stefan said that we would learn about very few things we could actually solve. Yet, we still managed to fill an entire semester with varied and interesting material, covering the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, various solvable PDEs, and numerical methods",
    "I learned about partial differential equations, which turned out to be very interesting! There were also some cool topics near the end of the course related to current research being done with PDEs -- these were both the most confusing and the most interesting subjects in the course.",
    "This course was a great overview of PDEs and their uses in science and math.",
    "Through this course, I learned basic properties of partial differential equations and how to solve them. The class focused on the wave equation, heat equation, and laplace's equation. At the end of the course, we also discussed numerical methods of solving these equations. We also learned about Banach's fixed point theorem."

   "comments": [
    "Strength was Stefan's teaching. He made the material exciting by amping it up and teaching extra material. I think it would have been nice to have problem set solutions, or more detailed feedback from graders, but everything else was great.",
    "This course didn't have any resources available like peer tutors, TAs, or anything like that, which made it much more difficult to get help understanding the material. We only partly worked out of the book, which made it very hard to find a reliable reference that could explain the concepts the way Stefan wanted us to know them.  Any sort of resources that could be added to the course would be extremely beneficial.",
    "The strengths of the course were the material covered was great, the problem sets were not impossible, and the exams were very fair.",
    "The psets could have benefitted from a mixture of both the advanced topics they discuss but also some very basic problems just to make sure we know what formulas there are and what they do. Psets were very complicated and after doing certain problems I felt like I still didn't understand basic concepts.\r\n\r\nAlso there could be better correspondence between the lectures and some kind of written materials, whether that's a textbook, written lecture notes, or something else.",
    "The main strength was Stefan's obvious and consistent enthusiasm for the subject matter. This came across every day and made lectures very interesting. At times, though, the course felt somewhat disorganized, especially near the end. When Stefan is giving overviews of advanced research topics, I think he should keep his audience in mind a little more than he sometimes did in this course.",
    "Stefan is an amazing teacher and the course was super engaging.",
    "The course was really great for getting an intuition for partial differential equations and their applications. Stefan constantly went on tangents describing how material we are covering in class was being used in modern science research. This was very inspiring. The emphasis on application often meant, however, that we only superficially covered the more theoretical chapters of the textbook. I wish the course had taken these theoretical aspects a bit more seriously."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but I can only speak to when Stefan is teaching it. Lots of fundamental math skills thrown in with the PDEs.",
    "I would probably recommend this course to another student. I think the concepts overall are really interesting, but I found the class very frustrating for a lot of the semester mostly because of the lack of resources available. But pdes are everywhere, so it's really important to know them.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a great class and genuinely interesting material. Also the workload was manageable.",
    "If you're interested in the material, you'll definitely have a good grasp by the end.",
    "Yes. PDEs have a reputation as a sterile and calculation-heavy field, but Stefan really made them come to life. This was a great course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another Math\/Amth major - the material is incredibly interesting and useful, and Stefan was so engaging which made the course all the better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The material is extremely useful for those taking courses in the sciences, the instructor is a lot of fun to learn from, and you can never go wrong by learning more math.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to another student. This class is really inspiring since you learn so much about how PDE's are used in science. That being said, don't expect to come out of the class feeling like you've learned a bunch of general theory of PDE's. Every PDE is its own system and there isn't that much general theory combining them."
