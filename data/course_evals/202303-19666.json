                "Strengths: The class is very well-structured, with a set daily schedule established from the beginning of the semester. There are daily quizzes (reading comprehension, Pinyin, and  which ensures that each chapter is understood . The quizzes and homework decrease towards the end of the semester, when a foundation is consolidated. The unit (3 chapter) exams are much better than having midterms/finals. The majority of the class is spent reading the current chapter, practicing sentence structures/vocabulary, and verbally responding to the teacher using learned sentence structures. Overall, it is a class that improves your weaknesses, whether that be speaking, reading, or writing. There is also plenty of help offered by Chen LaoShi and the Tutorial Teaching Fellow.\r\nWeakness: I wish there were more group projects earlier in the semester, but there would be plenty in the second half of the semester, which are great develop a class bond while practicing Chinese.",
                "strengths: really clearly and helpfully organized, holds students accountable for learning the language on a daily basis, great opportunities to practice speaking and writing chinese\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none, except for the asynchronous class on thursday can sometimes feel like an unnecessary break in the flow of the class",
                "Maybe a little more group projects instead of quizzes",
                "Strengths: I walked away gaining a huge improvement in my Chinese speaking and writing\r\nWeakness: Heavy workload, but ultimately worth it.",
                "Well organized and effectively structured. A good amount of busy work and high time commitment.",

There is a lot of help, feedback, and suggestions offered throughout the semester to make improvement. The amount of time/effort you put into the class is what you get out of it!",
