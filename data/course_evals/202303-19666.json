                "Strengths: The class is very well-structured, with a set daily schedule established from the beginning of the semester. There are daily quizzes (reading comprehension, Pinyin, and  which ensures that each chapter is understood . The quizzes and homework decrease towards the end of the semester, when a foundation is consolidated. The unit (3 chapter) exams are much better than having midterms\/finals. The majority of the class is spent reading the current chapter, practicing sentence structures\/vocabulary, and verbally responding to the teacher using learned sentence structures. Overall, it is a class that improves your weaknesses, whether that be speaking, reading, or writing. There is also plenty of help offered by Chen LaoShi and the Tutorial Teaching Fellow.\r\nWeakness: I wish there were more group projects earlier in the semester, but there would be plenty in the second half of the semester, which are great develop a class bond while practicing Chinese.",
                "strengths: really clearly and helpfully organized, holds students accountable for learning the language on a daily basis, great opportunities to practice speaking and writing chinese\r\n\r\nweaknesses: none, except for the asynchronous class on thursday can sometimes feel like an unnecessary break in the flow of the class",
                "Maybe a little more group projects instead of quizzes",
                "Strengths: I walked away gaining a huge improvement in my Chinese speaking and writing\r\nWeakness: Heavy workload, but ultimately worth it.",
                "Well organized and effectively structured. A good amount of busy work and high time commitment.",
                "Strength: Quick acquisition of literary skills \r\nWeakness: Lack of Collaborative activities or discussion"

There is a lot of help, feedback, and suggestions offered throughout the semester to make improvement. The amount of time\/effort you put into the class is what you get out of it!",

                "I would 100% recommend this to another student! The friendships and knowledge you walk away from this class are incredible. You not only learn about the language, but about the Chinese culture as well.",
                "Yes - great way to learn\/re-learn Chinese.",
                "Yes. It is a good introduction if you are comfortable with verbal and need to work on writing."
