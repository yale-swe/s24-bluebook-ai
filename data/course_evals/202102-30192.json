I would not say I can now read and understand German fluently, but I definitely have a good grasp of grammar, syntax, and constructions that are specific to German. I also learned how to use paper and online dictionaries as well as a variety of facts about German culture and history.",
                "attention to details, new language reading ability, broad German history knowledge",
                "Reading capabilities in German to be able to conduct primary research. Also the ability to understand when and how I should intelligently consult a dictionary rather than looking up every word.",
                "I worked on my german translation abilities.",
                "Taking this course greatly improved my grammar and vocabulary in German. Already, I have noticed improvements in my ability to work with primary and secondary sources in German, which is necessary for my research."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: organic progression of content; short chapter readings that made it feel more manageable; asynchronous allowed for flexibility in completion\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were pretty much repetitions of the readings, and I would've preferred more new material/examples; some of the grading notes could be explained a bit more, primarily when the correction is to a word or phrase that seems content-wise synonymous with what was \"corrected\"",
                "The course was executed well in a self-paced, module-based format. Feedback was always prompt, individualized, and helpful. Some lectures might have benefitted from more examples that were not already included the textbook.",
                "The structure was a strength - constantly translating helped develop skills quickly and efficiently. Some individual time with the professor would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: the breadth of the material covered in the book, the rigor and clarity in the presentation of grammar rules; the variety of themes and subjects that the translations dealt with; the clear and prompt feedback offered by the instructor and the TA.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lack of a \"live\" component i.e. a weekly Q&A session or walk-in office hours led by the instructor where one could ask questions, share one's struggles, and exchange learning tips with classmates.",
                "it being 100% online was stressful and less engaging than it could have been",
                "I thought the course went quite well.  I really enjoyed the self paced aspect and the recorded lectures allowed the perfect amount of aid when the chapter in the textbook was a bit too confusing.",
                "The course had a lot of work which meant so much more time was spent just getting it done than really working on the nitty gritty of the grammar and the vocabulary so fewer daily assignments would be better. The textbook and video lessons were very helpful.",
                "It's an online language course, it seems well-structured for what it is. Any \"weaknesses\" are likely inherent to the form of online, asynchronous, text-only language instruction."

Encountering a language for the first time can be very frustrating and a fully online course with no live component comes with an additional layer of challenges and frustrations.",
