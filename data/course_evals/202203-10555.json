The discussion sections also opened me up to new insight from my peers and showed the importance of discussing ideas in reaching a new synthesis."

            "comments": [
                "Lectures are very boring and I don't see how useful they are. They seem to just summarize the readings we have done. The final exam (gobbets section) seems unnecessary and is effectively testing our memorization of the readings.",
                "I think the course is laid out really nicely. The pace is steady but not too quick and Brad is a very clear professor. Having both a final essay and a final exam has been a bit overwhelming, though, and I wonder if they could be reduced or combined somehow.",
                "Strengths: The books covered in this course are really interesting, and Brad is a great instructor. The content of the course is made very clear through lectures, so I don't think anyone should have trouble with grasping the readings. Weaknesses: I'm not sure if this is a weakness but the course comes with a very \"do it yourself\" philosophy when it comes to the readings. What I mean is that you really need to be disciplined when it comes to keeping up with the readings because there are a lot of them, and no one is going to make sure you're doing them. The essays are not related to all the texts covered in the course, but the readings will be important for the final exam, so while it may not seem necessary to keep up with the readings during the course, keep in mind that it will be later.",
                "The organisation of the course is excellent; the syllabus makes the readings and tasks for each week very clear. The three papers can seem challenging to keep up with, however, it's not unreasonable given this counts for a writing credit.",
                "Great lectures, always engaging and fun. It would be nice if we had the opportunity to turn in drafts of our essays to revise later, but the individual meetings with our TFs to discuss essays were still very helpful.",
                "The lectures in this course are pretty difficult to stay focused with as it becomes a challenge to listen to a lecture with no visuals and just words. I felt my TA does a wonderful job enhancing my studies in this course; and drove me to learn at a higher level than I would on my own.",
                "Lectures could be more engaging, maybe with handouts or writing more on the board",
                "loved brad as a person, but he was not a good lecturer; found it very difficult to keep track of what he was saying",
                "Strengths: Teacher and TAs. Brad is an incredible teacher and an expert in his field. I hope to take more classes with him in the PHIL major. The TA was also very engaging.",
                "lectures could be more structuredhard for visual learners since the lectures are purely auditory. Strengths include the structure and guidance given around writing a paper, and the brevity of the course readings",
                "Strengths: A lot of content is discussed in as much depth as possible, giving a good overview of ancient philosophy\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes quantity of content eclipses quality, and I felt that the passion I retained for philosophy throughout the course was because I constantly fought to honor my natural curiosity and treat the content as more than just a means of doing well on any exam. Because that's ultimately pretty opposed to the true value of philosophical thought. \r\nHowever, I can't think of any way the course could be improved considering it must cover the content it does.",
                "The sections were very helpful but the lectures were slightly disengaging",
                "Seminars were good, readings also good, but lectures were very hard to stay attentive",
                "I think there was a fairly high amount of reading in some weeks, and that wouldn't necessarily be an issue except large chunks would go unmentioned in lecture and section. While certainly helpful in a supplementary sense, it detracts from the material that the instructor was focusing on, so I think it could be a little more streamlined."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes if you want a general survey of ancient philosophy, but make sure you have some level of interest in Greek metaphysics because it can get tedious at times",
                "Sure, but you really need to be interested in the topics covered. If you're someone who doesn't find enjoyment in pondering death, the meaning of life, and the dynamics of knowledge and reality on a deep level, then I don't think you should take this class because there are a lot of readings that you can't efficiently get through if you're not interested in them. If you are, however, interested in these topics, you'll be exposed to a wide range of interesting philosophies that may even change your perspective on the world. That being said, if you're very worried about your grade in this class, I would caution that it's very unclear how you're doing in the class for essentially the entire semester. Your final score consists of 3 essays, the final, and class participation, and we only received the grade for our second paper at the very end of the semester, so I have no clue how my performance will turn out. I'm also a bit opposed to the structure of the final exam because 60% of your score was placed on ten passage recognition questions (i.e. identifying the text, author, and significance of the passage, more or less). It's definitely doable as the questions really only cover the major texts and philosophers from the course, but there should be a bit more clarification on how students should study for this section. Regardless, I still think you should take this class if you find it interesting because it's very insightful and has given me a great starting point to building my own philosophy on life.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Although there is a final exam, I thought that I was able to take a lot away from the readings to potentially apply to other areas.",
                "Yes! You should study ancient philosophy, helps you think deeply about the amazing world we live in, and Prof Inwood is a very careful and incisive thinker.",
                "Absolutely, if you're at all curious about the world and the nature of our reality, of knowledge, etc., and what other thinkers have to say about these. Some of the ideas and arguments you'll find in the assigned readings will seem surprisingly inane, but there is a lot to learn from and reflect on in this course, and many of the topics of discussion are of no small consequence to how we decide to live our lives (e.g. happiness, death, and so on). If you're interested in philosophy, this is a great (and frankly necessary) introduction.",
                "no",
                "If you do not have much knowledge over ancient philosophy I would recommend this course, as you would learn very much about the ropes of philosophy.",
                "Somewhat, need background for philosophy major but not the most exciting class",
                "yes",
                "Take this class!!!",
                "yes, especially if you have had no formal training in philosophy in hs",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who already had a lot of passion for philosophy. If students don't put in the actual work doing the readings, caring about the readings, paying attention in every lecture, and questioning the class content, I think this course would seem to be a chore, which is the opposite of what philosophical thought should be. While I personally thoroughly enjoyed the class (because of these reasons), I would not recommend it to a student who is just trying to check off a writing credit on their distributional requirements. That nature of course selection has always been very heartbreaking to me. Do things because you love them or think you might love them, not just to torture yourself through a requirement, passionless!",
                "Yes, but maybe take something a little more specific and with a smaller class size",
                "Yes! Professor Inwood is a wonderful lecturer and the content is organized in an understandable, compelling fashion. The essays are designed to teach you how to write a good philosophy essay, with each one being more open ended and subject to interpretation than the last. The readings sometimes are heavy, but for the most part manageable.",
                "I would recommend it for the material and the readings, but I would be just as likely to recommend just the material and information and readings without needing the course. However, that requires a lot of self-motivation, so the course is likely valuable.",
                "Know that it is a history of philosophy class more than anything. It can be super dry at times if you're not interested in the material, but Prof. Inwood is fantastic and an engaging lecturer. This class taught me philosophy isn't for me, but it was still enjoyable and not too much work, so if you think you'd like the content I'd reccomend."
