By bringing in guest speakers to present their research, I also learned a good thought process to have regarding the running of an experiment - i.e. why researchers did something over another.",
                "This course teaches you how to closely read economic papers and analyze their research design and methodology. This is an extremely useful and necessary skill if you want to continue in research or just generally want to be able to read papers in general. Throughout this course, I learned a lot of various econometrics and research techniques, how they can be applied, and the strengths and weaknesses of various experimental designs. Additionally, I learned a lot about the various topics within foreign aid and current research going on within the subject area.",
                "Debates, controversies and schools of thought regarding foreign aid, humanitarian aid, and development. This course also had a focus on methodology and research design, and included some key texts on econometrics and program evaluation at the start of the semester. The final project proposal was a great way to think about doing your own empirical research on aid, anti-poverty programs, or development."

                "This course was in general very good; the discussion sessions were engaging, and Aronow led the sessions well and chose interesting readings. The guest speakers were also really great. One potential suggestion for future semesters would be to slightly reduce the quantity of guest speakers, as it would have been helpful to spend more classes studying econometrics and political economy content more in-depth.",
                "No weaknesses. Professor Aronow is a very knowledgable on how research works and did a great job explaining to the class how to better understand the course material and future research papers. Brining in guest speakers was also an amazing idea because it allowed class participants to ask questions directly to authors and better understand thought processes.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Aronow is a wonderful and insightful person who genuinely is very excited to teach students about this topic. He is very insightful about the topic and obviously put a lot of thought into curating an in-depth and interesting syllabus. Additionally, most of the seminars invite a guest speaker to talk and discuss their research. This allows you to learn first-hand the thought process that goes into designing a research experiment and writing a paper. Also, its way more interesting to be able to have so many different people come and talk to you about what they are up to.\r\n\r\nno weaknesses",
                "Strengths. This class had a great syllabus and a highly interesting professor. It was also challenging in the right way, and covered material on foreign aid in a way that is difficult to find in any other undergraduate course. This course should definitely be offered in the future. I think the course could be improved by more organization and setting clear expectations for students at the beginning of the semester, but that was largely a product of adapting and being flexible to the pandemic. Another improvement might be spending a week or two focusing on research ethics in this field."

                "Yes -- this course is certainly worth taking if you're interested in foreign aid research and social science research methods more broadly. Aronow is incredibly knowledgeable and also has a great sense of humor. Class sessions were informative, engaging, and enjoyable. I felt that the writing assignments helped me improve my ability to analyze and critique economics\/political science research papers, and the work load was quite manageable in general. The guest speakers were also really great.",
                "Yes if they were interested in understanding how research is conducted and how to improve it in the future in the social science context. This course deepens the understanding of whether research is reliable and how it could be better. Extremely high quality class with a very knowledgeable professor.",
