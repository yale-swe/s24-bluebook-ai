                "Strengths: Professor Fairdosi is very knowledgeable about the material and selects great readings to facilitate discussion:\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes its clear people lack engagement with the class and the same students need to facilitate discussion for everyone else.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fairdosi allows you to gain what you put into the course without putting unnecessary stress or pressure on you. This allowed me to enjoy the readings and assignments because I did not feel stressed. The questions we talked about were also interesting and the concept of the course seemed novel. Also, the introductory lectures were also very good!\r\n\r\nImprovements: This is the first time the course was taught so a few improvements could help. A lot of the required readings were from the records of the Federal Convention but then the vast majority of the conversation was about present day issues. As a result, the pages to read from the federal convention should be more targeted so that students read what is relevant and then more current readings can be introduced.",

                "I think any course with Professor Fairdosi is a good one. Like every seminar, I think what makes or breaks this class is the composition of students and willingness to participate. Occasionally there were some really interesting conversations, other times it fell flat. Professor Fairdosi did a good job of trying to stimulate conversation, and I think that topic, content, and structure of the class has wonderful potential if it continues in the future!"
