In this way he didn't have time to explain things clearly enough and just neglected a lot of things though I can't blame him.",

                "I feel like the questions on the PSets were not always the same level as the questions given in class. Some involved physics with which I am not too familiar. It is hard to learn math virtually, but the Professor was always available to help.",

The habit of mind skills were hard to understand what exactly the professors were looking for. Also, more comments on assessments and problem sets handed in would be helpful instead of just stating which questions were wrong.",

The weakness of the course is that the grading system is difficult to understand at first, but becomes easier over time. The course can be improved with more clear answers from the instructors and responsive actions when the course nears the end of the semester."
