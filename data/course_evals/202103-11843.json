                "The courses weakness was the instructor. Prof Sweeney was constantly late to class, late/absent of her own office hours, and designs problems that we cannot approach due to her lackluster teaching. This course can be improved by either holding her accountable to her job duties and having a more engaging teacher help her design her curriculum, or getting a new instructor all together. Her teaching is not okay for an institution such at Yale, or any institution at all for that matter. She needs to do better.\r\n\r\nThe TAs were lovely and were more helpful/supportive than Sweeney.",
                "This course was fair and effective in teaching physics, but it was difficult for an entry-level physics course and there should be a lower one before it.",
                "Strength: learn variety of physics concepts\r\nWeakness: structure of the course is not very clear and can be a little over the place and don't often learn from what you did wrong. For example, had a quiz, didn't get feedback from the quiz, and had a similar question on the exam 2 days later",
                "I spent 99% of my time in the course frustrated. Recitation was only offered on Thursday nights, groups were never switched around, TAs often didnt know how best to approach problems. Prof Sweeney was sometimes unreachable via email. The TA in charge of gradescope made errors and was not approachable at all about making corrections to grades or about physics in general. Weekly quizzes were graded generously, but honestly did not serve to enhance learning at all. Lecture slides were not very helpful (the one lecture by a TA writing notes on the iPad projected on the screen was the best lecture of the semester). Homework problems werent representative of what was tested on midterms, and there were no solutions in the textbook to the example problems. I did appreciate Prof Sweeneys understanding about the difficulties related to the pandemic though (optional final after finals were moved online, 2 dropped assignments per assignment type, etc.) All in all, this course has potential and I think the Professor did want us to learn and cared about our wellbeing, but everyone was a bit in over their heads. It wasnt difficult to do well, so if you dont care about actually learning physics and just need a physics course, take this one. If you have the math background or actually need to learn physics, take 180.",
                "The grading scheme was the best and most sensical grading scheme I have had at a class at Yale. The ability to grant us nearly full credit if we made a mistake in one small part of the problem was very helpful. The 5 step parameters to answering problems helped make Physics seem simpler than I previously thought it was.\r\n\r\nWhile the format of the recitation is a great idea, I feel as if it was not properly integrated. The recitation questions never fully reflected what we were learning in lecture, and additionally we would be quizzed on them the following Monday. This meant that over the weekend we had to do problem sets on topics we learned in lecture but never reviewed, while simultaneously studying for recitation material. What would be helpful would be posting recitation solutions afterwards, considering that the Monday quizzes are an expansion of those anyway. Additionally, having all the sections/recitations on the same day is extremely inconvenient for students' schedules.\r\n\r\nI wish there had been an Ed Discussion Board set up, which I know was the initial intent but never occurred. This would have made reaching out and asking questions outside of lecture and recitation much easier. Additionally, when it came to review sessions, I wish they were a bit more structure in the sense that a TA would take us through each practice problem, and then at the end we would ask questions and try to work through our questions together as a group. \r\n\r\nLastly, the slides were not extremely helpful during the lectures. What helped me learn more was when the professor actively wrote on the board and explained her process as she was doing it. I hope that next semester, this is a format they implement a bit more.",
                "The course needs better direction. The teaching was all over the place and very ineffective.",
                "This is not a physics class, it is a modeling course. As a result, there are no external resources you can consult for help. This would be fine if the class content was understandable, but it isn't. Lectures are rambling and confusing, with information being poorly presented and explained. To make matters worse, the \"textbook\" is unclear and unhelpful. You will quickly realize that your ONLY hope of doing well is copying the weekly recitation problem, memorizing it, and then writing that information on the quiz. If you actually want to learn, take 180.",
                "This class felt very confusing and chaotic. It didn't feel as though I was understanding any of the new material just memorizing how to do a couple problems.",
                "Strengths: many opportunities for office hours, revisions to facilitate learning of the material \r\nWeaknesses: poor organization, teaching staff was not a \"unified front,\" limited lecture (professor would lecture ~1hr/week, often was late & ended early, which would be fine if we covered all the content necessary for the quizzes/psets--we didn't). Due to limited lecture time, office hours became virtually mandatory. Professor wasn't present at her listed office hours the few times I tried to go. TFs often didn't know how to solve the recitation problems, so there were a few weeks where we left more confused than when we started.",
                "The structure of the course incorporates learning from the textbook readings, lecture content, and independent problem solving well. \r\nHowever, the text itself is jarringly written with a frequent odd choice of notation. The lecture slides rely a bit too heavily on displaying the formula derivations from the text rather than conveying the subject. The TA-led recitation sections also caused frequent misunderstandings due to tutorial that was either incongruous with the other TAs or with the professor.",
                "I think that this course is too confusing and it needs to be simplified.",
                "Strengths include assignments that allowed for practice of content learned in class, office hours, and review sessions.",
                "I wish the lecture slides were posted before lecture so that we can follow along instead of needing to copy stuff down. I think its easier to be given slides ahead so we can follow along and try to understand how problems are done during lecture rather than scrambling to write down notes without processing the information. I also wish that homework recitation problems werent so much more difficult than what we covered in class. I feel like what we covered in class doesnt sufficiently prepare us well enough to do most of the homework problems.\r\n\r\nStrengths: TAs are willing to help.",
                "This course was strong in that it taught students a useful method for solving physics problems, and I found the units on kinematics, forces, work, and energy to be the most useful.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many improvements that must be made:\r\n\r\n- Weekly recitation problems were meant to enhance our knowledge of concepts learned during lecture, but the selected problems were often so specific that they did not prove very useful outside of recitation. Weekly sections would likely be more useful if they were held in a format more similar to office hours, allowing students to ask questions and proceed through worked examples as a group.\r\n\r\n- There must be greater communication between the instructor and the TAs. Many times, the TAs were not able to provide the same solution to homework problems or recitation problems; this made it difficult to study for quizzes and exams. Furthermore, differences in grading policies between TAs and the instructor caused various grading issues that had to be rectified.\r\n\r\n- I often found that we did not go over enough example problems in class to adequately prepare us for the homework assignments, which often took an inordinate amount of time to complete without the help of a TA in office hours. In the future, problems akin to those found on the PSET should be covered in class such that students are actively learning and practicing important concepts.\r\n\r\n- In future years/semesters, it would be beneficial to use a different, published textbook. This semester's textbook was often difficult to navigate due to an overabundance of lengthy equations with little indications as to which were most important. Furthermore, almost all of the example problems in the textbook are rather complex; students require less complex problems at the beginning of a chapter such that a grasp of basic principles can be achieved before moving on to more complex ones. Lastly, the textbook used during this semester focused on a variety of topics that did not seem entirely appropriate for a physics course---even with a life sciences application (e.g., probability). Many students who enroll in this course are looking for a curriculum that prepares them to take the MCAT; as a premedical student, I found that some of the topics covered in this course had little overlap with MCAT material---something I found surprising given the name of the course.\r\n\r\n- The course's weekly schedule should be reevaluated. More specifically, a more appropriate quiz day should be chosen. By holding recitation on Thursday, the quiz on Monday, and setting the PSET deadline for Sunday/Monday, students must review, apply, and study each week's material largely over the course of about three days. To make the material more manageable, the amount of material covered must be decreased, or the schedule must be rearranged such that students have more time to work through problems and ask questions.\r\n\r\n- I found that the release of grades and uploading of course documents (e.g., quiz and recitation files) was often inconsistent or delayed; in future semesters, it would be beneficial for students to receive feedback on a more consistent and efficient basis."

                "Honestly, if you have to choose between 170 and 180, the breakdown is this: \r\n\r\n170 is conceptually simpler. If you learn how the grading/exam system works, then it's easy going as long as you can teach yourself and you study the appropriate material. The professor hardly communicates and doesn't show up to her own office hours, so you will be relying on the TAs and ULAs to carry you. Bring friends or make them in class.\r\n\r\n180 is conceptually harder. The midterms will fuck you over. You will honestly probably learn more, but is the suffering worth it?\r\n\r\nIf you're premed and you need to knock down that year of physics, and you know how to self-learn, just take the easy pill.

                "Odds are you're deciding between this class and 180, in which case there is no correct decision. In 170, you will be forced to memorize content/ problem answers that you do not understand. In 180, you will have to use critical thinking on what are likely very difficult (yet solvable) math problems. You know yourself best, and you should pick your poison accordingly.  \r\nHowever, if you are studying for the MCAT I recommend 180 instead of this class, as you will learn nothing in this course.",

                "If you are even remotely competent with math and care about learning physics, take the 180 sequence instead",
                "No, but if you're looking at this course you either have to take it for your major (me) or you're pre-med. Sorry :( \r\nThat being said, due to the way the course is structured it is easy to get a good grade without really learning physics. The class initially caused me a lot of stress before I learned how to best take it, but after that became quite manageable. Go to office hours for the pset (which you don't actually get tested on), memorize what you learn in recitation and utilize the rubric to score well on the quizzes, and write down those questions on your note sheet for the exams; then do all that again.",
                "Unless the organization of the class changes, I would not recommend taking this over Physics 180.",

                "At this time, I would not recommend this course to another student. The course suffers from a multitude of organizational and structural issues, and many of the topics covered are not particularly useful outside the classroom. Until PHYS 170 undergoes substantial modification, it is likely more worthwhile to take a more traditional physics course (i.e., PHYS 180)."
