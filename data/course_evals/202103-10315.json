            "comments": [
                "Readings are fascinating (for the most part), but quite dense\/dry\/academically written and quite long. Discussions, while interesting, often tended to lag on for too long, so we didnt cover as much on the syllabus as Rasheed had intended. However, Rasheed is a brilliant and open-minded discussion leader and educator, and I improved my writing skills a whole lot thanks to this course.",
                "Weaknesses: Probably the readings. At the beginning of the class, we examine argument construction of readings relevant to our focus on \"global sound\". I felt that the readings were either puzzling, dry, or difficult to decipher. At times, all of us would be lost trying to understand the readings. However, it gets better once we do hands-on writing activities.\r\nStrengths: Rasheed's flexibility. He is incredibly accommodating on assignments, and he probes you in the right ways to optimally articulate your points. Definitely meet with him one-on-one if you take the class, because he gives the best insight during those sessions.\r\nImprovements: I enjoyed the hands-on activities like the soundwalk, writing games, and partner discussions. I feel like the class would benefit greatly if Rasheed gave those more priority.",
                "The incorporation of music was amazing. The range of music introduced was admirable. There was music from every part of the world and the introduction of instruments not common in the U.S.. The assignments were a reasonable length and well structured. I loved being able to directly relate what I was learning to every aspect of history and life.\r\n\r\nThe readings were a tad difficult to grasp at first, so more in class reading would have been helpful. More  1 on 1 help with writing would be beneficial. At times, I felt disadvantaged because I did not have a music theory background or experience playing an instrument, but this was short lived.",
                "I really appreciated the selection of readings and different formats of class engagement from discussions and panels, to sound walks.",
                "Strengths - small class and could ask many questions. Class was fun",
                "We are given plenty of time and preparation for any assignments done and I think the leadup and tools are presented very clearly. It didn't feel basic, though, because the readings were interesting and selected well. \r\n\r\nI understand that it's probably not fitting for a professor overseeing a seminar to be overly critical of students arguments, but I sometimes felt that there was a dichotomy between how we would be assessed in seminars compared to how we would be assessed during papers. I would make some admittedly very sloppy arguments during the seminar that would go completely unchallenged, and they were deservedly torn apart during paper feedback. Not a terribly notable weakness, though, because paper feedback was very well done. I just sometimes wish there could have been a bit more exchange of ideas during the seminar part. That could be dependent on who you take the class with, though. I also sometimes felt like the full depth of the readings wasn't explored. It's clear that Professor Tazudeen is an extremely knowledgeable guy, and I found that seminars were filled with rather mechanical reactions to the readings. That's on me though-- I can't say I was different. \r\n\r\nOverall solid course-- I learned how to turn in a paper that's not awful and I liked most of the readings.",
                "I saw no weaknesses.",
                "Professor Tazudeen was one of the most helpful instructors I have ever had throughout my history of education. Very knowledgeable Professor that know an unbelievable amount about this course."

                "It depends. If you're truly interested in sound and humanities, the course is definitely worth your while. If you're looking for a class with an aim to improve your argumentative writing, Global Sound is still great, but probably not the best class to exercise that skill. In that case, I would look at other 114 classes, perhaps even 120 classes to see what suits your fancy.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone. You do not need music theory experience!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to improve their argumentative writing. Professor Tazudeen gives very clear and helpful feedback and the class was facilitated for good discussion amongst students. My favorite part of the course was our panel presentations after the large research project where we were able to hear about our peer's work.",
                "Yes, professor kept the class interesting",
                "If you already feel confident as a writer-- not just in terms of your ability to churn out words, but to craft and cite an argument-- probably not. If not, I'd recommend it. I was definitely in the second camp and feel a bit more confident approaching higher-level courses after this one. I don't think I ever had any \"wow this is revelatory\" moments, but not every course has to be like that. It's truly middle of the road when it comes to work-- if you plan even slightly, you'll never feel time crunched. I did not plan in the slightest, and I still made it through.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student.  Its completely fine to have no musical background to take this course.  You will learn new things that will take you out of your comfort zone, but in a good way.",
                "Absolutely, Professor Tazudeen is an extremely fantastic Professor. He prioritized this course and his students so much that he would reply to urgent emails at midnight if needed. Highly recommend this course to students."
