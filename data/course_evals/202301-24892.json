                "An understanding of Mikhail Bulgakov's phenomenal book, The Master and Margarita.",
                "The course can only be described as a master class in Russian literature. The curriculum is incredible. Doctor Shelekpayev guides students through a deep dive into one of the best novels of the 20th century. The novel, similar to that of his semi-autobiographical character the Master, is the defining work of Mikhail Bulgakov arguably one of the most persecuted writers in the history of the Soviet Union. Bulgakov had no shortage of criticisms of the Soviet state, and throughout the twelve years that it took him to complete this work he cleverly laced his position(s) in between the lines of this extraordinary novel. With the direction of Doctor Shelekpayev, students are led through a subsurface exploration of each of the novels 33 chapters, unveiling a wide variety of themes that ultimately aid the class in assembling a five-dimensional portrait of the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s which only this course can provide."

                "Strengths: very charming professor, relatively low workload, relatively easy content.  Lots of opportunities to speak out and share your own opinions of the novel.  Weaknesses: it turned out that I did not care about the novel enough to discuss it for an entire semester.  I do not even like Bulgakov.",
                "Professor Nari is the best strength",
                "Love that it's focused on one novel - makes for a really deep experience reading and never felt rushed to skim\/skip readings",
                "Classes were very engaging and I appreciated that the seminar format allowed for active participation and discussion. The novel is also fascinating, and I loved the fact that we had the entire semester to cover it, which really allowed us to not only examine the novel in depth but examine it from historical and intertextual perspectives.",
                "This course was incredibly interesting and engaging, I enjoyed going at a slow pace and analyzing the book closely instead of rushing through the novel.",
                "This class was well organized and well run. There was a good balance between large group discussions as a whole class, classes when the professor would lecture us about a certain topic relevant to the book, and small group discussions. I think it could be better if there was more feedback provided to the students throughout the semester, because the only feedback we received the entire time was on the midterm essay.",
                "strengths - highly engaging course, very well organized, amazing and knowledgable professor. While I grew up in a post-Soviet household and had some knowledge about Stalin's Russia, the professor made sure to share and discuss any relevant material for the students who did not have the background. We also covered one book in full depth, allowing me to fully understand the text. The book is full of symbolism and if one does not dive deep into each part, the plot might not make sense. I took another Russian lit class a few semesters back with a different professor and we read 16-20 different literary pieces - fair to say I did not retain any of that while I was fully engaged during the term. \r\nweaknesses - literally none",
                "I think the course material and activities were both very interesting. I enjoyed our discussions and I think the class was appropriately paced. I do think the class could be structured a bit better. However, Nari was very accommodating throughout the semester, changing the quizzes to better match the course. I also think it could be interesting to bring in more outside readings (or possibly TV or film?) to talk about responses to The Master and Margarita. These, however, are small changes; overall, I think the course is very interesting and should definitely be offered again.",
                "i took this class in its pilot year, so Nari was learning just as we were. But you cannot hold that against him. his teaching was so reasonable and so effective. He is an excellent professor, and one to be grateful to have the opportunity to learn from.",
                "Strengths: extremely kind and knowledgeable professor, very adaptable to student feedback throughout semester, really nice to delve so deeply into just one novel, classes rarely felt repetitive because prof would always have a new activity to engage with the novel \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not much feedback \/ grading",
                "No weaknesses at all. Ill list here a few of the top strengths: 1) Accessibility As someone who struggles with social anxiety, I knew when registering for the course that the seminar format was going to be my biggest challenge. I found immediately that Doctor Shelekpayev worked with me in this regard, something I am so grateful for as it completely alleviated my anxieties from the very beginning and enabled me to excel in this course. 2) Regarding tests... the two tests are more than reasonable, and are actually incredibly fun. Some students mentioned that the first test brought everyone together because of one question in particular (which I obviously wont describe here, but I hope that question is left on the test as it really did spark much conversation and laughter). Additionally, a third test was dropped and in its place we were given a very simple project which was so much fun. This included making only two very small edits to the Master and Margarita page on Wikipedia. I cant wait to see how long that page gets over the years with everybodys input (that is, if Doctor Shelekpayev continues the project, which I hope he does). 3) The two papers (midterm and final) were other highlights of the course. There is no shortage of topics to choose from when discussing this novel, so students wont have trouble finding a topic for these two essays. Many students even remarked that the papers were a lot of fun, which I very much agree with. In the lead up to the midterm paper, the instructor held a workshop on finding the right essay question (for you), and this was incredibly insightful and helpful. Great feedback on the essays as well, and grading is easy on these. For example, I relied on quite an outdated source for my midterm essay (mostly because one of my main sources had a few applicable books in the Yale library regarding my particular essay topic), but this didnt hurt my grade. I also used the feedback from that midterm essay to find better sources for my final paper. 4) Grading is more than fair. If you want an A, then read the novel closely, come to class, and participate in the discussions as best as you can (obviously if there is an accessibility barrier in this regard, Doctor Shelekpayev will work with you). 5) The in-class discussions just wow. Doctor Shelekpayev facilitates incredibly lively and fruitful discussions. This is why you must take this course. I mentioned this before, but it is worth repeating... I found that my assigned readings were aided by the many insights shared by the students during our rich in-class discussions (led by Doctor Shelekpayev), and these discussions enabled me to see much deeper into the nuances of the text. The discussions complemented the assigned readings very well, and had I read this novel without these insights I can only say that I would have missed so much (I need to stress this, as this realization was itself like a major wake-up call\/ epiphany for me, in that when dealing with the works of persecuted writers, we must read that much closer). Finally, the assigned reading load is light and manageable, and this is likely because there is a lot to uncover in each chapter. Bulgakov spent twelve years on this novel and every sentence is like a purposeful calculation. Every scene\/ episode in this novel is like a move on a chess board, and this is something that will be discussed in-depth throughout the course. Again, no weaknesses at all."

                "Yes, definitely. It is a great opportunity to truly examine the novel in depth.",
                "Yes! It was interesting, and you learn a lot of new things about Russian literature, a lot of novel genres and the history of the USSR. I really enjoyed it.",
                "I would strongly recommend reading the book--or at least, having a very good idea of its style and what it is about--before taking the class. I think if you like the book, you will like the class a lot. Personally, I didn't love the class, but I don't think that's the fault of the class at all; I just got tired of the repetitive nature of the book and its over-the-top fantasy satire style.",
                "Yes, absolutely! As a STEM major, I completely loved this class. Nari was an absolute pleasure to have as a professor and I learned so much about The Master and Margarita, Bulgakov, and the Soviet Union.",
                "absolutely! Dr Shelekpayev is an amazing professor and this course not only helps one to understand Master and Margarita, but it also teaches the historic background of the time it was written. Spasibo professor for a great semester!",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wanted a better understanding of Russian literature and culture. I think the Master and Margarita is a great book and Nari was great at teaching us more about its context.",
                "Take it! Its a great class and a great literary work. You cant go wrong!",
                "Would recommend as an easy WR and the novel at hand is a fun read",
                "If you are interested in the underground protest culture or the intelligentsia of the Soviet Union, I would highly recommend this course. Additionally, Professor Shelekpayev is a phenomenally brilliant professor.",
                "Yes absolutely 100% recommend. In my opinion, the course is a must for students majoring in Russian and REEES, although it is certainly not limited to these majors. With the breadth of themes covered in the novel, the course itself is applicable to a wide variety of majors at Yale (if not all majors). Our class in particular had students from various STEM disciplines, as well as many humanities majors not including Russian or REEES. I would particularly recommend the course for students interested in learning more about oppression of artists, works by persecuted Soviet writers (think Bulgakov, Zamyatin, Babel, Akhmatova, and Pasternak), life in the early Soviet Union under Stalin, censorship, propaganda, despotism, administrative and societal corruption, the Great Purge, secret police, magical realism, the grotesque, Faust, and much more. Even if you dont know anything about any of these topics and just need a writing or a social sciences credit, this is a great way to dip your feet into something new. Doctor Shelekpayev is welcoming to all students. This may even turn out to be one of your most memorable classes at Yale."
