                "Lectures were interesting.\r\nHomework wasn't very clearly graded, textbook design was suboptimal.",
                "Strengths: Su Laoshi is great. He is very flexible and is always willing to help with any questions. Every class, we go over the readings and any related material. No weaknesses.",
                "Professor Wei Su tells very interesting and insightful stories, including background info about the novels as well as his own experiences. They showed traditional Chinese beliefs, the thoughts and lives of the Chinese people during the time, and Professor Wei Su's wisdom. Also, after returning our essays, he spends class time explaining major writing tips. One weakness is that our class often went overtime, making me have to rush to my next class.",
                "Strengths: The course material is quite interesting, as it draws from contemporary Chinese literature. It was a nice change of pace from the textbook readings in CHNS 162 and 163. As always, Su Laoshi is an excellent professor who is highly passionate about literature and cares for his students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Weaknesses are few. The one thing I noticed about this course, however, was that there were fewer opportunities than in CHNS 162\/163 to practice speaking. This may have been been due to the online format (it is understandable that class discussion is challenging over Zoom), but I think one or two more oral presentation assignments could have been helpful.",
                "The class is a great opportunity to practise reading and writing in Chinese. The class' greatest strength is definitely Prof. Su himself, he just has so much to share!\r\n\r\nThe textbook could be presented a bit better. It is only in simplified characters, and seems to be a photocopy with a lot of hand-written corrections. An actual PDF with selectable text would be very useful for students taking the class remotely.",
                "Strength - the stories are interesting, and the Professor Su explains in detail the historical and cultural contexts of each story\r\nWeakness - there are very little chances to speak or practice any new vocabs and expressions. Minimal feedback to writing assignments",
                "I absolutely loved this class! Professor Su loved to share his stories with each author, and it was always my favorite part of the course. Prof. Su also made sure that everyone was engaged during class. I can't think of anything to improve for this course --  it was amazing."

                "Yes! If you're considering taking a class with Su Laoshi, this is a great one. I would recommend taking this course before CHNS 165 in the spring as the readings are shorter and there are fewer words to study for in dictations.",
                "I think that this course is very meaningful for students seeking to understand Chinese people. By reading famous novels on the level of advanced Chinese that many Chinese people read and learning about their historical and cultural background, students can get more prepared to get along well with Chinese people.",
                "Yes. If you are an advanced Chinese learner, this course is a great way to get introduced to \"real world\" Chinese. One develops not only improved language skills, but also a feel for different authors' styles. This is part of what Su Laoshi calls \"tasting Chinese\"- understanding the connotations of words and how authors use language to achieve certain effects. Additionally, this course features a few essay assignments through which a student can greatly improve their writing skills.",
                "Yes, I definitely recommend taking a class with Prof. Su to anyone at this language level",
                "Yes but not if you want to practice speaking",
                "Yes! Please take this course! Prof. Su is so engaging, and I found myself loving Chinese literature more and more each class.",
