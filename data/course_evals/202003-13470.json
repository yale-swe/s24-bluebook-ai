In that vein, it was a broad overview of some of the themes, topics and methods covered in the realm of cognitive science. Though the online format of classes in a virtual semester inherently makes them much less engaging (a fact a guest lecturer once spoke to in class) I felt that I still retained a lot from many of the lectures due to Professor Scholl's entertaining and personal style of lecturing . The thought paper pushed me to deeply consider the real world applications of everything we had learned about thus far, and the act of studying for the two main exams allowed me to reach out to classmates I might not otherwise have met and get together to make collaborative study guides and work through bits of lecture we didn't quite understand. Professor Scholl encouraged this kind of work and deep thought in his course, and implementing his recommendations made the absorption of a highly diverse set of material that much more doable. The most captivating part of the actual course material itself was how highly applicable it is to life itself- many of the experiments involved perceptions or ideas we ourselves had experienced or encountered at some point in our lives, which made learning about them in more depth very rewarding and fun to talk about with family and friends.",

The course has incredible breadth, covering a basis for cognitive science as well as various \"case studies\" for aspects of cognition that Scholl finds especially interesting. However, this means there is not an incredible level of depth with any one topic, so any one seeking to learn a great deal about perception, reasoning and decision-making, linguistics, or any one topic through the lens of cognitive science, expect to learn some about that topic but a whole lot about other topics as well. Pretty understandable for a survey course though.",

                "organization: so bad. i didn't know what was relevant and what was irrelevant, and usually that kind of thing is pretty obvious, but when the TFs and the professor literally tell you to \"relisten to the lectures and see which parts he talks about the most\" as a study guide.....ok\r\ni understand that he's very engaged and enthusiastic about the content but the way he would get distracted wasn't helpful. and when a TF told us that he didn't like it when one TF would send stuff out to the whole class instead of their assigned group of students was strange, like why don't you like us getting equal access to information...\r\n\r\nand i don't really understand why he won't use canvas? having to go to his own website to get all my materials and relisten to lectures and such was a hassle, and i don't really think canvas is so ugly or so inconvenient that he feels that he has to make his own website for us to go to, especially when all the other yale professors use it perfectly fine... he cropped his lectures weird too. instead of categorizing them by day, he did it by lecture topic and that was annoying too\r\nhe also wouldn't upload grades at all, just emailed them to us... no updates in the semester, you just have a vague notion of whether you're passing or not\r\nknowing final grades shouldn't be russian roulette \r\n\r\nbut otherwise, the content itself is very interesting",
                "This class was always very interesting and easily applicable to the real world. It is a very good introductory level course. Weaknesses that come with the breadth of this class is it feels like (especially only meeting 2x a week) that we breezed past certain topics. Additionally, there was very little feedback on submitted work.",
                "Strengths: fascinating subject matter, cool demonstrations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Apart from the flashy visual demonstrations, I found the lectures to be somewhat dull\/monotone\/unengaging",
                "extremely large class, TAs are overworked. lecturer was great though",
                "The lectures were somewhat hard to follow, it felt difficult to sort through the relevant information. All of the material, however, was extremely interesting and highly engaging.",
                "The amount of reading proved overwhelming at times. I enjoyed the interactive examples incorporated into lessons to teach the main ideas.",
                "Professor Scholl is incredibly energetic. He brought more enthusiasm for this class than any other professor I had this semester. Since this class is a survey of a broad field, however, at times it felt a little stitched together rather than the course material building on itself each week.",
                "The course was great",
                "The greatest strength was the interesting content in lecture. The greatest weakness was that there was very little support outside lecture to help us confirm our understanding of the material and prepare for exams and essays. Students could benefit greatly from sections, a given option for study groups, and sample exam questions and responses to those questions. I struggled with the exams not because I didn't understand content or pay attention in class, but because the answers asked of us were very specific and it was not made clear to us how to answer the questions.",
                "The lectures were usually very engaging but sometimes hard to follow. I would, however, attribute this more to the online format than anything else as I understand it must be very difficult to teach maximally effectively on a zoom call. I think that the first exam was a somewhat frustrating experience for some of us because besides the format we knew very little about what sorts of questions we would see. So a bit more transparency with regards to that first exam would likely go a long way in alleviating some student anxiety. Additionally, the \"thought paper\" was, albeit likely intentionally, about as open-ended as you can imagine, and since the course dipped lightly into a variety of topics and we were instructed to avoid doing outside research, this made for a bit of a tough brainstorming and writing experience. In retrospect this was probably a good thing-- churning through many thoughts and potential ideas to arrive at the most appropriate one is a great exercise-- but it was certainly tough. It may have helped if we were provided a few more sample papers to get a sense of what was expected of us, and what qualified as truly original thought.",
                "Strengths included the lectures were always interesting and the immense support received especially from our teaching fellows. THe concepts were nice and the reading questions were very interesting at times. Some weaknesses were that some reading question articles were really long and unnecessary to understand the concept. At times the recorded lectures didn't makes sense as he would refer to his mouse in the lecture but the mouse would not be visible in the recording causing the students to get confused,",
                "The strengths are that the lectures are very organized and easily followable. I would say that it clear what was going to be on the test, but that was more easily known by going to the TA review sessions because they would go over major topics and ideas. However, the test questions are very vague and fairly difficult to answer, even though I felt like I had a good grasp on the material as he was going over it, so it was hard to know what details were important. I think an improvement would be having summary slides or big topic points at some point in the lecture to better organize what to focus on.",
                "Weakness: this class lacks feedback on how we are doing throughout the semester\r\n\r\nStrengths: the super kind professor and TFs\r\nProf. Scholl is a gem and while some lectures feel like they drag on due to the topic, he still maintains his subtle comedy style of teaching\r\nThe amount of controlled breadth in the topics is a strength too, the class did not feel like it moved too fast through the topics and spent due time on each",
                "The strengths were the variety of topics bevause it made the class exciting and engaging. Some weaknesses is that some class topics were not fully taught which made it hard to grasp for the exam. The readings on certain topics like linguistics were very difficult to grasp by myself.",
                "The strengths of this course were that Professor Scholl was extremely passionate about the topics that he was teaching. Because of this, however, he often would spend too much time on a topic, and that would cause us to be behind in terms of the content. This meant that the readings that we would be doing would not coincide with the lecture topics, and that discrepancy would cause some confusion in terms of learning. Another strength of this course was that the professor and TFs would stay behind after lectures to answer any questions in a group office hours format. This made it so that students could often receive direct feedback on the questions that they had that related to the course material that was just covered. A weakness of this course was that because there were only 3 TFs, the TFs were overworked and could not really provide direct feedback on the reading questions that were submitted to them. Grading was also a bit slow because of that.",
                "Some weaknesses include the fact that you will only receive feedback about your performance based on your midterm, which can only be viewed \/ reviewed with your TF during office hours, which fill up very quickly. Then, you write a paper and also take a final. However, you will not know how you did on these assignments until (I assume) the final grade is released. In addition, there is little to no confidence in how the curve is going to break down. Prof. Scholl said that he was \"incredibly lenient\" in grading the exams, but they ended up having an average of a 70. I don't want to focus on grades, but these are some things that caused a lot of stress during an already stressful time.",
                "I would say the strengths and weaknesses are mainly related to the trade off of breadth vs. depth.",
                "This is a very good introductory course for covering a range of topics in cognitive science while still going into depth in many of them. However, even though it's structured in a way that lets the professor cover several facets of cognitive science, this course can only discuss so much with the time we have. I wish there was a way to have been able to go over more content while not getting too bogged down in certain case studies or examples...or, better yet, a way to poll students about which topics in cognitive science they'd be most interested in learning each semester.",
                "The strengths of the course include the breadth of material covered, ranging from core concepts to specific domains of research such as perception and language. The course could be improved by having more assignments tailored to classwork material, as it was difficult to grasp the main concepts and ideas from the lectures.",
                "A weakness of this course was the grading system . The grades we received on homework were based on completion only and no feedback on the depth of our thinking about the readings save for the most exemplary reading responses. The only feedback during the term was our Midterm grade, which was administered via Canvas and results delivered via email reporting only the percentage. We weren't even allowed to see which answers we got wrong on the exam page despite the fact that a significant portion of the test was multiple choice. Having a larger number of low-stakes small quizzes throughout the term will help prepare students for the midterm and final and provide an impetus to do the readings. Also this method will help provide a better picture of how well students are digesting the material - which is a lot.",

It is evident that lots of care went into the structure of this class, both to ensure that each topic received appropriate screen time and to follow a thematic flow that was established to better understand the different topics.",
                "The lectures were very entertaining and informing. Professor Scholl is a great lecturer that can teach the class content while keeping everyone engaged. Some of the required readings were a little too technical, but overall the class was great.",
                "The lectures are amazing. The topics were interesting and Professor Scholl does a good job of engaging the students through videos, jokes, and \"games\" even over the virtual format. The only weakness of this course was the individual interactions\/engagement with the course, which is really hard to do with 100+ students in the class.",
                "The organization of the course was great for learning. The readings were accompanied with reading questions and the professor went over the readings in class as well. During the lectures, the readings were"

                "I would say the COVID practices for the course were very successful and appreciated. Exams being open-note simply made the most sense (and in my opinion, is a better exam format in general because it forces better understanding about the bigger picture from the material rather than simple recall).",

                "This course as a lecture was very easily geared towards learning online and having lectures recorded was super helpful to reference diagrams. However, due to this it would be very easy to disengage.",
                "I felt that virtual discussion sections for this class may have helped to balance the lectures",

                "Professor Scholl had everyone keep their monitors on during class. Seeing all the student's faces certainly made me feel more engaged.",
                "I thought they handled the online learning well",
                "The TA office hours and pre-exam reviews were helpful. The guest lectures were also very engaging. I think in class there was room for dialogue or questions that could be posed to students that would've made lectures more engaging. Breakout-rooms did not have this effect, and usually it was awkward and silent in the breakout-rooms.",
                "Office hours were sometimes helpful, but it might have been more productive if they were guided to a certain extent.",
                "Good.",
                "I liked that lectures were recorded, but I wish they could be uploaded earlier. In many cases, they took more than a day, which meant that I was always delayed in the class and had to take notes and watch multiple lectures at the end of the week or even in the next week. Also, activities or solutions to practice problems were not recorded, making that aspect of the class just neglected to asynchronous students.",
                "I enjoyed the live lectures a lot, but I wish there were more interactive portions (breakout rooms, etc.).",
                "It was nice that the lectures were recorded, but it often took forever for the lecture recordings to be posted on the course website. I also wish that the professor had recorded from the beginning of class to the end of class, rather than just recording the lectures themselves. Because he opted to not recording the brief \"debriefing\" time that he took before class, students who relied on just the recording missed out on important information about the exams and such. I also wish that there were more opportunities to communicate with other students in the class through sections or something- the class often felt very lonely.",

                "I think the lecture format was fine - aside from a few of the demos, most of it was probably roughly the same experience as being in person.",

                "The virtual live lectures were effective, as well as the guest lectures through zoom.",
                "Online lectures were engaging because Professor Scholl is a very dynamic lecturer. He packs in many images, examples, and activities and succeeds in engineering fascinating moments of guided discovery during class.",
                "Everything was great---I didn't really understand that rationale for excluding certain segments of the lecture (especially running through practice problems)---if there's a concern about student privacy, shouldn't those students just be made aware that they're being recorded? It only happened once, but it was frustrating to not be able to check my answers because I had an emergency and couldn't make it to the live lecture.",

                "I thought this course was wonderfully adapted to the circumstances students were in due to the pandemic. The recorded lectures were so helpful and the website structure was so nice because it was easy to navigate and find recent announcements and course updates on there.",
                "The lectures were very informational and provided us with the information we needed, however the lack of participation in the class made it difficult to retain focus during the whole lecture.",

There was enough assistance available to talk about the themes of the course and about other ideas in general, which helped to facilitate interesting discourse, especially for students that were considering the major.",
                "I am glad that lectures were recorded -- I often listened to the recorded lectures instead of attending live, which was officially discouraged, but it was much better for facilitating learning, I thought (I could pause, repeat stuff, listen on a higher speed, etc) -- so I'm glad that was possible, though I understood the appeal of attending live."

Don't let this throw you off, because there's sure to be something about this course that you'll love.",

If you are remotely interested in cognition and some of the more interdisciplinary aspects of psychology and the study of the mind, I would highly recommend it to any student, regardless of major or background with the material. It is an intro class so it is very beginner-friendly and assumes no prior knowledge really. Some of the material can be a bit annoying and tedious to learn (turing machines and case-assignment), but they are more than doable and the TFs were amazing.",

The things I learned in the class were so interesting to me, and I shared them with nearly everyone in my life who would listen. Professor Scholl is also great at lectures, but definitely be wary that there isn't much support in the class. The TAs have office hours, but there's virtually nothing else that helps you confirm your understanding of the material and prepare for exams. If you know the material really well the exam questions are fair, but the problem is you're likely to get a low grade because because you don't answer the questions the specific way they are looking for.",

                "Most definitely yes because you learn so much about yourself and it is fun aside from all the dense courses you might be taking.",
                "I would recommend this course if you know little to nothing about Cognitive Science, but you like the idea of interdisciplinary learning or would like to take a CGSC class in the future. While there could be improvement, it is still a great first-year or introductory class to this field that gives a wide breadth of knowledge, so you can discover what topics are most interesting to you.",

                "Absolutely, if you are interested in cognitive\/brain sciences at all, I would say \"go for it!\" I can't speak for the other professors, but Prof. Scholl definitely made this class a worthwhile experience that I was sad to see end (but luckily now I can take one of his seminars). I would say this class is very accessible for unrelated majors. Plus, there is no hellish intro textbook. We read a great selection of research research papers and relevant articles.",

For the tests, try to ask yourself the point\/takeaway of each major study that was covered - preparation for the tests can feel overwhelming, but it shouldn't be.",
                "Yes absolutely! This course is so much fun to take and Professor Scholl really makes it interesting with his witty jokes and strange tangents.

                "Yep, if you're interested in the subject, and especially if you're a first year or sophomore! Scholl is an engaging lecturer who really really loves what he studies, and the material is presented clearly and effectively. He's a bit dogmatic about what he believes (which are, roughly, the standard presuppositions of modern science: objectivity is possible and science has it, the nature of consciousness is just something that science hasn't figured out *yet* rather than genuinely beyond its scope, our minds are computers, etc.) -- so just be prepared for that if you're coming at this class from either a background of theory\/critique\/the humanities in general.",
                "Yes! This course wasn't for my major but it has been one of the most interesting courses I've taken. You learn so much about how your brain works and a lot of the material is very surprising and relevant to everyday life.",
                "Absolutely. This class combines philosophy, psychology, computation, logic, statistics, robotics and more to provide a comprehensive view of the human mind. It is challenging but Professor Scholl and the excellent TF's made the material approachable.",
