We do a lot of personal work, and I learned to open myself up to challenges and very interesting performances through the work we did off stage. Also, writing every day -- it may seem tedious but in the long run has such a strong, positive impact on your work.",
                "How to develop a solo show, how to use your body and physicality in performance, importance of a daily writing practice",
                "I learned some skills for performance and writing, specifically paying attention to the body, spontaneous writing, following desires, embodying characters, and telling stories.",
                "Through this course, I developed the habit of writing and journaling regularly. It also allowed me to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.",
                "In this course, I gained skills in general creative writing, but especially for a solo voice. I gained collaborative skills in theater-making, i.e. I learned how to effectively critique other performers and directors, and I also gained experience directing and acting for solo performance in collaboration with a partner."

                "All perfect. Deb is a magic.",
                "I think the biggest weakness of this class is the lack of feedback and structure. There was often times where none of us knew what was going on. Furthermore, whenever we turned in work/papers we would receive little to no feedback on the work we had written. (the most I received were a few annotations/comments on my midterm paper) The lack of feedback can be often very discouraging. \r\nThe strength of the class was all the work we did discussing, on movement, voice, etc. We were definitely challenged a lot, and it made for a very interactive class.",
                "Strengths: Deb, as always. Class with Deb is always a joy and she creates a fun, welcoming space to share your stories. I also enjoyed the warm-ups we did and the automatic writing. Weaknesses: not really a weakness per se, but if you take a Deb you gotta be prepared to not have a syllabus and just kinda go along with vibes for the semester which can be easy and fun at times and also confusing and stressful at times.",
                "Strengths are the practical nature of the course. It is a non-theoretical classes, and the instructor assigns a lot of practical assignments to develop habits, whether it is through performance or writing. The Weakness is that the instructions arent always clear in terms of whats being asked, whether that is by design to foster creativity is unclear to me.",
                "The greatest strength of the course is the quality of feedback and collaboration between the students, as well as from the professor. Exercises in writing and sharing were done frequently enough to develop confidence in these skills. The somewhat small class size allowed for a sense of trust and safety in the room, which facilitated truthful and deep discussions and investigations."

                "Of course. Especially for those who wants to try solo performance.",
                "Yes I would, even if you aren't a Theater major. There's so much to be taken from this class, so much that can be applied to your personal life outside the stage like how to present yourself, how to take up space in a room, how to open yourself emotionally and vulnerably. If you take a chance on the class, you will definitely take a lot from it.",
                "YES! If you love performing and writing, I would 100% recommend this class (and any Deb class for that matter!). I felt so supported in my journey as a solo performer throughout the course from both Deb and the class. It was such a welcoming and open space, and I always looked forward to each and every class to share stories from what happened since we last saw each other. The final presentation and final solo performances were such cool opportunities to actually create our own pieces and share them with each other. I wish I could take this class all over again!",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. It is not a lot of work, but it is perhaps one of the only courses at Yale when you might wish you were doing more. The content is fascinating and you will get a unique chance to reflect on your life, what matters to you, and how to express yourself as a synecdoche of the world.",
                "Great for anyone that wants to improve writing and solo performance skills.",
                "Yes I would - this course is great for both beginners and for slightly more experienced solo performers."
