In addition to learning the technical elements of light and shadow, as well as the practice elements of proper paper handling and pencil grading, I also learned about historical and modern artists whose drawings have marked important moments in the understanding of drawing as art.",
                "I learned all about mark-making and working in graphite and charcoal. I learned basic figure marking and learning how to translate feelings and internal dialogue to pictures.",
                "I was able to improve a lot of my fundamental skills for drawing and also learned a wide range of new techniques\/materials that I've never worked with prior.",
                "I learned so much in this class, largely how much I enjoy drawing. This class was a wonderful introduction to the art major here, and made me rediscover my love for drawing. I learned how to approach art in nontraditional ways, I learned the many different applications of different materials like charcoal, versus graphite, versus pen, versus colored pencil, versus chalk, versus combinations of all. I also learned how to think through composition and challenge my ability to tell a story through a single piece.",

                "I think the class is structured well and we got a lot of time to work on each project. I learned a lot from the professor and also from the workshops. I think we could have had some more variety in lessons, with more different exercises. We could have also done some more technical practicing and assignments.",
                "The instructor of this course was incredible. In addition to giving fantastic and precise feedback, Cam also challenged me to give better feedback on my own work and the work of my peers. There were no \"busy work\" assignments throughout the course. The readings were incredibly useful and direct. The drawing homeworks were crucial to my understanding and personal artistic development. Although I recommend that there be more materials exploration in the future, this course is a fantastic introduction to drawing.",
                "Strengths: Cameron as an instructor, time spent in class to work, short presentations followed by hands-on work\r\nWeaknesses: not enough time!",
                "I really appreciated the amount of work time during class and the feedback that we received throughout the course. Overall, ART 114 was just a fantastic course that allowed me to learn a lot of new techniques while still improving my existing skillset.",
                "I genuinely have no critiques for this course. I absolutely loved having Cameron teach. I would love to see him back in this class in the future!!",
                "Awesome intro! Wish we got more guidance in media other than charcoal, I feel like I didnt get much of a chance to build my confidence in graphite or pen",
                "Class time was split into an array of tasks that supplied great variety, though I felt I would have leaned further with increased time intervals"

                "YES! Not only did I learn the technical skills of drawing, which serve as the foundations for almost every other media, but I also learned to think about my creative practice in completely new and crucial way.",
                "If you are willing to put the time into your work, you will certainly see great results!",
                "Yes I definitely would recommend this course if you are interested in learning how to draw\/want to find a space to be creative!",
                "Definitely definitely would recommend this course. Absolutely loved it.",
                "Absolutely. If you are also an engineering major, I cannot recommend enough to take an art course while you are here. It allows you to use and engage with a very different part of your brain than stem classes which is really refreshing-and rewarding if you are willing to take it seriously. Any art class would be great, but basic drawing with Cameron Barker has been nothing but stellar. Cam combines his impressive formal experience with an humble and accessible teaching style. This course certainly requires more work outside class than I had expected. I found myself spending hours each week on the take-home drawing projects\/homeworks. With this invested time, however, this class up the framework for serious improvement of your art skills-no matter your experience.",
                "I gush to many friends the serendipity of this course with Cam and Earthen and classmates. Each Basic Drawing class is shaped by its group, and I am grateful for mine. Our trajectory through materials and sight guided us into drawing no matter previous practice."
