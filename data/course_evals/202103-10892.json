                "Strengths: This class gets you to learn python and forces you to engage heavily with the material. Victor is also very passionate about the class and that shows. He also writes great notes. Exams were generally fair but I wish he would have been more clear about what was on exam 2 as it was the year before's exam 2 and 3 and just a huge amount of material to study. I also definitely struggled with completing both exams in the hour and fifteen minutes and feel I could have done better with more time.\r\nWeaknesses: This class assumes a lot of background knowledge that I did not have. The textbook was completely inaccessible to me. I wish the beginning of the class and been taught slower and we had spent more time on things like bra-ket notation. I was so overwhelmed the first couple of weeks and it left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the class.\r\nWe never received any of our homeworks back or had answers posted so I could never learn from them. I also had no sense of how I was doing in the class other than exams. I wish we had more homework that was easier, breaking the work down a little for those of us that haven't done upper level math in a few years. Some of our coding assignments later in the semester also seemed crazy hard to me for a class that didn't assume you knew python going in.",
                "Nothing to improve",
                "Class is very dense. I am amazed that it can be completed in a single semester.",
                "The professor sometimes assume students are able to follow him deriving equations. But I personally sometimes feel confused about where I am and why we are deriving this. \r\nAlso QM knowledge is the prerequisite of this class, which is kind of unexpected.\r\nBut the class over all gives a really broad overview of the stat mech and talks about things in depth and in practice. \r\nThe professor is also very passionate.",
                "Maybe include a few Python sections in the beginning of the semester to acclimate students with computational tasks. Also, including short pseudocodes for calculating stuff like RDF, MSD, etc. would be helpful to those with less heavy computational background.",
                "This course is really interesting and I am glad I've taken it. A great strength of this course is the professor. Prof. Batista is so indulged in the course that you will never get bored at all. The course is also flexible in the sense that the assessments are not constraints to the students, but rather an opportunity to learn new concepts and acquire vital skills. One minor weakness of the course is the absence of the bigger picture in many instances during the semester. Having a general sense of where does the current material/content falls and links to other parts of the course/topic is vital to the general understanding. I appreciated the last class when the professor summed up all that we learned in class and tailored a nice story on how everything links.",
                "The lectures given by Prof. Batista is extremely good. The homework, midterm exam and the computational projects are very helpful. It would be better if we could get more feedback from the assignments."
