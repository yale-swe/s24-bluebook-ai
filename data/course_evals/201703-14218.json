All of the readings were extremely interesting. This is a wonderful seminar to take, and the final paper (20 pages) is very, very manageable since it's paced out carefully.",

    "It was extremely well organized - every reading and every theme pushed our class to think about surveillance and engineering methods for the body.",
    "Strengths: excellent class all-around.\r\nWeaknesses: almost none? there probably are, but I can't think of any right now.",
    "The selection of topics was extremely interesting! I really liked how the themes began to link together towards the second half of the semester. I think the discussion questions was very constructive and tracking the major shifts in the construction of the body at the end of each week was also very useful.",
    "The subject matter of this course was really interesting! Our class discussions of the readings were all relevant and allowed me to see the material from a variety of different perspectives, which I enjoyed. I did however find that discussion lagged, so maybe if we had some discussion questions to frame our discussion around, discussion would flow more smoothly."
