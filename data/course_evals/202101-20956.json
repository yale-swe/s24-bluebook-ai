                "Learned about the landscape of education law, how to read cases and gather the necessary facts",
                "I learned a lot of legal concepts such as strict scrutiny and rational review. I gained a lot of knowledge on the different areas of education law and the important cases within each area. As someone set on going to law school and practicing as an attorney in education law in the future, I feel like this class was immensely helpful at developing the stamina to read through sometimes dense legal cases and extract the valuable information from them, a skill I had previously lacked. In fact, prior to taking this class, I was quite intimidated by the law, but I feel a lot more comfortable making my way through legal texts now.",
                "I learned how to read legal cases and think through problems and apply the law to them.",
                "Learned a lot about legal decision making, and how the Constituion impacts court rulings in the educational sector.",
                "I learned so much about education law -- an area I knew very little about at the outset.",
                "This is a great introductory law course for undergraduates. You'll learn what to read for in the cases, and the readings are very accessible to people who are not literate in legalese. The papers are all super open-ended. You can solve fake cases and apply the precedent, or you can reflect on a case that you think should have been approached differently. A really phenomenal course.",
                "Learned about a wide variety of Ed Law topics from school desegregation to free speech rights. Learned how to read and draw from cases.",
                "Broadly, I learned the fundamentals of how to read cases, how to understand constitutional arguments, and the dynamics of the Supreme Court. Of course, I also learned a ton of caselaw related to education and young people.",
                "This course taught me a lot about the law, how to read and interpret court cases, and landmark cases related to education and how education law has been interpreted over time. This course was really foundational for me in understanding the role of the law in something more familiar to me as education and schooling. A lot of the material was new to me at first, but this course then gave me a new lens by which to think about education-related issues."

                "There was too much lecturing form the prof in the course but readings were good. Prof is really great though just wish there was more chances for students to engage with material.",
                "Strengths are Judge Garfinkel! He is a fantastic, kind, accessible Professor who deeply cares about his students as individuals and genuinely wants for them to have the best experience possible in his course.",
                "Very good course!",
                "Strengths: Judge Garfinkel is wonderful - so kind and knowledgeable; readings and subject matter are super interesting. We read some really pivotal cases in the educational law field in so many fascinating subject areas - school funding disability rights, gender equality and trans rights, religion in schools, etc.",
                "Strengths: the content and its organization. The course was very well-organized and what we would be covering was always clear.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the assigned reading did feel a bit overwhelming at times. It also felts like more student-to-student engagement could have been implemented to make the course more engaging. A lot of the discussion in the seminar was just Professor Garfinkel asking the class a question and someone volunteering to answer and then moving on. I think in the future maybe posing an interesting question to the class and having students discuss with each other and then share out to the group would potentially be more interesting and allow us to get the perspective of multiple students/",
                "Strengths are that you learn about interesting education law and Professor Garfinkel is very kind and you can tell he loves what he does. Some weaknesses are there was a lot of reading and I wish there was more student discussion rather. I also wish we were taught how to write legal essays.",
                "I think the cases we read were very interesting, and I learned a lot. \r\n\r\nCourse could be improved by allowing more chances to discuss the implications of the cases on social structures or inequality rather than only being rooted in the case and the law.",
                "The casebook readings are amazing, and Garfinkel is an expert and great instructor.",
                "I really loved this course -- definitely one of my favorites I have taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths: Judge Garfinkel is an absolute gem. It was a real shame we didn't get to meet in person. But he really lit up the \"room\" with his jokes, stories from the bench, and reflections on the cases. There's no right or wrong in the class - just different ways to apply the readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor Garfinkel is the best. Super kind and approachable and very considerate of his students (he cut our paper load from 25 to 20 after the semester we've had which was much appreciated). He tends to lecture in this course more than seminar lead which is thankfully fine because he's an excellent lecturer. I loved the paper requirement -- we ended up having to write 20 pages about anything over the span of the semester. I highly recommend writing about the problems in the book. They're kind of fun (you feel like a lawyer) and you can get the paper requirement done in doing 4 of them. Grading in the course was also thankfully quite lenient which I appreciated. He was also good about giving feedback on papers. The material in this class was genuinely super interesting. I loved that each class was a new and interesting topic. There were definitely some weeks I enjoyed more than others but I think that's the nature of education law. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture style isn't the most engaging. I wish there were more opportunities for student input and participation. No matter how good a lecturer Professor Garfinkel is, 2 hours is a long time to stay engaged. On a similar note, I never really got to know my peers in the class which was kinda sad. They all had a similar passion for education and it would have been interesting getting to know them better in that part. Another weakness I would say is Zoom. This class would definitely be better in person. I think it's especially hard to listen to a lecture via zoom especially when there are no powerpoint slides or anything. It is hard to stay engaged. Lastly, the reading load was quite heavy in this class so be prepared for that. If you want to make it through all the cases and supplementary material you need to start early.",
                "I see no room for improvement-- this class is perfect",
                "great prof",
                "Strengths: Professor Garfinkel!! He is incredibly supportive, smart, and brings his expertise as a judge to the table. He taught us a lot but was also open to new ideas and learning from us, so class felt more like an exchange of ideas which I appreciated. Another strength is the papers -- we had to write 20 pages by the end of the semester but weren't given any due dates beyond the first paper. Though this meant we had to be more aware of our time management, it gave us more flexibility with our schedules which I thought was a strength. Guest speakers were also a strength -- it was really cool to learn from people actually doing this work currently. \r\nWeaknesses: the readings were really long. It was sometimes hard to decipher what was most important from the cases and there was often a lot to read in one week. Maybe having some guiding pointers for the readings or what to pay most attention to in the cases would be helpful. Also, sometimes class felt a bit disorganized and hard to follow but there was just a lot of material and it could be overwhelming at times.",
                "Lots of reading hard to get through all of it sometimes but definitely manageable if you don't procrastinate! Really appreciate the flexibility in assignments that you can divide depending on how hard the rest of your semester is/what topics you're interested in"

                "I really enjoyed this course! I felt like I always left class having learned something new, and Professor Garfinkel was very willing to meet with students outside of class to discuss the course. The way the course is designedwhere students hand in a series of short papers on topics of their choiceworked really well for me. I was able to submit work on the issues that I was most interested around my schedule. I would highly recommend the class!",
                "Yes! This is a terrific course. Judge Garfinkel is a professor who every Yale student would be lucky to learn from and the material we covered was so interesting and topical. Education Law is unique from other law-related classes I've taken in that though it focuses on a specific area of the law like other courses, education law as a practice touches on a wide range of topics such as wealth disparity, racial and gender discrimination, LGBTQ rights, disability discrimination, privacy rights of children, due process, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc.",
                "YES! take this class!",
                "YES! Judge Garfinkel is encouraging and kind; really accessible and eager to help his students. He was super understanding about the difficulties of doing virtual class for the third semester. An overall wonderful class with fascinating readings and flexible workload. I rarely say this but would honestly take this class again and feel like I would still get a lot out of it and still really enjoy it.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in law school (and strong yes if you have an interest in education and the law!). I think the course exposes you to legal text and theory in an approachable way. Even if the course isn't always as engaging as it could be because of little student-to-student discussion, Garfinkel is very knowledgable and a great guide for your first foray into legal stuff.",
                "Yes if you're interested in education law/ law school.",
                "Yes if you are interested in learning about education law. If you are hoping to discuss social inequalities or the implications of the law, you should not take this course.",
                "Yes. Even if you're remotely interested in public education, I highly recommend taking this class.",
                "Definitely! It even made me think about edlaw as a career.",
                "1000%. This was my favorite course of the semester. The cases are so interesting and the syllabus is set up so that each week builds on the next. Judge Garfinkel is one of the kindest people at Yale. You can meet with him whenever, and our meetings always went over the allotted time slot. I'm so glad he teaches undergrads!",
                "Yes I would -- not a life changing course but solid! Professor Garfinkel is amazing. He is super kind and approachable and a pretty engaging lecturer. He's also always available for students and is not afraid to bring in his own life experiences into the class. He even leveraged his connections to bring in some speakers. The workload in this class was super manageable -- we ended up needing to write 20 pages over the semester on anything we wanted. For people who take this class in the future, write papers on the book problems. They are kinda fun and you can easily reach 5 pages each. With just 4 of them, you'll have met the page requirement. Grading is also very generous and fair!\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this class was not the most engaging in the world. A 2 hour lecture with no slides or notes can get tough to follow. Professor Garfinkel is interesting but can tend to get all over the place during lecture. Student engagement also seemed low. There were a couple of people who regularly participated in class, and no one else truthfully did which was sad.\r\n\r\nOverall would definitely take, but you should have a serious interest in Education Law o/w you might struggle with engagement and staying on top of the often lengthy readings.",
                "Take this class, especially if you're flirting with the idea of law school!!! Phenomenal course with one of the best professors I've had at Yale and it gives you a real taste for a law school style seminar. Professor Garfinkel gives you a ton of intellectual flexibility with your assignments so you have a real chance to more deeply explore the parts the material you're interested in. Can't recommend this class enough.",
                "you'll get as much as you put into it. great prof. great opportunity if you're interested in the material.",
                "Yes!! If you are interested in the law or maybe going to law school in the future or education-related controversies and topics, then I would recommend taking this course. You get to learn from someone who has first-hand experience as a judge which is also a really unique experience. Professor Garfinkel is invested in his students' learning and you will leave class having learned something. Even if you are unsure if you want to take this route in the future, this class is a great introduction to education and the law.",
