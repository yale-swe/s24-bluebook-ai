                "Way too much material to read and watch every week",
                "It was A LOT of work. I think it got a little burdensome and tedious simply because everything was online and we weren't really engaging live with the course material we had been assigned that week. Plus, the readings and lectures that were assigned hardly ever correlated with the topics of the weekly reading responses, so we ended up having to do double the readings.",
                "I really enjoyed this class! Even in this online format it was clear that Professor Lockhart cared a lot about us. She was always responsive and willing to engage with us. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I noticed was that the recorded lectures were a bit long sometimes and it wasn't clear what needed to be watched each week.",
                "I loved the weekly responses. It made me think through the details of specific cases. I also enjoyed the student presentations, which led the class through the pros and cons of specific topics. Finally, it was great that we were able to drop a few weekly responses in such a hectic time.",
                "The lectures were all very interesting and relevant, but they could have been more engaging if they were live. The weekly thought questions helped to keep me engaged with the content and also helped me to develop ideas for the final project. The presentations (given by students) were good but could have been a bit shorter to allow for more time for discussion afterward.",
                "The course required a reasonable amount of work, nothing more or less than I've experienced at Yale before. The overall topics we covered were very interesting and helped facilitate discussion and engagement, which made it much more enjoyable. There were also clear guidelines for all assignments which eliminated any uncertainty that may stem from this.",
                "The course itself covers fascinating topics. The readings were interesting, though sometimes lengthy, but I liked that some were optional. The recorded lectures were dry and too long. I often felt they could be more appropriate and PC. It bothered me when we were shown graphic videos of Black people being shot in one recorded lecture. I don't think that minority deaths should be an educational tool none of us need to be reminded with disturbing videos that racism exists (and if we do, then that's sad). Omitting these would've made the course better.",

                "I loved the course content but I would have liked to have lectures live instead of pre recorded",
                "Strengths are that you can watch the lectures on your own time and that your work load is very manageable. The subject matter is also super interesting. One weakness of the course is that sometimes it can be hard to know which readings and which lectures are meant to be done when (and the syllabus is little help as things didn't always align).",
                "Strengths: Prof Lockhart is very kind, responsive and detailed in her response to questions and feedback. The weekly TQs were an EXCELLENT way to encourage us to do the readings, watch the lectures and stay engaged in the course (although you could do pretty well on most TQs without doing most of the readings, because the lectures give a good summary). TQs helped to spread the workload across the semester and were graded fairly. Issues discussed were very interesting and the lectures did a good job synthesizing the material and presenting different perspectives. Well-organized!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Recorded lectures are quite long and many students didn't really watch them, instead just flipping through the slides. Live lectures or shorter lectures would be helpful. Presentations could also be abit boring when students droned on and on, which made the discussion sections less engaging and educational.",
                "Professor Lockhart is amazing and this class is so engaging.",
                "The canvas page was disorganized (so many readings posted that had never been assigned, confusing file organization, readings to be used for assignments but that had never been assigned).\r\nI thought that we could have used time better during synchronous meetings. Further, there were a lot of technical difficulties (multiple Zoom links sent out, professor issues with screen sharing, etc)"

Personally I like being able to go back and listen to any parts I may have missed or not understood completely.",

                "Maybe. I found the format of instruction frustrating. It was clear that my assignments were not read all the way through, because I got marked down for things that I had actually included. The thought questions are designed to get you to cite specific studies and regurgitate information from the recorded lectures and readings. The discussion board was also a bit of an echo-chamber, and didn't work well to actually get collaborative engagement from students. Students' presentations were often interrupted by the professor and the format was essentially just another student-led non-interactive lecture.\r\n\r\nThe content of the course is really interesting, so if you are particularly excited about it, it may be worth taking the course anyways."
