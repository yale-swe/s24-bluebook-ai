                "The course allowed me to spend a lot of time developing research skills and pursuing a certain research project. Often the assignments were not clearly discussed besides what was given in the syllabus, which made it difficult to know what the professors expected from me. I wish they had given us more information about expectations further in advance. I also think that the course professors should have \"shown up\" a little bit more for presentations and feedback because I often turned in work just to have it be left in the \"void\", with no comments or feedback. For example, the poster session required a lot of work but I had no visitors come, which was disappointing and felt disrespectful of the students' time.",
                "20 hours is a lot, but you can get a lot done in the lab. COVID kinda screwed that over and it can be a lot esp during your senior year. Not sure how it could be improved. Strengths is that if you dedicate the time, you will see the results.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are the way they evaluate you. Seems like a lot of unnecessary things that they ask you to do, but ig that's life.",
                "It's very dependent on your own lab environment, which could be good or bad. For me I had a very supportive mentor network in my lab, so getting credit to spend time I would have already spent in the lab was a plus. Otherwise, the instructors were more hands-off, which was helpful at the start of the semester, but a little more guidance toward the end of the semester (with clearer instructions) would have been helpful.",
                "This course was quite self-directed, which enabled me to pursue my research in the way I saw best by coordinating more closely with my lab mentors and thesis advisor."

I would say that the course organizers did a pretty poor job of explaining what assignments and presentations would look like in the remote setting. The course organizers also seemed pretty disengaged and barely gave any feedback after giving us a first semester presentation grade, which seemed arbitrary.",

I felt that since it was quite typical to spend this amount of time in lab, the 20 hour-a-week requirement would likely be met regardless of my BS-intesnvie status. Given the length of this research project, the longer requirements for the final paper actually made things easier not harder."
