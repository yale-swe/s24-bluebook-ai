                "Strengths: Emphasis placed on comparing authors, lectures, discussion. Weaknesses: The readings are often immensely long and it would be useful if we could be told the pages to focus on the week before. In addition, I found the bulk of Roman history to be very detailed and hence tiresome - it may have been better to read more direct political theory during that time.",
                "Strengths: quality of discussion, course structure, I really appreciated to focus on key passages and ideas that made the text easier to digest.\r\nWeaknesses: would like to see more diversity of readings in DS courses as a whole",
                "This course is designed excellently. Prof. Renaud consistently connects modern theories or occurrences to ancient books, and he adds new relevance to these thousand-year old texts.",
                "The strengths of the class are that the reading itself does a great amount of the teaching, however Professor Renaud expands upon the teaching greatly in the class discussions. His insight helps to solidify the lessons learned in the books and contextualize what we were reading. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness was at times it would seem that Professor Renaud was expecting students to talk, but no one would. This was likely an awkward byproduct of zoom disconnect, and did not impact my enjoyment of the class whatsoever.",
                "Strengths\r\n-Very interesting selection of readings from the classics in history and political thought\r\n-Engaging and directed seminar sections where you can deepen textual understanding and draw connections as a group with the guidance of Prof. Renaud, who keeps the conversation on track while also offering textual insights\r\n-The papers! Despite the quick turnaround, the paper assignments are a really fun and challenging way to form your own take of the primary readings and\/or synthesize multiple perspectives.\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-Some overlapping with DS Philosophy; some readings (Maimonides, Augustine, etc) feel more like philosophy material than H&P reading\r\n-Overall, H&P occupies a less defined role in the DS curriculum; I certainly think there should be a place for history and political theories, but it can be unclear sometimes (e.g. when reading tends towards philosophy material) what the goal of H&P is\r\n-While all the lectures have been very insightful, some offer too much contextual detail without reinforcing textual understanding (especially when the text at hand is difficult to comprehend in the first place)",
                "Strengths: the readings were engaging and interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class discussion was often not so productive and I did not always feel like I got so much out of seminar",
                "This course encouraged students to critically examine the role of each text in relation to both Western history and modern society. It also allowed students to identify the similarities between the ideologies of every text, all the while considering the perspectives of fellow classmates, other authors, and additional texts from the other DS classes. However, at times, it seemed as if only a handful of individuals in the class were willing to contribute to the discussion, so smaller-group conversations could have facilitated the participation of all members in the class."

                "Breakout rooms were well utilized",
                "One element implemented by the Professor was havi by student-led short presentations at the beginning of each class, to give a brief overview of both the reading and what should be discussed during the seminar. While this isnt necessarily Covid-specific, it was very helpful for getting us involved and to get the discussion going.",
                "The seminars on zoom were very productive in my opinion.  I really enjoyed the use of breakout rooms to discuss passages and questions in small groups.",
                "Prof. Renaud conducts Zoom seminars very well: we have a flow of handraising and commentary that grew to feel very natural.",
                "I think this class was perfect for covid times. I was able to engage with my classmates and felt connected with them. Professor Renaud was very understanding and flexible.",
                "Strengths\r\n-Zoom seminars were well-organized, and Professor Renaud often utilized break-out rooms to their advantage\r\n-Professor Renaud organized a variety of activities (student presentations, debates, break-out rooms, group question discussions, Professor Renaud even sometimes produced his own illustrations of the texts!) that were rigorous and challenging and at the same time engaging and fun. These were really amazing in general especially in the context of zoom fatigue and the monotony of sitting in front of a computer all day. Professor Renaud's H&P sections were probably the most engaging DS sections I have had this semester! In my opinion, these kinds of activities should be more widely used across DS sections of all strands (regardless of in-person or virtual environments, but especially in virtual environments).\r\nWeaknesses \r\n-The umbrella lectures for DS in general could be more interactive",
                "Engaging course practices included student presentations, creating a discussion queue with the \"Raise Hand\" function on Zoom, and receiving additional virtual documents to supplement the primary texts. The breakout rooms were a stimulating way to delve deeper into the main discussions, but could have been utilized more often in order to allow the students to develop a narrower focus in smaller groups."

                "Yes! Despite the challenges we faced with COVID, our DS cohort was very united and one through which I met many incredible people.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to early historical thought and is very accessible to those who haven't engaged with these texts before.  Prof. Renaud's insights and ability to facilitate lively discussion was great.",
                "Yes. You can learn how society functions (or malfunctions) because a couple of ancients said how we'd behave in the state of nature. How history repeats itself as tragedy and farce.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to someone. Professor Renaud was a wonderful instructor who was clearly very passionate and knowledgeable. His presence in the classroom helped to facilitate an excellent learning environment.",
                "Absolutely. I would recommend Directed Studies in general, but I would especially recommend Professor Renaud's H&P section. The kind of rigorous 5-page primary source analysis paper assignments across DS are a great, challenging experience in general, and Professor Renaud certainly takes it further (we had a combination of close reading prompts as well as prompts that ask you to synthesize multiple authors). In addition to the engaging activities Professor Renaud devises for section that deepen textual understanding, he also often brings in brief early-modern and modern sources that highlight the impact of the ideas of classical and medieval historians and political theorists. The course is certainly worth doing for the reading alone (reading historians like Herodotus and Livy is an irreplaceable experience), but Professor Renaud makes it infinitely better through his insights and guidance.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend the first semester of DS H+P if you want a good overview of ancient History and and political thought and are prepared to do a lot of reading and writing.",
                "I would highly recommend the course to another student as it greatly enhanced my critical thinking skills, which could be applied both inside and outside of the class. Each discussion was stimulating, and built upon those of previous sessions, yet was never repetitive or uninteresting. The class provides great opportunities to consider the extent to which modern political occurrences compare to past events, and also fosters great appreciation for intellectual, political, and social history."
