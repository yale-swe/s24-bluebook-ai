He could get off topic sometimes but loves to answer student's questions and welcomes ideas. He also is good with communication and willing to give feedback or clarify anything when needed. The material was very compelling, and you learn a lot about the reading network. Some of the research papers given were a little dense, but the more of them you read, the easier they get.",

                "Yes and no. Professor Pugh is super great and you can tell he is really passionate about his work. I really admire him for that. That being said, the class is pretty uninteresting at times, unless you're looking to go directly into this field. Professor Pugh goes on long tangents and most of his slides are pretty unhelpful. It's basically like he's just talking without slides. That being said again, you don't really need to know any of the information he is talking about in class to do well. So, even if you just sit in the class doing other things and not taking notes, you will do well if you complete the assignments well. All in all though, Professor Pugh is a great professor to know. He is kind and understanding. I would really only recommend this class to someone interested into going into the field.",
                "I would recommend the course to other students. There are a lot interesting topics covered in this course.",
                "Absolutely. It is intellectually challenging without being overwhelming, and it will forever change the way you view reading and the human mind.",
                "Yes! It's a pretty chill class with a great professor where you can learn a lot. It's nice to take a focused class like this where you really dive into the topic",
                "Yes, if youre really interested in the topic. You have to be pretty self motivated - keeping up with readings, choosing paper topics, and paying attention in class is really all on you, but if you want to, youll learn a lot."
