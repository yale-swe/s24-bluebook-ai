                "Professor Kamens has an incredible breadth of knowledge and passion for the Japanese poetic form; thanks to this, I learned a lot about how to read and appreciate the intricacies of Japanese poetry. Topics include rhetorical devices such as makurakotoba, kakekotoba, yuugen, and much more.",
                "I learned about the history and fundamentals so f Japanese poetry.",
                "I did not know much about poetry and I knew very little about Japanese Poetry and Poetics prior to taking this class. I felt that I learned so much throughout this course that I would never otherwise have learned. Other than the specifics of Japanese poetry and Japanese history, I feel I was also able tp improve my writing skills, particularly literary analysis.",
                "I learned about Japanese poetry from about 600-1300 (and spent a little bit of time in years past that). Also developed some skills in looking at visual media. Thought about poetry as a larger medium and what makes things poetry as well which was interesting.",
                "I learned a great deal about how to shape my arguments with convincing word choice, which will be incredibly useful in future classes. More particularly, I really enjoyed learning about the inter connectivity of the Japanese poetic canon.",
                "I learned how to carefully analyze Japanese poetry and the uniqueness of Japanese poetry compared to other forms of writing.",
                "I learned how to read and analyze Japanese poetry. I also learned a little bit of the Japanese language.",
                "This course was a beautiful and moving introduction to the history of Japanese poetics, from the ancients to the early modern.",

                "I learned about different types of Japanese poetry and the different devices they used. I also learned about different ways to analyze these poems. We discussed the historical context of many of these poems and also touched on how these poems related to and were created in response to different issues in Japan, such as women's role in Buddhism or the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",

                "The poems felt too repetitive; maybe three lectures would have been enough. The end of the semester felt so fresh, though!",
                "Strengths: very interesting material and readings, great selection for syllabus, good level of student engagement\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were a bit too long (I would have preferred two hours a week with maybe additional discussion section)",
                "Prof is really knowledgeable but classes were not very engaging. I was expecting more rigorous close reading and discussion of the poems but the class ended up being very lecture based.",
                "It was often difficult to pinpoint exactly what was expected on each essay, since the prompts were often very loosely guided, and no examples of what might be a stellar essay were presented in class.",
                "I really enjoyed this course, the only note I may have is that sometimes I felt the historical context to poems was presented in a way that was less engaging than how vibrant and exciting the material was. I really enjoyed when there were engaging backstories and such that were not just emperors and dates. I would suggest giving the history a bit more excitement! Regardless, I really enjoyed this class.",
                "Overall, a lot of the bigger questions about poetry and getting to examine the elements of Japanese poetry was very interesting. However, the lectures were slightly boring at times which made it harder to be focused and learn sometimes.",
                "I think having two graders grading separate papers made it confusing and hard to apply comments as sometimes, I would get opposing comments on the same paper.",
                "The strengths were the selection of fascinating poems and Professor Kamens whose passion for the subject never ceased to inspire me.",
                "The course is well organized, but I dont think its organization is clarified enough. Sometimes I was lost as to what we were doing in class. Some readings had an overwhelming amount of information and it was hard to tell what was useful or not at first.",
                "more feedback on improving papers",
                "A strength was Prof. Kamens' extensive knowledge of the topics we discussed, we even got to read some of his work as part of the class. He had an obvious passion for the poetry we discussed which made the class more engaging.",
                "I felt that the lectures were fairly boring and not very engaging; however, that may be due to my lack of interest in poetry compared to the course itself.",
                "The strength of this course was definitely Professor Kamens and his love for Japanese poetry. I felt it with every lecture he gave. The poetry he presented was also extremely interesting, especially when paired with literary critique. I think this course was great because it provided a taste of many of the context in which Japanese poetry can be found."

For me, I resonated with his sense of humor but I can very easily imagine people who would not. The class itself has quite interesting material if you are interested in Japanese poetry and culture more broadly.",
                "Yes because it is an interesting topic and the teacher is passionate.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially if you enjoy history and poetry! It was lots of fun and you can pick your level of engagement. I learned a lot!",
                "I think if they are interested in Japanese poetry or poetry as a larger whole, this class has a lot of valuable parts to it and provides a very good overview of pre-modern Japanese poetry. However, the class can be somewhat boring which should be taken into account.",
                "I would highly recommend this class as the lectures were all informative and interesting.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it allows you to delve into a subject one would otherwise be unable to explore. It is very interesting and not only allows you to learn a bit about Japanese culture, but also lets you work on your close reading skills.",
                "If youre genuinely interested in poetry or Japanese or both, I would recommend it. But if you just want this as a guts and have zero interest, I do not. Itll be a long semester.",
                "Yes! Japanese poetry has very deep roots, this course exposes them in a fascinating and elegant manner.",
                "I think this class is a great class to take if you're interested in Japanese poetry! The lectures were sometimes not the most engaging, but the material we covered was interesting. I personally was not the biggest fan of some of the poetry we read in the class (I though a lot of it was pretty repetitive), but there were definitely some really cool poems we looked at, especially once we started studying more modern poetry. The class was also organized well and I enjoyed it overall. We also took a trip to visit the Beinecke and the YUAG to look at some Japanese poetry and art and I thought that was the highlight of the class. However, if you're not already interested in Japanese poetry and are just looking for an easy writing credit, you will probably be bored in the class.",
                "If you are interested in Japanese poetry  or poetry in general then you should definitely consider the course we covered some famous works such as the Tale of Genji which stood out to me in particular.",
                "It is a fairly easy writing credit so if you need it then yes, and if you are interested in the material then I bet it would be a very interesting and eye-opening course.",
                "I know this was the last time this course will be offered but I would definitely recommend it, as it was genuinely interesting and opened my eyes to poetry more that I anticipated.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, even if they are completely unfamiliar with poetry. The interpretation of Japanese poetry and the way in which poems are connected through time and space is incredibly interesting."
