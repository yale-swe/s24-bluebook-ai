It is just unfortunate that we have in class tests that are closed notes when in real life we will never have to translate hieroglyphics without having access to resources like our notes. It also really sucks to have it at 9 am in the morning because that is too early for me to really function and pay attention to something as complicated as hieroglyphics."
