                "I felt disappointed by the lack of promptness on the part of the TAs in answering student questions on Ed Discussion. Many times it would take two or more days to get a question answered about homework, and I personally asked a question about an assignment that wasn't answered until an hour or two before the deadline.",
                "Strengths: this is one of the best-structured courses I've taken. The video lessons being uploaded on the site were so helpful because I could go back and watch them until I understood the content. This, paired with the office hours that I could go to if I had questions, was very effective in allowing me to learn.\r\n\r\nImprovements: It would be great if there were more office hours (just so that I have a chance to ask all my questions, which I sometimes can't do if there are too many people in the office hour).",
                "Strengths: JDRS does a great job with his video lectures, the course is asynchronous, abundance of office hours - plenty of opportunities to receive help. Weaknesses: TFs make many mistakes when grading the homeworks, TFs don't always respond soon enough to questions on Ed, I wish JDRS was more clear on what the final grading will look like in this class, grade cutoffs for final letter grades appear to be quite high because students tend to perform very well on all of the assignments, grading is very meticulous, TFs will take off many points for minor mistakes made on the homework assignments that can easily impact your grade",
                "I thought the structure of the course was very good, it was very easy to follow along and learn. The pace was good too.",
                "It is very well tailored and thought out, there isn't much that could be done better.",
                "JDRS is amazing! The material is interesting, and I liked the psets. One downside is that the curve can be a bit harsh (many people receive 100s on psets).",
                "Strength was the professor and the TAs, always available to answer questions and help out. Weakness was all the homeworks.",
                "The course video lectures were very engaging and led into the homeworks well. Maybe providing answer keys to the homework after they are graded to clearly show what students missed.",
                "The course is very well organized and easy to follow along with the psets\/lectures. Sometimes, I felt like I was losing points for silly mistakes on homework and exams, so I wish I had a clearer guide for what exactly is expected on homework problems where we are told to explain\/analyze the results.",
