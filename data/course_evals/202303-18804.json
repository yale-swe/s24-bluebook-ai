                "This course is designed so that students learn a broad span of material and can create connections between units easily, which is something that not all classes at Yale can say for themselves. It does assume a bit of proof writing knowledge than is implied in the syllabus, which makes the first couple weeks of class especially challenging. However, once you can get the hang of writing proofs, the rest comes easily.",
                "Posets were not really used in the course after we started graph theory, it kinda felt all over the place.",
                "Abi is a great and funny teacher, who explained concepts clearly, answered questions well, and provided great feedback. I also thought that the problem sets and exams were challenging but a fair reflection of the course content.",
                "the grading is way too hard",
                "This is an excellent course! There is a high probability you will immediately see its relevance to other courses - I found myself seeing parallels in my CS and Stats classes while taking it, which was fun! The class is well structured.",
                "Very interesting topics, Abi is a brilliant instructor, just wish he could've taught less out of the book. He seems so insightful but the lectures were completely based off of the book, remarks and all.",
                "This course was well organized. I feel like we could have spent a little less time on posets and more time on graph theory.",
                "Less time spent on the lecture warmups and more on the actual material",
                "Many people taking this course already know quite a lot of Maths and Discrete Maths; they are familiar with the material, which created a very unequal distribution of grades for the midterms, with many people scoring a 100 while many others getting below 50 and dropping the course. This also created a false sense that the pace at which the professor might choose to proceed accommodated the students' needs. I felt very unsupported throughout the course. We did not go over proofs at all, which is integral to discrete maths since one is expected to prove everything. Although the lectures were okay, the supplemental materials we received were very insufficient -- they were almost non-existent, to begin with (we only had the psets and a set of practice questions for each midterm, none of which had answer keys...). This was a very unsatisfactory course for me overall, and I would not recommend it, at least not with Abinand Gopal.",
                "Introductory course to discrete math. Sat in on this course during Bulldog Days and it seemed far more advanced than what we covered this semester. Very much wish we had gotten further into graph theory instead of spending so much time on relations. Class could definitely have included more interesting topics.",
                "There was a lot less content on graph theory than I expected.",
                "The material was presented clearly and covered well. It seemed to me like proofs were covered very quickly, which might be difficult if you haven't taken other proof-based courses.",
                "This course was fascinating and very engaging.  The homework was relevant and the lectures were very well done.\r\n\r\nHowever, this course is a little slow and rarely challenging.  The truly interesting questions required creative \"aha!\" moments, rather than thoughtful application of the course material.  In the future, it might be better to have two versions of this class  one for CS majors (as it's required for the major), and one for math majors interested in the topic.  As a math major, I often found the material to be trivial and the pacing too slow.",
                "The lectures followed the textbook pretty well. However, the professor never posted lecture notes or recordings, which could have come in handy during review.",
                "Strengths: Abi! Warm-ups, PSETS, little jokes throughout lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing really.",
                "In terms of the course structure itself, I think the topics covered had a decent order and I found the material relatively interesting.  A lot of the issues I had with this course stemmed from how poorly it was managed.  Problem sets took insane amounts of time to be graded, often with almost no meaningful feedback.  Moreover, there were absolutely no sample solutions released for anything in the entire class, including exam review.  I found myself doing near perfect on problem sets only to walk into the exam and be woefully unprepared because I had gotten no feedback to indicate I was doing anything wrong.  The majority of the math classes I've had at Yale at least gave good feedback when it came, often with sample solutions, but without that fundamental feedback it felt very difficult to succeed in this course.  I simply don't understand why giving us examples of problem sets or exam practice questions was deemed impossible.  The worst feedback for certain was on exams; the professor often just said a question was wrong without elaborating why, which is especially bad when the midterms were all three questions split into parts.  But with all that being said, a lot of that does probably have to do with the professor and how the course is managed by said professor; the material itself is I think pretty interesting and the textbook we followed was decent.  If more consistent feedback was given, I think this could be a much much better course.",
                "This was a good introduction to discrete mathematics for students like me with proof-based math experience. I do think that the class may not have been as accessible to students with less proof experience as it could've been.",
                "This course was by far my favorite course this semester. It was engaging in the lectures, the psets were interesting and difficult but not overwhelming, and I felt the professor really cared about all the students. There's nothing I would change, and I have loudly recommended this class to as many people as I can."

                "I think if you can get around it for any requirements, maybe by taking a more difficult discrete math course, I would totally do that since 244 didn't go very in depth or feel that related to other Math or possible CS majors.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It's probably required for you, but the class content is interesting and improves your proof-writing skills.",
                "yes if you want to learn discrete",
                "Yes, especially if you can take with Abi, who was great. Its not too difficult, but probably should not be your first proof based math class, as the homework is pure proofs and there is little to no instruction on proof methods beyond just watching proofs get done in class. Cool topics and very obviously applicable to many other fields",
                "Yes, if you want to get more practice with proofs and get an intro to discrete math, (it depends on the instructor but sometimes this is a great class to do proofs for the first time, but it was not this semester).",

                "I think this is a good course for anyone to solidify their knowledge of combinatorics.",
                "Great for early cs/stats/math majors. Would definitely recommend some familiarity with proofs and induction",
                "This course was the first math class I took at Yale, which probably wasn't the best idea. I learned a lot, but I also struggled a lot. Just take CPSC 202 if you're taking this to count toward your CS major.",
                "Fine class. Interesting and potentially difficult when the material is new. I think other professors have taught this course more efficiently and made it more interesting.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course. Discrete math is a fun topic and it is refreshingly different than other topics in math.",
                "The course is super interesting, but it's not for you if you're a math major looking for a challenging class.  I took this course as a math major looking for an easy 5th credit and this class was perfect.  However, I know many CS majors found this class quite difficult, so be prepared for tough problem sets and lots of office hours if you're a CS major.",
                "It is a good introductory course to the covered fields in math, as lots of applications are related. I'm not sure I learned a lot of broad skills though, moreso just memorizing definitions.",
                "Incredibly fun and interesting class with professor who really is willing to help at office hours, going many times beyond the stated end time.",
                "Yes! Super super fun area of maths. I honestly loved going to lecture for this class, it was generally a blast. Graph theory gets a little more boring with all the definitions, but it picks back up! All of the combinatorics/relations part is awesome.",
                "For CS majors who love math or math majors who are in the mood for some fun more applied and tangible math, absolutely!",
                "This is a difficult question because I had a truly negative experience with this class and could absolutely not recommend it in its current state.  That being said, most of my problems have not that much to do with the content but with course management, so if the professor has good reviews I would probably recommend this class.  That being said, if you're thinking about taking this as a computer science major, unless you have a math background AND really want to get the material from a math POV, I would probably recommend CPSC 202 over this class.  That being said, again, I'd recommend this to math students if they're interested in the material and the professor has good reviews.  Otherwise, I would be very very wary of taking this course in any capacity.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend it as an introduction to discrete math, especially if you already have experience with proofs-based math. Discrete math is very fun and interesting math, and I enjoyed the subject more than any other math courses I've taken at Yale. Abi can be tough and not necessarily outwardly friendly, but I think his instruction and grading was fair. The class may not be super accessible if you don't have proof experience.",
