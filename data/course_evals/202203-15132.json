I have learned a lot about the Theory of Deep Learning, how to analyze papers, and how to proofread them. As a good chance, you will attend some science events organized by other institutions, such as Quantum Computing, and can learn a lot about other exciting topics."

Most of our conversations were geared towards how to make a career in science, which is great if that is your life plan.",

If you are not planning to do research or study a STEM field, do NOT take this course. That being said, this course really isn't that much work and it is very helpful if you are a STEM student! It made me rethink my life choices every single week. Plus, Head Charles is wonderful.",

This course has helped me build the foundations required to conduct research at the undergraduate level, teaching me how to read and understand research papers effectively, write with concision, and communicate results effectively.",

                "Yes. I deeply enjoyed this course and felt that I learned a lot. This course will help me in the future.",

                "Yes, for anyone looking into research in general or research at Yale, this is a great course.",
                "Absolutely! Bailyn is a great professor and he has really thought about how to make this a good class for non-science majors, and it shows! This class is not a gut, but it's not very difficult either. As someone who kinda dreaded having to take science credits when I have so many humanities classes that I would rather spend my time and money on, Professor Bailyn made the distributional requirement worth my time. Very appreciated"
