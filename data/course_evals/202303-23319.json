This was then applied to extremely relevant ethical questions when discussing modern museum displays such as the Cushing Center. Skills developed include engagement with a lot of primary source material from the medical historical library and Cushing Center (so fascinating!) as well as other interesting primary and secondary texts."

Dr. Licskai was an effective discussion moderator and kept us on topic while integrating information from our readings. Additionally, her assignments felt relevant and she provided clear feedback.",
                "Strengths: the readings were very well put together, I liked our visits to the medical historical library, professor Licskai is super supportive, engaged, and communicative\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions felt very low energy (I think this may have just been specific to the people in the class), sometimes discussions could get very hypothetical",
                "Strengths included the course readings and the class discussions. One way it could be improved would be through more specific assignments that are less open-ended.",
                "Strengths: Every discussion is opened with a very low stakes roundtable where each member of the section has an opportunity to share their thoughts and/or emotional responses to the reading. Reactions here were varied across the many readings for each week which was an interesting sample of what caught people's eyes and also helped guide discussions. Small groups also helped facilitate everyone having an opportunity to work through their opinions about difficult topics. Professor Licskai is passionate about the questions she is asking and wants everyone to engage with the material in a meaningful way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, I felt like there was a lot of planning for the time period that we didn't get to. Sometimes this was good because everyone was wrapped up in the discussions we were having, but sometimes going through the slides after class I wish there were other activities that we had a chance to discuss. This, of course, all only speaks to Professor Licskai's dedication to her courses, her readings, and her students."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Licskai is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. She is kind and supportive as well as extremely talented in providing feedback. Her comments never fail to empower me and make me feel confident in my writing abilities while still highlighting areas of improvement and ways in which I can develop my writing style, sense, and content. In this class, I learned a ton about forming historical arguments and analyzing sources to support these arguments. I thought that the assignments were all clear in their expectations and once again the feedback we received on them was super helpful to actually growing as a writer and historian.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this class for students interested in history of science and medical ethics.",
                "Absolutely! This was one of the best HSHM classes I have taken here at Yale. It took a lot of relevant themes from other HSHM classes and contextualized them in human specimen display which feels very personal and crucially important to understand its history."
