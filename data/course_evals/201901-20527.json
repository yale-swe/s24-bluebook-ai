    "I absolutely recommend this course  as a non-visual artist, there was a lot for me to learn about drawing, and Rob made it enjoyable and comfortable. You'll learn concrete skills that'll make you a much better drawer, and you'll also gain a lot of confidence.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning to draw and learning about art from a very knowledgeable professor. If you are taking this class hoping to learn drawing in a traditional way, this might not be the right class for you. We did not get any formal instruction in how to draw depth or proportions, for example, and I would have appreciated a little guidance in that. However, Professor Storr made a compelling case for why that's not the best way to learn how to draw. The class is pretty laid-back and not a lot of work, just make sure to keep up with your daily sketchbook.",
    "Basic Drawing was so enjoyable that it didn't even feel like a class. It was a joy to attend twice a week.",
    "Yes its super fun and not that much work",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants a chill class. Its not that much work. Even though youre in class a lot, its pretty therapeutic and fun. Also a good way to get a humanities credit.",
    "Take it with Rob",
    "Absolutely! It is an easy workload and very interesting. Im not an art major and I really appreciated the class.",
    "Yes. Rob Store is what makes this class amazing - he is fascinating and changed my perspective on drawing slightly every class",
    "Definitely- great for learning about myself, setting aside time to draw, and learning a new skill!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has any interest in art.",
    "100\/100 recommend!"
