                "This class was a great way to practice German in a casual setting.

I learned a lot about historical developments in the German language, as well as the basics of German dialect politics today. Over the course of the semester, my German listening comprehension also improved greatly.",

                "The main strength of the course is Professor Schenker. She is the most animated professor I have ever had at Yale, and she makes class feel so fun, even when we're learning about obscure topics, like Middle German literature. She went above and beyond to adapt the course for the Zoom format, and there are plenty of activities to break up the schedule. The material of the course is also a huge strength -- everything is just really interesting to learn about. The only weakness of the course was the senior citizen interviews. They were difficult to schedule (especially on the weekends), and they didn't really give me much insight into the German language because most of the senior citizens weren't that interested in talking about dialects or German itself. The only other weakness of the course is that I would have liked a bit more feedback on our reading reflections; it would have been nice to get corrections every once in a while (even if it wasn't graded) just to know how we can improve our written German.",
                "This is a wonderful course. The greatest strength is definitely Professor Schenker. She is an absolutely wonderful professor -- she is engaging, extremely knowledgeable and interesting, and very kind to and accommodating of her students. The class is also generally strong, the subject material, especially our unit on German dialects and varieties, was extremely entertaining and interesting, and the final project about dialects was equally enjoyable.",
                "The main strength for any course taught by Theresa Schenker is Theresa Schenker herself. She is clear, organized, effective, and also very understanding of extenuating circumstances. She clearly cares a lot about her students. Another strength of the course is that, especially toward the end, the content very much broadens your view of what German is and gives a better idea of what the language concretely looks like in day-to-day use than most German language courses I've taken. I also appreciated how the final project was very spaced outhaving it due in pieces rather than all at once made it feel much more approachable and lessened stress around finals season. As for weaknesses, the course felt quite lopsided in terms of which skills were practiced regularly. Although we had to write up short summaries of the readings, it felt like our reading and speaking skills (class participation + weekly video responses + the class presentation) were very much emphasized, and there weren't many opportunities to practice or get feedback on our writing, aside from on the final project. Additionally, the material can be quite hard to grasp toward the beginning of the course  the texts were very academic and it was really easy to get lost or to get nothing out of them after spending a lot of time on them. The readings got easier as the topic material changed, and Theresa started sending reading questions to help guide us, but before that happened, it was really frustrating to have to get through a bunch of readings about Old German and linguistics in the first couple weeks of the course.",
                "The organization/timeline of the final project I found was nice. Instead of having everything due at once, it spanned the course of several weeks. For students who struggle with organization (like myself), this was I think helpful.\r\n\r\nThe taking notes on class readings was a bit not my style, but the professor was nonetheless accommodating.",
                "Strengths - very interactive, and plenty of opportunities to speak German with native speakers. I loved that we did the senior chats and also worked with a German speaker for the final project. I also appreciated that we watched movies from different German-speaking countries, like Switzerland and Austria.",
                "Discussion seminar format works very well and is great for improving language skills. Readings were often a little too heavy and complex due to being in academic German"

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: exposure to a wide variety of topics, small class size, speaking practice, variety of assignments testing all four language skills (Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking). Weaknesses: readings for every class instead of by week, most classes are spent almost entirely in breakout rooms (perhaps breakout discussion groups in a non-virtual format, or things work differently), feedback for coursework is inconsistent (extensive for more trivial assignments and sparse for larger assignments into which far more student time was invested)",
                "Professor Schenker made the class perfect for the Zoom format! We relied on breakout rooms extensively for small-group discussion, and we often had incredibly fun virtual activities: escape rooms (via Google Forms), online crossword puzzles, Kahoot, Jeopardy. It really felt like a fun class because of the variety of activities each class, and I never came to class knowing what to expect. Additionally, the course Canvas page was incredibly organized, with all of the assignments posted weeks in advance, which was helpful for planning.",
                "This course was really well geared towards remote learning -- I was as engaged as I would have been in an in-person course. The classes were extremely well formulated to maximally engage students. Professor Schenker was always available by email and was very accommodating, which I very much appreciated.",
                "There were lots of breakout rooms. I think sometimes the way they were run could be a little disorienting or stressful (getting shuffled between rooms at the beginning of an exercise/the quick 15 second countdown before they closed), but overall I thought it was a good way to make the most of the Zoom format, get to know other people in the class, and to try to encourage more speaking outside of the big group discussion. I also enjoyed the virtual escape rooms that we did twice or three times, which also felt like a good use of the Zoom format.",

I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is not very confident in their German.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It is a very laidback way to continue learning German. The course requires work, but it is always very enjoyable, so it never feels like you are doing homework even when you are. Your German skills will improve greatly, and Professor Schenker makes class so fun! Definitely take it if you want to keep learning German. The subject material might seem pretty specific at the beginning if you're not a linguistics person, but don't let that dissuade you from taking the class. Even though the class focuses on the history of the German language, Professor Schenker teaches in a way that makes it accessible/interesting to students from any background, so even if you don't think you're interested in historical language studies, you will almost definitely enjoy the class anyways.",
                "Yes! This course is wonderful for any German student -- Professor Schenker is just wonderful and the class is extremely interesting. I would highly recommend!",
                "I would recommend it because Theresa teaches it and she is great, and I'd also recommend it if you're looking for a course that doesn't have a huge end-of-semester workload, since the assignments are more regular/spread out. Content-wise, it wasn't my favorite, but if you're interested in linguistics or history, then it would probably be interesting for you.",
                "I would recommend any course that Theresa Schenker teachesshes by far one of the be set teachers Ive had at Yale, and is also super understanding and kind to boot. But especially this course, which is in an area in which she is expert, is fantastic.",
