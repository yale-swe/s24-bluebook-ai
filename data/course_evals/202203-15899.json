Getting to have meaningful discussions on race with very insightful reading materials left me with a greater knowledge of race in America.\r\n\r\nI also left the class with a much better understanding of journalism and the way in which we as readers engage with readings.",
                "I learned how to engage in classroom discussions more effectively: being prepared to defend my positions when differing opinions or conclusions that are counter to my own are presented. I learned how to do a close reading by listening to the conclusions of other students and the professor.",
                "Learned about journalism, particularly as it relates to race.",
                "This course was a fantastic exercise in engaging with different kinds of writing related to race relations in politics. The types of assignments were engaging and unique even if you're not particularly interested in journalism, so long as you're invested in the consequences of journalism on the political landscape of the United States. There's a ton of flexibility to write about what you are passionate about.",

                "Got to read a great variety of material around race and politics in the US, and learned so much. Great discussions and great professor.",

                "The strengths are the classroom-forum style that allows several opinions and conclusions to be heard. Also, the longer class held only once a week suits me better than a class that meets twice a week and has a once-a-week section as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class, I believe, is the lack of diversity in thought. There was diversity in ethnicity and race, but the students have the same socio-political mindset and the class becomes an echo chamber rather than a place where assumptions can be challenged. A student who may have views that deviate from what is accepted on a modern college campus would feel uncomfortable in this type of setting. Certain students take certain classes. A conservatively oriented student probably would not take a class that discusses race or any AFAM class. Students who would take these kinds of courses usually share the same worldview so they would rarely challenge each other, if at all. This is not the type of learning environment that I believe Yale University wishes to promote. And this is no criticism of the professor. He was the only one who would push back against a misapprehension or wrong historical or analytical interpretation.",
                "Nice professor, but not very thorough requirements explained.",
                "The course was interesting, but frankly I did not learn any hard skills about how to report on race or immigration, nor did I receive any concrete advice or feedback on how to improve my skills in doing so. We mostly just spoke and read about how much it sucks to be POC in America.",
                "Professor Felton was an extremely busy man, which enriched the course with what he could share from his personal experiences but made it difficult to get timely grades/substantive feedback. None of us faulted him for that, thoughhis obvious passion for the course more than made up for it.",
                "Critical, reflective discussions about race, power, and immigration. Professor Felton is very accessible and offers helpful feedback.",
                "Strengths were the discussions 100%. This was one of the first courses Ive taken where it felt that the conversation was student-led and informed by prof. I really enjoyed it! I wouldve loved more feedback on papers so that I could know exactly what to improve on journalistically."
