I found I could actually articulate what made me love a movie or hate it as I had more words in my film vocabulary.",

                "I loved the filmmaker presentations because I learned about other artists outside of the syllabus. I also liked that Oksana encouraged us to take notes while watching films. I do think discussion could've been facilitated better though.",
                "This class is really fantastic. I looked forward to it every week. I would have never seen the majority of the films shown just because I didn't know they existed but I'm so glad I was exposed to them. I think the readings enhanced the movies and allowed me to have a more informed conversation in class. I also appreciate that the class worked for those of us who had never taken a film class before. Oksana introduced concepts gradually so I was able to build up my knowledge of film over the course of the class and I never felt that I was significantly behind my classmates even though many of them had more experience in film classes than me.",
