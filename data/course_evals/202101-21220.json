We read the \"Great Pretender\" by Suzannah Cahalan and listened to Donor 9623, which were both so gripping and had great writing. We also had a lot of amazing guest lecturers who gave incite on what it's like to be a writer."

                "I personally really enjoyed the class. I think the workload is manageable if you just stay on top of your readings/essays. Try not to leave the final assignment interviews until the very end.",
                "I wish we had more feedback and more opportunities to workshop in class. It would be great if everything could have three drafts instead of two to give us more opportunities to improve.",
                "i liked how the professor was able to interact with, get to know, and provide feedback to everyone. the readings helped me think about my own writing, and the individualized feedback i got on each thing i submitted was very helpful. the workshops were also helpful to see how others approach the same thing",
                "Strengths: Prof. Epstein is fantastic at leading/supporting discussions and giving feedback, our readings were interesting and complementary to what we learned, cool guest speakers to meet and learn from, assignments were engaging and just the right amount of challenging, course clearly built on itself in the best way. Weaknesses: None?? Just wish we could've been in person of course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Epstein is an amazing professor and writer. We also wrote a whole lot in the class and got a taste of different writing styles before diving in to the final paper. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was SO much work that sometimes I did not know how I was going to do everything. This was more work than my STEM courses.",
                "This has been my favorite course at Yale thus far. We only had 8 people in the class (including the professor), so we were able to read a lot of each other's writings, and everyone participated in class discussions. Professor Epstein also gave us fun activities to do and shipped us cute prizes. The deadlines came fast, but Professor Epstein was always very accessible and kind. This class is a lot of work, either a first or second draft is due every week. The final paper was a lot longer than I had expected, 3 times the word count of anything we had written before. I thought we could've done a third draft for the final paper. All in all, though, Professor Epstein is a great teacher and made this COVID semester a lot less sucky."
