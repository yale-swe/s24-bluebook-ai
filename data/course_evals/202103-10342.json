                "I improved my ability to read critically. This involves not only reading assigned texts critically, but also my own and my peers' writing during the editing stages of papers. I gained a greater appreciation for the language non-fiction writers use. I also improved upon my own writing skills, and raised my writing abilities from a high school level to a college level.",
                "I learned so much about truth in politics. On top of that, my writing also became so much more clear and concise. I believe this was an excellent introduction to college academic writing, and will prepare me so well for what's to come.",
                "i improved my writing skills marginally.",
                "How to create a solid argument and stay consistent with a strong claim.",
                "Learning how to read higher level texts, think and analyze critically. Learned about the foundations of democracy, definition of truth, facts, and lies. Learned from historians, philosophers, and journalists.",
                "How to read texts carefully and for understanding of the author's argument, main ideas, and means of supporting their claim. How to write an academic paper, including constructing and organizing an argument, elements of style, and the writing process. The process of writing an academic research paper, including finding sources and creating a bibliography and bringing the results of research together into a claim and paper. Understanding what truth is and its importance, particularly in the realm of politics and democracy.",
                "I learned how to read and write English.",
                "So much! I grew so much in not only my writing skills (ie structuring a paper, concision, etc) but my analytical reading and researching skills. This class is so focused on questioning our sources of knowledge and diving deep into authors and legitimacy to come to the best conclusion possible. Our readings were varied and helped me understand the best ways to approach various texts. Guided research was helpful we will surely do it later."

                "The strengths of this course are the variety of authors that students read through the assigned works and the variety of writing types they encounter through the four different papers. Another strength is the instructor's editing style of the students' papers, and the flexibility with which the instructor assigns papers and readings. A weakness of this course was the lack of rubrics for the papers the students write, and another weakness was the lack of clear communication regarding deadlines of important assignments, such as papers.",
                "Professor Riley is an outstanding discussion leader. Very informative feedback on writing. Great readings.",
                "Strengths- Professor Riley is the most incredible professor. I also appreciated being allowed to write our research papers about anything we wanted.\r\nWeaknesses- The class does end up becoming a bit of an echo chamber, although perhaps it is just a coincidence that everyone in our class has very similar world views. Also, I think we were given perhaps too much time to work on the research papers time that I would have loved for additional class discussions.",
                "this course is somewhat interesting. there is not too much reading in the course packet and some of it is interesting although the main book is not very good nor interesting. the subject matter was interesting but discussions were not sufficiently focused or purposeful. the amount of time given for first drafts was often too short while the amount of time given for revision was too long.",
                "Professor Riley fostered a class environment that allowed class and peer discussion as well as individual learning and practice.",
                "Feedback was great. Professor always gave opportunities to meet with her and discuss the writing.",
                "Strengths: the ability to practice and learn reading and writing in an academic context. Professor Riley very carefully and methodically teaches you great techniques for better understanding readings and writing academic papers, all through the lens of this fascinating topic. Professor Riley is passionate about this topic, truth in politics, and that excitement comes through in discussion, where she prompts us with thought-provoking questions and we can hear the perspectives of our peers. The wide variety of writing assignments leading up to the research paper, the biggest assignment, helped to ease me into academic writing, especially as a first-year. Also, Professor Riley provides incredibly detailed feedback on each assignment. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: applied to both academic and personal life as I now am critical of where I get my news, helped in all aspects of academic tasks like writing and reading, super engaging, not too much reading, a draft system to offer really good feedback!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes a hard balance between working on our papers and asking questions vs discussing new readings. Sometimes dragged when we had a big paper coming up with peer review session and less new material"

                "I would recommend this course to another student. This course definitely helps students improve upon their writing and also their ability to read and analyze texts critically. I especially appreciated the topic of this English 114 writing seminar, and the ideas about truth that we discussed in class were fascinating and unparalleled in any other Yale College course I have taken.",
                "Absolutely. Take anything with Professor Riley, and if truth in politics/journalism interests you, take this course.",
                "Absolutely in fact, I would go as far as to say that this is a class that I wish every student took, because it really opens your eyes to epistemological issues. Professor Riley is such a kind, compassionate, and thoughtful professor. I also cannot understate how much I feel like my writing improved! Just be prepared to write a lot.",
                "not particularly. although professor riley is very kind, intelligent and flexible, this course isnt a gut, but isnt very intellectually interesting or challenging either.",
                "Yes it is a class I believe every Yale student should take because its topic and scope is so relevant and comprehensive to all our lives in America (and as future leaders).",
                "Yes! Especially for students interested in improving their writing, looking for a political science/history/american studies track, and wants a smaller seminar environment.",
                "Yes, every student can benefit from both the writing elements of the class and its interesting content, which is particularly relevant to the United States today.",
                "Yes! 1. Professor Riley grades quickly, unlike many other Yale professors. 2. She is very flexible and accommodating with due dates. She has moved deadlines back multiple times for the whole class, and from talking to peers, she is willing to give extensions for individual circumstances. 3. Good paper feedback.",
                "Yes! Prof. Riley cares so deeply about her students and their success and the course is engaging. If you are interested in politics, news, or how we view current events, this is a great class."
