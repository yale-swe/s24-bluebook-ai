                "This was a great class regarding the field of medical humanities. I learned so much and was able to use the readings for other classes too.",
                "I've learned how to enjoy reading and writing about medicine and how it intersects with so many different aspects of humanities, from philosophy, the arts.",
                "It's hard to say in a couple words, but basically how to take the humanities and apply them to medicine. This was the most \"liberal arts\" course I have taken, drawing on philosophy, literature, art, music, science, psychology (just to name a few) to tackle some of the looming issues of medicine.",

            "comments": [
                "The course has strong readings that were very interesting. I wish that during our discussions I had the chance to talk amongst my peers a little bit more. Each classmate would say something about the reading, which our professor would comment always. This on occasion disrupted the flow of the conversation as people may not have wanted to add a follow up.\r\n\r\nAnother strength of the course was how engaging the professor's lectures were. I wish we had got to do a dedicated presentation of our own on one of the topics he lectured on.",
                "I wish the lectures were more tethered to all of the readings, but I nonetheless enjoyed how the class discussions encouraged students' emotional reactions to the pieces rather than something more analytical. The trips to the Yale museums were very insightful.",
                "This class went at a pace established by students.\r\n\r\nNo weakness.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrison! And the readings, especially the books.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths are definitely the professor, the syllabus, the specificity and application of material, and the utilization of Yale's resources. I would say one weakness at times can be the structure of the class. Morrison would often lecture for an hour or more and then we'd discuss. I wish at times that there was more discussion and less lecture or that more of the discussion were led by students.",
                "I loved all the trips we took to interactively learn about the material from class. We also heard from the most interesting speakers.",
                "I don't believe that there were any weaknesses in this course. The lectures, guest speakers, and class trips around campus were all incredibly interesting and helpful in understanding the class content; every week was different and interesting in a new way.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrisons passion and kindness! He genuinely cares so much about all of these topics and his students and it made the course a joy. Also loved how he made use of all of Yales different resources. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures felt a bit disjointed when we ran through one or two writers entire body of work within 40 minutes. I wonder if theres a way for lectures to be a bit more focused, perhaps if we read more complete works instead of selections",
                "The strengths of this course included the small class size where it was easy to interact with my peers, the many field trips we took that made this class even more enjoyable. I think one way this class could be improved is by having annotations or some background information provided along with the reading so we have that additional resource while reading the texts for class and it would better prepare us for class discussions."

                "Absolutely! I believe all prospective premed / premed adjacent students should take this course. The class material, Dr. Morrison, and guest lecturers provide an introduction into the medical career through the context of the humanities. This introduction is by far",
                "Yes! I think youd get the most out of it if youre premed but anyone could definitely enjoy this course very much",
