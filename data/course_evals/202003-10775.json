For the readings we had to answer some questions (most were content-based so not very difficult if you read the text) and make at least three \"good\" and \"original\" comments. For the the corresponding class, Profesora Adorno would then go over keypoints towards understanding the text through the use of a powerpoint. She would call on students to read and answer questions throughout the class. Other than the readings, we completed two quizzes on Canvas (content based, more of recalling facts), two 3-6 page essays, and a final theatrical presentation of an assigned reading.",

Constantly having to use Spanish-speaking abilities during class and while doing the weekly readings contributed to my growth in Spanish proficiency.",
                "I think the biggest insights I developed from this course was a better understanding of Latin American life and literature during the colonial age. I got to read many interesting passages in Spanish from a large variety of perspectives during this time period. By engaging with the language, readings, and discussions, I feel I also improved my ability to speak and understand the Spanish language.",

                "Strengths: low work, Prof Adorno is friendly and understanding, a few interesting lecture topics here and there, fun final project \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: found most material relatively boring, annoying to use Perusall (which is where all HW is submitted), Prof will call on you in class",
                "Strengths - Professor Adorno. She is wonderful and engaging, and really made attending lecture worth it! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Perusall. It was a very confusing platform to use and many students didn't try hard in the comments. I don't think it achieved it's purpose.",
                "Strengths: Profesora Adorno is extremely passionate and makes sure everyone is understanding the material. This course also delves into the history surrounding the texts, which made them easier to read.\r\nWeaknesses: The scope of the readings was pretty limited (almost all were indigenous royalty or conquistadors), and we only read one female author, Sor Juana, which I though was the most interesting one.",
                "Because this class was a 9AM combined with the repetitive nature of the form of instruction at times it was hard to concentrate. I found what helps is to actively take notes during lecture, but notes are not needed to pass the class as the powerpoints and Perusall notes are always available to students outside of class.",
                "This class had very manageable work, all you had to do was analyze texts for every class and write two essays. I didn't really like how we were randomly called on in class. I feel like that would be better for a seminar not necessarily a lecture.",
                "Strengths: professor picks out very interesting readings and focuses our attention on very manageable passages. Assignments were constructive and helped learning, along with ample feedback. I enjoyed the online reading markups in Perusal.\r\nWeaknesses: I felt class time could have been used better to facilitate discussions, rather than just showing powerpoints and calling on individuals for answers to specific questions. Might have just been due to trying to adapt to virtual learning.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, Professor Adorno communicates\/engages with us consistently, work was pretty low effort. Weaknesses: some of the readings weren't very interesting",
                "There are many strengths for this course. The greatest strength is Professor Adorno. Her enthusiasm, support, and knowledge of this course and her students makes this a class I would want to take over and over again. The material is riveting and workload is manageable (and the final project was a lot of fun!).",
                "The readings were very interesting but the class lacked engagement and required more discussion.",
                "Profesora Adorno adapted beautifully to the virtual format and was able to keep her class engaging and exciting. Her assignments were clear and approachable, and she clarified any confusions quickly either via email or, if you wanted, by appointment. She was very open to hearing her students differing ideas and analyses. Overall an amazing professor. \r\n\r\nI do, however, wish that we were asked more challenging questions during class, rather than just called to read from slides. I would love to see the cold-calling method dialed back, and see students be asked to analyze aloud as they please.",
                "The main strength was Professor Adorno's ability to get all of her students involved. The main weakness was simply the online aspect of the class. It was difficult paying attention to an online presentation in the early morning.",
                "It helped me improve my Spanish through reading, writing, and speaking assignments. I also learned a lot about Latin American history through the reading assignments. I think the class format could be a bit better organized in some ways. Profesora Adorno cold calls on people which is sometimes hard to keep up with (especially on Zoom), and the homework questions sometimes seemed a bit tedious. But overall, a great way to get a language credit!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Adorno is AMAZING and cares for her students. The course is well structured. Grading is very lenient.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings are very difficult and sometimes it feels like you've been thrown into the deep end. The class is super early in the morning and you have to be present for lectures.",
                "the seminar format is hard with 40 kids, especially over zoom. engagement over zoom would be higher with less people in the class.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it is a relatively low workload compared to other language courses, but that does not mean you learn any less. On the contrary, by analyzing more in depth a couple of pages of Latin American Literature, you are able to truly get a sense of the historical context of the time. There are no weakness :)",
                "Everyone gets a chance to speak and make mistakes when practicing their Spanish.",
                "Strengths are that Professor adorno gives feedback very fast and is always willing to answer your questions.",
                "Professor Adorno is very sweet and understanding! The class itself is a great ease-in back into Spanish, even if you've had a gap in your learning. I had classmates from varying grade levels and from a wide array of majors, so it was a great way to meet new people too. Keep in mind that she does call on students to retain engagement.",
                "Strengths: The course gives a detailed look into significant historical figures aside from those akin to Christopher Columbus and Hernn Corts, such as ancient Aztec prince Nezahualcyotl and Sor Juana Ins de la Cruz. The workload is minimal but enough to activate our analytical mindsets; the lack of constant stress was extremely helpful in balancing the course with others. Additionally, Profesora Adorno and TF Esteban Crespo were absolutely amazing in guiding us through the course and very much willing to help and inform us.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The scope of the course is very limited to focusing on the authors that emerged during the colonial period in Latin America, and at times, this felt a bit overly-specific or too niche (nature of the course, I suppose). Students at times were only expected to contribute by regurgitating information from power points in essays and during lectures, and I think students would have benefited by having more group activities and seminars, similar to how we did in one of the sessions taught by the TF. I think more opportunities to think critically and speak during class with our peers would have been perfect for the class, so that we were still challenged and encouraged to improve our proficiency in the Spanish language.",
                "I always enjoyed doing the readings. They were very interesting and insightful, without being overbearing to complete. While I still enjoyed the assignments, perhaps one way they could be improved was if we got more feedback on the weekly comments we wrote for the readings.",
                "I think the readings are well chosen and Professor Adorno does a good job of pulling meaning from them. Professor Adorno's passion for teaching and for the material is evident, and it makes the class a lot stronger overall.\r\nI think the biggest weakness of the course for me was the formatI think I would have gotten more out of the class if there had been more discussion. It's hard to do that given the size of the class though.",
                "Can get boring but the professor broke that up sometimes with interesting projects.",
                "I wished the class was not so early during the day.",
                "The course could be improved with more in depth analysis of the readings in class, rather than time spent reading passages aloud. I'm not entirely sure that Professor Adorno's method of having student questions guide the class was always entirely successful.",
                "I thought that I did the best I could given that I do not natively speak Spanish.  All I know is that I improved greatly, and that is what counts."

                "I thought that this class translated well virtually. The slides were easy to follow, and even remotely (and at 9am), Profesora Adorno forced us to be attentive by cold-calling during lecture. In the future, I think having more breakout rooms\/interactions with others in the class could make people more engaged.",
                "The Perusall honestly starts to get really boring and repetitive. Later in the semester I felt myself pushing it off to as late as possible. Our final project was a group assignment where we had to create a script based on one of the primary texts we had studied over the course of the semester. We would then have to perform our script live in front of the class on zoom. At first I thought this sounded really silly and would feel really stupid doing it as we were encouraged to go all out with music, sound effects, zoom backgrounds, costumes, and props, but when it came time to present it ended up being really fun. It was a creative and entertaining way to review all the content we had gone over. (We also didn't have to memorize our lines so it was a very low stress environment).",
                "Perusal was great.",
                "Professor Adorno was very accommodating, and altered her syllabus as we figured out what worked and what didn't during the semester. I really appreciated this. Sometimes class didn't feel very engaging, mostly because we weren't in-person though I know not much can be done to remedy this.",
                "This course worked impressively well given the circumstances. I cannot think of any improvements.",
                "There needs to be more engagement among students.",
                "Profesora Adorno made sure to master the art of Zoom by using 2 computers at once so she could present her lecture while simultaneously seeing all her students. All that could be improved, Id say, is the Perusall assignments, which could feel like busywork at times.",
                "Perhaps it would be good to find ways to make the class more interactive. It felt a little \"lecture-y\" at times, which would be fine in regular times, but it made it difficult to focus with the online formatting.",
                "Profesora Adorno would cold call on people to answer questions, which I thought was particularly difficult on Zoom because Internet issues might make it difficult to participate. I also understand why she asked us to have our cameras on at all times but that was sometimes difficult if I was not able to keep my camera on because of connection problems. But other than those two things, I think the class transferred pretty well to Zoom. I also appreciated that she canceled some of the end of semester assignments.",
                "The main practice that could be improved is the early timing, which made it quite difficult for students in certain time zones.",
                "Despite being a big class, randomly calling names kept people engaged in the material. Also asking people to turn cameras on did the same thing. The organization of the homework assignments could have been more tidy.",
                "The use of Perusall for reading assignments was very unclear. The grading algorithm on Perusall did not make much sense, and I was never sure if we were even supposed to do it.\r\nBreakout rooms during Esteban's lectures were a nice addition to the course.",
                "The live virtual lecture allowed for a closer experience to an in person lecture. While active class participation enabled everyone to talk to each other.",
                "I wish the lectures would have been recorded, but I think there was a privacy rule that prevented discussion-style classes from recording lectures.",
                "More breakout rooms and activities with smaller groups of peers would have greatly helped.",
                "I feel our assignments and discussions worked very well in a virtual format. Even the final theater presentation was very fun and allowed us to make use of many of zoom's features in creative ways.",
                "I'm not sure how different the class was due to Covid. The lectures were good.\r\nWe used perusall, an online platform where you can post annotations and respond to teachers about the reading. Perusall is not my favorite. I might have preferred more typical written responses, but I don't know if this was a change due to covid.",
                "Allowing students to complete reading response on Perusal was really nice and allowed us to be flexible in our learning.",
                "Professor Adorno did a great job encouraging interactions and discussions in class. We had to have cameras on at all times (we had around 40 people in the class), and she would randomly call on people to answer. Throughout the semester we also had several group assignments, including our final project."

                "If you're trying to get your language out of the way, I recommend. Not a lot of work, relatively interesting, the professor is great. I took as a sophomore, after a 5 on AP and not taking any Spanish my first year. Was never overwhelmed in terms of not knowing what was going on, even though my Spanish was not perfect going in.",
                "Yes absolutely! Professor Adorno is wonderful and the material is interesting!",
                "This was not the most challenging L5 Spanish class that one could take, but if a student is looking to get a language requirement, I would definitely recommend this class.",
                "Yeah, it's a good course to take if you're looking to get your language requirement out of the way. However, reading Spanish texts and looking at how colonizers viewed\/treated Latin America can be frustrating but its not the course's fault.",
                "Yes, I would. Overall, the course was a great fifth class and I learned a lot about the subject material. Professor Adorno clearly cares about student learning and made the course very stress free during a weird virtual semester. In particular, she did an excellent job making the readings only 4 or 5 pages of the most important parts of each book so that we could really focus in on the details. I am personally not the most interested in the discovery\/conquest of the New World by Spain, which this course exclusively focuses on, but if you are, this would make for an engaging course. Otherwise, it is a fairly easy Spanish credit and you will have practice reading and writing in Spanish. Note that the historical legacy of colonization of the New World is seldom, if ever, appropriately addressed. I was not particularly bothered by this but I know some students might have been. The professor mostly approaches the material from a neutral perspective, not providing normative evaluations, but do be aware that the majority of the readings are written by the Spanish colonists and only a handful actually deal with the barbarism of the conquest.",
                "I would. It's low-effort and I thought I wouldn't take away much as a result. However, I do feel more knowledgable on Latin American literature, and I do think my Spanish improved. The communication between us and Prof. Adorno \/ Esteban was very good.  That being said, you might not find the readings very interesting without attending lectures or reading the powerpoint, which gave us more insight about what we read.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. The material was interesting and Professor Adorno is incredible.",
                "If you are trying to transition to level 5 Spanish without taking a big jump, this is probably the best class to take.",
                "If youre looking for an L5 Spanish course that teaches you more about historical context than speaking formalities, or if youre interested in Spanish literature, this course is definitely for you! It is highly enlightening and enjoyable as well. I recommend to anyone who has a skilled working knowledge of the Spanish language.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It was a fantastic learning experience and a great L5 Spanish course to take.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great way to get a Spanish credit! Just be warned that you do have to prepare for class and do the homework questions because she expects everyone to be super engaged. But the other assignments like essays and the final project were not at all demanding.",
                "Yes!!! Prof. Adorno makes it all worth it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they want to learn about the course material, not necessarily if they want to improve their spanish. given there being so many kids in the class it was hard to always participate or engage over zoom.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly my fellow Latine peers. I know that during high school I never took history\/literature classes that centered around the origins of my culture because they simply weren't offered. This was a great introductory course to the richness and complexity of Latin American cultures and how they were impacted by colonialism.",
                "Definitely not. I can't say I took much from this course, there are probably better L5 courses to take.",
                "Yes! A manageable workload with a great Professor!",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes! If you're looking for an interesting Spanish course with a relatively low workload, this is an amazing course. You'll dive deeper into historical figures from the Latin American colonial period and gain greater insight into the complexities of relationships between indigenous Americans, European colonizers, and the American continents. The opportunity to learn from Profesora Adorno and TF Esteban is invaluable and one that every student who can should take advantage of.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Even though I came in without the strongest confidence in my spanish speaking abilities, I always felt able to keep up with the course and complete our weekly assignments. The discussions and readings were all very interesting, and I feel I learned a lot about Latin American literature and culture throughout the colonial age.",
                "I think this course is a solid introduction to taking classes in Spanish. It's good to improve reading comprehension and writing skills.\r\nThe material is also interesting and important and worth learning.",
                "Yes, for the examination of classics and how the professor weaves in history and culture into the course.",
                "This class is great for any student with a pretty good level of Spanish, and is arguably one of the easier L5 courses. It helps that she cancelled our final essay partway through the semester to allow us to focus more on the final project.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has advanced Spanish but not a ton of experience writing.",
                "Definitely. The texts we read were fascinating, not only as written works, but as historical artifacts displaying the blending of local Native American\/Indigenous peoples and the Spanish conquests into the Americas. It was also really nice to speak with the teacher and the other students regularly."
