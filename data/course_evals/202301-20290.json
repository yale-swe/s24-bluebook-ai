            "comments": [
                "The course's readings are interesting and were engaged in a justified, often interesting fashion, but the structure of the course was such that students spent a great deal of time watching the professors in conversation with one another which, while fascinating, did not lend itself to a great level of engagement with the material. If ever students were asked for input, these instances were few and far between, and tended to be focused on the one student presenting on a given day. Generally speaking, it was easy to be checked out because thoughts were developed at great length without any interest in the flow of the class.",
                "Only weaknesses. This course is not well structured to teach students anything. Most of my class consisted of upperclassmen like me, and here we were, stuck in a class marketed as a seminar but it's really just a lecture, a lecture that goes at .75x speed. Probably the worst class I've ever taken.",
                "The course had very little structure in terms of the syllabus, and the theory pairings often seemed quite random, with no connection from week to week or even within a single class. The instructors lectured in a 20-person class and did not encourage discussion, while essay prompts were extremely vague.",
                "This course requires vast restructuring. Professors Hever and Campe are brilliant and extremely insightful, yet the way the class was run was not conducive to students' learning. They mostly spoke between themselves for entire 2 hour blocks, with student presenters for each week fighting to get their presentations in. Student involvement was low, and even when questions were posed to the class for discussion, students were often unable to engage with each others' points and discussion would stagnate. The connection between readings on the syllabus was unclear, and repeated readings from How to Compare, which is a shame because they are both in the same course sequence. This class must be restructured and refined if the comparative literature department wants to retain students and if it wants to ensure some sort of core curriculum/common understanding among the majors.",
                "I have friends that have not only dropped the course but dropped the Comparative Literature major after exposure to this situation. It is not a course, it is a situation. I love this department with all my heart but if it isn't somebody's TOP of to-do list to completely overhaul this course, that would be sad. \r\n\r\nThe textbook needs to be burned. \r\nThe readings need to be under 50 pages per week, and available in a mandatory coursepack printed at the beginning of the year.\r\nThe instructors need to be people who will cultivate any amount of excitement and communal understanding in students.\r\nThe instructors need to value a social atmosphere of presence and investment, and real relationships between those in the room. \r\nA dramatic reading of Wikipedia, or a properly organized 15 minute lecture, needs to accompany every new node of the intellectual tradition being traced. A GLOSSARY, AT THE VERY LEAST, COULD BE PROVIDED, IF ONLY AS A HELPFUL GIMMICK TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF STRUCTURE. \r\n\r\nThe fact that this is intended to be the first contact a student has, purportedly a young student, a first-year, with all the pretentious and practically esoteric ways that literature is taught, is BONKERS. What kind of access is this giving? All it does is immerse someone who may have never heard of Camus or Benjamin in a sense of uninspired tired review. It's careless! It could alienate any person, of any academic and cultural background, from the joy of literature, secondary literature, theory! Holy moly!",
                "An abundance of weaknesses: disorganized and non-communicative professors, no clear expectations or deadlines, virtually nonexistent syllabus, lack of student participation. I could go on forever. This should NOT be a mandatory course in the LITR major!!!!!!!",
                "Weaknesses: unscheduled curriculum, classes that are too long, useless textbook, lack of engaging discussion, minimal direction for papers, and unclear expectations \r\n\r\nStrengths: the professors and TF are sweet",
                "I have never written a negative course review. I can't in good conscience write positive things about this class. The comparative literature department is great, but this is simply not a good course. \r\n\r\nHow to Read is a requirement for the major, yet the conversations I've had with classmates have made clear that it is actively discouraging students from pursuing further coursework in the department. Though I know that LITR 130 doesn't reflect the quality of instruction in most comp lit courses, not everyone knows this, and that's a problem. The truth is that I am having a hard time figuring out where to start with this review. \r\n\r\nA haphazard list of issues: The level of engagement during class discussions was remarkably low, largely because of the structure of the course and the quality of the instruction. Most students spent all 110 minutes on their computers, which the course's organization (student presentations and lecture-style remarks from professors) practically encouraged. In short: This is barely a seminar in its current state. At the beginning of one class, professors half-argued in front of students about who would be leading discussion. The syllabus looked interesting, but we always seemed to return to a few texts from the first weeks of class (Camus was a particular favorite). Theoretical concepts and buzzwords were thrown around before they were defined. (Many of them were never defined.) Feedback on writing was all but nonexistent. The professors announced and scheduled a make-up class during reading week on the last day of class.\r\n\r\nThe long and short of it is that this course is begging for an overhaul. It's in the interest of both the department and the students.",
                "This course needs an entire restructuringit doesnt really work at all the way it is set-up right now to teach students much.",
                "The syllabus is good, but the textbook readings should be cut. The structure of the class and class discussions are really not great and could benefit from some more engagement with the students. It is essentially a lecture by the two professors with questions being offered to the two students giving their \"presentation\" which is just a summary of the readings that everyone was supposed to do.",
                "The feedback I received on my first two essays was actually very helpful (however, we received no feedback or grade on the final essay). Also, the assigned reading for this course is really interesting if you actually take the time to do it. But while the class is meant to be a seminar, it ended up being more of a lecture by the two professors with few attempts to engage the students, or at best an interrogation of the two students who were presenting each classas such, it was easy to lose motivation to do the readings. Also, considering how lecture-heavy the course was, I wish the professors had spent more time simply explaining some of the more complicated theoretical texts to make sure we understood them fully.",
                "The course does not have the best structure in my opinions; in most cases with seminars, students enjoy the discussion in class more than they enjoy the reading. In this course, it was the exact opposite for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the readings and wish that students could have interacted with them to a greater degree in class. Often, the course became a discussion between the two professors and the students presenting the material for the week, which was interesting to listen to, but was not an intimate of subjective experience with the texts. This may have been due to any number of factors such as the large class size, the two professors, or the presentations taking up a long period of the class. The presentations also put a lot of pressure on the students that had to present each week; it was as if class was just watching a different presentation each week rather than discussing the texts.\r\nI also found the essay prompts unhelpful in formulating ideas for a paper; the open-ended prompt is nice as it allows for complete liberty and freedom, but it also gives the student no semblance of a starting place to go off of.",
                "I think the teachers are brilliant. However, it seems silly this is an intro class. We do readings on very basic concepts when most of the students in the class were already midway through a comparative literature major. This can make different readings feel a little dull. Also, there wasn't much discussion which was kindof sad, so I didn't get to know the rest of my classmates."

The textbook focused on many very redundant and basic concepts such as point of view, yet many of the theoretical readings were extremely complex and the class discussions did not facilitate proper understanding of them. The paper prompts were uninspiring, the feedback was very minimal, and overall, having 2 professors created more confusion than valuable discourse. Most of the time, very few students paid attention or participated, and the atmosphere was not motivating or conducive to learning.",

If that's the case for you, I wouldn't recommend dropping the major just because of one bad class. But know what you're getting into. (The popular strategy right now seems to be to wait until the last possible minute - i.e., senior year - to get the course out of the way. That kind of speaks for itself.)
