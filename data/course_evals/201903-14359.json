   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the realities of intervening in crisis situations and why it's not as simple as going in and helping out. We learned a lot about the difficulties in intervening in weak states vs strong states, the tensions between different forms of humanitarianism and different philosophies pertaining to alleviating human suffering, and problems within the humanitarian system. It was incredible to look at case studies and read works by people who have been in these situations and get a first-hand look into work that is so necessary but so complex.",
    "I learned how to think critically about humanitarianism through an anthropological perspective. Also learned how to develop succinct and practical arguments from the texts we read and research we conducted.",
    "Understanding of the humanitarian field, both its necessity and its shortcomings.",
    "Issues and theories relating to humanitarianism",
    "Learned just how complex humanitarian aid actually is, and how wary you have to be when you're doing it.",
    "I felt like I learned about specific case studies as well as the underlying principles and issues of humanitarianism. It is an interesting class and I feel much more competent when discussing the limitations and strengths of humanitarianism.",
    "Amazing course. Gave me an opportunity to look at the way we interact with international humanitarian aid and how we can change it.",
    "the ethics and politics of humanitarian interventions, critical analysis, research highlight development, military dimensions",
    "An understanding of the current aid system, debates in ethics, approaches, and mandates, often through the lens of case studies. Awareness of the nature of crises and the necessity for nuanced approaches. I was often surprised by seeing the dark side of approaches that seem flawless at first glance.",
    "We learned about global humanitarian intervention and how it changes based on whether it is delivered by NGO, military, faith-based, and corporate agencies. We learned through case studies (the 2014 Ebola crisis for example) and we led class discussions on a huge range of readings from the perspective of those delivering and those receiving aid. We also learned about the partnership and challenges between humanitarian focussed and human rights focussed organizations.",
    "I learned a lot about how to effectively deliver aid in crisis situations and the factors that complicate the ability of aid organizations to carry out meaningful and lasting aid efforts to create change for affected populations.",
    "This course covered the logistical and ethical dilemmas encountered when considering, designing, and implementing a humanitarian intervention. Questions like the difference between humanitarianism and human rights, the trade-offs between long-term and short-term approaches, the issues and benefits of holistic interventions, and the role of states, civil society organizations, militaries, and religious groups were all dealt with in the readings and discussed in the course. Guests were invited to the seminar to share their own experiences and give students a better understanding of what it is like to work in the humanitarian field at various levels. The class featured discussions, debates, videos, student presentations, and guest activities. It was an incredibly inviting and comfortable environment in which we could have earnest conversations."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course was well structured to build on the knowledge we had developed every week and deepen the conversation about the problems in the humanitarian system. We had great discussions sometimes but sometimes it was hard to get your thoughts into the room. The times we had debates or lively discussions and went back and forth were the best. We always had something to look forward to and something new and interesting to talk about.",
    "Strengths: I LOVE CPB! by far one of the best, most professionally-equipped profs I've ever had at Yale. Syllabus was so great and assignments were not bad\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: maybe more thorough feedback on the CA's?",
    "No weaknesses. Amazing class, great readings, lots of insightful in-class discussion.",
    "Very engaging seminars, relevant (and not too heavy) readings, assignments were not overbearing\r\n\r\nSome of the readings were really really really dense and theoretical",
    "Strength: I loved doing the readings every week, and class discussions were always very engaging.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the material felt a bit repetitive.",
    "Great readings, wonderful professor and wonderful classroom environment. Very engaging material and the critical analyses really do help with understanding material. Weaknesses: Would've liked the professor to use some of the long class time lecturing, to guide the discussion better and clarify the topic. The presentations on readings led by students were a waste of class time and there was too much material to try and synthesize. Maybe a better method would be to allow the student to pick just one reading and give the takeaways for that + connect it to outside sources or news stories. The final presentation could have been better if instead of a vague topic, the student groups were each assigned a case study or organization and asked to discuss the relevant topics learned over the course through the lense of the case study.",
    "GLBL 393 is a solid global seminar with a very manageable workload. I think the main strength of the course is Professor Panter-Brick -- her background both as an academic and as a practitioner (literally a certified humanitarian) makes her a source of a wealth of knowledge and also personal experience on the grounds of humanitarian crises. Rather than focusing on brute memorization of facts, Professor Panter-Brick, and consequently the course, is committed to students walking away from each class with key takeaways, ones that won't be forgotten by the next class a week later. \r\nHowever, I think this is where the only weakness of the course lies: as the course was mostly focused on case studies, I sometimes wanted a rigorous theory that could ground and connect the various concepts\/case studies we discussed throughout the semester.",
    "This course has excellent readings and Professor Panther-Brick teaches the class both the strengths and limitations of medical humanitarianism. A weakness is that every student has to present on the readings and that can make the start of class seem a bit dry.",
    "Strengths: Cpb is an amazing professor and the information is incredibly engaging. She knows what shes talking about! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it sometimes feels like theres a lack of guidance but otherwise amazing",
    "The main strength of this class is its professor. CPB is an exceptionally kind and caring instructor who cares deeply about her students' learning and development. The course design reflects the instructor's sincere intentions. The main weakness of the course is that the grading policy\/expectations are often unclear. Students have the ability to receive grades and feedback very quickly, but without clear expectations (particularly on the final assignments), it's much harder to prepare.",
    "Strengths: Loved Prof. Panter-Brick, good readings, fair level of work, great and prompt feedback offered, fabulous content. Really meaningful course. Weaknesses: I would have liked a bit more collaboration with my peers early on so that we got to know each other better before the final projects.",
    "This course was amazing. I learned so much and got to engage with readings in deep ways. I think the critical analysis assignments were great because they helped me learn to convey my ideas in a no BS kind of way, and since they were short, they were not too intimidating (though a lot of time does go into making a concentrated argument). After doing one, I had a much better grasp on the readings than I would have had without them - it made me realize how writing can be a tool for increasing my own understanding. Class discussion was engaging and intriguing, sometimes over my head but maybe that's just because I tend to be sleep deprived. A suggestion would be to maybe make the recaps of the readings into mini presentation assignments with a power point? That could be practice for the final presentation, and would make them stick more in our minds perhaps? This was an accessible class even for me, a stem student - the writing was manageable with plentiful feedback and support if you need it. I really liked that the final project was done in groups, because it helps a lot to get to discuss the concepts and bounce our ideas off of each other. Maybe if there were a little bit more small group action in class time that would be helpful for those who don't speak much in the class discussions . I really appreciated Professor Panter-Brick, she is so experienced and very genuine, and it added a lot to the class to hear from her personal experience and opinions. One of my favorite classes was doing one of the focusing exercises that she had done\/studied in the field - interactive experiences like that are unforgettable, especially because she led the way in being very vulnerable and taking it seriously, and the students followed suit. The classroom became a unique and lovely community - I feel like I'm friends with everyone in the class even though I haven't had a one on one conversation with many of them.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at yale. Prof Panter Brick is inspiring, kind, well-spoken, and a wonderful mentor. If you have the chance, take this class. The assignments are well balanced between writing and presentation and the readings are engaging.",
    "This is an all-around strong course. Professor Panter-Brick is not only a caring professor, but she is knowledgeable and eloquent. She is skilled at guiding discussions, she organizes the seminar so that students can stay attentive and interested, but so that the topic and conversation remain focused. She is able to create a comfortable and welcoming environment in which students are able to sincerely engage with the readings and debate with one another. The guests she invited to join the class were intelligent and thoughtful, and the perspectives they brought gave students an understanding of what humanitarianism can look like at various levels and to different people. The readings were always well-picked; I often found myself reading more than the required amount and taking careful notes because the information shared were really facts and stories that I wanted to know. The assignments taught us skills of analyzing a text and succinctly summarizing it, making connections between texts, and drawing our own conclusions. The feedback we received highlighted both our strengths and also areas that could be improved upon or that were not clearly supported. I can identify no weakness with this course."

   "comments": [
    "If you're at all interested in humanitarian intervention, whether it's policy or being on the ground, I recommend this class. It really gives you a new view of humanitarianism and its flaws, but still gives you hope for its future. The readings are mostly all interesting and you can learn something from all of them. There's never a point where the course gets repetitive, even though the topics all relate to each other.",
    "Yes! A must for anybody entering any humanitarian or health-care or foreign policy related field!",
    "Yes, especially if you'd like to enter the humanitarian sector.",
    "Yes, not too much work but eye-opening and fascinating if you care about humanitarianism",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! If humanitarian work\/global health work\/ global affairs is of interest to you, it's great!",
    "If you're looking for a theoretically grounded course focused on humanitarian interventions, I would rather recommend a sociology or anthropology course. However, if you're interested in humanitarian interventions and potentially considering participating in humanitarian response in the future, this course is perfect. The course does an incredible job of highlighting the daily experience of humanitarians on the grounds of the crisis as well as the various factors that are considered in interventions, both the big picture from a high-up level and the individualized perspective of aid workers and recipients of aid.",
    "Yes.",
    "100% yes",
    "Yes. Firstly, the course is well-designed for student learning and isn't unreasonably difficult. The bulk of the grade consists of short papers, and unlike many other writing courses at Yale, you aren't limited to a set number of attempts. You're required to submit 3, but you can write more, which offers a great opportunity for feedback from CPB. Secondly, it's well-designed to accommodate not only students who have preexisting interests\/background in humanitarian work but also those who might not (and are looking to explore the field). The class lays out key principles\/concepts in humanitarian affairs before diving into case studies and major debates. This makes it easier for students to participate in class because they'll have a common ground of foundational knowledge to work with, rather than starting without basic principles. This all being said, you'll definitely get more out of this class if you devote more than the minimal time to this class (e.g. writing more than the 3 papers); there is quite a lot to explore within the class material but it is up to you to make the effort on your own.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Very wonderful professor and incredibly meaningful course content. Really pushed my critical thinking and understanding of humanitarianism. Profoundly changed the way I think about systems of aid.",
    "Highly recommend - opened my eyes to a lot that goes on in the crisis-affected parts of the world, and has opened doors for me to learn more about it on my own. I loved even doing the assignments because the material was so interesting, and the debates that exist in this field are very challenging and nuanced - there is so much to learn and it was great to be encouraged to have our own opinions even in our very limited knowledge from the weekly readings. Professor Panter-Brick is incredible and made the class so meaningful - we were encouraged to dig deeper and deeper into the issues and really wrestle with the tensions that exist in differing opinions and case studies. I loved this class, and want to find a way to engage with the field in my career as an engineer, seeing that there is so much room for improvement and impact in humanitarian work.",
    "100% you should take this class. One of my favorites at Yale!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot in an environment where student opinions and ideas were valued and celebrated.",
    "If you are interested in humanitarian work or human rights work, please consider this course. I have never encountered a seminar in which I felt so comfortable participating and in which all the students were so passionate about the topic and had their own unique perspectives to share with the class. Professor Panter-Brick is an incredible teacher who conducts valuable and interesting research. The guests who visit are fantastic and really care to share their expertise with the students. The assignments are reasonable regarding work load and really do help you to engage with the readings, which are also excellently curated. I cannot give this course a higher recommendation."
