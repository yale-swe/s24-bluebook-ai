                "Strengths: the feedback on essay drafts and ideas is really good; combined with the instructor sign-ups Prof Ranks hosts after each draft submission, you know exactly where to improve.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the professor sometimes fishes for answers during class discussions. Discussion also lagged at times a lot in class, but I feel like that may be a result of moreso the student composition in the class and interest in the specific topic talked about in class than any reflection on the professor. The big thing for me though would probably be that it takes an extremely long time for the professor to grade our papers (for example, I submitted my final paper (i.e. the fourth paper of the course) before I even got my second paper's grade back).",
                "I really enjoyed this class. It was challenging but doable, and I truly felt like a learned a lot.",
                "Strengths: the discussion posts which helped guide the day's lecture\/discussion points, breakout rooms, and seminar style format\r\n\r\nCons: getting paper back took a very long time... I only received my first paper back before the semester ended and we wrote 4 papers",
                "I think it was good to start off with more dense texts and then gradually move to ones with more modern language and clear arguments.  It helped build the close reading and critical thinking skills early on so that later I felt like I could see deeper points within the more modern books\/stories.  A weakness would just be getting feedback on essays.  It's always hard to know how to improve without feedback from previously written essays.  However, feedback on drafts was always very helpful while also being kind which is hard for a lot of people to do, so I appreciated that.",
                "Some strengths are that Prof. Ranks was super engaging and clearly passionate about the subject, and the choice of readings. Class discussions were also generally quite fun, as well as the breakout rooms. It might be improved by having more timely grading for the four essays, as we only had one essay graded by the end of the term, and therefore did not have a good idea of our grades throughout the semester.",
                "The reading materials were fantastic and prompted very solid discussions, yet the course may have been too focused specifically on truth and power. The writing, as a result, was somewhat limited."

I felt that I was able to connect with my classmates even though the course was completely online.",
