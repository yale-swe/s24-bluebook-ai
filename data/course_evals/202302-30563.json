                "A lot of content in what is simply not enough time. I know the goal is to complete it over the summer, but maybe drop the culture course? 130+148 is a lot, especially right off the bat.",
                "I think there could be less projects because a lot of the time it felt like busywork. I think speaking in class was helpful.",
                "The strengths is being completely immersed in Spanish. As a summer joint-course program, every class is in Spanish, allowing you to put all your focus on learning the language. The weakness is the often monotonous structure of the course. It is definitely intensive.",
                "It was a great review of L1 and L2 that dove deeper and expanded further.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- it was nice having two different professors\r\n- I learned a lot in a short amount of time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- lots of random activities that took up a lot of time but had no relevance to grammar lessons or future projects\/exams that we had. I'd rather we had that time to study for exams, work on graded projects, talk about\/practice grammar, etc.\r\n- There was a slight discrepancy in consistency and continuity between the two professors' teaching\r\n- Sometimes some activities take longer than expected, but instead of shifting the requirements and expectations, we are still expected to complete everything that was originally planned, and that takes away from the quality of our work and learning. More flexibility and prioritization is needed. When plans change, the important (graded) work and lessons should be prioritized. If the first activity of the day takes longer than expected, the following activities should be modified to firstly include the most important elements, and if time allows, then the original expectations can be added.",
                "Strengths: You definitely are forced to get a better sense of the Spanish language.\r\nWeakness: I definitely do not recommend taking this course over the summer because you learn a lot of information in a short time which can make it difficult actually learning the content. Also, the class is very rigorous as students are expected to attend class at 9 am for 3.5 hours every week day and be at full levels of alertness every single day as your participation grade is evaluated harshly. Also, students are expected to complete assessment tests and projects on the same day which makes studying difficult and preparation for projects hard as you often only have one day to complete them.",
                "Strengths: This course is a great review of basic Spanish grammar concepts for students who have studied Spanish before and are hoping to strengthen their foundational grammar skills in the language. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course can feel very repetitive in its material since most students have already learned the content in an introductory Spanish course. Since this course is a month long, there should only be 2 projects assigned, rather than 3, so that students are not overwhelmed with extra out of class time work on top of homework and test preparation. The 2 exams are weighted so heavily that if you do not do well on one, your grade can drop significantly. The teaching staff (Maria Vazquez and Sebastian Daz) did not explain the material well, so I found it more helpful to learn from Supersite than them.",
                "I thought the course was effective, and I enjoyed the the VHL supersite and assignments. However, I thought the tests were often difficult to prepare for, and that the practice materials could be misleading or incorrect. I think a better system for exam preparation would have improved the class. I also did not like that the exams were at the end of class."

                "I would not, mainly because of the instructor which I explain further below. It is also just very overwhelming during summer and having this course follow the same attendance\/tardiness policies as YSS doesn't make sense. Most YSS courses are twice a week for five weeks, and under such circumstances the zero absence policy is entirely fair. However, when a course meets 5 days a week for 3 1\/2 hours (and often the professor does not give the allotted 15-minute breaks), this policy adds an unnecessary level of stress and exhaustion.",
                "If it is a requirement I say it is doable, and if someone would like to improve their spanish. But a lot of it is teaching yourself and you need to be prepared to put a lot of independent study in.",
                "Yes, because of the rest of the study abroad experience.",
                "Yes, if they are looking to fulfill their language requirement, but no, if they are taking it for fun\/for the study abroad experience. The course was very intensive, but in some ways, the organizational structure did not help facilitate learning and took away from the experience. The main instruction was not from our instructors in person but from the videos we watched for homework.\r\n\r\nOverall, this program is good, but more prioritization and flexibility is needed. We understand that the program is intensive, and we like that we learned a lot in such a short period of time, but there are many activities that took up a lot of time that did not contribute to neither the intensity of the program nor to our learning experience. Those activities either need to be removed or the time we spend on them need to be reduced. I do not believe the intensity of the program would change if those activities were removed. In fact, I think spending that time to produce higher quality graded projects, reviewing and understanding grammar concepts, spending time practicing speaking\/writing\/reading, or learning more about cultural topics would contribute to the intensity of the program. Prioritization and flexibility apply to the excursions, museums, and tours as well.",
                "I would not recommend completing Span S130 because learning a language is a difficult thing that I believe takes time and practice which this course does not allow. Students are rushed to digest large amounts of information with little time alone with the material and topics are taught very quickly so if you fall behind there is little chance to catch up. If you really want to improve your Spanish I do not believe this course provides you the time to do that and the methods of teaching does not give students effective ways to learn as it heavily relies on Supersite to teach the material.",
                "I would not recommend taking this course as a part of a study abroad program. The workload is simply too great for such a short program.",
                "I would not because they would have to take this course in tandem with the L4 Spanish summer course.",
