   "comments": [
    "The knowledge that I have developed in this course is not limited to the philosophers and their theories that I came to know, but also includes the critical thinking skills. I learned to examine the arguments of my own by finding the objections and discard the view that I previously held.",
    "I have learned so much about philosophy, and I think it is really cool that I now know the basic knowledge to further study it. I have learned how to write a philosophy paper, which is more logically challenging than other papers, and I have also learned how to study the text of philosophers.",
    "By taking this course, I've made my first dive into the subject of Philosophy. Professor Franks and his TA Juan revealed to me what I intellectually took for granted before taking the course. Moreover, I developed the skill of discerning the construction of arguments and the skill of philosophical writing.",
    "The ways of arguments",
    "The ability to analyze the events in my life.\r\nThe awareness that I should find out the meaning of life.",
    "Writing skills, basic philosophical knowledge, and critical thinking skills.",
    "Formed much of my view on the question: 'what do I truly know'. I learned how to perform well in a college course and write a philosophy paper.",
    "The most important thing is that I learnt to retrospect my life. And realize the importance of examining my life.",
    "a new philosophical perspective in viewing this world. Learning how different philosophers argue about different situations in life is extremely interesting.",
    "I learned not to accept everything we were told as granted, we should be sceptic to things in the world, and that should be what thinking really is.",
    "Knowledge about philosophers.",
    "I learned a lot about how differently philosophers have addressed important issues, especially belief formation, the existence or nonexistence of God, how we should behave, and what philosophy can or can't do. I was able to challenge some of my own assumptions, such as that our own desires should never influence our factual beliefs, as well as seeing others' assumptions challenged. I also learned about some philosophical debates I had known very little about before, such as the question of whether machines think. With these questions especially, I developed new points of view I never could have on my own. Furthermore, I learned a lot about philosophical writing, both from the philosophers we read and from the essays and reading responses we wrote; I understand much better now how important it is to be clear, and how sometimes this means saying the same thing twice in different words, since two people may not take the same meaning from one philosophical statement. I also developed my ability to participate more in class discussions.",
    "I learnt a lot about philosophy.",
    "I think it was the sharp analytic skills I developed. As I took another humanities class in comparison, I found out philosophy has a higher demand on the rigor, precision, and clarity of thinking, and the professor together with the teaching assistant were very responsible and dedicated to helping me develop this mode of thought. They also encouraged creativity and active participation in discussions, which I thought were very helpful in my future pursuit of academics.",
    "1. Basic knowledge about philosophy, especially Western philosophy;\r\n2. A very holistic view of different ideas of different philosophers about some philosophical topics;\r\n3. Deeper view about what philosophy really is.",
    "The long history of philosophy with the various topics like morality, happiness, and piety."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provided very classical and modern original texts of ancient and modern philosophers. The quality of materials provided are excellent although somewhat challenging for me to read. The discussion form of leading the class is quite inspiring to develop new ideas while it seems less organized since this is no summary to the discussion.",
    "I like that it covered a little bit of everything, and we went through a bunch of different philosophers that hold different views, However, I wish we had more time to go more in depth about some of the theories.",
    "I believe that for this summer session course, the large capacity of students taking the class limited the professor's ability to give us detailed feedback. Perhaps next time a smaller class would help with comfort and the students' ability to engage each other in discussion.\r\n\r\nOne strength of the class was the handouts that Professor Franks prepared for us for every class. They detailed the course of the lecture and they were very helpful in understanding the material.",
    "Too many fluff readings and class discussions that weren't moderated and irrelevant to course topics.",
    "Making simple concepts sound hard. Completing a crash course Philosophy helped me understand more.",
    "Strength: Responsible professors, interesting texts\r\nWeakness: The class discussion is somehow not efficient enough, I would recommend that the class should be more focused on certain topics in discussion",
    "The course is great.",
    "It's easy to get lost because we had a big class\r\nSome of the topics were very dry\r\n\r\nVery interesting ideas that we discussed",
    "I am a bad paper writer. I usually fail to be careful enough when building up my arguement. But I feel like sometimes I can have some good thinkings.",
    "Why this course is lecture-based, the assignments are essays. It would be much better if we have the chance to get the chance to revise our papers.",
    "It is really helpful to provide notes to help us pick up the central idea suggested by different philosophers.",
    "Strengths: Great teachers, the content of the course is really interesting for those who are truly interested in philosophy (not just the critical thinking skills that learning philosophy offers), the class discussions allow students to share their thoughts freely and they are crucial to let students learn about the nature of what philosophers do.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class is too big that not everyone gets to fully express themselves in class.",
    "I felt good when the topics of the class matched my interest. However, the difficult part was when the sophisticated text came to read.",
    "The readings were varied in difficulty, which was good, and they also formed a very interesting dialogue. I liked that we would often read excerpts and articles with theses that directly conflicted with one another, since this forced us not just to agree with the authors but to evaluate why one point of view might be better, why another might have overlooked something important or made a problematic assumption, etc. I also appreciated the combination of lecture and discussion. I liked that the professor would give us some background information about the readings (but not too much, which would have distracted from the philosophical questions themselves) and then explain the larger framework of concepts that distinguished one philosopher's position from another's, even though this framework was often not mentioned in the actual articles. For example, it was very useful to define explicitly the difference between ethics and morality, even though the philosophers we read had not done this, because they were relying on that distinction in their writing. It might have been good to have even more discussion, though, so that students could get even more feedback from each other and from the instructor on the development of their own views. \r\n\r\nI also thought the writing prompts were very good at getting to the most important philosophical issues. I liked that we had multiple options for what to focus on in writing our reading responses, and I think that maybe it would be a good idea for the essay prompts to provide more options as well. I think it would have been helpful to receive more specific comments on our writing from the professor.",
    "no . this course is so great",
    "Currently I think the course is already in a great situation. The professor did much for us to make our learning more effective and convenient. He sent out the course materials to us and reminded us to read them before class very early before the session started, and he offered us handouts and brief explanations of the materials in class so we can have a accurate and organized view of the materials. I found the handout particularly helpful because usually discussion-based classes are easily disorganized because the discussions are free and creative, often jumping from one point to the other. However, a handout marking the main points of discussions helps to keep the pace greatly. I think the only point that can be improved in this course is the limit of the number of students. I think the experience would be even better if there are less students in a discussion-based class like this.",
    "Strengths:\r\n1. Involves many different topics including metaphysics, epistemology and so on;\r\n2. Provides holistic view of different opinions on this topics.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. Maybe the course shouldn't be limited by only Western philosophy, it can also introduce some other kind of philosophy.",
    "The way of professor taught is interesting and professional, easily attracting students to involve in the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, for anyone who is interested in philosophy, this is a great course for them to get a sense of what philosophy is, and learn the basics.",
    "Yes I would. Philosophy poses many questions that we have to wrestle with. There is a lot about the self and knowledge that we do not fully understand and Philosophy helps bring us closer to discovering ourselves.",
    "No, at least not with Professor Franks. Too many readings that weren't even discussed in class and felt like \"fluff\" were assigned. he didn't give feedback at all on assignments. He allowed the TA to teach most of the class and the TA did a poor job as well. Overall, this class seems to function like an in class experience structured like an online class. Professor Franks was inaccessible and his lectures were too foggy at times. While his knowledge about philosophy is deep and remains unquestionably true, I'm unsure about his ability to teach philosophy. I wouldn't recommend this class to another student unless you want a lot of readings, little understanding of them, and class lectures that aren't interactive or accommodating to \"intro\" learners.",
    "No.",
    "Yes. To students truly interested in philosophy, this class is a platform for the clash of minds.",
    "This course is beneficial for those who want to start leaning philosophy.",
    "Yes. The professors are nice and patient. And they introduce philosophy in an extraordinary way.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, this is a good course for students to have a first touch on philosophy, it really gives you a big picture of what philosophy is like, and what aspects we could explore in the philosophy field. Although sometimes we may feel quite lost in the world of philosophy, this is probably the pain we have to pain in order to gain the ability to really think in a critical way.",
    "Yes, I totally would. I think this course is a very thorough introduction of the philosophy world for students that are interested in this area. The course reaches to a variety of philosophical question from many different periods of time and appeal to all students. In addition to philosophical problems, the mindset that philosophers advocate is also a really good thing for students to learn: the spirit of continuous examination.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who know they are interested in philosophy, but have not already taken many philosophy classes. Since doing the readings carefully is a big time commitment, anyone who takes the course should be at least somewhat interested already, even if not very knowledgeable yet. But I thought that it was also a very good way to learn a little about several different branches of philosophy, which could provide students with useful insight about what interests them most.",
    "yes. because this course is very interesting.",
    "Absolutely. First of all the professor is extremely responsible and caring for the students. He and the teaching assistant offered us individual instructions in various office hours and very detailed feedbacks on the works we did. Second he and the teaching assistant cultivated a very active, intellectually creative, and also friendly class atmosphere which makes us feel comfortable to share and examine our views. Lastly, they are very accessible both as great teachers but also as mentors. When we talked to them about questions concerning life and the real world, they were both very willing to offer their opinions and advice. In general this is a very illuminating and rewarding learning experience.",
    "Yes, since it's very helpful and informative for someone who hopes to study philosophy but never have a chance to be guided in a holistic view.",
    "Yes, definitely! \r\nThe course is academic with many valuable discussions. Besides, its provide us with a general but detailed overview of philosophy."
