I've leveraged this knowledge to think about the world in new ways, which is perhaps the most valuable element that a student can take away from a course.",
                "This course served as an excellent introduction to sociological theory. Additionally, this course improved my analytical skills when it comes to reading academic papers. For the first half of the semester, SOCY 202 gave me knowledge of analyzing and understanding sociological theory. The second part of the course provided insight into applying these sociological theories to concepts such as romantic culture on campus and inequality in education. The application aspect of this course led me to develop new perspective on aspects of modern society. I felt I left the course with a new lens to view the world. Overall, the course served as a good introduction to sociology and how it can be applied in the field."

                "Strengths: TA provided excellent feedback. Mixture of grad students and undergraduate students facilitated learning. Leminar style was good.",

                "I think the class is great as is!",
                "Strengths: the professor was very kind, understanding, and knowledgeable; the content was very interesting; the professor made the class engaging through intellectually rich class discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the readings were long and convoluted, but that's to be expected; thankfully, we broke the material down in class.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course included the diversity of the topics covered. I felt that our journey through different topics (from emotion to political populism) provided an overview of the many different ways that sociology can be applied. I also think that the discussion aspect of this class was a strength. I initially thought this class would follow more of a lecture format but we ended up embracing discussion. As such, I felt I learned a lot from hearing my peers contribute. I frequently felt we engaged with the sociologists best when different members of the class would provide their critiques.  \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was that all classes felt relatively similar. We had many good and insightful discussions but it sometimes felt a little routine to read an academic paper for homework and then summarize and discuss that academic paper in class. I really enjoyed the classes where we incorporated other activities into our discussion, such as concept mapping or talking in small groups, and I think it would be effective to have more of this diversity. I also think that spacing out assignments differently would be a way to improve this course. We had some inspiring creative assignments at the end of the semester but I think it would have been effective to have included more assessments earlier in the course so the assignments were spaced more evenly."

                "Yes! Definitely take this course. All around the board, this course was amazing. Sociology is inherently fascinating, but coupled with an excellent professor, this course is a must-take.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course provides a great introduction to sociology, for both sociology majors and non-majors alike. The path of the curriculum from theory to application leads students to develop a broader understanding of sociology. The course also provides a unique opportunity to discuss personal stories and current topics through an academic lens. I enjoyed our discussions on how sociological ideas related to our own experiences and appreciated the time spent learning sociological concepts that related to current ideas."
