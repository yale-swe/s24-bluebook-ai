Rigorous analysis of Lazarillo del Torres and Spanish films. And, of course, detailed instruction in Spanish.",

                "strengths: the course provides such a variety of topics that will keep the class interesting. Profe Jones is the sweetest professor I've had at Yale. A gem!! \r\nweaknesses: too many people in the seminar so the same ones would speak.",
                "most of the readings were in english and I was expecting a L5 spanish course. It would be very interesting as a history seminar, just not as a language credit",
                "Strengths - seminar style made it nice to discuss class topics. Question-style conversation allowed me to come up with answers for the future. Video and movie/documentary clips great in bringing a first-person experience to The Spanish Inquisition. As well, the material being interweaved in both Spanish and English (for more complex works that were only ever discussed in an English framework) was incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- the syllabus could have been more clear. Sometimes it was incredibly difficult to parse what we should be reading for a given day. As well, more clarity in making the assignments would be appreciated -- I had to search through the Canvas archives to find an old version of what we were supposed to be doing with the final project, for example.",
                "I think that it was a good class. Being a seminar, you could really choose your level of engagement. It is essentially an open mic.",
                "This was basically a fake class. We had three assignments the whole semester: a take home midterm, and two short papers that were due the very last day of classes. None of the students ever did the reading, including me. We missed 6 of the 24 scheduled class periods. \r\n\r\nStrengths: this was a great way for me to fulfill my language requirement without having to do any work\r\nWeaknesses: none of us learned anything\r\nHow it could be improved: honestly not sure this class is salvageable",
                "I wish that classes had been a bit more organized and regular, and that there had been more opportunities to receive feedback and practice my Spanish language skills. However, the subject material was fascinating, and Professor Jones was a compelling lecturer and discussion leader.",
                "The course was great! It was enjoyable especially because the style was usually open dialogue. It could perhaps benefit from other kinds of activities to do during class.",
                "A strength of this course was the fact it was a seminar and that we were were able to practice speaking Spanish. A weakness was that the class was quite disorganized. It was never clear which readings we were supposed to do for each class, and even when the TA helped organize them later on in the semester, it was still confusing because it felt the class discussions weren't always about the reading. We also never received our midterm back with comments, just a grade. That was the only feedback we got for the entire course on how we were doing.",
                "Strengths: great readings, professor is very kind and understanding, there is a lot of flexibility on the final project and what you want to research.\r\nWeaknesses: I hoped discussions were more structured and that the professor was more transparent about the direction of the course and why we were moving from one topic to another.",

                "Yes. It's a nicely taught course and is an interesting angle to finish Spanish at Yale (L5). As a Catholic too, it provided a fascinating look into how the faith was used to justify societal norms in Medieval Spain.",
                "Yes of course. Professor Jones is very kind and always available for extra talks in the form of office hours.",

We spent a lot of time covering that topic. While that topic is interesting, I had hoped for a more well-rounded view that took into account other parts of the Inquisition. The class was quite disorganized and you had no idea how you were doing.",
