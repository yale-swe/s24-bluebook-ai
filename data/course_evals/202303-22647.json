                "I learned different statistical concepts such as probability distributions, moments, Central Limit Theorem, Law of Large Numbers, Markov Chains, Monte Carlo, covariance, correlation, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and applied them to scientific and financial concepts, including the Boltzmann distribution, percolation, Langevin dynamics, options, and portfolio risk. This course sharpens many of these statistical concepts that people likely have encountered before taking the class, and applies them to fascinating concepts in other disciplines. We also learned how to code models related to these concepts in the languages of our choosing, though Prof. Sohrab uses Matlab for in-class demonstrations and provides Matlab files, so Matlab knowledge will provide you an upper hand for coding exercises, though these coding assignments can be done in any language and are much more interesting and fun rather than tedious and draining. There are also many handwritten, mathematical exercises as well.",

This is the ultimate applied math class; students emerge with a well-rounded background in a wide variety of statistical topics whose applications range from physics to chemistry to engineering to machine learning to finance. Its a spectacular course."

            "comments": [
                "I will start with weaknesses, only because there were very few if any at all. The only issue I might have is that I would have appreciated practice problems for the second exam, but the types of questions on these exams are difficult to create, so it is understandable. The other thing is this class is very \"on-its-own\" in both the APHY and ECON departments, and it really is difficult to gauge the level where it falls in relation to not only those departments but also the S&DS department as well. For many students, the concepts covered in the first 40% of the course were familiar, so many students did not necessarily learn any new concepts, but the problem sets allowed us to use these familiar concepts in different settings as we solved problems that applied to scientific\/financial concepts and\/or used them in programming demonstrations, which few of us had done previously, so even this minor \"weakness\" already has its remedy. If I were to give a suggestion on prerequisites, I think in addition to the listed prerequisites of differential equations and computational linear algebra, a student would benefit from taking S&DS 238 or S&DS 241 concurrently\/before taking this class, though that knowledge is what makes many of the statistical concepts much easier to understand and is not required.\r\n\r\nOnto the strengths, I would first like to note that although it is very long, this course's name is the perfect description of what it covers. Nothing is misleading about the course's syllabus, prerequisites, etc., and Prof Sohrab follows his stated curriculum and philosophies very closely and honestly. This class allowed us to apply statistical concepts in much broader contexts and unlocked much more creative thinking than a large majority of courses I've taken at Yale, and this is largely attributed to the professor's organization of the class and his goal of wanting to make everybody think and ponder rather than plug-and-chug. Sohrab is very funny and keeps lectures interesting while still covering concepts in great depth in class and our homework, and he is very genuine in his goal for us to learn in this class above everything else. This is a beautifully organized and accessible course to anyone with the prerequisite math knowledge, which most students studying a quantitative major (Physics, Econ, Math, S&DS, CS, Chem, and many more!) will have likely in their first two years. I hope this class can be offered more often in the future as well! It would be great to offer this once a year rather than every 3-4 semesters.",
                "Funny, engaging, and instructive professor. Sometimes it is a bit computation\/coding heavy, but that is the nature of the subject.",
                "I really enjoyed this class! The programming exercises were really interesting and not tedious at all (maybe 4 hours\/wk on average). The course provided a really good intuition for the various statistical methods presented, even if you have already been exposed to them before, and has a number of cool applications in physics and finance.",
                "Strengths: lectures are excellent, psets reinforce learning. Essentially just a really well-run class with a great professor. Weaknesses: perhaps spend a bit less time on the beginning intro probability stuff, pretty sure everyone knows that. maybe just jump straight to the CLT and add more fun material in other places. personally would have liked to see more done with brownian motion and such",
                "Sohrab is a really good instructor",
                "Just about everything in this course is a strength. Professor Ismail-Beigi is the biggest asset to the course. Problem sets offer a perfect balance between mathematical derivations and coding applications; the exams are fair and test mathematical intuition rather than the ability to devise clever proofs on the spot or perform rote arithmetic. I particularly appreciated that problem sets simultaneously provided direction about how to approach a problem, but also allowed us significant freedom in our approach (we could use whatever coding packages we wanted  and even whatever coding language we wanted.) This allowed me to develop my own approaches to problems and feel like I was creating my answers by myself from scratch, rather than working from a code template given by the professor while trying to fill in the blanks of their framework. This process is much more analogous to real-world research or professional work where there is no template and you have all the freedom in the world to solve problems in whatever way you think is best."

                "Again, I would absolutely recommend this course, especially under the instruction of Sohrab. As previously mentioned, this course facilitates engaged, thoughtful, creative learning that is not observed in many quantitative\/STEM courses, is accessible to students across many departments, and applies to many different disciplines! As long as you have the prerequisite math knowledge, this class will not have any outlandish, unfair conceptual difficulty, but rather challenges you on your applications of the concepts.",
                "I strongly recommend if you have any chance of a future in finance, quantitative finance, or statistical physics.",
                "Absolutely. This class is a hidden gem, especially if you want to learn statistical methods without actually taking a stats class.",
                "Yes! It's a great way to learn and apply statistics and modeling methods. Personally, it helped a bunch with quant research interviews. It's great that Yale offers some classes like this which are extremely practical to industry.",
                "Yes although the class is generally stacked with extremely smart and motivated STEM students so unless you're also a really really sharp student it may be difficult to do well in the class. Sohrab is a good teacher and the content is interesting and the course is well designed, but the grading is very vague so it's difficult to know how you'll fare.",
                "Definitely. APHY 470 is one of the very best courses Ive taken during my 2.5 years at Yale. This is the ultimate applied math class; students emerge with a well-rounded background in a wide variety of statistical topics whose applications range from physics to chemistry to engineering to machine learning to finance. This course should be offered more frequently; I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to take it."
