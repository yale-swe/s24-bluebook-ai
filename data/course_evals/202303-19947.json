I really enjoyed our seminar time, and I am thankful to have learned how to thoughtfully listen to my peers and have productive conversation about writing. I also learned a lot about how to go about revising an essay.",
                "I wrote a variety of essays, including close-reading analysis, argument-based writing, and a research paper. I learned how to better organize my writing and the importance of supporting my claim throughout my entire essay. I also learned many strategies for drafting and revising my papers.",
                "Better writing, better at discussing things, better at close reading",
                "An understanding  of different models of and approaches to childhood and how certain writers have explored and depicted childhood, the ability to reflect on own childhood and how you portray it. The class also fostered a love of writing through seeing it as a tool for self exploration."

                "I think the textbooks were a little unnecessary. I also wish we spent more time on children's literature itself, rather than reading analyses of children's psychology.",
                "Strengths: Carol Morse is a fabulous professor. She cares very deeply for students and ensures that we have time to work with her. She especially encourages us working alongside each other. \r\nWeaknesses: There were some readings that I was not as interested in, but I still think it was important for me to learn about them and consider what implications they had for childhood and growing up. I would not consider it a weakness, but it is something that I did not enjoy as much.",
                "There are so many strengths of this course! Professor Morse is such an amazing professor; she is very kind and encouraging and gives clear and thorough feedback. The prompts for the papers were often broad and flexible, so you are able to write about something that really interests you. I really liked that for many of the essays we were required to submit multiple drafts before the final paper was due so that Professor Morse could give us excellent feedback throughout our writing process, which really enabled us to improve. The topics were engaging and made for great class discussions. I cannot think of any weaknesses!",
                "I think some of the classes focused too much on talking about the essays we had to write as opposed to actually talking about ideas from the class material.",
                "Strengths: Prof Morse is an amazing teacher. The numerous drafts and workshops enable an ability to reflect on what works and what doesn't and to improve in following papers. The class discussions are engaging and the readings are great."

It was such an interesting topic, and it gave me so much room to explore my academic interests. She truly embraces fluidity and encourages her students to learn about what intrigues them.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Morse is excellent, and the class builds a great foundation for writing.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it. Chill workload, great professor.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you are interested in improving your writing, I would recommend the class. The workshops are helpful and Prof Morse always offers great feedback. The course allows students to explore their writing in a relatively stress free environment."
