                "The strengths were the handouts and the professor's level of effort. There are far too many weaknesses to identify. The pre-class videos were ineffective. In the videos, the instructor would cover basic definitions, and then end the video was mathematical theory that was irrelevant to what we were expected to learn. Every day in class (a math class), we wasted 30-40 minutes talking about politics, classroom aesthetics, or Tic-Tok videos. Lastly, one week before reading period, we had 6-week old quizzes that were upgraded.",

This was largely mitigated by the utilization of the Piazza platform, which allowed questions to be posted for a prompt response by peers, mentors, or the instructor themself. The combination of the two made online learning relatively easy, although without proper ability to use both or a lack of familiarity with it, would make the course difficult to navigate.",

The areas that can be improved are: (1) professor spending more time in the class solving problems rather than putting students in breakout rooms and asking them to solve problems (there was hardly any interaction between students after first few sessions) and (2) either no time limit or a more liberal time limit for quiz, since the objective is to master each content.",

It was great that the professor had a tablet to work through the problems in front of us. However, it was always difficult to present our own answers to the professor (since the problems were complex and hard to write out on a keyboard).
