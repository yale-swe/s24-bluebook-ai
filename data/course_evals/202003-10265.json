I really like when I come out of a class and I'm able to recognize a lot of the names of people we read from in other classes, which is definitely the case from this course. I was introduced to a lot of books that I would otherwise not have read and was taught a lot about how to understand what context a text is using. There was a lot of emphasis on how one idea connected to another and what elements of one movement impacted another.",
                "I gained a lot of insights on animal ethics and how animals view the world",
                "We discussed animal ethics and their uses both in and outside of literature. All in all, there was a lot of interpretation of the human through the lens of the animal. More than the established content, though, was the vocabulary I learned. It was not unusual for students to purposefully use complex terms to describe things or concepts even if there was a simpler way.",

                "This course could be described as an introduction to animal(it's) studies in a highly interdisciplinary. Readings ranged from cognitive science to political philosophy to western classics to post colonial literature. For me, the broad takeaways was gaining knowledge and insight on the question of consciousness, the moral and political status of animals, and how various narratives provide frame how we think about animals as beings with whom we are in relation.",
                "I learned a lot about the animal rights movement, both from the readings and from my fellow classmates. The discussion format made it easier for me to ask questions about details I did not understand. We covered topics like animal ethics and the animal conscience.",

                "I really liked this course a lot. I think sometimes the reading was a bit too much to really get to understand and spend time with everything we were assigned. It was definitely more than in my other four English classes, but it is also a junior seminar. \r\n\r\n(And this is nothing against this course, but I think that everyone knows there's way too much reading for most classes at Yale but for some reason no one really does anything about it :( Tbh it hurts my feelings and it's really overwhelming and people are always stressed about it so I wish that someone would care.)\r\n\r\nThat being said, Professor Kramnick was supportive of us and though there was too much reading to always get to everything, there was always one reading that we could discuss as a class and connect to the main ideas of the course.",
                "At first there was an overwhelming amount of reading but it was cut down to be a lot more manageable. I enjoyed the readings we did and the professor's summaries. I liked how open the essays were. I wish there was more debate and disagreement in section, though.",
                "For a course so concerned with animal ethics and the treatment of animals, the overall empathy level of the class felt extremely low. To be fair, I think much of that could have to do with the chaotic circumstances in which we find ourselves this semester, but even in other classes I've seen people show more concern and personal interest than in this one. There was occasionally racist or problematic writing in some of our readings common due to their age, but then it wouldn't be uncommon for that language to then be used within class discussion without much thought. Overall, the class didn't seem conducive to memorable conversations beyond the problematic or occasionally pretentious language.",
                "This class was wonderful!!!!! Sometimes reading load was high, but I think that is typical for an English class and I really enjoyed the thoughtful syllabus and lively discussions.",
                "I sometimes felt that essay prompts were not given early enough but otherwise the class was great",
                "One of the best, if not the best course I've taken at Yale. Professor Kramnick is a phenomenon. He is so prepared for every class (sends an email outlining discussion before each one). He is kind, thoughtful and teases out insights from every student's comments. I also really appreciated my classmates. We had students from many different backgrounds , each enriching our discussion in their own way.",
                "It was annoying how the class always ended 5 minutes late (12:55 instead of 12:50), which made it hard for me to prepare for my next class (1:00).",
                "I thought that the choice of readings was generally excellent, and gave us a lot of material to discuss, though maybe some more non-European sources would add more to the class. I also found the structure of the class to flow really well, both in terms of units and overall discussion."

The thing that I think could have helped was having a shorter class because by the end everyone's attention span was gone. I don't think it would be that way in person but over zoom it was hard to focus after an hour.",

We had a total of two five minute breaks the entire semester, but in those classes that we had breaks the class ended up going over time by ten minutes. Overall, it didn't feel very understanding or adaptive to the current circumstances.",

Theres a lot of reading, but the discussions and posts help to tie everything together and its perspectives you may have never seen before. Worth it.",
                "The daily check in was such a great idea, it really helped build community and a relaxed environment. I also thought Kramnick's idea of leaving our mics unmuted was great at making discussion more natural, although people gradually stopped adhering to this suggestion.",
                "I thought that generally the class on zoom worked really well. I really enjoyed when we had breakout rooms, so perhaps having more of those could help students get to know one another better and express their ideas more easily."

It often felt as if I was being talked at rather than with, and while conversations were back and forth, it still seemed more like a performance than actual understanding in some people's cases.",
