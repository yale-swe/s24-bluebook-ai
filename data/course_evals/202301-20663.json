                "I learned how to use the formal definitions of limits and derivatives to extend the notions to more abstract spaces than just R. This was the main take away. My ability to write proofs also greatly improved, as the proofs in this course were challenging.",

For example, while the topics covered in Analysis were definitely interesting (gaps in real numbers, \"larger\" infinity than other infinity, continuity, etc) they felt more abstract than complex inner product space.

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The ULA, Chris, was great at keeping us afloat with the concepts and homeworks.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class was not engaging or interesting at all. Often times, we were just presented with theorem after theorem without any pause for us to actually comprehend, nor was there any explanation to real world use. Instructor was a big liability.",
                "A strength of the course was the content. I thought the content was very interesting and it gave me a much better understanding of the tools from calculus that I had learned before. I am more well-versed in advanced mathematical proofs and this new branch of mathematics. A weakness of the course was the problem sets. They were often unreasonably difficult and long, which made it difficult to work through them. There is not much support through office hours as well, so the problem sets end up becoming a major source of your weekly workload.",
                "One main strength of this course is that students are involved in the work similarly to how mathematicians might work. The problems are very challenging and students must come up with their own original solutions. Additionally, student's work must build logically from the framework developed by the theorems introduced in class. Also, the sheer amount of time required by each problem set (in my case 30 hours per week) helps students build persistence and expand their perspective in order to find creative solutions.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is the extremely demanding nature of the problem sets. Having to spend 30 hours a week on math (or possibly less for certain students) removes a substantial amount of time that could be used for other courses. On the one hand, I do think it is beneficial to have the experience of wrestling with problems for extended periods of time. However, I think it may not be realistic to expect students to turn in their work every week on Thursday, which is the middle of the week and often when several other assignments are due. But, I did appreciate that Professor Smart gave numerous extensions and provided office hours to help students navigate this challenge.",
                "Strengths: Very challenging class that will make you feel more confidence in your ability to write analysis proofs.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures feel very much like a waste of time, since you only need to know the textbook to do well in the class and you typically have to re-read the textbook even if you attend lectures before you actually understand the material.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Classes where Smart talked about the intuitions behind things were especially helpful, as I'm not sure where else to get these insights (things like \"think of compactness like finiteness\" or visual proofs on the board of certain things)\r\n- When Rudin had messy examples/proofs, we learned cleaner ones\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- In the final week, few people (in my social circle) understood the material. Since this was not on the exam/homework, there was also little incentive to take the time to study it before classes. Maybe instead teach a less rigorous, more \"fun\" topic? Something about fractals, examples of weird series that explain why other notions of \"limit\" didn't catch on, etc.",
                "Lectures went a bit fast, hard to keep up and take notes and understand the content at the same time.",
                "The strength was the weekly problem sets, which greatly improved my understanding of the material and my problem-solving skills (although all the problems were from the textbook - Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis). One way it could have been improved is to line up the lectures better with the homework (there were many things on the homework that we did not cover in class and vice versa). I also felt many lectures were fast and hard-to-understand, and I had to read the textbook to understand the material.",
                "Strength: Definitely made me a better mathematician. Unlike Math 226, the Math 256 textbook (Baby Rudin) does not teach you the materials in an ordinary pedagogical approach; instead, Rudin expects you not just to understand him but to keep up with him, to not only follow but close the gap. Although daunting, it sets you up for higher math classes and self-discipline. The quote \"If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime\" summarizes this well. Even if the textbook is denser than Osmium, the lectures fill in the gaps in Baby Rudin. Weakness: I honestly think this class is more difficult than playing Moonlight Sonata 3rd Movement with one hand. Although the Psets were important in reinforcing the materials covered during class, I think it could have been toned down (like 5-8 problems per Pset instead of 10)."

                "I would only recommend this course to a student who is extremely interested in and well-versed in proof-based mathematics with a lighter workload for the semester. There is little reason to take this course unless you will be interested and dedicated to it throughout the semester due to the high workload. That being said, it is still a fulfilling experience and I feel that my skills in mathematics have improved as a result of taking this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student is considering a mathematics major and has extensive background or feels very comfortable with proofs. The course is extremely challenging, but putting in the time needed to understand and apply the content has significantly improved my mathematical skills.",
                "Yes, but only if you're majoring in math or a math-adjacent field and willing to spend 20-30 hours a week on problem sets. The workload of this class can be truly brutal sometimes, but you'll feel very accomplished at the end of the semester. Otherwise, just take Math 255, which teaches basically the same material (from what I've heard) but has problem sets that are half as long.",
                "If you want to learn analysis thoroughly, you should take this course. It was a lot of work and independent learning, but once you get to the end youll realize it was all worth it. The course is really hard though. Only take it if you are confident in your proof writing skills and have a lot of time on your hands.",
                "I enjoyed the course, but I think that I would warn anyone who asked me to instead take 255 rather than 256. The workload was very high (around 15 pages a week), and the extra material the 256 got to go through (sequences of functions) does not seem as widely applicable as the other topics in this course.\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested in pursuing a career in mathematics research, I'd tell them to solve problems 5-15 in Ch.1 of Rudin (the first 4 are not representative) and assess if they would want to do that amount of work every week.",
                "Only if you are a math major, and even then only if you are interested in the field of real analysis or have space in your schedule. The psets for this class take a long time.",
                "The class requires a lot of time to be spent on homework, and the homework problems (about 10 a week, all from the textbook) are very challenging. If one is okay with doing a lot of work on their own, then they should consider this course.",
