    "I gained a great insight into trans theory and histories, as well as being pushed to apply these logics in a creative way for my final project.",
    "This course completely changed the way I think about trans history and my place in it, as well as history and the archive in general. I think at some point in the semester my brain split open and then came back together different. It was wonderful.",
    "This class challenged students to engage with critical gender and queer theory when examining the art and histories of erased and oppressed peoples.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the history of gender variance and was exposed to a variety of theories of gender.",
    "A rigorous history of trans history and its intersecting disciplines!",
    "I learned a lot about interpretive ways of writing, thinking, & seeing, and elasticating rigid preconceptions of what \"trans studies\" entails"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: content, instructor's teaching abilities, guests brought to campus\r\nWeaknesses: seminar isn't very structured, which can be nice, but sometimes leads to a dead end",
    "I would say the readings and films were definitely a highlight, as well as being able to learn from Dr. Stryker, who is absolutely brilliant. While the reading load was sometimes a bit heavy, engaging with the readings was definitely worth it.",
    "Susan Stryker is brilliant. She was very understanding and asked challenging questions students sometimes couldn't answer. It was a great class.",
    "This course covers a lot of really interesting material, but a lighter reading load would have facilitated more lively discussion in class. More planned out structure for class time would also have encouraged participation.",
    "I think the reading was slightly to much. Or accountability to do the reading had to improve.",
    "Very strong reading list, though could have been shortened. More class discussion & open engagement encouraged by the prof would have been great to see. But incredible guidance"
