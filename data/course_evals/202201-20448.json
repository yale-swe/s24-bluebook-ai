That gave me confidence that I can continue developing such fluency. \r\n\r\nI also learned a lot content-wise from the theater, film, literature, environmental, and other aspects of the Spanish-speaking world we engaged.",

                "Strengths: the professor was amazing (more on that below), the content was interesting, and the course consistently required you to write, read, speak, and think in Spanish\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only thing to come to mind is that sometimes the assignments felt unnecessarily complex, even meta (e.g. giving a presentation primarily about what it was like for us to create a magazine cover for the presentation). With that, it sometimes felt like the arbitrary but quite specific requirements of the assignment actually inhibited me from diving into language learning. In those moments, it felt like content learning or even production was being prized more highly than language learning (which is why I was in the course)",
                "strengths: the course content was often quite interesting, particularly as the semester went on. We watched films and shorts that addressed topics like neocolonialism and bioethics that I haven't encountered too much in my other courses. There's a pretty consistent workload, so I was forced to practice on a near-daily basis.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the workload, while being consistent, is often quite high. There are sometimes multiple assignments due simultaneously, between all of the different moving parts of the course. While I think I got a lot out of the varied types of assignments (written paragraphs, group presentations, essays), it certainly could feel overwhelming at times. I'd recommend adding more oral assignments; while we do talk in class, I think my speaking skills would've improved some by replacing a few of the writing assignments with oral ones.",
                "Too many times a week it was exhausting. Give one day off a week",
                "I think that a weakness could be how much work was needed to be done prior to class. Often I would not be able to finish all of the work and was left with an ineffective class.",
                "No weaknesses. I enjoyed the projects.",
                "The cultural media was excellent. Class format (small groups, daily meetings) contributed significantly to content delivery. Course design should incorporate more mandatory oral participation, particularly listening.",
                "The assignments for this course were incredibly diverse, so you didn't get tired of the coursework.",
                "I don't believe there are any weaknesses of this course. Everyone is engaging everyday, which creates a good learning environment. I believe the strengths are in the assignments in which we are assigned. We utilize what we learn grammatically in the various culture assignments, so we are learning double.",
