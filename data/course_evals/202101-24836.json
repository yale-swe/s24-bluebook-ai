                "The course material is fascinating, but Professor Barbour himself is what made this course a highlight of my week. Professor Barbour is incredibly passionate about the issues discussed during class, is an engaging lecturer, has an incredible amount of personal experience in the field, and evidently cares a lot about his students and their learning experience. He shared plenty of anecdotes and went out of his way to make sure students understood all that was being taught (more than any other professor I've had at Yale). No weaknesses aside from the occasional confusion about what readings were to be done before the next class."

It should be noted that while this course uses R, it is not designed to teach students how to code (rather you simply copy/paste code). This made the coding parts of the course very accessible to students with no coding experience."
