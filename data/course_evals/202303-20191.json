                "I loved how accessible this class was, the zoom option and the free 48-hour grace period for problem sets were liesavers.",
                "Strengths: This course was flexible and Prof O. emphasized learning and grasping concepts more so than the technicalities. Weakness: There is a lot of content that sometimes you don't know what will be tested.",
                "Strength is that the exams are open note and the course content is interesting. Weakness is that there is a lot of material covered in each lecture and it can sometimes be overwhelming.",
                "The course is very intricate and extensive. I enjoyed the fun facts Professor O included throughout the lectures, it kept me interested and happy. At times, I do wish the problem sets related a little more to teaching material.",
                "Strengths: Homework load is low. Most of it is just performing unit conversions and reading graphs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are quite boring, and do not adequately prepare us for the midterm or final exams. Every point in this class corresponds to one percent of your grade, so missing even a few questions can have a substantial impact.",
                "Strengths: straightforward grading and the professor was incredibly attentive/supportive. Weaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: very informational and Prof. Oristaglio is an expert in the field. The PSets helped to reinforce things we learned in class and allowed us to explore relevant topics and add our own ideas.",
                "I thought the content was really easy to follow along, but found the lectures a little boring and the slides pretty repetitive.",
                "More interactive",
                "More engaging lectures",
                "It's a good class for non-science majors to be introduced to the discipline, however I did not find the material very engaging.",
                "Strengths included challenging, thought-provoking homework assignments and interesting course material. Weaknesses included tedious lectures and unhelpful teaching fellows.",
                "Strengths: The professor is passionate and excited to teach about fossil fuels and energy. He had the coolest pumpkin on Halloween! It is cool, relvamt content to a lot of things in the world right now.\r\nWeaknesses:  Weakness was that because the class was a little large for the room, the class got moved half on zoom. You could go in person, but once the zoom option was there for half the classes,  had trouble not using. It generally made me less engaged and I had trouble staying focused during zoom class. I wish the Psets were more regularly spaced throughout the semester instead of stacking up on the end.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is professor oristaglio. He is EXTREMELY knowledgeable about fossil fuels and has decades of experience in the industry. The biggest weakness is that it can sometimes feel disorganized. The course covers a wide range of topics and you may go from learning about economics to geology to chemistry in the same week.",
                "Strengths: knowledgable and kind instructor, interesting content. \r\nWeaknesses: low in-person attendance (there's a live Zoom option), so lectures can seem empty and boring.",
                "Strengths- gives u two weeks to do pset with 48 hr grace period. All lectures are recorded. All exams are open note and you can email which day you want to take them\r\n\r\nWeakness- Psets are a little lengthy",
                "The content is super relevant and very very engaging. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "The material from the P-Sets and Exams can be disconnected at times.",
                "Strengths are that Professor Oristaglio is a very engaging lecturer and clearly cares about the course. Weaknesses: The grading was at times unclear",
                "Strengths: a lot of content that isn't too hard\r\nWeaknesses: it's not so well organized",
                "You can tell Michael is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic, and his ability to answer questions is phenomenal. However, while teaching, he spent (I believe) too much time on statistics and data about fossil fuels and not enough time explaining the history or scientific concepts. I found the presentation of data (like percents of different fossil fuels use) to be repetitive and take too much time.",
                "Really interesting and important content but the plate tectonic stuff is tough and on the dry side",
                "Wish the psets were more engaging and involved more background research",
                "The problem sets are well designed to emphasize the learning from lectures.",
                "The lectures are a strength. Professor Oristaglio is clearly very knowledgable and makes the lectures interesting but simple enough to follow along.",
                "Really great material and coverage of fossil fuels. Professor was clear with what to expect and conveyed messages clearly.\r\n\r\nThe final exam was very difficult in terms of the expectation of a deeper understanding rather than a general overview of the material. It would be great if the class has more group discussion and reflection.",
                "I think having every class in person would've been better.",
                "Although the professor was extremely interesting, he was not always the most engaging.",
                "Strengths: Good, clear PowerPoints; few PSETs and assignments; in-person/online format so easy to adjust if you don't want to walk to the other end of the Earth\r\nWeaknesses: Can be kind of boring if you're not super into the subject; in-person/online format made it easy for me to disengage ; exams were lowkey a scramble to find information and were kind of confusing to me. In addition, all the office hours are held at basically the same hour every single day, which means if you have one obligation at the same time every day, you can't make any of them (not conducive to a student-athlete's schedule). I also would have appreciated if some office hours were closer to main campus.",
                "The course was really fair in its exams and in its PSETs! I think the professor could go more in depth on each topic, because it kinda felt like we stayed at a surface level the whole time, but to be fair there was a lot of content, and that could have hurt student performance.",
                "could do with more lenient grading on p sets",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, comprehensive in scope\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "He is lovely and well informed. Lots of information. Sometimes there are so many details its hard to absorb the overarching picture."

I am definitely more informed about the world and about fossil fuels and renewable energy as well as the politics and discourse surrounding it. If you are not interested in Earth science this class will be boring, but is informative.",
                "Yes, if you need a science credit. I feel that this was a much more interesting course than some of the other science credits, even if I had to work harder.",
                "I would. The class is very interesting and it pertains to an increasingly important issue of today. Professor O does an excellent job at providing insight on all sides of the argument.",
                "I do not recommend this course. Although the workload is low, the midterm and final exams are quite challenging and test us on material that was not explicitly covered in class. The lectures are boring (the professor skims through a slideshow), and do not clearly teach any concepts. Most of the homework is dull and involves performing unit conversions or graph reading. Every point in the class is worth a whole percent of your grade, so making even one mistake can be consequential. If you're looking for an easy science credit, there are probably better options than this one.",
                "Absolutely!!! Whether you need a SC credit or just want/need to take the class, it will be enjoyable. You learn a lot without too much stress or pressure.",
                "Generally, yes. It is interesting, has a very manageable workload, and genuinely teaches a lot about the topic. I think most people would benefit from the understanding they will gain in the class.",
                "This class felt a little too pro-fossil fuels at times, and also went a bit too deep into geology and ancient petroleum system formation, but overall I found the class interesting and useful.",

                "Yes! Good course and applicable knowledge",
                "No, I wouldn't. I think there was too much confusing material. We jumped from balancing chemical formulas to thermodynamics to tectonics and it was really hard to follow and tie the lectures together.",
                "Yes! It was very interesting!",
                "I would recommend this course not only to environmental studies or planetary science majors, but also students interested in political science and global affairs. About half of the class is structured around the serious science of fossil fuel creation and application as energy sources, but the other half is seriously policy-oriented and deals a lot with the nature of fossil fuel usage around the world as one of, if not the, top commodity on the global market.",
                "It was a good, take-on-able science for someone who doesn't know science. They introduced all concepts, and t was really good about not assuming knowledge that I didn't have. It was approachable but also delved into real topics. I wish it hadn't been half zoom and if it wasn't would have been easier to engage in.",
                "Yes. It will not take up much of your time and the lectures are interesting. If you want to learn a ton about fossil fuels then you will find this course interesting.",
                "I recommend it as a science credit. It wasn't that difficult and the content is interesting. Workload isn't nothing, and you will have to do the psets and study for the midterm and final, but it's a good class.",
                "Yes, especially if interested in Energy because you learn so much every single class.",
                "Yes. It gives a good overview of fossil fuel systems and the current state of world energy. Note that this course is very earth science heavy; you won't learn much about fossil fuel markets/policy/industry as whole. It's more about the earth science of petroleum and coal fields.",
                "It's good for a science credit.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It teaches you about an important and often under appreciated topic which is the world energy system.",
                "Not really... it was fine but i didn't like it all that much and it wasn't an easy A for a science credit like I was hoping.",
                "Yes, I will say it is a bit boring at times. Be prepared to hear a lot of statistics about fossil fuels. However, the material itself is very interesting and the Orestaglio is very knowledgeable if you ask questions. The option to do remote on some days was nice too.",
                "Good science credit on an important topic. Its not a gut to be honest  you have to study diligently for the tough exams, but good class overall.",

                "Great course for anyone interested in Energy and the professor is extremely knowledgeable.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are actually interested in the fossil fuels / earth science. The course is very well taught and organized, but it can definitely be a bit of a drag if you aren't actually that interested in the material at hand.",
                "Absolutely recommend to anyone studying energy, geology, chemistry, economics, or the environment!",
                "Definitely, interesting material that is a great break from other coursework",

                "Yes, if they want a low-workload class or 5th class. 6 PSETS, one midterm, and one final is a steal at Yale. If you put in the effort to go to office hours for the PSETS (make sure to find a good TA), you can get really good grades on the PSETS. Midterm and final are harder, but they are open-notes and open-internet.",
                "yes",
