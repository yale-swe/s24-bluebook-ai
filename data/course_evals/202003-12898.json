It often seemed excessive, and speaking with other students who took the class before it seems this may be due to the online situation, as it was not like this for them.",

The activities, both in-class and for homework, were very engaging and diverse. It should be noted that there is a lot of work though, and this made it difficult given the number of classes I took. It runs like an intensive Spanish course, so I would just recommend that anyone who takes it be ready for that.",
