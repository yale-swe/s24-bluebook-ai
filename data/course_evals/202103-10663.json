The broad range of authors we read allowed me to gain an understanding of how thinking in political philosophy has evolved over time, and the more modern readings/authors we read were really engaging.  Additionally, I learned how to read more efficiently in this class.\r\n\r\nI also greatly improved my writing skills through helpful feedback from my TF.",

We focused on consent and obligation, social contract theory, democracy, inequalities (wealth, class, race, sex), as well as numerous other topics that lay at the foundations of politics today.

                "The lecture slide format was very helpful and definitely the sections helped solidify concepts in the readings. However, the readings were too dense and long that it was impossible to read them all. Also, the lectures fell flat as there was no engagement from the students. It did not make a difference if you went to lecture or not.",
                "Strengths: the TFs are cool\r\nWeaknesses: boring",
                "Strengths: Readings covered a broad collection of topics, from classic philosophical texts by Plato and Aristotle to texts on twenty-first century socialism and climate change. Professor Oskian always opened the floor for discussion at some point during lecture, which I thought was nice. I also have yet to work on the final but think it looks very interesting; it is an opportunity to apply philosophical texts in a response to a choice of a few articles highlighting current political thought, and that seems like a great way to tie together the semester. I've heard that the final was different in the past, so I'd recommend keeping the format it's in now. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally didn't enjoy this class all that much because it taught me that I'm not a fan of philosophy, but the content was objectively interesting. I would encourage anyone considering this class to proceed with caution if they like organization and planning ahead, because this course had little of eitherreadings were often posted the night before lecture (or, once or twice, not at all) and due dates had to be clarified multiple times. \r\n\r\nAlso, lectures were pretty much just reviews of the readings, which can be a strength or a weakness depending on what you're looking for.",
                "I found the discussion section to be far more important for my learning than lecture. Lecture to me often seemed like too much of a regurgitation of readings, and they were (for me) often hard to follow, especially in the first half of the semester because Prof. Oskian was not in the U.S. and had to deliver the lectures via Zoom. Eventually, I ended up not going to lecture until she actually was able to lecture in person because I had such a difficult time understanding her. Once she was in person, lectures did become more helpful.",
                "I can only think of the weaknesses of this course. Lecture was not engaging or interesting. I left after each class feeling frustrated or discouraged.",
                "This class is not very well organized. Every project ended up being pushed back and the materials and prompts necessary to start were consistently made available fairly late. Additionally, it seemed like both Oskian the TAs were fairly disorganized when it came to grading. I had a single grade made available to me before the credit/d/fail deadline, which made it difficult to know how I was going to do in the course. I think the scope of the readings was a strength and they were mostly very interesting, but the quantity of reading for every class made it hard to show up to class prepared. The section added to the workload, as there were required reading responses that weren't listed in the syllabus. The course would be greatly improved if the papers had clear rubrics/expectations defined in advance. My TA expressed to me that they'd given similar notes on formatting and content to most of the papers they graded which makes me think that most people in the class would benefit from more clearly articulated expectations.",
                "I think that this course as well organized but definitely could be expanded during lecture beyond a summarization fo the reading material.",
                "Honesty at times the course is as just such an extensive survey that it was ridiculous. Obviously no one is going to read a 200 page text in 3 days, so that makes discussion sections and lecture engagement much less fruitful.",
                "The breadth was large, and the depth was not. The strengths are the papers that we write (writing non-intensive is recommended) and the sections; the weaknesses are the lectures (where many students are not as engaged as they should be) and the shallowness that we cover each philosopher with.",
                "Strengths: pretty low maintenance\r\nWeaknesses: unorganized, too many political philosophers, not clear on what is wanted on assignments, harsh and slow grading",
                "I appreciated the broad range of authors we read, and the focus on modern political philosophy during the second half of the semester -- this class was not all about the work of white men, which I really appreciated.  At the same time, the amount of content covered did not allow us to dive deeply into topics other than those we decided to write essays about -- this was a tradeoff, but I think par for the course for an intro class.  I now have a broad set of knowledge about different authors and their perspectives which I can use to guide my studies in the future.",
                "I think the strengths are in the sections and the lectures. I think the main weaknesses were the grading and the workload. It was very unclear how the first paper would be graded, and I only now know what they are expecting (I think). The workload of the readings was also pretty high, and if there was a bit less reading, there might be more engagement. Along this line, I feel like we barely got into a lot of the topics, and it felt like we were going through the coursework as fast as possible instead of really getting to understand and envelop ourselves in the content.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly interesting material that is well-summarized and taught.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very slow grading, not well-organized and run, poor communication. Also, there were times when some of the most important and interesting philosophers were lumped in too densely and there was barely any time to discuss them in section (e.g., Rousseau + Locke + Hobbes + others)",
                "Section was a strength of the class!",
                "Strengths: syllabus and course structure (good amount and timing of papers), the lecture slides were helpful, section was fun, I learned the fundamentals - which I really appreciate. Nate Hiatt was an excellent TF super smart, helpful, and chill.\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture could be boring and awkward, readings could be confusing",
                "The strengths of this course are its selection of philosophers. We covered the really important philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Hobbes, Locke etc) but then also more contemporary and diverse philosophers (Shklar, Douglass, Brennan, Pateman, Davis etc.). I was really impressed by the way philosophers were grouped together -- they themes were very helpful in categorizing their ideas.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course include the failure to turn around grades quickly -- I also wish the sections had been a little more structured or at lease the structure was consistent across sections.",
                "I wish the lectures were structured differently to analyze the papers more rather than just reviewing specific quotes from it",
                "Strength: seemingly interesting \r\nWeakness: course material was not interesting, TFs took almost two months to hand papers back, and discussion sections went over readings we had covered in lecture weeks ago.",
                "The course was incredibly unengaging, with lecture slides that were unhelpful, busy, and often confusing. Lectures were dangerously easy to stop paying attention to, and the overall organization/timeline of our topics felt strange.",
                "This course has lots of room for improvement. Some strengths are that the course covers a lot of ground in terms of authors, and there are lots of opportunities to participate in the course and share your own opinions. However, the course was horribly organized. 100-page readings were posted Sunday night for a Monday lecture if they were posted at all, which encouraged students to stop doing them entirely. The lecture slides were almost never posted, and the essay prompts came out weeks later than promised. We ended up having to write one paper over Thanksgiving break because the TFs were a month late getting prompts out. The prompts that did come out were all hyper-specific and didn't encourage must critical thinking, making essay writing for this class a trying experience. Moreover, there was next to no feedback on our writing, and I had no idea how I was doing in the course grade-wise until my final grade will be posted. Also, the lectures were all summaries of the reading, which made them uninteresting and not very engaging. Many students stopped coming to class entirely. Plus, the course tries to cover so many writers that it fails to do a deep dive into any of them. You come away knowing one or two things about each writer and that's it. Our class also had the unique experience of having the professor lecture to an in-person class through Zoom. While that wasn't too much of a problem, the TFs communicated very poorly with the professor and would let her stay on mute or be unintelligible for whole lectures which just wasn't conducive to a good class. To improve this course, there needs to be significantly better organization with posting material and better communication between the people running it.",
                "Strengths: The course went through a lot of great material, both classic and modern text; it usually broke down difficult theory into more easily understood concepts; the course exposed me to new concepts and made me challenged my preconceived notions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The slides sometimes had too much material, the professor was sometimes too complex when she did not break the underlying arguments/assumptions of the authors we read",
                "This course covered a wide variety of topics and gave a good general overview of political philosophy. However, there are a few ways I believe this course could be improved. Firstly, it felt that the course covered almost too many topics, as it moved so quickly from one to the other that it was difficult to dive into any topic in-depth. Moreover, the readings were at times unrealistically long, which became more and more discouraging as the semester went on. Additionally, the lectures often only summarized the readings; I would have preferred if they more frequently added additional insights that the readings themselves perhaps did not provide. Finally, readings and essay prompts were often posted late, which further made it difficult to complete the readings on time for lecture and discussion.",
                "The class is basically a reading list. It is a very good reading list  most of the stuff we discussed this semester was super interesting but I'm not sure I got a ton of extra engagement out of the class.",
                "I think the course could perhaps be improved by prioritizing depth over breadth (more time spent on criticisms, counterclaims, etc.)",
                "There are very few grades so your final grade is determined completely by only three assignments. Two of these assignments are papers but there is very little offered support on how to do well on these papers. Aditionally, feedback was given back at such a delayed rate that you could not use the markings on the previous assignment to improve on your next one. Unless there is an improvement on support for papers (perhaps a draft and final draft that are both draded) and better turnover when it comes to grades, there should be more assignments, and thus opportunities, to do well in the class."

                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they were particularly interested in philosophy or needed it for their major. It is, as one might expect, a LOT of philosophy on a wide range of topics, so if you think you might be interested in philosophy it's worth a shot, but it is a lot of reading for someone who may just be taking the class for the sake of taking it.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are certain that they interested in political philosophy. If you get disengaged in this course, it can become difficult fast because, in a way, philosophers that we read at the beginning of the semester shape some opinions and ideas of later philosophers.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to any student at Yale. I would only take this class if it was a requirement for a major or prerequisite that could not be avoided.",
                "I guess. Most people seem to be taking it as a prereq for EP&E and it's fine for that, but honestly, I don't think I heard anyone actually enjoying it very much. Towards the end of the course, it got more interesting and the readings felt more relevant to current political debates. It was helpful that most lectures were just analyses of the readings so you really don't have to actually read them to get something out of them.",
                "I personally would not recommend this course to another student. Personally, I did not learn much during this course in a way that can applicable tin thinking about political philosophy. This course was not very engaging to me personally, and I feel like I was not able to gain much insight.",
                "Yah as a prereq. Youll gain a base of political philosophy and philosophers and its kind of necessary, but because its intro and a survey it wont be the best class ever.",
                "I would not recommend this class to a student interested in learning about more historical political philosophy (like Aristotle and Plato); if interested, take a class that is more specific to them. This class was not my favorite, but was not bad. The professor was challenged with teaching a lot of philosophy in a short time. I would only recommend it to those who want a small glimpse of philosophy, as opposed to a foundation for their major.",
                "Honestly, if you don't have to take it for a requirement simply don't.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student -- I think it provided a great intro to how to read, understand, and analyze political philosophy, and especially appreciated the broad range of perspectives that we read toward the end of the course.  This class is really what you make of it -- there are a lot of long, dense readings that are rewarding if you read them -- you can get by in this class without doing many readings, but there is not much return on little effort.  I would take this class if you are willing and excited to do a lot of reading and thinking about the readings.",
                "Yes. Personally, I really love the content, but I think the speed and lack of clarity can hinder their experience. They need to really ennjoy the material to enjoy the class, but I feel like that's probably true for most classes.",
                "Absolutely, it has really interesting material. I just wish it was run and taught better.",

                "Yes! I think all Yale students should take this course -- this material in this course asks really important questions about our obligations to each other as citizens and members of a political community. Definitely important for social science/humanities majors to have this foundation.",

                "No. You do not walk away from this class with any tangible knowledge. It is all a flurry of ancient and somewhat current readings that lead to superficial discussions full of performative handwaving. Do not waste your time. If it is mandatory, good luck.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it. It overwhelms you with readings and then makes you feel inadequate if you can't complete them during discussions.",
                "No. I took this course because it was an EPE pre-req, and I assume most other people considering the course will have to take it for the same reason. However, if you do not want to do EPE, this is a waste of your time. It is a relatively easy course if that is encouraging, but overall, this class greatly disappointed me.",
                "I would recommend this course only to those who are really dedicated to learning political philosophy and not necessarily how it is used to operate systems in the real word. It is a lot of reading, and at times the material can be dry. For the average polisci student, this course may not be for them.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. While some of the readings are very interesting, the course is organized in such a way that each class gives you only cursory knowledge into each philosopher, so it's difficult to understand the big picture or to trace ideas over time.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student only if they are already passionate about political philosophy and want to pursue similar topics in the future.
