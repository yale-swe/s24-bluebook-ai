It was very interesting to see how climate science connects with colonialism and economics.",

                "could be improved through a few more diverse readings/authors\r\nalso if the conversation was not all the time focused on the specific readings but if we organized discussions sometimes based on theme in broader contexts\r\nstrength - the essays were fun to write, i liked doing presentations, and small group discussions",
                "Strengths: great instructor, the syllabus and readings are really engaging, and the assignments (weekly brief reading response, paper, and final project/paper) were all really well constructed",
                "Strengths: I thoroughly enjoyed our class discussions. Oliver is great at facilitating the seminar discussions. Every class, he was prepared with great guiding questions at the same time, he left room for students to drive the conversation. His feedback on the weekly reading responses was always detailed. The material was very engaging, and I felt like I was learning something new in every seminar. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there could have been more guidance for what was expected from the presentation assignment but I also appreciate that it was fairly open-ended because every student approached it in different ways.",
                "Great syllabus and discussion. I really like the weekly presentations idea that introduces the class to the readings and where they can be expanded upon. I really liked the group work that we did, beginning our reading evaluations in small groups and expanding the discussion from there. I think the class could benefit from more of that because it makes readings, particularly the longer ones, much more digestable and less intimidating from the beginning. I think sometimes our discussions were a bit weak and could've gone deeper so maybe some improvement in that regard.",
                "The presentations every week helped with my understanding of the readings and the trip to another library was incredible. A weakness is I wish we had more group talks.",
                "Appreciated the flexibility of the final paper! We had the option of doing a standard research paper, a creative project (ex. podcast, advocacy action plan, art exhibition, video performance, etc.) , or syllabus design (ie. reflection and expansion on the syllabus). I also appreciated our \"midterm\" (the primary source analysis), especially because a lot of the class was on knowledge production which informed how I understood the form/content of the archive I chose ."

The discussions were really engaging and I really loved the readings (which is not something I say lightly). The material is really important and I ended up leaving the class generally feeling like it reshaped the way I think about certain subjects.",

You learn fascinating connections between fascinating topics. It is a very chill environment, you discuss as you see fit.",

We also had a very understanding instructor who always tried to make his class accessible for all students. I really appreciated the written feedback I received. Oliver was very warm to everyone and very understanding that we were all coming in with different fields/levels of knowledge around colonial violence and climate change."
