                "Strengths: Problem sets are hard, but well-written, and I felt like they moved away from the \"toy examples\" you get in a class like 470 (Artificial Intelligence, which is a prerequisite for this class as I recall) and more into complex but usable ideas. Plus, this class takes you from theory down to implementation pretty nicely.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's hard to keep a grip on the big picture. Earlier in the evaluation I felt like I had a hard time answering the \"what is this course about?\" question, because past the first few weeks, the lectures get a bit disjoint - particularly because about half of them are paper discussions. (Paper discussions are great, but I felt that without more overarching content it was hard to get the most out of them.)"

                "Lectures as a whole were done very well. The coding done in class was particularly useful for the psets, as were the lecture recordings.\r\n\r\nSetting up our own virtual machines was challenging, the cloud resources were underutilized, and the introduction-to-github pset seemed largely unnecessary. In light of this, adding a cloud component to the github pset might be helpful.",

                "It's hard to have a good discussion on Zoom. I felt that Professor Vazquez did her best - often splitting into small groups with specific parts of a paper to probe, for instance - but ultimately it's just hard to do. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I felt that the class staff was very communicative, which was nice in an online course. There's a class Slack, and it was pretty easy to get in touch with a staff member when needed."

The psets themselves have very detailed instructions, telling you exactly how to set everything up. This means that minimal time is wasted on unimportant bugs and your focus can be on learning the concepts.",
