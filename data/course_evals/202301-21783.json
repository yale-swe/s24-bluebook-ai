The only thing to be aware of is that Professor Mohamed randomly chooses two \"discussion leaders\" to direct questions at throughout each lecture...so you pretty much have to do all your readings.",
                "Strength: Really good ppts, professor is highly passionate and knowledgeable about subject, TFs hold well-rounded discussions",

                "Cold calling was good and kept us honest. It also meant that people checked out after theyd gone, for that time round. But I think it was good all in all. \r\nSometimes there seemed not to be much to do in section.",
                "Awesome class. Very well taught. Reasonable work load such that a lot of time could be spent on each text. Honestly, I would not change anything. I loved this class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mohamed was wonderful! It was obvious how much he loved studying Milton, and it really came through in his lectures. He gave very thorough lectures and made a point to get students engaged. Sometimes the class felt like a large seminar instead of a lecture. The workload was also relatively light---the readings were very manageable and the only big assignment was the 8-10 page final paper.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures felt a little long, but maybe that was because it was right before lunch...."

Milton's a classic and his work both draws on writers before him and influenced those who came after him. Having the support of a professor and TF made reading him much easier than it would have been on my own.",

                "Yes! I came into the class expecting it to be dense and difficult, but Prof Mohamed is a fantastic teacher and Milton is an incredible poet. The daily workload was actually quite reasonable so due attention could be paid to every passage. Nor were the essays overwhelming. If you get the chance, do take this class!",
                "Absolutely would rec. Even if you're not necessarily interested in Milton, this class is fantastic. Engaging lectures/discussion sections and the Prof and TAs were helpful and easy to talk with (they also give great feedback).",
                "Yes, if you are really interested in learning more about Milton. Personally, I went into the class having already read and enjoyed Paradise Lost, but realized by the end of the semester that I wasn't interested enough in Milton to be invested in the class for an entire semester. But there were plenty of students who were, and they made the class a lot more engaging by asking questions and being excited about the content."
