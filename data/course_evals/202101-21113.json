                "Wang Laoshi is probably the best professor I've ever had for Chinese class. You learn so much from this course and continue to develop your Mandarin skills. As always, this will be a lot of work, but I think that's to be expected from an L4 language class.",

In class, Wang Laoshi was the absolute best, super engaging and positive despite the unusual circumstances and the occasional (not unwanted) interruption from her dog. The exams were very accommodating with the option to begin them at any time during the exam day and their open-book format. The only (minor) issue was the timing of individual session partner releases, since sometimes we had to camp out in the mornings to practice and prepare if the email was sent out late and we didn't know our partners."
