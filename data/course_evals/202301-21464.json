            "comments": [
                "Strength: the professor. Prof. Steinacker is incredible. She is extremely passionate about the subject and conveys that in her lectures. Psets are challenging, but doable, and Prof. Steinacker and the TAs were so patient and helpful. Provides a very good overview of the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: psets could be time consuming, but that also may be the nature of the subject. Really appreciate the decrease in workload this semester compared to 180 last semester.",
                "God I hate these psets, but without them I prob would not have learned anything. You might do bad on the exams but you still end up understanding the content somehow, and Steinacker curves the class so you should be fine with your grade",
                "Strengths- Grading criteria was fair and I thought the breakdown of grading was good. \r\nWeaknesses- The classes were spend primarily deriving formulas and then the homework was based on using the formulas when we hadn't had examples causes everyone to struggle greatly on the problems and need TF and peer tutor help to complete the assignments. Additionally the homework was very long and took far more time then any other class I was taking. There is an extremely high workload of this course.\r\nThe exams are difficult but the corrections on the midterms make it alright, the difficult aspect is the final is the same difficulty of problems but worth more of the grade and without revisions makes people's grades drop and I think the final should be curved.",
                "good class, a requirement for most people",
                "I would say that this is one of the best science classes at Yale. Although the course is difficult, the course really helps develop a very strong and useful understanding of complex topics in E&M.",
                "Professor Steinacker is an outstanding professor, and she provides so many resources for learning and understanding the material. She herself hosts at least 8 hours of office hours each week, and she's arranged TA/peer tutor office hours every night.",
                "Physics 181 is by far better than 180. 180 had an almost unbearable workload and the material was not interesting, at least to me. 181 was way more engaging and moderate in workload. It was actually a pretty fun class and the fundamentals that I feel as though would be needed in my major were found in this course.",
                "I would say the biggest strength of this course is Professor Steinacker; her lectures are incredibly engaging, and the way she structures her lectures and her lecture notes makes it very easy to grasp difficult concepts. Additionally, the wide array of options for office hours and study halls creates a really productive learning environment for working on problem sets.",
                "Sometimes it does feel more like a (learn how to solve equations class, instead of understanding what is going on different situations",
                "Strengths: A great breakdown of the material with a wonderful professor. OH was a great way to get help for assignments -- please go!\r\nWeaknesses: pretty high workload. not much feedback on homework assignments.",
                "Prof Steinacker is an amazing professor and I really recommend this class! I really appreciate all the care she put into the class, and even if the course is difficult (on the HW), it is meant to push your understanding and help you grow as a thinker! And her exams and reviews are very very reasonable and fair! I think she does an outstanding and amazing job teacher! I am so glad I got to have her as my professor for physics!",
                "The course is difficult and you should expect to spend a lot of time in office hours to finish the psets. However, there are a lot of TFs and peer tutors available to help you. Professor Steinacker is fantastic and is very dedicated to her students. She does her best to make lectures interesting and help students out in any way possible. A weakness of the course is that sometimes TFs would badly grade the assignments and tests, taking points off when you should not be losing points.",
                "I liked that lecture notes were provided and recorded lectures were available. It would be helpful if all the recorded lectures were made available if someone missed a lecture or wanted to review it.",
                "I found the PSETs pretty manageable as long as you went to office hours, which there are a lot of. The professor genuinely cares about her students. Exams are curved and there are exam corrections to get back points, which is nice. The only thing I wish is that they gave a formula sheet earlier so that you could use it on PSETs rather than just right before exams.",
                "Strengths: This class gives a very organized and well-taught introduction to different electromagnetism concepts. It builds all of the information from a foundational level which helps not only know but, understand the reasoning behind everything. The lectures (and subsequent notes) are designed to take you through acquiring and applying knowledge. You are not just handed formulas or given complicated derivations to say you have them. Instead, they are walked through, questioned, and then comprehended, and finally used in physical examples (which facilitated a great learning environment). Problem Sets can be difficult at times, but with strong access to help during office hours and study halls, they are very manageable. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Electromagnetism, at times, is not an intuitive sector of physics. As a result, even though the process of getting formulas or conclusions is clear, it can be hard to grasp \"what it physically means\". To improve, potentially add a couple more analogies that can help. (One example that was effective was using water flowing for an analogous example of electric flux).",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker makes this course what it is. She infuses her lectures with passion, always is available to help in office hours, and is very attentive to students. She is rigorous with her PSets and her work demands a lot, but you learn so much from the experience and leave the class with a lot of insight and knowledge on electromagnetism. The exams are very fairly graded, and the level of depth to which we go in each sub-topic is just right for them to tie together coherently. Lectures are some of the best and most organized I've been to at Yale. The lecture notes are also very comprehensive and detailed. Can't think of weaknesses.",
                "This course was taught really well. I honestly dont have any critiques.",
                "The course is extremely challenging. And the problem sets present an exceptional time commitment, that essentially requires office hours to complete",
                "Strength: great p-sets that prepared you well for the exams\r\nWeakness: lectures were not very engaging",
                "Fantastic lecturer, great PSETs + office hours that are extremely conducive to learning, many resources for help (extra PSET problems, reviews, study halls, etc)",
                "Prof. Steinacker is great and the course is very well structured",
                "I think the beginning of this course went very well. I started feeling like I was struggling after the first midtermthe midterm made it hard to focus and really learn the material in a pivotal point in the course, and from then on I felt behind. I suppose this is natural in such a challenging class, and Im not sure how to get around it. The support network for this class is phenomenal. Professor Steinacker is super supportive, and the review sessions and study hall sessions and office hours were essential to understanding the material and succeeding.",
                "The primary strengths of the course are the resources that Professor Steinacker provides you in order to comprehend thr material. In class, she will always work through the material step-by-step and will frequently encourage questions from students to engage them and depending on the lesson will have in-class demonstrations that are interesting to watch and learn from. Additionally, outside of class, there will office hours nearly everyday for a 2 hour period , peer tutoring/study hall for PSET at around the same frequency, just later in the day, and she will provide lecture notes on all classes. This becomes an amazing resource given that she does not quite follow the textbook and the notes are thorough, in-depth, and easy to understand. Lecture notes will truly be of unparalleled help if you are trying to study or comprehend the material if you didn't get it in class. Lastly, before any midterm of exam Professor Steinacker will provide the list of topics covered, the lectures containing those topics, hold a dedicated review session to which she will also upload the notes for (containing example problems and topics), and cite every PSET problem that relates to said topic in order to get practice with it. What can be improved from the course relates primarily to the management of PSETs. By her own admission, Professor Steinacker will make PSETs intentionally difficult in order to \"force\" you to attend office hours or peer tutoring. They are not meant to be solved independently which can be very hard to keep up with if other classes are also piling work. Also, the deadline for PSETs is rarely 11:59 and most often at 6pm on Fridays which can interfere with a lot of other work. This aspect of the homework is the greatest thing I had an issue with in her course.",
                "Strengths is that it's very in depth and the professor makes sure that you're learning and getting the most out of it. Weakness is that it's a bit fast paced and sometimes you'll need to play catch up on your own. Also homework can be a bit much at times.",
                "The class is very well organized to support student learning, as there's always office hours or study halls to attend. Sometimes I wouldn't receive clear grading on my assignments, which made it more difficult to learn from my errors made.",
                "Strengths: Adriane Steinacker is the biggest strength of this course. That woman is an ANGEL! She gets to know all of her students, is so kind and sweet, and has a deep love of what she teaches. Her office hours were the highlight of my week, and she made the class very manageable. The TA's and your peers in the class are also a large strength. Without working with others I would've failed this course. \r\nWeaknesses: The content, being a physics class, is hard and you have to really work at it to understand it. But that's it! No other weaknesses :)",
                "N/A I love this course and Steinacker is amazing.",
                "181 was definitely better in terms of workload than 180 because Prof. Steinacker started giving us shorter problem sets which made the class overall just much less stressful. I love the way that exams are run; you get to do revisions after the exam, which I think is such a great learning opportunity in subjects like physics as you are able to go back after the exam and make sure that you really do know all the subject matter. Professor Steinacker is great at explaining the subject matter but be aware that it is definitely more abstract than first-semester physics, so in my opinion, it was much harder to keep up in lectures.",
                "I learned a lot in this course, however, I don't think any course should have this much homework and stress.",
                "Course material is interesting, however workload is a lot",
                "This is a fantastic course that sets up a strong foundation of physics thats perfect for people in related majors, but it may be challenging to premeds that are just taking it because its a pre req.",
                "I dont see any weaknesses with the course. It is very structured to get a lot from lecture and theirs is so much help offered outisde of class. I dont think theres a single office hour slot I at some point didnt go to.",
                "This is an absolutely fantastic course!\r\n\r\nOne strength is the problem sets (very well designed). Another is office hours Prof Steinacker and her peer tutors are great!",
                "Just like PHYS 180, it is taught really well. The homework assignments can be a bit much at times, so you have to go to study hall or office hours to complete them.",
                "I think that the course does a fine job teaching the topics it covers, the workload is fairly intense but other than that no points of improvement.",
                "Did very well at utilizing skills built from PHYS 180, and just expanding new ways to apply knowledge.",
                "I really appreciate the constant feedback and the ability to do corrections in this class. It helps me learn from my mistakes and better my understanding of the material.",
                "This class was wonderful! I could not have imagined a better introduction to these topics. Even though I never took AP Physics in high school, and hardly encountered electromagnetism topics prior to this course, Professor Steinacker made everything approachable by giving exciting lectures and providing an abundance of extra-help resources.",
                "The strengths of the class were the office hours were extremely helpful in consolidating the lectures and concepts went over in class. You also got to collaborate with others and check answers to check your understanding of the problems. The lectures were very well taught and Professor Steinacker is very supportive and understanding of her students.",
                "Professor Steinacker is one of the most engaged and best professors I have had at Yale. She constantly strives to ensure students learn the material and actually understand what they are learning, and offers countless office hours each week so that students aren't just completing the problem sets, but understanding them at the same time.",
                "Its very hard and difficult to catch up in when you fall behind.",
                "The problem sets end up taking amount a very large amount of your time every week even if you spend hours in office hours. They're also very difficult to complete if you don't attend study halls and office hours. The midterms are generally quite fair and test corrections make it easier to preform well. The problem sets, although very difficult and time consuming, are graded fairly and end up being very helpful when it comes time to study for the midterms and final.",
                "Keep most things the same! Course benefits from a lot of accessible office hours + accessibility to peer tutors and teaching fellows for help (peer tutors in particular). Course also benefits strongly from having prerecorded lectures up, as sometimes topics are covered a bit quickly in class. I would say that decreasing the number of problems per problem set also helped a lot in terms of managing student workload with minimal detriment to student learning.",
                "I thought the course was very cool and taught effectively. The instruction was wonderful and the psets insightful. The reviews were helpful. The midterm and final exams were fair.",
                "While I enjoyed the course, I felt that I didnt get as much out of the lectures. I often felt that they were delivered in a way that wasnt as accessible as it could have been. I think Professor Steinacker may have gone unnecessarily fast, and done unnecessarily complex examples too quickly. \r\n\r\nI often found that it wasnt until the exam review that I deeply understood the material.",
                "Excellent course, really teaches basic fundamentals of physics while encouraging you to apply these basic to complex questions.",
                "More staffing in office hours and more directions for TFs and TAs (for study hall) because often times they themselves would be confused on the problems as well",
                "The biggest strength of this course is its ability to prompt students to work together.  This is done through really hard psets.  A downside is that these psets asked for too much at times.  They take hours to complete."

                "I would recommend any course taught by professor Steinacker to another student. I would absolutely recommend PHYS 181 to another student if they were looking to gain a thorough understanding of the basics of E&M or to satisfy a major requirement. I would not recommend students to take this course if they are looking for an easy science credit, but if they are looking to be challenged, I think this course can be extremely rewarding.",
                "yes but its not a gut or a fun exploratory course or anything",
                "Absolutely! Professor Steinacker is AMAZING, and while I may not be a physics major, she always kept my interest and explained very challenging concepts in a very clear and concise manner!",
                "Avoid at all costs and take 170/171 unless this is a major req (it unfortunately is for me), there is a far to high workload to merit recommending this course. After phys 180 many students dropped to 171 for good reason and many like myself wished they could drop.",
                "take if you need it",
                "Absolutely. If you're looking to better understand the physical world, this is a fantastic class. It is challenging, but there is so much support to complete the homework and understand the concepts.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in physics. I think it is taught so well that you come out of it feeling like you have really truly learned and understood so much.",
                "If you have to, its also an ok stepping stone from 180 instead of going to 171 as you know what to expect from the professor",
                "Yes, especially w/ Prof. Steinacker. I am pre-med so was thinking about 171 instead, but I took 181 because I liked physics and ended up enjoying the class. Be ready for long assignments and please go to Office Hours/Study Hall!",
                "Yes, if you are interested in physics or have to take it as a requirement. It does take up a lot of time.",
                "Yes! Great application of calculus and differential eqs.",
                "Yes. I think Steinacker is a very sweet professor, and I think that the workload was manageable. Granted, I had some physics background from taking Physics C in high school, so this course was not as challenging for me as it was for others.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. If you are interested in physics, engineering, or any physical science, this class helps provide foundational physics and problem-solving skills that can be applied. It will be a difficult, but rewarding class. Professor Steinacker prioritizes the learning of her students and cares deeply about your growth. So, even in the difficulty, the support is larger and the growth will be as well.",
                "Absolutely, and take it with Dr Steinacker! The physics of electric and magnetic fields is both fascinating and complex, and Dr Steinacker teaches in such a way that makes you really understand and hence enjoy the topics. There is a lot of support available in the class (peer tutors, TFs, office hours and study halls pretty much every day) to help you succeed. The content itself is interesting, and with an excellent professor who cares, it becomes that much more valuable.",
                "Yes! While this course is really hard if you dont have a physics background, you learn a lot and Professor Steinacker is AWESOME.",
                "Unless the person has this course as a major requirement, this course is incredibly difficult and presents a time commitment as well",
                "Really, PHYS 181 is very doable after PHYS 180. The kind of problem-solving and math that you're doing in this class should be really familiar, it's just that the topics differ. P-sets are shorter than in 180 and exams struck me as slightly easier.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes, this is a great choice for an intro physics sequence",
                "Yes",
                "Not really; If you are not required to take this class, but wish to establish a thorough foundation in the physics of mechanics, electricity. and magnetism, maybe. This class will take a lot of time and effort to do well and should not be taken lightly. This is not a class to take on a whim because ti just seems interesting. 1If you must take this class then be prepared for the effort it will take, but if this a non-mandatory class for you then be wary of taking it unless you truly think you van dedicate hours of time for PSETs alone, in addition to studying.",
                "Yes! This is a great introductory physics course to learn more about this topic and also gain insights on how to solve certain problems and approach E&M from a novel perspective.",
                "Yes, Professor Steinacker is fantastic and you will have ample opportunity to learn the material. You'll take from the course what you put into it.",
                "YES! ABSOLUTELY! I love Professor Steinacker. She made learning physics so fun. If you have no reason to learn physics I probably wouldn't take this class, but if you're pre-med, an engineer, or a potential physics major, this is a great class!",
                "Yes, Steinacker is insanely passionate about physics and deeply cares for each of her students. The material is great but its only so because of the way its presented.",
                "Yes, please it take it",
                "If you're between 201 and 181, I would definitely suggest you take 181.",
                "I would totally recommend this course because Professor Steinacker is a great teacher who understands what it takes to get students to learn, and her office hours are super helpful. I enjoy the classes a lot and she makes the information interesting and makes sure to engage the class.",
                "I would recommend it if the person needs to take a physics course. The 180 series is definitely the best option.",
                "Yes absolutely! You will learn so much and be challenged to think in new and interesting ways.",
                "I thought it was very interesting so I would recommend, but only if you're willing to put in a lot of work into the homework assignments.",
                "I would recommend this course, but only to a stem major in need of a physics credit. This course is not for someone just causally interested in the subject.",
                "Yes, the teacher is phenomenal and it's overall very interesting to learn about how the universe works.",
                "Yes, if you enjoy hardcore integrals and math applications.",
                "Yes!! Take it with Professor Steinacker if you can! Although the material moves fast and is challenging, there are enough resources if you seek them out, and the grading is very forgiving to truly encourage learning the material. The problem sets were a bit shorter this semester compared to PHYS 180, which made the workload more manageable as well!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other if you looking for introductory EM course to give you a solid foundation in approaching and understanding physics concepts. The professor, TAs, and peer tutors are very much supportive of the students learning.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend 180 and 181 because of the professor. Yes the material might be a little more challenging but you genuinely understand it and the math is kind of fun!",
                "Its a difficult class but you learn the fundamentals of physics very well.",
                "I would recommend this course if the student is a non-physics major who still wants to get a comprehensive introductions to fundamentals of physics, but I would warn that while grading is very fair and the course has a lot of support from Professor Steinacker, TAs, and ULAs, the problem sets are very time-consuming. If you are just taking this course for a major/pre-med requirement, I have heard 170 is a lower workload, but 180 is definitely manageable especially if you are comfortable with calculus and have time to attend office hours.",
                "I would say, even though this course is at times fairly interesting, I'd only recommend it to someone who needs it for their major or is very interested in physics.",
                "Yes. It is very important to learn physics.",
                "I would recommend this course, but I likely wouldnt recommend it for for freshman. It was very difficult, and a much larger time commitment than any other class I have taken. However, I did feel that I learned a lot and that I was trained by this class to effectively conquer other classes. After this, other classes felt easy.",
                "Yes. Especially if you do not have a background in math and physics, this course is designed to encourage success from all stem backgrounds. So much support is available, all peer tutors and TAs are excellent. Also, it is a very fun class, with physical demonstrations and the professor is phenomenal.\r\n\r\nGo to the exam reviews! Best STEM course exam reviews at Yale so far, she brings all of the concepts together so well.\r\n\r\nTry to take this course fall/spring (180/181) with Steinacker both semesters!",
                "Only to students who have taken 180 before and are familiar with the prof's teaching style / expectations",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone for the camaraderie of working through really tough psets"
