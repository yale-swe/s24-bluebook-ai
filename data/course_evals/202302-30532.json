                "I learned about the history of Spain throughout different time periods, talked about the political climates throughout their history and types of regimes, explored cities and museums, and gained a better understanding of the Spanish language. I loved staying with my host family, got truly immersed in the culture, and feel that my reading, speaking, and comprehensive skills have gotten faster and better.",
                "I learned to listen better in Spanish, write with more knowledge of grammar, and learned about the values, history, and ideas of Valencia through the periods.",
                "Overview of Spanish history and culture",
                "Through everyday breakfast, lunch, and dinners with my host family, excursions, classes, and weekend trips, my skills with reading, writing, and speaking Spanish soared. I learned so much about the entire history of Valencia and Spain and feel I have garnered huge learnings about how Spain's complicated history forms its present.",
                "I was able to practice and develop my Spanish, experience Valencia and its traditions, and learn more about the culture of \"el campo\" in Spain and the Spanish Civil War through class.",
                "I developed more practical skills for writing, speaking, and listening in Spanish. Being able to have a host family, excursions, and class made me a lot more fluent speaker. My classmates and I were also developing a critical understanding of Spain's culture and history with our class engagement but also on our own with our final projects. The different aspects of the program's cultural immersion was extremely enjoyable as I was able to experience living in Spain first hand.",
                "I developed my Spanish reading, comprehension, and speaking skills while learning about the history of Valencia and Spain. I also read Spanish literature and studied Spanish art.",
                "I learned an incredible amount about Spanish history and culture, especially through the lens of Valencia! On a broader scale, I gained independence and skills for living in Spain with another family, and it was a truly enriching experience with language aquisition\/development.",
                "I believe that I developed many skills, both in and out of the classroom. I found living with a host family helped me with my people skills.",
                "Throughout this course, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of Valencia and its historical significance within the context of Spain. Additionally, the course has provided me with insights into the diverse groups that comprise Valencian society and the respective roles they play within it."

                "Strengths: the professor. Profe is a gem that is a one-of-a-kind, life changing professor. The class material was engaging, flexible, and Profe was also very open to getting to know us outside of the classroom and asking us for feedback. There is room for improvement with the diversity of the speakers brought in, but that is something that had already been addressed in class and I look forward to seeing who is brought in next year. \r\n\r\nThere is also lots of different opportunity to express your opinions to your classmates, the prof, or Sofia, the TA. I feel like there was an open environment where it was safe to make mistakes and share your views without judgement.",
                "It was a perfect balance of workload and excursion. Jorge is a caring soul!",
                "There are a lot of different assignments, while managing to not be underwhelming. The course offers some challenge while also allowing time to enjoy Valencia. Most people created final projects about things that matters to them and made them engage the community. Its awesome.",
                "Strengths: Jorge and Sofia were an amazing team, Jorge was extremely kind and engaging throughout the program and was incredibly easy to reach out to, he spoke and taught in a manner that allowed us to share our thoughts but always left me with a profound thought at the end of class, the 3 times a week and schedule was amazing\r\nWeaknesses: The tours and excursions especially in Madrid were heavily catered towards audio learners which I found very difficult to become accustomed to and I felt took away from my learning experience with no visual manner\/guidebook to keep as a reference in case I was confused with tour guide explanations, a guide on using the bus\/subway or the basics of Valencia might have been nice at the start of the program, I wish I had been in contact with a speaking buddy during\/before the program to practice before arriving in Valencia",
                "Strengths: Professor Jorge and our TA Sofia were the highlight of the course. They taught with joy, excitement, and structured the course in a way so we were learning for the sake of our own enjoyment and not in the pursuit of a high grade. Our excursions were amazing experiences, especially our trip to Madrid, Toledo, and Consuegra. The literature and paintings we analyzed in class were my favorite parts of the curriculum. \r\nWeakness: The inclusion of a graphic novel as part of the curriculum is a great idea that did not play out as well in practice, only because no one in the class particularly enjoyed the novel. Soldados de Salamina and the entire unit focusing on the Spanish Civil War fell flat in comparison to the first half of the course. I feel that this is due to the fact that for the first half of the course, we were reading literature about topics while experiencing the aftereffects of those topics when we explored the city (ex. reading about el campo and visiting Albufera). However, we had no excursions having to do with the Spanish Civil War, which made me feel detached from it and less interested. I recommend adding a small, optional excursion to some museum or location that engages in the history of the Spanish Civil War\/the era of Franquismo. I also recommend swapping out the Soldados de Salamina graphic novel for a different work (possibly just reading snippets of Soldados instead) and including a different graphic novel.",
                "Our instructors and class content were incredibly engaging! The pedagogical focus on bettering our grasp on language (rather than grammar) was really refreshing compared to other Spanish classes. Our discussions about texts, excursions, and others materials were enjoyable, fun, and productive. The feedback by instructors was also very clear, and I feel like I knew what I could work on to do better on my assignments. The canvas page was also very comprehensive and we could understand what was happening each day. The instructors were also receptive to feedback on the different aspects of the course and valued students' input. Jorge was following the original program this summer as it was his first time leading this specific program. However, he has already expressed that he is planning to include more content which highlights Spain's relationship with minority communities in future sessions.",
                "This course was great. It was a great amount of work for a study abroad program, was never overwhelming but still felt like a legitimate class that I had to put effort in to succeed.",
                "The readings are approachable, engaging, and the presentations are varied and include a mix of lecture and discussion. I can't place a single weakness, this was an amazing class and such a fantastic experience.",
                "This course is designed to cater to students who possess a willingness to be challenged not only linguistically but also socially."

It was an incredible experience that I would recommend to a student if they were willing to feel uncomfortable in order to learn, were eager to experience the average daily life of a Spanish family (including those they might idealogically disagree with), felt comfortable with trying to adjust to another families lifestyle, wanted to try new food in Spain, were eager to travel and become familiar with the actual city of Valencia.",

                "Absolutely! There was a nice balance between the academics and the cultural immersion parts of the program. This specific program has unstructured time which allows students the ability to explore the different parts of Valencia. Valencia itself is safe, beautiful, sustainable, and has a lot to offer in terms of museums, food, activities, and parks. The relationships with host families was also amazing! I got to see how life is like in Valencia by going to family events, going out with them, and just hanging out with them.",
