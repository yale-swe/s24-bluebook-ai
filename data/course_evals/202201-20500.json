                "By taking both semesters of third-year Russian, your skill with the language will improve a ton. By the end of Russ 151, you will have learned all of the fundamentals of grammar in some fashion or another. The course is also designed to focus on nineteenth century Russian history, which is super interesting.",
                "This class had an especially strong emphasis on aspect and verbs of motion. Basic grammar tools that should have already been learned were strengthened by progressively increasing the nuance and complication.",
                "I learned a lot of new vocabulary, complex grammar that Im much more confident with now, some history and culture of Russia and was able to practice speaking and reading. It was intense but rewarding.",
                "Lots of Russian history! This class was basically L2 on steroids, going over perfective\/imperfective and verbs of motion.",
                "Constantine is incredibly knowledgable, constantly teaching us the roots of words (from old church slavonic, german, french, etc) which creates a highly interconnected web of Russian vocabulary. Throughout our course we had insightful discussions of serfdom in Russia, the reigns of two tsars, and the politics that arose around the various regimes. I really enjoyed our discussion based class, with lively presentations on pop-culture in Russia, as well as informative talks on current news stories."

            "comments": [
                "This course is great because of the constant work which is essential to improvement in a language. The textbook is also great: Professor Muravnik made it himself and it fits the course perfectly. My one complaint would be occasionally this work wasn't evenly spaced and at the end of the semester the homework took several hours longer than they normally did because the content was compressed.",
                "Very fun mix of assignments - you can really tailor the course to your interests in Russian culture\/history",
                "The grading of the course is conducted in such a way that it allows you to learn in earnest without crushing academic pressure, which is super beneficial. One weakness of the class was its size, insofar as having 13 students in a advanced language seminar made some hardly participate and those who did often felt as if they were dominating the discussion which hindered further willingness to speak. (Not necessarily a weakness with the course or the professor, but something that admin should work to fix in the future).",
                "The timing of the course was slightly off - perhaps the most challenging part of the syllabus was only covered in the last few weeks of the course, and felt somewhat short-changed as a result. Would recommend starting aspect even earlier, followed by verbs of motion and then integrating the other verbs throughout the semester through the historical essays, etc.",
                "N\/A",
                "Strength- Constantine is very knowledgeable and can answer any question.\r\nWeaknesses- Not much opportunity to speak in class conversationally. Felt like less Russian practice speaking.",
                "The only thing I would say is that our class sometimes got sidetracked and off topic, but I wouldn't necessarily call that a weakness. We would learn new words, phrases, and Russian phenomenons during these 'off-topic' discussions, so it often would amount to a positive gain in my opinion."

                "Yes absolutely! Russian is such a fulfilling language to learn and Constantin's class is great to help students at an intermediate level. Definitely keep taking Russian!",
                "Yes",
                "One hundred percent. Professor Muravnik is the best Russian professor around and brings liveliness and humor to class that just can't be missed. You'll get to learn a lot about Russian history and culture while also honing your language skills. If you've come this far in the language, why stop now?",
                "I would recommend it. I haven't taken another college course at Yale, so I don't have much to compare it against. However, compared to other language courses I have taken, Professor Muravnik's teaching method is very well-suited for developing an advanced understanding of the language. He does not stop at examples or formal instruction, but is very talented at helping his students develop a sort of narrative or framework that explains the intricacies\/oddities of the language and can be applied broadly.",
                "Yes, if you really want to learn Russian",
                "Yes, I think I greatly improved my Russian language skills in this course. It was never boring, and it seemed to me that the community of the class made learning exciting rather than daunting."
