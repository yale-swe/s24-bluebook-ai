                "Strengths: Professor Kinane is a great and enthusiastic professor who is genuinely passionate about American Politics. The course was organized well and comments on drafts for essays were helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: There are no significant weaknesses that I can think of. Discussions were good, but sometimes it is hard to jump in. I would suggest posing a series of questions before the discussion begins and allowing students to independently jot down some comments before the discussion begins.",
                "I thought that the selection of the papers was excellent, as was the enthusiasm of Professor Kinane. I think that the quality of discussion improved as the semester went on, although it still was not ideal. Because there were so many students, it often ended up being students lining up to give speeches on whatever they wanted to talk about, instead of engaging with each other. At the end of the semester, it seemed as if many students had not read the papers, and so only a few people were willing to contribute to class discussions. I do think that the course instructors did a good job of adapting the class based on mid-semester feedback and there were notable improvements.",
                "I absolutely loved this class. Professor Kinane and her teaching fellows did a fantastic job getting everyone to participate, feel engaged, and have an excellent class experience every week. My only issue with the class seems to be Zoom-only, and no fault of the professor's. Sometimes, someone would say something in our open discussion that would totally shift the conversation from one idea or topic to another, and so it'd sometimes be really confusing to know when to jump in or participate. Of course, in person, this would likely not be an issue, and it worked itself out as the semester went on and I got to know the discussion style of my fellow classmates.",
                "The strengths of this course were the assignments. I learned the most from writing the midterm and final essays. However, the discussions and lectures were not very helpful to me. The discussions were often led by the same few students at the beginning and end of the course. At the beginning of the course, Professor Kinane chose students using the raised hand feature on zoom and the same students always got there first, leaving everyone else at waiting at the end of the line. Around midterm, Professor Kinane realized this and started choosing others but at the end of the term she changed the system again to make the discussion more substantive and cohesive and less about individual comments (which I greatly appreciated) and discussions were run by jumping in but this again seemed to lead to the same students talking over and over again. This is definitely a tough situation to remedy over zoom but one approach I appreciated in another class was keeping a line up of students to speak, like Professor Kinane initially did, but leaving room for students to jump in to discuss briefly what was just said and then moving on to the next student in the line up.",
                "Strengths: Seminar style and discussions leaders made the material easier to engage with. Assignments weren't too intense!\r\nWeaknesses: A group project as a final exam would have worked better as a solo project.",
                "Very good course and instructor is very responsive to feedback. Really great class overall. One way to improve course is to delegate more time to smaller group discussions.",
                "Strengths: Format was great (all things considered). The lectures were engaging, discussions were good, quizzes made sure we did the reading. \r\nWeaknesses: At first, it was difficult to talk, as the 30 person class was a little big to hold a discussion section. After taking mid-semester feedback, Professor Kinane changed the format slightly, and it was much improved.",
                "The strengths of this course include the engaging lecture and interesting political science research that is presented in class. The weakness of this course is the attempt to create seminar-style discussions with a group that is simply too big to do so with. This course could be improved by not attempting full class discussions and relying more on teaching fellows to lead smaller discussions.",
                "This course was engaging and well-structured given the virtual format. I felt often that there were multiple readings we were looking at the surface level instead of going deeper, just because of the amount of content. That being said, this was a great intro course and provided a broad look into American politics.",
                "The professor made the lecture as interactive as possible which made it more engaging than a typical lecture.",
                "Strenghts:\r\n\r\nCoverage of the debate between federalists and anti-federalists in the first weeks was very interesting.\r\nThe section on public opinion in the last few weeks, especially the paper by Bullock et al. was interesting.\r\nThe Hacker and Pierson paper was my favorite, a really good read\r\nPowerpoints were very clear and well designed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nMany of the readings focused on statistical models, the mechanics of which were impossible for me to understand, which was frustrating, as I was forced to take them at face value. Given that I did not take many of the points made by authors featured in the course at face value, I was annoyed by this situation as I couldn't apply critical analytic skills to assess the validity of claims being made from these models.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of ideology felt lacking in nuance (even considering the narrow ideological window of American politics)\r\n\r\nDiscussion sections seemed to feature a lot yes-people just going along with whatever the text of the week said in order to score brownie points. Eventually a (great) text would come along to disprove the prior text and it made me wonder whether some people actually had any opinions. (e.g. the Downsian Electoral model and the Hacker & Pierson paper that highlighted its flaws).\r\n\r\nImprovements?:\r\n\r\nTo be honest most of my gripes are really down to my own taste. It would be interesting to see the professor or TAs challenge what students say in discussions so as to dissuade vapid praise of whatever text is being discussed.",
                "Strengths: an abundance of materials, a comprehensive syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: disorganized class structure, too heavy of a workload for the average week, not enough grade opportunities, unapproachable professor",

                "The lectures succeeded in being engaging and informative. The seminar-style discussions are good in theory, but 25+ people simply cannot be expected to have a productive full group discussion over zoom. The class should rely more on breakout rooms so that discussion can be geared towards smaller groups where a conversation can actually be developed.",
                "I appreciated the concept of having regular breakout rooms led by TFs with the intent of having a more responsive discussion, which is difficult to have in larger groups, especially virtually -- I wish they had been used more. I think having the slides posted and accessibility of Professor Kinane and the TFs in office hours made it better geared towards a virtual setting.",

                "For someone who is looking for a more low-stress, introductory political science class, this might be a good fit. Additionally, the course gives a student a good introduction to different political science papers, which might be of interest, given that they are different from political stories one may read in a newspaper, for example. Given that it is a broad survey of many aspects of American politics, it does mean that there is not a deep dive into any one subject. Thus, if a student has a particular interest, another class may be more suitable.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the civics and politics of the United States. I came away from this class knowing a lot more about politics and feeling much more ready to engage with the world and future political science at Yale, which is saying a lot, as politics were already my major interest before signing up. Even then, the papers we read and the discussions we had taught me so much more than I could ever imagine.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are really interested in or dont yet have a clear understanding of the American government system. I would also possibly recommend it if you feel really intimidated by political science research and want an easy way to ease in to it. Otherwise, if you are looking for an introductory political science course to test out the major, I think you should really focus on finding a topic that interests you.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. Not only is it a good way to build your participatory skills, but I think it's a really essential bank of knowledge that every person should be privy to when examining American politics. Super good! And professor Kinane was incredible, along with our TF's.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially if they are interested in Political Science and want a survey of common political writings and theories in the field. This is a very surface level course, but introduced me to areas within PLSC that I am more interested in. If you took AP Gov in high school, be sure to pick the 2nd section or the content can be repetitive.",

                "I would not recommend this course to another student.  The course work was far too much for any student to be expected to have done for each class, which resulted in students having to choose between skimming several articles or reading one or two thoroughly enough to actively participate in the class discussion.  The class discussion was chaotic and lacked structure, which led to a few students dominated each class while several others could not participate.  The class often ran over time without ever having covered the agenda for the day.  In short, don't waste your time.",
