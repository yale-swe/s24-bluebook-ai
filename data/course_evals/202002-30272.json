   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "it moves very fast which is a weakness for those who cant keep up but if you put in effort it's not bad, especially if you're only taking this class by itself. the strengths are the professor and TAs because they do their best to make sure everyone is accommodated and helped when needed.",
    "Strengths: Lots of help opportunities, good resources to prepare for tests, helpful homework, clear expectations\r\nWeaknesses: fast pace makes it difficult to keep up",
    "i think section could be more helpful if it wasn't just the ta doing suggested problems. i thought the course was pretty good for over zoom and all of those added difficulties",
    "Strengths: Professor Ghiassi-Nejad is an absolute gem of a human being. His lectures are engaging and interesting. His teaching style is clear and easy to follow. He also cares SO MUCH about his students!!!! He is the reason I had such a positive experience with this course!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the administration of the test on examity caused a lot of stress for the students and it wasnt clear whether we could use certain types of calculators or formula sheets. Also, sections were not structured rigorously and could use more of a framework.",
    "Strengths: Homework was always useful and helpful to learn from and was not excessive busywork. Professor was very caring, accommodating and willing to make time and answer questions. TAs were helpful and available. Weaknesses: topics are not covered very in-depth, but that is probably to be expected for an introductory summer course. I'm not sure whether I would have learned more in a semester-long class because the depth was not always there, though it was obviously sped up due to it being a 5-week summer course. Not many weaknesses, I enjoyed the class!",
    "Strengths: teaching aligns well with textbook, although lectures can be a bit more organized and focus more on the conceptual thoughts of physics rather than derivation of equations\/formulas. Office hours and TAs are very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exam problems can be more similar to the problems assigned (since I felt we werent taught so heavily with conceptual ideas and then the exam had conceptual problems that I wasnt used to seeing). Quizzes, although 5%, were so stressful under the 5-min time limit. I wouldve appreciated if the limit was extended to even 1 or 2 min more.",
    "The course is structured well: lecture is based off the main key points of the chapter reading, and the problem sets are from the textbook and begin from easy and increase in difficulty very fast. There are quizzes every discussion section that are graded, and timed, however, I would prefer if we could just work on the same problems in section with the TA because some questions are tricky or aren't really intuitive the first time learning it. The time crunch also is stressful. There are three written exams and an oral exam in this summer course. I don't think there is enough time allotted for the written exams as there are bonus problems at the end of the exams and I never even have time to touch those problems.",
    "The course was very well run. I don't have any specific improvements.",
    "The strengths of this course are the resources. We got ample practice tests\/problems to help us prepare, we have office hours twice a week, and we had a great professor. A weakness of this course were the technical difficulties; however, they were addressed promptly. What can be improved upon is the spacing of the office hours. We didn't get office hours on Tuesdays\/Thursdays\/Saturdays and I wish we had access to them at least once a day.",
    "Strengths:\r\nHelp is easily available\r\nTests were reasonable, and adjusted when deemed too hard for the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nOnline format is not for everyone\r\nThe assignments and homework were not in sync with the pace of the class, made it hard to keep up",
    "The quizzes did not align very well with much of the material we were learning in lecture, which was quite frustrating. The questions on the quizzes also were usually poorly worded, so the right answer wasn't always super clear, which felt unfair. Lastly, the quizzes were too short in time allotted. We were asked if there was enough time for the first quiz, which was relatively easy since there was so little material covered at that point, so the time limit seemed fine. But as the weeks progressed, the quizzes became much harder and there was simply not enough time to think through the poorly worded, oddball questions. I also felt like lecture could be too long sometimes and could skew to be slightly off topic. Maybe having a break in lecture or doing shorter lectures would be more effective. It could be hard to stay focused, especially on zoom for that long a period of time. The exams also often had specific vocabulary that was not in the book, nor mentioned in lecture or discussion. I presume many of these obscure terms are synonyms or equivalents of more familiar terms that we did learn, but it felt frustrating to have these unfamiliar terms pop up on exams, when the setting was already stressful enough. Another critique would be of discussion sections. I recognize that it is very hard to have collaboration and natural conversation over zoom, but I wish there was more of an effort to have students work together to solve problems because I feel like we can learn a lot from each other and see different ways to look at the same things that might be helpful. My final weakness would be how office hours were held. If online again, I think investing in a way to have both students and TAs show work via some sort of virtual whiteboard feature would be really helpful since it was difficult to explain as a student what you were visualizing without being able to draw and present anything. \r\n\r\nStrengths of this course would be the many, many office hours that were offered. It was super easy to get help at most times and all the TAs were super available and willing to help. This was excellent. The professor also seemed generally excited about the material and interested in it, which was good. The homework component was good and the additional problems were helpful as a guide - I only wish solutions and explanations were made available for the additional problems.",
    "No real weaknesses. Quizzes could be a little more clear.",
    "This class was super well taught and extremely flexible with the grading, allowing me to truly spend time learning and understanding the material without worrying about my GPA. The support structure with TAs and office hour availability fostered a friendly and effective learning environment.",
    "The course moves very fast but nature of a summer course.",
    "It is very rapid, so it can be hard to keep up. The homework problem sets were well-designed, but the teaching could be confusing and hard to follow. It could be improved by eliminating sections and adding extra office hours for the TF's as well.",
    "There are very flexible office hours, and teaching fellows were extremely helpful. The class itself, however, was not particularly well taught. Professor Mehdi is kind, responsive, and cares about students, and this could be a product of the course being moved online, but his lectures are hard to follow, and I did not gain a conceptual understanding of the topics from class. There were frequently mistakes in answer keys for quizzes and practice tests (which made me second guess my understanding) and the lectures did not spend enough time unpacking the actual physical meaning of certain concepts.  We mostly worked through practice problems and spent time deriving, which while helpful, limited my understanding of the topics as they exist in the real world. I think the course could be improved by spending more time discussing how to develop an intuition about outcomes before we plug in numbers to equations.",
    "A strength is the amount of practice problems given as homework and practice tests before exams.\r\n\r\nA weakness is the speed. A topic would be introduced, one very basic sample problem would be given, and then we would move on. Often the homework was much more complex so in order to finish the assignments the class required a lot of self teaching.",
    "It was a typical STEM class, and it was taught fine, especially given the online circumstances. Sometimes the sections are unnecessarily long, though.",
    "Quizzes too difficult and not enough time.",
    "I think that the only weakness I would cite is having discussion sessions 15 minutes after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays it was difficult to remain engaged after doing Physics for such an extended period (9:30-10:45 and then 11-12).",
    "Professor is really kind and cares about students. Lectures are very fast paced but expected considering this is a summer course. I think if the professor could explain the examples a little more thoroughly: it is more worthwhile to go though one example clearly than four examples but rushed.\r\nI wish the quizzes matched the content of the lecture the day before: sometimes they were on content just taught and sometimes they were a week behind. I also think since the quizzes mattered little for the overall grade, it would have been less stressful to have a second try at the end of section (so we learn more in the end).",
    "Professor Mehdi was very accommodating and genuinely cared that we understood the course material. The only weakness I can think of is that because it was online, it was generally harder to be engaged.",
    "This course was very well done. The visual aspect tailors to visual learners and helps to clarify areas of potential confusion. The homework assignments are very helpful in providing practice and insight.",
    "Strengths: Mehdi, the professor. Absolutely the best part of the course, not only bc of his candor and geniality, but also bc of his domain knowledge of physics. Take this class with him! He will help you whenever you need it.",
    "Strengths: Professor was very dedicated. \r\nWeakness: Section was not very help in second half of course."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend phys 180 summer course because although it's tough and moves fast, you wont find a physics class as accomodating and helpful. the workload is definitely less compared to what you'd see in the school year and you can tell that professor mehdi and the TAs truly want you to learn physics and they really show their care and support.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to knock out a prereq\/major requirement. It's a good way to get a fundamental understanding of physics. The pace is very fast so if you don't have previous experience with physics, I would suggest not taking another summer course concurrently.",
    "i mean i would only take it if it was required, but it's not that bad",
    "I am not a science focused student and took this for a distributional requirement. I didnt realize that this course is geared towards those intending to major in physics. Still, would recommend. Professor Ghiassi-Nejad makes the material accessible to all students and will help you understand everything you need to know.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it as a good and lighter prerequisite to get out of the way, especially during the summer -- material is useful and is a good basis for understanding other courses.",
    "Sure, if you'd like to learn physics. In my experience, I have never taken physics so this class was very challenging especially it being during the summer and as fast paced as it was. If you have taken physics before, it should be easy\/manageable, as many students who I took this class with had an easier time grasping onto concepts or working on the problems than I did as they had taken AP physics or had a good background in physics...",
    "Yes and the professor is great.",
    "Yes, this is very applicable to anyone going into STEM. I would certainly recommend taking this course over the summer because it would be very hard to manage if taken over the fall semester.",
    "Yes, if you don't mind online format, this course works well.",
    "I think a lot of people who take this course, have to because of major requirements. In that case, this question is somewhat irrelevant. If you don't like physics, definitely do not take it. I took physics in high school, hated it, and did not enjoy taking more physics (but I had to). However, if you have never taken physics before and are interested, this course will definitely give you a good introduction into what basic, general physics is all about, and if you hate, you know it's not for you. And if you love it, great. Some people really seem to 'get' physics, others don't, and this course is difficult and not built for someone who doesn't quite 'get' physics. It's not the kind of course you can just put your head down and grind it out and just become super successful at it, and it is super fast-paced so if there is a lot going on in your life, this would not be the best option as it is rather time consuming for the entire duration.",
    "Yes as it provides a good foundation for key physics concepts.",
    "Yes, Taking it online was very normal and the teaching staff was there to support at all times.",
    "Yes. But I probably wouldn't recommend for just a science credit. However, for those taking it for their major, it is not that bad.",
    "Absolutely yes; I had a pretty awful physics experience in highschool and was honestly pretty scared of physics after that but this class gave me the courage to approach physics again in the future. I'm not scared anymore and that's a great start.",
    "Yes, this is a necessary course for several STEM majors. Taking it over the summer is VERY fast-paced, but it is 100% doable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if it was not online. The class is convenient and helps fulfill a requirement and it is efficient. That said, students need to be proactive and spend time outside of class learning the material, since the online lectures are not sufficient. If the class were in person I suspect these problems would be less extreme!",
    "If you want to get physics out of the way doing YSS is a good idea. Just be prepared for the pace. It'll take up a lot of your time over the summer.",
    "Yes. Professor and TAs did a great job with the online.",
    "If you absolutely need it, take it. During the summer you'll have a lot more time to dedicate to it.",
    "It's a good way to get the Physics sequence done and focus on one subject for the summer. Esp for a lot of premeds, they are not looking to do many more physics classes so the summer physics course is probably a good fit. Just be conscious of how much time it can take: the class can really take up all your time if you are not careful. Make sure you keep that in check while you take this course and go have a life too! It's summer after all",
    "Yes, a physics class or two is required for many majors, and I think PHYS180 is a great way to fulfill the requirement. The physics you learn is pretty interesting, the math isn't too difficult, and the professor is very helpful and cares that you succeed.",
    "I would recommend this course. Concepts are very well-explained and I left it with a new-found sense of confidence in my physical understanding of the world around me.",
    "Certainly. This is a great class to take in the summer, learning some really interesting science in a low-stress environment. I had never taken a physics class before, but I have a very strong math background. This class was quite easy, even balancing coursework with a job. Exams are fair, bordering on trivial. If you need this class for your major, or even if you just need a chill Sc credit, take this class!",
    "Yes, if you don't want to take a full year of physics."
