You'll be able to read anything in Hindi by the end of the semester, and probably will be able to have a conversation with people about your day.",

The workload was good--enough to retain information from class but not too overwhelming.\r\nWeaknesses: this wasn't anyone's fault, but the conversation section didn't feel cohesive with the class because the TA didn't know what we had and hadn't learned."

Even if you feel that you personally struggle a lot with learning foreign languages and\/or are worried you'll lose interest, you'll end the semester feeling great, having learned a lot, and excited to continue learning Hindi.",
                "Yes! If you're going to take a language, Hindi with Swapna Ji is fun and you learn a lot. With any language, there's a lot of workload and you meet everyday of the week, but Swapna Ji makes it fun by letting us learn through songs or talking about our days.",

                "Would highly recommend! I am taking this class for fun and it has been so rewarding.  It's cool to look back and see how much progress you can make in just one semester.  Hindi is a beautiful language and the grammar (so far) isn't too hard.  It's also cool to be able to write in another script."
