                "This course forced a high level of engagement because of the pure number of assignments and evaluations. This meant that I was constantly working and retaining the language, however some of the assignments felt unnecessary (all of the projects, etc.). It was difficult to stay on top of all of the small assignments and weird due dates (some over the weekend, etc.). However, I liked the format of finishing worksheets at home and going over them in class in groups to share our answers and correct our work. It felt more efficient than using class time to complete the assignments. I wish we had talked more in a casual setting in the class. I think I would have felt more prepared for the oral exam if we had done this.",
                "I think we could have spent more time on grammar during class",
                "This course not only teaches grammar and vocabulary, but also immerses students in topics of cultural significance through its projects. I liked how in addition to teaching the rules of the language, it also gave students a deeper look of the worldwide impact of the language.",
                "Strengths are the structure and opportunities for tutoring",
                "I believe that in person lectures will be better than online learning, but this lecture format still did well despite this weakness."

                "I think this course used breakout rooms well because it is really important to collaborate with peers and talk, both about the assignments and more casual Spanish conversation. I actually felt like I got to know people in my class, which I can't say for any of my other Zoom classes. Additionally, the exams,  compositions, and presentations were smoothly run, despite the added difficulties of Zoom. I can't think of anything specific to be improved. Language classes are better in person, but there isn't anything that the class could do to improve that - I think they made the best of the situation.",

                "I think this course has adapted well to being remote. Even though we only met three times a week, there were enough activities to keep students engaged in learning the language including exercises and movie assignments. There were also plenty of opportunities to work with other students and have exchanges in Spanish. I think conversation was very helpful in practicing what we have learned.",
