                "In the beginning of the semester, I felt like I was learning how to read Greek. After only one year of Attic, there were elements in this class that were not introduced to me but expected of me, such as identifying why certain cases or constructions were used. I was also expected to sight read with little practice. I was really discouraged by this because at the beginning of the semester, the instructor gave the impression that we would move at a pace beneficial to everyone. Unfortunately, this class was apparently above my level, and the instructor told me to just read Smythe or make appointments elsewhere to improve my sight reading.",
                "I got a lot better at translating Greek and, especially, Homer. In addition, I am a bit more sensitive to fluctuations between different dialects of Ancient Greek. Oh, and last but not least: I am much more confident at sight-reading than I used to be!"

                "The strengths of this class were the supplemental readings about Homeric violence. The weakness of this course was that the expectations were never made clear. At the beginning of the semester, it seemed like the instructor would work with where we were at. This was not the reality of the class and was apparent based on interactions with the instructor during office hours. This could have been improved by prefacing the class is for people who are familiar with Smythe and case usages as well as sight reading because review of these concepts in-class or in office hours was minimal.",
                "Reading Homer really helps you develop confidence in translating Greek due to the repetition of certain epithets or expressions. It was highly enjoyable whenever we read epic traditions from other cultures, since we got the chance to compare and contrast these literatures. \r\n\r\nAnd how could it be improved? I would have liked for the course to have incorporated readings outside of our daily translations of Homer. It was exciting to learn more about how \"epic\" can be both universal and particularI would have liked to have experienced a couple more of those \"aha!\" moments.",

                "No, because the expectations coming into this class were incredibly unclear. I am also confused about the utility of office hours. It seems the instructor has some idea about what they are to be used for, but has not told the class what that is. In an attempt to learn the way that is best for me to learn, I tried to review lines with the instructor, and was told, \"Val, it is not my job to repeat what we did in class.\"",
                "Yes. If you want to learn more Greek, then you should really consider this course. Homer is a fun read and, due to the repetition of epithets and certain phrases, you can really develop your vocabulary. You'll also develop other important skills, such as sight-reading and knowledge of the culture.",
