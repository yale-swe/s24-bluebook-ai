I learned how to write freely, challenge my inner critic, and engage with different theatrical techniques, and through having my work read out loud, I learned so much about my own writing style.",

                "I learned a lot about playwriting as an art form and where my voice could go with it. I also got a grip on what my voice sounds like as a writer and what I'm trying to say.",
                "This course was one of the must fulfilling courses I have taken at Yale College. Professor Margolin is a wonderful professor and incredible playwright. Participating in her class taught me more about playwriting than I could ever have hoped for, and allowed me to explore my writing in a safe and incredibly creative atmosphere."

                "While the class focused mostly on creating opportunities for generation (it was a generative workshop) I do wish that more time had been spent analysing plays and playwriting techniques."
