                "Developed a much deeper understanding of fluid mechanics through the classes on transport. Moreover, I learned how to apply concepts of enzyme kinetics to problems within pharmacology.

            "comments": [
                "The strengths are that KMJ explains the material well and there are two sections you can attend which are helpful. Although KMJ is great, her class is extremely difficult. The biggest weakness is the midterm project. It is so long and we receive very little instruction on how to actually do the MATLAB part of it. The midterm project was over 20 pages long of so many calculations, explanations and MATLAB and excel plots and interpretations. It was so difficult and if you didn't devote your spring break to working on it, you were very behind. This should have been the final project in place of having a final. Do not underestimate how high the workload is in this class",
                "Overall a terrific class, and I really got a lot out of it. The only thing is sometimes I felt it was may be the tiniest bit disorganized Im really not impactful to the course at all",
                "KMJ is a fantastic lecturer and the course is very interesting. My biggest suggestion for improvement would be to post annotated notes on Canvas as even if you take good notes in class it can still be very helpful to supplement with her notes for psets. Often on canvas the slides for a derivation were blank as they were done in class.",
                "The course is taught very well, but it sometimes becomes difficult to understand how this content could be applied in a real world setting outside of academia. We learn a lot about how to apply differential equations to construct enzyme binding and diffusion models, but I'm still not entirely sure how I would use this knowledge. Even though the content was difficult, I still have the impression that I learned a very basic level of biological modeling, but I feel like this would only ever be used for modeling a system in academia. In terms of how the course is run, lectures are very engaging, and TF sections are helpful for figuring out how to do psets. However, it gets pretty frustrating that psets take so much time and work, but are only worth 15% of your grade.",
                "This is a very well-organized course and Prof. Miller-Jensen does a great job of teaching and running it. I do wish that psets would be a little more manageable without having to seek outside help - sometimes if we do attempt it alone we could waste a lot of time as opposed to waiting until office hours to set up the question.",
                "The professor is a massive strength as she make the material engaging and very applicable to the real world.",
                "The phrasing of several of the assignments is difficult to interpret both the intention of the question and what parameters we are/are not allowed to make.",
                "Strengths: Prof KMJ is so knowledgeable, organized (!!), and understanding. Her lectures were very well structured and engaging. The material is very relevant and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: the PSETs are pretty difficult and time consuming (and nearly impossible to complete without friends and TFs), so it would be nice if they contributed more to our final grade. It was disappointing that the midterm project was worth more than all the PSETs combined, considering they took 5-10 hours each week to complete.",
                "This course evaluates knowledge in many ways such as a project, problem sets, and exams. Also, there are many opportunities to interact with both the teachers and TFs.",
                "The class was well structured and the material was covered very well. I would say that the PSETs were very time consuming and that I wish they were worth more of our grade based on the amount of work we had to do for them.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting material. The information in the class is taught in an intuitive way. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Probably some of the hardest psets I've done at Yale so far.",
                "This course was so much work and I definitely learned a lot but the psets and projects and exams were some of the most difficult at all. I think their was a lot on matlab that also made it hard. I think less matlab would make this course less stressful",
                "Strengths: Dr. Miller-Jensen is an amazing instructor and she always ensures that people are caught up and understanding the class material by checking in and clarifying when people ask questions. The class material itself is very engaging and relevant for those interested in the molecular side of biomedical engineering. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Psets are unnecessarily long, complicated, and unclear such that you cannot succeed unless you make it to TA sections every week. Expect to spend 5-10 hours a week on them. The Ed discussion portal was helpful but was not frequently updated, especially before exams.",
                "I believe that the grading distribution is a weakness given that the PSETS should be worth more than 15% of the overall grade as they are much more challenging than other classes. This class emphasizes exams which is a fair move but the reward of steady and consistent effort throughout the semester should also matter. A key strength of the course is the way in which Professor Miller-Jensen is highly engaging with the material and is always open to answering questions."
