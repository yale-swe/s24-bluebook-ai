    "I really gained a better sense of how to examine shows from many different aspects and analyze them.",
    "Not much... learned how to watch TV somewhat analytically",
    "I learned that TV has become more complex. I learned about lighting, costuming, camera angles. this was all in the first 2 weeks. after that it was pointless to go to class and do the homework.",
    "This course provided an intro to story arcs in TV; visual techniques like camera operation, color, composition; and other creative storytelling techniques that contemporary complex TV has introduced.

I learned how to analyze lighting, sound, dialogue, and other visual storytelling elements of specific episodes, and we also looked at literary, Biblical, and historical references in some of the shows we watched. I learned about title sequences, the differences between diegetic and non-diegetic sound, and we also got to see snippets of actual scripts from the show Professor Jewiss works on.",

   "comments": [
    "This course wasnt well structured from the outset it seems. Assignments were set far in advance, but details of them wouldnt be posted until very close to the due date. The content of the course seemed to repeat and cover the same ground for weeks. Many of the insights and comparisons seemed to be reaching and slightly far fetched at times.",
    "Way too much work for what the course is. Should be a writing credit with how much mindless typing we had to do, and most of our daily writing assignments are just for a participation grade. The amount of work was absurd.",
    "There was an absurd amount of work for this class. We usually had five paragraphs due every single class period on top of two presentations and three essays. The professor assigned us this work often the night before and would swtich the assignment several times. The syllabus changed almost every day. I usually enjoyed the lectures themselves, at least towards the beginning of the course. At the beginning we focused on one show and looked at clips. Later the professor started just talking without showing anything or analyzing anything and it got boring. She called people out during class in a very rude way and was also rude about the athletes in the class, making comments that insinuated that they were not smart. She made comments such as \"you should know this\" or \"as you all already know\" which i feel like is a basic don't do in teaching. She shamed students for not having read certain texts and made them feel bad for it. The classroom did not feel at all like a safe space because she would call people out, cold call, and made rude comments about students that did not have certain prior knowledge. She changed the course as it went and often left her TAs in the dark. She announced a month in that you now had to participate during lecture which i have never even heard of. She skipped around in shows and posted shows hours before we needed to watch them. Also, don't take this class if you don't want spoilers because she ruined the ending of every show she discussed.",
    "It was nice to watch television for assignments, but the syllabus changed radically throughout the course, and the professor did not always seem receptive to questions or comments.",
    "The strengths of this course is the topic and the discussion sections. There are very little classes offered on television at Yale, so I really hope there will be more courses on this topic in the future. Discussion sections were also helpful in having people break down the shows more extensively.\r\n\r\nThere were an egregious number of weaknesses to the course. The first thing I would say is that the course is structured terribly and bites off far more than it can chew content wise. We were assigned 3-4 episodes every Tuesday and Thursday with paragraph long reading responses for each episode. These needed to be turned in on Canvas by 9AM before class, or else the student would get a 0. Additionally, some sections had to turn in a hard copy of each reading response in addition to the Canvas copy, and failure to do so would result in an automatic \"C\" on the assignment. In order to watch and critically respond to complex television, you need to watch the episode in its entirety at least once, probably twice. Just in watch time alone, that's already 3 up to 8 hours every Tuesday and Thursday. Often, we would skip entire seasons or watch episodes out of order, making it incredibly difficult to analyze the intention behind cinematic choices without any narrative context to a show's arc or its characters. These assignments were consistent throughout the entire semester, and aside from receiving occasional feedback from our TA's were never mentioned again. From these 3-4 episodes, maybe three scenes at most were actually discussed in class. Professor Jewis scarcely brought up our reading responses in lecture and probably didn't even read them at all. In other words, this class was a ton of busy work with no reward.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness of the course was that no one involved in teaching the course (not Virginia Jewis nor the TA's) has an extensive film background. TA's often made observations on par with that of their students because they didn't know what to look for, focus on, or how to analyze television in an effective manner. I absolutely think Film majors should stay away from this course despite the awesome topic because any film majors will be completely frustrated by the lack of intellectual challenge in conjunction with the consistent workload. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, major elements of the syllabus were completely changed on Canvas without any class explanation. Prof Jewis would just make the assignment on Canvas and wait multiple classes before mentioning or explaining the assignment. We didn't know we had a final assignment until very late in the semester. On the very last section of the semester, our TA literally told us that they had no idea what our final assignment (20% of our grade) was.",
    "i think that if the amount of writing stays the same, it should be a writing credit, but otherwise I think the assignments towards the end of the semester were a much more reasonable way of having us respond to the content",
    "The class didn't really teach much. The beginning couple of lectures were very interesting and engaging, but became quite dry and repetitive after a couple of weeks. The lecture hall became quite empty until attendance was made mandatory. The class requires a lot of time. Classes meet twice a week, and it is not unusual for four hours worth of television (not to mention writing assignments about those episodes) to be assigned as homework two days in advance.",
    "nothing about the structure of this class was clear to the TA's or the students.",
    "The lectures were abysmal and the workload was excessive. We covered so little of what we watched in class, and the lectures just felt like personal pontifications of a Dante-obsessed philosophy professor who happened to get her hands on a box set of the best TV of the past couple decades. Then she decided to ruin that TV for the next generation.",
    "The professor could definitely been more organized on getting our assignments on canvas on time, often she would post them the night before they were due and justify it by saying \"that's how it is in the TV world.\"",
    "Strengths: The class is SO interesting, great topic, and actually changed my way of understanding and watching TV\/entertainment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof Jewiss did not seem to have a real plan going into each lecture; it felt like she rambled for 50 minutes and then let us leave. She also assigned a SIGNIFICANT amount of work throughout the semester; 6 hours of TV a week is somewhat unfeasible and makes the sheer amount of TV you watch less enjoyable, rather than potentially watching one episode and picking apart different things. The quantity of weekly tv was too much.",
    "For a film major, this class is somewhat basic in its actual discussion of film theories and focuses much more on the storytelling aspects from the lens of literature. The organization also needs some work and the workload was too heavy at times.",
    "Strengths: good choices of shows, the TAs were great\r\n\r\nWeakness: the Professor",
    "Professor Jewiss needs to focus more on the structure of the class. Most of the time it felt like she was just winging it, especially with the assignments, and it made me really frustrated with the class.",
    "The course was really interesting and a fun way to look at a rarely-examined field. It definitely had some growing pains (it was switched from a seminar to a lecture during shopping period), such as unclear expectations and a quickly-changing syllabus, but overall was enjoyable.",
    "The course focuses too much on \"busy work,\" which involves watching 3-4 hours of television, readings, and writing critical responses for those episodes before each class. In addition, the responses aren't really involved in class discussion or lecture, and thus feels like a fruitless exercise meant to make the class feel not like a gut. It was not intellectually rewarding to write all of that, and felt like it rewarded those who just pumped out quantity instead of perhaps wanting to focus on a smaller selection with quality.",
    "The fact that we look at many different shows is very good, but I think all the shows lie in the same realm, which can get very boring and very limiting in terms of how we examine television, so more diverse content would be better.",
    "it was WAY too much work",
    "Everything about this class, except the talented TF I was assigned was horrible. The lectures were completely irrelevant to the topic. I feel like I wasted my time in this class. The quantity of homework was ridiculous considering you stopped benefiting from the tediousness of it after the first month.",
    "The course covers very interesting and fun material, it is a great class to take with friends so you can watch the TV together and talk about it, then analyze on your own. The organization of the course could be improved, perhaps by focusing on individual episodes at the beginning to get a sense of various storytelling techniques, and then moving on to one whole show to employ the analytical skills we developed. The best part of the course was the extensive focus on Breaking Bad, so it might be more beneficial to choose fewer shows and really dive into them.",
    "Great topic, great course, a STUPID amount of work. This course was extremely interesting and attractive to many students on campus and the class jumped in size from a small seminar to a large lecture. However, the professor was constantly worried that her class would be perceived as easy and as a result she assigned 4+ hours of homework for each class. This class was not a writing credit but I easily wrote twice as much for this class as I did for actual writing credits.",
    "The shows that we watched and analyzed were fantastic. I enjoyed basically all of them. I would've liked the class to be more organized. The syllabus was always changing, and things just weren't really set in stone. I would've liked for our classtime to be used to look at a greater variety of topics and scenes instead of focusing too much on only a few clips.",
    "Lectures could be more structured, focused, and varied instead of purely analysis of scenes",
    "A good overview of \"complex TV,\" but asking us to watch the finales of shows we hadn't watched through was not great, both for selfish reasons and because you can't really analyze the way a series if wrapping up if you haven't seen the series.",
    "Content of class was runny and often redundant; TA section was more informative. It should be noted that this class was intended to be a seminar, not a lecture, so this shouldn't be faulted at the professor.",
    "Since the syllabus isn't fixed, it is extremely hard to plan ahead for the intense workload of this class. I would recommend the professor having a set syllabus with assignments released far enough in advance, as well as some sort of set guidelines\/rubric for how reading responses and long-form essays should be written.",
    "This is the worst class at Yale.",
    "The course was incredibly unorganized, to the point where it became more of a burden than a learning experience. I think that this could have been a genuinely beneficial class, especially for students who are interested in this industry, but unfortunately the class had zero focus. The syllabus was constantly changing, with the excuse that \"this is how things work in the TV world.\" A classroom is not the television industry, nor should it be treated as such to students who need structure in order to be able to deal with their other classes and commitments.",
    "This class would have been much better as a seminar, not a lecture (which is was the professor intended anyways).",
    "I'm not evens sure where to begin. This course is all weaknesses. Let's start at the workload cuz I know that's what you, my fellow students, care about. We had to write paragraph responses for every episode of a show that we were assigned, and we were often assigned many episodes in between lecture meetings. Not only was this so much work, but it was also mindless work, not only because there was rarely something worth analyzing in depth in EACH episode, but also because anything of substance had to be severely truncated to also be a concise paragraph. And she added a SIX PAGE PAPER weeks into the class and made it due (originally) a week and a half after it was assigned. She constantly changed the syllabus (sometimes even the day before an assignment was due) and dismissed any concerns or questions about these methods, either with her characteristic smugness or with the ridiculous adage \"In the TV world, you have to adapt to constant changes.\" Thanks, Shonda. And lectures. Lectures were boring and repetitive: Jewiss only played back scenes with rare, if any, insights into new ways of understanding the camera or the material on screen. (My favorite in-class observation of hers was that, in Breaking Bad, the viewer experiences different moods if they watch the show without sound and with sound; innovative, I know). There was an appalling centering of whiteness in the shows chosen - from Breaking Bad, to Mad Men, to Game of Thrones, to The Sopranos. The departures from this were white-feminism extravaganza The Handmaid's Tale, n-word-loving-Gina-Rodriguez-leading Jane the Virgin, and The Wire (this show bangs tbh but still). There was little structure or critical, sustained engagement with the assigned TV shows. Except for Breaking Bad (of which we watched 3 seasons in an incredibly unsustainable condensed time-frame), we jumped around the assigned shows, making it impossible to have incisive observations about narrative structure, character development, themes, and even motifs. We did almost none of the sustained work that makes an interesting TV-centered class. Jewiss engaged almost no critical theory in the class, as well. We were assigned one piece on \"Difficult Men\" (aptly titled as such) and another on the transition of TV from \"Beats to Arcs\" (even more aptly titled). Can you believe that we watched Mad Men without discussing the male gaze and its near-unavoidable reproduction in camera work? We watched Breaking Bad and The Wire without discussing the dynamics of race, policing, power, and poverty that control the drug trade! There was rarely any teaching done. Jewiss did so little to add to our critical knowledge of the TV medium that every assignment was the same, and even worse because of it. This was just a poorly-taught film class that happened to use television as the work of study.",
    "This class was great in theory but not so much in practice. \r\n\r\nTake a shot every time the professor brags about her job (which is very cool, dont get me wrong, but every single lecture, multiple times and not humbly???), talks about Dante, or uselessly draws an X on the board to represent a narrative pattern. \r\n\r\nYoull need this shot when she somehow makes the connection that Columbus Day is a day to celebrate immigrants. Or when she monopolizes an interview with Yahlin Chang, an amazing writer and co-executive producer of The Handmaids Tale, with tangents about herself. Or when she claims that people stop her on the street in Rome to tell her, a script translator, to never change the opening credits because she obviously has this power and name recognition. Or when she tries to brag about where she got her glasses from by saying that theyre from the same store as the glasses that Jude Law wears. Or when she makes attendance mandatory after failing to engage the class that causes the drastic drop in attendance in the first place. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is a little harsh, because she does have cool insights sometimes.\r\n\r\nI also think that the conversion from seminar to lecture threw off the course content, and I extremely disliked how we were assigned work that would take at least a couple hours the day before. I really felt like these last-minute assignments were very unfair, especially because I had heavy workload classes.",
    "I think this class would greatly benefit from having slightly more structured lecture, because I found that at times the lectures seemed to be somewhat circular, and could repeat some of the main themes.",
    "Strengths are the shows that were chosen (Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Jane the Virgin, etc)\r\nThe biggest weakness was the lack of structure. Lectures were always at least four episodes behind where we were in our watching assignments and it was difficult to understand what the point of the lectures was. Also, the workload ridiculously high in terms of sheer hours the course demanded and this must be recalibrated if the class were to return next fall. \r\nAlthough it is important to learn the language of shots, timing, editing, etc, once we learned that, that was all we did for the whole semester. My critical responses to episodes were at the same level of analysis 2 weeks into the course as 12 weeks into it. The endgame of the course needs to have someplace else to go, essentially. \r\nAlso, the readings should either be eliminated or integrated into the course more fully.",
    "I think the quality of interaction between the professor and her students could have been improved.",
    "Strengths: There was never a dull day in lecture. I have no idea why people decided to stop coming, because I greatly enjoyed what Professor Jewiss had to say, and EVERY time. I feel bad for those that chose not to come, because they really missed out! The class covers a wide breadth of television shows, from Breaking Bad in the beginning, to Mad Men, The Sopranos, Jane the Virgin, Game of Thrones, to the Young Pope in the end. The wide variety of genres made it feel less restrictive, because for a while it felt like we were only talking about Breaking Bad, but when we switched gears, the interest re-ignited. Professor Jewiss is a brilliant lecturer, and the historical references, the \"quoting\" of other stories\/storytellers was very fascinating. We also had a wonderful class meeting with Yahlin Chang, YC '94, a writer and producer for the Handmaid's Tale--a really great opportunity to meet someone else working presently in the field, and hear her insights. What other class has homework where you watch TV? And good, quality, complex TV?\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the time we would watch an episode\/several episodes, and neglect to discuss them in lecture. Sure, it's fun to watch TV, but I have a lot of things to do for homework, and the excessive watching wasn't really necessary. We also had these \"binge-weekends\" where we had anywhere from 4 to 6 episodes to watch, sometimes encouraged to watch more, which would definitely impose difficulties in terms of simply time allotted. While the lectures and content we were covering was fascinating, we were kind of left in the dark as to what the expectations of the course were; Jewiss would tell us that this was the life of working in television, doing things on the spot and expecting rapid changes, which, while it may be correct, is not super conducive to a college course. While I did well in the course, I know other people were suffering because of the vague directions in assignments, or lack of clear expectations.",
    "The strength lies in its originality and the intertextuality of putting non-TV works in conversation with TV series. The class's main weakness was its poor transformation from a seminar to a lecture; most TFs were not interested in or informed on the subject, the massive amount of written responses were certainly worthy of a writing credit, and the structure, themes and grading methods across sections were different enough to be different courses. It was widely unfair given that the standards and expectations set by the TFs were drastically different, and people in the same course had to put in completely different amounts of work.",
    "A lot of work - 6-7 episodes per week + analysis",
    "I think the first unit of the course that focused on breaking bad was very strong and each lectured created a foundation for the course. However in the other two sections the lectures felt a bit repetitive and unstructured. I also felt that section time would have been better if it incorporated discussion about the episodes we had just watched.",
    "Only weaknesses. Absolutely no strengths. Extreme waste of time, ridiculous level of passive engagement, disorganization, student frustration, etc. The list is indefinite.",
    "This class could definitely improve by having more structure in the way the section works alongside the course. Lecture had so much we could talk about but many times we went over similar things. However, I learned to see shows differently and am interested in learning more. I enjoyed writing the episode reviews but the class could have been a writing credit. I enjoyed reviewing them at the end of the course as a reflection.",
    "The lectures are frankly difficult to sit through. The curriculum lacks structure and the assignments are arbitrary. This course would be better as a seminar.",
    "Weakness: class was not engaging, we had to write about and watch so many TV episodes that we never even talked about in class. We also had every good show spoiled for us for no reason. The goal of the class was to identify storytelling techniques, but we jumped around in shows and season and it was hard to follow to plot line of any show.",
    "The organization of assignments and how much work was scheduled throughout the semester felt less clear compared to other Yale courses.",
    "This course needs a complete restructuring in order for students to garner an actual understanding of modern television. The course makes little to no progress in addressing the questions it sets up from the beginning (understanding what makes these shows as great\/greater film--historically considered the more artistic medium--or how the medium of television is utilized in a more compelling manner than it has been historically). Instead, the course shows a handful of episodes from prominent and popular television shows. For a course so focused on television, rarely did episode or show analysis focus on unique aspects of the television medium, rather shows were analyzed and considered much like films are analyzed in film studies, and, therefore, the value of taking a television course was lost. As a film major, the value I thought the course would bring to my education is a greater and more in-depth look and understanding of television--how contemporary shows have taken advantage of the medium--rather than deconstructing scenes the same way film scenes are deconstructed. Moreover, these deconstructions were often insufficient to the standards of the rest of the film major, speaking to a larger problem of the course which is its inability to exist as course for majors or nonmajors. That is to say, I sympathize with the nonmajors that were thrown into long analysis without much introduction, and as a film major, found it frustrating to engage in a course that did not properly with terms and concepts from FILM 150. The course could be greatly improved if it considered only one or two shows, looking more closely at how characters are developed, what questions are posed the beginning of the season and answered by the end, and how the show changes over time or stays true to its voice. Moreover, larger questions of the industry could be asked with this set up as well such as shows that were made before streaming versus after. By far the most successful portion of the course (although not without its flaws) was the section on Breaking Bad, where we spent the most amount of time with one show and where the lectures were the most planned out.",
    "The television shows picked could've been more diverse. There are many highly regarded, \"prestige\" television shows starring women and people of color that could've been added to the course. Additionally, I would suggest picking fewer tv shows and really diving into those like we did Breaking Bad. It wasn't very helpful to only watch a handful of episodes of shows like The Affair and The Wire  would've been better to have more time to spend on the shows we watched.",
    "Strengths: focuses on some well-known and critically acclaimed tv series, allows self-growth\r\nWeaknesses: constantly evolving syllabus with short-notice assignments, expects you to watch too much tv, doesn't discuss all the material that students are expected to watch\/read",
    "This course had the potential to be the most interesting course ever. But, the professor didn't have a clue what she was trying to teach nor how to teach in general. A new professor who actually has a lesson plan that doesn't change weekly and a goal for what the students should be learning would be an improvement. Don't take this class with Virginia Jewiss. Don't do it to yourself.",
    "The constantly changing syllabus presented logistical problems. I understand that in the world of television, deadlines and assignments can change at a moments notice, but locking assignments and thereby forcing students to complete work the night before it was due for the sake of realism and flexibility to change assignments was not respectful of the fact that students have other courses and obligations outside of this course.",
    "Syllabus, when stuck to, was very strong. I thought the organization made a lot of sense, starting specific, widening out, and ending specific. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness was the disorganization. While I understand the professor saying we need to be on our toes to work in TV, many students have other things we need to plan around and not having a consistent syllabus was frustrating. There was also a point where I stopped doing the readings as we were frequently about a week behind the syllabus in lecture and by the time professor Jewiss would reference something, it would have been 10 days since I had read it.",
    "It was horrible, she had no plan and no curriculum and she changed the syllabus every single week which is not even allowed according to Yale academic rules.",
    "I really did not enjoy the lectures. Professor Jewiss seemed to talk in a stream of consciousness manner most of the time, and I did not feel like I gained much from any of the lectures.",
    "The syllabus moved very quickly. I think there should have been fewer episodes assigned for each week. But section was great, and I learned a lot from my peers and TA.",
    "strengths: course content; themes to each lecture; use of clips\/media in class; guest lectures and speakers were engaging and interesting; my TF was wonderful \r\nweaknesses: unclear assignment directions; many changes to the syllabus were hard to keep up with (for example, we had to do a presentation in section with only a few days notice); hours of work every night (in addition to watching the television episodes, we had to write paragraphs about each one of them and complete readings, which was very labor intensive); difficult to make sense of\/write about shows when we only saw one or two episodes; sometimes lecture themes became repetitive; older, white\/male television shows were chosen as the primary focus of the course (not representative of the current TV climate\/what is relevant to students); sections met on science hill (very far away from where class was held)\r\nimprovements: make fewer changes to the syllabus\/clarify expectations of course from the outset; possibly look at only one or two television shows rather than many; further clarify ideas\/themes of lectures; incorporate more diverse television shows; change the location of section meetings to be closer to main campus",
    "it was interesting but unstructured",
    "The strength of this course was its subject material, where by reading the syllabus and course material, it is easily inferred that the content is very interesting to study. However, the manner in which the content was delivered by our professor corrupted the potential this course had, as they only focused on very specific scenes while assigning an enormous amount of episodes to watch, and her focus on the content material was lacking, as she had no clear structure in the lecture. The most significant weakness of the course was the workload. As a student at Yale, this course gave more work than any other course I have taken, which would be more understandable if that's what the professor put on the syllabus, but the syllabus was highly altered after shopping period, slowly revealing the amounts of writing students were responsible without knowing it from shopping period. Additionally, the amount of writing in this class was uncalled for, as not only is the class not a writing credit, but the assignments weren't of any depth, and yet what I consider busy work. However, don't let it fool you, the busy work would take up to 8-9 hours a week to complete, as the professor assigned a unholy amount of work.",
    "Strengths:\r\nThe material is interesting! These are really amazing TV shows. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThis was intended to be a seminar but was turned into a lecture at the last minute. Because of this, the course was very unorganized. The syllabus changed almost every day, and often times grading and assignments were very unclear. There was a culture of distrust and frustration throughout the entire class. \r\nDue to time, we often had to skip around. We would watch the beginning and end of a series, and I feel like some of the shows were ruined for me.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics, shows; guest speakers; creative elements that are discussed; discussion sections and projects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures lack structure, deep dives into topics that may not interest you, too many assignments",
    "This course spent very little time on many units (e.x. our unit on The Wire), and we covered them very superficially. The lectures were not very fruitful in my opinion."

    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I dont feel as though I gained much from it.",
    "No no no. I took this course because it was something different than my typical courses (econ, math, etc.) and looked fun - watching TV and writing about it. But no. Professor Jewiss changed the syllabus close to 10 different times and added a slew of new assignments throughout the semester; in addition, she and my TA were very disorganized and unclear as to what they wanted in the different assignments. I thought this would just be a fun class to take, but I had to Credit\/D it mid-semester just to be able to keep my sanity for my other classes and not worry about getting a bad grade. In short, this class is NOT JUST A FUN CLASS IN WHICH YOU WATCH TV AND TALK ABOUT IT. It is way more work than any class of this sort should be. I would have dropped it ASAP if I didn't need the credit. Plus, the shows we ended up watching were very suggestive and objectively strange. For your own sake, don't take this class.",
    "I would tell the student to take the course if it was not taught by the professor. I really enjoyed analyzing TV and I learned a lot about film. However, as discussed above, the teacher was disorganized and rude to students. She made mean comments about athletes and assigned a ton of work the night before. She would post one assignment on the syllabus and then when you went to submit it the assignment on canvas had changed and you had to redo it. The TAs often didn't know how to answer our questions because they did not get clear feedback. You were forced to jump so much around in shows that you learned less.",
    "Um... like, if you want to watch an immense amount of long television episodes. Yes. The shows can be very gruesome however. The workload is quite a lot, and it is also repetitive work. The same assignments but with different subjects.",
    "Absolutely not. I was so excited for this course when I saw it on Canvas because classes on television are rarely offered at Yale, but never before have I been so sorely disappointed by a course. It ruined many legendary television shows on my list to watch because I had to watch series' finales for class assignments as well as other episodes out of order without any feedback on my assignments. The professor is rude, arrogant, and doesn't respect her students at all. None of the TA's had backgrounds in film. It was a complete waste of time.",
    "No. Not much is taught, yet there is a lot of work. The lectures are not that interesting and infuriatingly repetitive, most of it is not relevant to assignments.",
    "nope.",
    "No, the lectures were terrible and we skipped around so much in the TV shows without actually covering it that it just spoiled a lot of great TV for me.",
    "I would, only because I actually got a lot out of the course and I thought it was fun learning about TV in this way. However, be wary of how much tv she assigns each week and that she's a bit rambling of a lecturer (I think she's probably better in a seminar setting). If you can deal with that, and you really enjoy watching Tv, then you'll probably get as much as I did out of it.",
    "This is not the class for someone who is hoping to breeze through based on the name alone. The professor expects the student to watch 4-8 hours of television every week along with a written paragraph about details from each episode. The course was also very disorganized, in part because it was being converted from a seminar to a lecture. If the shows listed on the syllabus interest you, however, this can be a great way to gain a better appreciation of the value of television and how you as a viewer can get the most out of the shows that you watch.",
    "Not with the current professor.",
    "I would not until the course is more structured. I don't think it's well facilitated for student learning. Also, the TA's were not film students and most of them seemed like they didn't want to be there.",
    "I would, as long as the student is prepared to put in a lot of work and watch a lot of TV.",
    "This is a very time consuming class, and may not pose the intellectual reward you might be searching for when coming across a TV-writing class.",
    "Absolutely not. Way too much work to not have ANYTHING you worked on or read about reviewed in lecture. Only saving grace was if you had a good TA.",
    "I think it is very intriguing to learn about the different storytelling techniques that each show uses, something that almost anyone could get behind, so I would recommend it to just about anyone.",
    "No! I took this as a gut and it turned out to be my most time-consuming course! And I'm a pre-med student...",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. DO NOT TAKE ANY COURSE WITH PROFESSOR JEWISS.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the TV shows listed in the syllabus and in taking some kind of film\/TV analysis course. I had never seen Breaking Bad and I ended up finishing the whole show with my friends because we got so into it. There are a lot of little writing assignments that can start to add up, and of course TV watching actually takes a lot of time, so be ready to commit.",
    "No, absolutely not. Watch breaking bad on your own time and youll enjoy it much more, and you wont have the end ruined for you by the professor. Who in their right mind would have you watch the first 2 full seasons of the greatest show of all time, and then have you skip to the end to write a reading response on the last episode. RIDICULOUS.",
    "I would, but not as a gut. There is a surprising amount of work (both hours of TV to watch and response to write) which is worthwhile but still a lot.",
    "Yes, if you're willing to write analytically about TV. No passive watching.",
    "Definitely don't take this class if you're expecting a light course load. If you're genuinely interested in watching the TV shows, you might enjoy the class though, but I don't think it's worth having to do all the assignments.",
    "Absolutely not. This course was not at all what I signed up for. The instructor had no regard for her students or their time. The syllabus was changed A NUMBER of times over the duration of the course making it difficult to stay ahead of assignments. Additionally, assignments were added to canvas sometimes within as few as 18 hours until they needed to be completed. The prompts and rubrics to the writing assignments that the instructor decided to give us (although not originally on the syllabus) were ambiguous and a lot of the times my own TF was unclear on the purpose and actual makeup of the assignments. I have never felt so disrespected as a student. Whatever you do, do not take this course. The mental strain, increasing workload and overall frustration you will have enduring the pain that is this course is NOT worth it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, especially not if it is still taught by Virginia Jewiss.",
    "Literally see above. There is not a good thing about this class.",
    "Only if the syllabus was actually complete and the professor is different. I found her personality too grating and the disorganization of the class too irritating to make this classa class about one of my favorite subjectsenjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in modern TV, because I think the content is very engaging, but they should know that the class comes with a very high workload.",
    "I would not. If you are expecting a chill film or humanities class, do not take this. The minimal amount of benefit or fun you might get from the content is not at all worth the time you will have to put into it.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone unless I was deliberately trying to make their life worse.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to spend time watching really good television--and also has the time to actually watch it, and critically think and write about it. It's a time commitment for sure, and you're going to want to allocate that time, because it's totally worth it. If you want to learn how TV works similarly to literary masterpieces, look no further. Think of it like an easy English course, but instead of reading books, you're reading TV shows. Also, if you like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Game of Thrones, Jane the Virgin, The Sopranos, The Handmaid's Tale, or The Young Pope, and want to learn something new about these shows, take this class. Or, if you're like me, and hadn't seen any but one of those shows, and you want to spend your semester watching these shows, take this class. It's not everyday you'll find a class like this one.",
    "Only as a fun course if you're looking for a relatively easy credit and interesting\/fun lecture not if you're looking for intellectual challenge or a way to grow significantly.",
    "Absolutely 100% not. Do not waste your precious time on this atrocious class. Learn something elsewhere, because I assure you, you will learn nothing in this class beyond the feeling of swallowing constant anger and annoyance. I truly hated this class. Gained nothing. Wow. Makes my blood boil to think about in this very moment. Save yourself.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in analyzing film. It is very interesting to pay attention to the details and concepts behind a show. Shows are changing all the time, so it was definitely interesting to hear about it from someone who works in the industry. If you have taken other film courses, I definitely recommend this one because it is interesting to compare the differences in a analyzing a show and a movie.",
    "Nope.",
    "No, unless you enjoy having every major TV show spoiled for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, if they go in with a clear expectation that this isnt an introductory course aimed at gaging interest, but a heavy commitment in terms of cinematic learning, work load and time spent on getting every commitment completed on schedule.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student. Complaints of the actual material aside, I would not recommend the course because of how often the syllabus and expectations of the course changed. It became an extremely frustrating course to keep up with since getting ahead on work was not possible given the frequent changes in assignments and changes in grading policies.",
    "If you haven't taken a film\/tv class and are new to the field this is a good introduction to the world of tv and you'll learn how to critically evaluate television shows and scenes. However, if you already have had experience working in entertainment or if you've taken other film\/tv courses this class may seem very introductory and elementary.",
    "No. Prof. Jewiss is an incredibly annoying lecturer, and the changing syllabus and unpredictable response assignments were a major pain.",
    "Absolutely not. Terrible professor who didnt prepare class whatsoever. Watching tv is fun, but she is not the professor to teach it since she never prepared anything. Also just a mean personmakes fun of students in lecture, especially athletes, and yells at students for random stuff.",
    "Not if Virginia Jewiss is teaching it. Biggest waste of a lecture in my entire Yale course history. Every week, at least 2 hours of my time was lost to the most worthless lecture I've ever attended. Every time I managed to muster the energy to go, telling myself, \"maybe today she'll say something, anything even slightly insightful or meaningful to furthering my understanding of television,\" I would be disappointed 100% of the time. Maybe if a new professor is selected, it would be worthwhile. But until then, I'd strongly recommend saying NO to this class, and any other class that Virginia Jewiss teaches.",
    "I may recommend this course.",
    "If it becomes better organized, absolutely.",
    "NEVER",
    "No I would not. The workload was insanely high and most of it was just time spent watching television. Viewing coupled with the readings (which professor Jewiss insisted we completed), and the paragraphs that we had to write created a really unrealistic amount of work for any Yale student to complete. In addition, I felt like the lectures were often more about the film industry itself and less about what we were viewing.",
    "Yes because its information that will help you in life as you watch cinema and television .",
    "yes, but be prepared for a lot of weekly work",
    "I would 100% not recommend this course to another student. Based on the syllabus and the course content, I would because it is very interesting, and definitely engaging. However, because of the way the professor taught the course, I would most definitely not.",
    "yes, if it were organized differently.",
    "If you are interested in the entertainment industry at all then I would recommend this class.",
    "No. I felt the lecture was not very engaging."
