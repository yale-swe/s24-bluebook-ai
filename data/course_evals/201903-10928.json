   "comments": [
    "I learned how to re-write and adapt my work.",
    "What makes good characters, dialogue, poetry, stories, and narratives; practice intensive writing, workshopping",
    "This class could have been really good--interesting reading and unique class structure of lectures by visiting experts and then workshops--but unfortunately because of my professor (Spargo), I felt that I did not learn anything substantial. Even at the end of the class I still do not know how to write a short story or what are effective techniques used in poetry or how to build a meaningful scene in drama. I did develop my patience and a subpar portfolio.",
    "I grew much more comfortable with words. Creative writing forces you to reimagine the power of writing to communicate a message and tell a story. It taught me a level of expressiveness that improved my formal essays, emails, and everything in between.",
    "Better writer and better story-teller",
    "Fiction, poetry, and drama writing (including how to read and critique works by established authors, workshop classmates' writing, and write our own pieces in the three forms)"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The prompts given in class were often too specific to complete -- such as \"You are a Korean-American at a Trump rally,\" or \"You are a rockstar's manager who hates mold.\"",
    "The course is a great introduction to creative writing, though assignments were often unclear. I also would have liked more in-class exercises and discussion rather than lecture.",
    "I enjoyed the readings and assignments for this class but thought sometimes actual class wasn't as interesting\/ helpful.",
    "STRENGTHS: The lectures were incredible and each speaker brought new and fascinating insight into the style of writing we were doing. Just the act of writing a short story, poetry, and a short play made me a better writer and more creative thinker. The syllabus, which has worked for years and worked this semester, is just great. My semester was infinitely better for having bits of fiction, poetry, and drama to read in between my more dense assignments. WEAKNESSES: Sometimes Clifton talked for the majority of the seminar and the amount of time devoted to students during our workshops was not evenly divided (some received 30 minutes of feedback while others might get 12). If you take this section, I highly recommend going to office hours every chance you get. He is a great teacher, but best in a one-on-one setting.",
    "I really liked this class. I think the ways in which I would improve it are trying to get more writing and talking about general writing strategies as opposed to specifics. We spent a fair amount of time closely analyzing short-stories and scripts. We would talk about word choice. I found these things to be helpful thinking about sentences and very specific moments in my writing. But I think it might have been more helpful to discuss general strategies about how to craft an interesting story\/poem outside of analyzing other people's work. We might have also been able to spend more time writing, which I think might have been more valuable again. Instead of having homework be reading multiple stories, maybe that could have been the first class of the unit's work, but then after have work more focused on our own writing.",
    "Great readings, fun writing exercises, and I also liked the plenary lectures we got to attend. I really enjoyed how we were exposed to many different forms of creative writing in a non-intimidating and supportive environment; I learned a lot about forms that I didn't expect to like!"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Intro to Creative Writing to another student, but I would urge them to consider which professors are offering the course.",
    "This course is excellent if you have never taken a class on creative writing and are interested in writing.",
    "Yes",
    "Do NOT take this class if you get Spargo. He does spend a lot of time giving 1-2 pages of feedback after each assignment (and thankfully he's more articulate on paper than in person), but the quality varies. Moreover, his written feedback isn't good enough to overcome the fact that he can't facilitate conversation or structure lessons. For example, even though our class is a seminar, it felt like a lecture because Spargo talked the whole time, which may have been bearable if he had anything meaningful to say, but instead he just rambled. I don't even know what we learned.",
    "YES! If you want to be a better writer in general, you need to know how to write creatively. It will expand your mind and your writing in other classes will improve as a result. The workload isn't that bad and you might just find that you're far more creative than you think.",
    "Yea, if you are interested in exploring your creative side I would take the class.",
    "Yes! Especially if you haven't tried creative writing before, want to experiment in different forms, or are looking for a way to get back into it."
