                "Taking Verlyn's class will make you a better writer. There's no other class at Yale that can make you as in tune with your voice and improve your writing as quickly and substantially as Verlyn's Genre of the Sentence. The weekly readings are short but selected specifically to address the needs of the people in the class.",
                "At the start of this class, Klinkenborg said it would totally transform the way we wrote, and the way we viewed writing. What a statement to deliver on! This course gave me a ton of insight into the minutiae of writing at the sentence level. It also changed my perspective on the relationship between writing and thought, the function and value of writing in my life, and a whole lot else.",
                "I learned how to write clear / sharp / short sentences, how to critically assess other essayists' writing, and, most importantly, how to edit my own prose. Verlyn and Emily did an amazing job at providing clear, comprehensive feedback on my essays. With their feedback, I've developed greater self-awareness in my writing. When are my metaphors unnecessary? When will a short sentence be clearer than a prolonged one? How can I direct the reader's attention with a carefully placed colon? With their feedback, I've developed a fuller understanding of my writing strengths / flaws, and where I have room for improvement!",
                "I learned how to write more clearly and creatively. I can't really synthesize everything I learned in the box allotted. Truly, this is an important class for any aspiring writer.",
                "In this course I learned to write well on every level. My attention to sentences and rhythm improved most, I think, but Im also leaving the class with a new outlook on the purpose of good writing and what its role can be in my life. The process of noticing my thoughts has also taught me a great deal about what it means to be me and to see the world through my eyes."

                "I dont have many reccomendations for improvement on this course. The consistency of the syllabus and classes was a huge strength.",
                "Writing a unique piece every week was, at first, a little daunting. By the end, though, writing the pieces felt like a giftand it never really feels like work. \r\nVerlyn (and Emily!) is the strength of this course. Verlyn line-edits your work and writes you a few sentences about what you've turned in every week. Let me say that againhe edits and comments on EVERY student's prose, two pages per student, every week. I've never had a professor so committed to his studentsand I don't think I ever will again. I've had professors never hand my papers back to me!! This is not this course. Verlyn is also incredibly dedicated to your well-being: he will tell you and your classmates that he really does care about how you're doing. And he means it. Also, your class might get to visit Verlyn's farm at the end of the semester! Verlyn is truly the best! Simply no weaknesses.",
                "Verlyn and Emily are the most thoughtful, kind, and wise professors and make the class what it is. I loved every minute of this class and have never thought so carefully both about the world around me and where I fit in within it.",
                "Klinkenborg is wonderful, and fosters a really welcoming and open class environment. The uniform weekly two-pagers gave the class a consistency that I liked without ever becoming too much of a burden. Most thorough, clear feedback I've ever gotten in a writing class. No weaknesses come to mind.",
                "Strengths: Verlyn and Emily give excellent feedback -- line-by-line edits, but also broader structural critiques. Class engagement is enriching: people give deep attention to every piece (student or assigned) that we read. And the pace and structure -- one, two-page, essay a week -- is manageable and allowed me to improve and experiment with my writing incrementally. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only one -- I wish we'd been more critical of some assigned pieces. It felt like every assigned weekly reading was a work to be celebrated (rightfully so, most of them were amazing), but there wasn't much class discussion on where these writers may have faltered. Maybe leaving more time to answer questions like \"Anything we didn't like about this piece?\" would help.",
                "No weaknesses. The course was engaging and educational. I was challenged in new ways that have forever changed my writing.",
                "The rhythm of this course was perfect. Verlyns weekly feedback was outstanding and his words of wisdom in class and offices hours always made me feel better about life. I loved reading my classmates pieces each week. I learned a lot from them and from the assigned reading. No weaknesses."
