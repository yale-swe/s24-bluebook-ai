                "Writing focus is helpful for those who are beginning, but can be strained to place one inside them for more experienced.",
                "This class was great for getting an overview on literature surrounding the multitude of topics that we discussed. I think that the 2 hour format was great for discussion as it allowed us to explore many themes across the texts. I especially liked that the there were so many connections made between spiritualism\/occultism to other subsets of history; ie technological development. I think it made the class much more interesting and nuanced. I would only say that sometimes it felt like there was a lot more reading that I could manage.",
                "Dr. Temple is a major strength of this course. She is truly an expert in the field and always creates dynamic and impactful conversations. I really enjoy her facilitation style, inserting herself and giving her feedback on many student observations but still allowing the conversation to flow. She also builds interactive activities into the syllabus, whether museum trips, film screenings, or image evaluation that helps bring class energy up from normal literary evaluation. The one improvement I would make would be in assignment structuring, which we already spoke about.  I love the flexibility of being able to write the source analysis papers whenever is most convenient, but some of that flexibility is inhibited by the requirement that the paper be in a week after the evaluated source was discussed in class. Opening that source consideration up to any on the syllabus, which is what she allowed for the second analysis paper, would be very beneficial."

                "Yes, I think that this class was very fun and interesting given it's extraordinary topic. It was very fulfilling to learn about a topic that many have such little information about because it means that you can learn so much more than other classes.",
                "I definitely would. It is very challenging and there is a ton of writing, but Dr. Temple is always available for consultation and is extraordinarily generous with extensions. She truly wants to see your best work rather than what you can get in on time. She also chunks down the final paper to make it as manageable as possible. Though forcing you to choose your topic very early, this makes the paper-writing process far easier. The content is also fascinating and unlike anything I have ever learned before. I would highly recommend this class to a dedicated history major who doesn't have trouble with large amounts of writing.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This is one of the most unique and interesting seminars I've taken as a history major at Yale."
