    "I learned the basics of French language.",
    "By taking French 110, I learned about French culture as well as the language from a new perspective. I have never taken a language course where English is not the basis of the course. Instead of being taught to translate French to English, we were able to understand French by watching videos, partaking in helpful activities, and performing skits.",
    "I learned the rudiments of French, particularly in a way that I could make my way around Paris and be able to make basic conversation with its inhabitants.",
    "I developed how to study and understand basic french. I learned how to comprehend and form basic sentences. I learned basic grammar rules and verb tenses. I learned that there is only so much work you can do to prepare and that it is okay to not do phenomenally in all classes."

   "comments": [
    "This course moved very quickly and had weekly tests, which made it very time-consuming.",
    "Strengths - very great for my French language development \r\nWeaknesses - a little difficult in terms of grammar, I felt that this portion of the course was very rushed",
    "Though demanding by meeting every day of the academic week, it did reinforce what we learned through repetition.",
    "The strength of this course was talking and listening in french everyday because it provided full immersion into the class. The weaknesses of this course are derived from how fast and intensive the class is. We move through important material so quickly that I feel like I can never get a grasp of what I need to know.  I only feel like I comprehend a subject the next week when we are already on another unit. Also, by having a test every Monday, we are losing out on class time. The tests got significantly harder throughout the semester, and I still did not feel prepared for the last unit. I felt like I was studying for the test instead of actually learning and enjoying french by it being so intensive. Having two lessons each week was also way too much because I never fully understood what we were learning."

   "comments": [
    "If you're truly interested in French, I would suggest it. If you're intimidated by learning a new language, French at Yale might not be the best fit for you. It moves quickly and several students already have some knowledge in French (even in L1), which makes it hard to keep up at times. You'll definitely have to put in a lot of time into this course, which might not pair well with your other courses and their workloads.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students wishing to pursue a French major or who want to learn more about French culture for their own benefit.",
    "Yes, but only if they are willing to study and put in extra time. For someone who has never taken French, the immersion method will be challenging.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless you really love the french language. You must have had prior french background to even come close to succeeding in this class or have multiple classes with a very small workload to be able to handle the amount of work given by this class. It is extremely difficult and not for someone who is a procrastinator. I did not enjoy this class for large periods of time."
