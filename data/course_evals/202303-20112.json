Sometimes the professors would give instructions and then contradict themselves in the next sentence. The writing lab felt aimless at times, and three hours on a Friday was a long time to have every week.",

                "For the class, I felt at times that the reading load was a bit intense to the point that I had a difficult time fully diving into, or even just remembering all the details of the texts we were reading. For the lab, my biggest critique is that I think that there was a lot of unnecessary talk that ate up writing time. I think that the 3 hour lab should either be shorter or focus more on peer work and direct engagement with reading, writing, and reviewing. I felt at times that our talking sessions involved the professors telling the students things they already knew or could at least assume during the course. Getting straight to the more hands-on material would be more valuable for giving the readers something to take away."

I would also recommend the other 6PGX courses though and encourage them to find which one they think works best and interests them the most."
