                "I went from knowing nothing about phonology to knowing a fair bit about phonology! The course focuses on rule-based phonology but also foreshadows more modern trends in the field, and it is really a great introduction to this subfield of linguistics. The material is incredibly interesting, and you spend a lot of time looking at real-life examples to apply the theory. I will definitely be taking more phonology classes in the future. The semester-long research project also taught me how to work with a native-speaker consultant, planning elicitation sessions and analyzing data, all of which are really important practical linguistics skills to develop.",
                "I gained an understanding of how humans concieve of the sounds we use to communicate with one another, and how our understanding of these sounds in our heads on conscious and unconscious levels, and what actually comes out of our mouths, interrelate with one another in predictable and comprehensively analyzable levels.",

                "I would say that this course served as a decent introduction to phonology. Most of the semester was spent developing SPE rules to describe sound processes in various language. We started with examples in English, but quickly broadened our scope to cover languages from all over the world. We started by looking at phonological processes on the segment level, and introduced the idea of features. Then we started looking at prosody and thinking about autosegmental approaches to different phenomena.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Burns is a fantastic professor, and she teaches in the most engaging way. She prioritizes student understanding over all else, and she provided ample opportunities for students to ask follow-up questions throughout the class (which I think is listed as a lecture but ended up being so interactive that I might call it a seminar). The semester-long independent research project is also really enjoyable, which is definitely a pro of the class. Weaknesses: There was not enough time to complete the weekly quizzes after they were assigned. Some weeks, the quizzes were assigned late Monday night and they were due the next evening, which was difficult to plan for. Additionally, it was a bit difficult to get started with the independent research project so early in the semester because we hadn't really learned enough phonology to know what to choose as a topic. It might have been nice to have mandatory one-on-one check-ins with the professor to figure out topics early on, because it felt a little like we were on our own for the first few weeks. We also got pretty far removed from the schedule on the syllabus by the middle of the course, which made the readings a little confusing. We got back on schedule by the end, though.",
                "This course truly shone during class time, where concepts were elucidated with clarity and efficacy not only from lectures from the professor but also from students interacting and helping one another to understand concepts effectively. The many oppurtunities for student participation helped drive engagement even in the virtual format, though discussions could be dominated in some cases by a few individuals. However, outside of class time, the course was much weaker. Many assignments often felt as though they were designed less to test and reinforce a student's knowledge from the course and more to challenge the student to solve problems in an optimal way, but it could be difficult to determine which of the several possible solutions to a given question was the one desired, leading often to a feeling of flailing. However, the grading was sufficiently lenient that this tendency in assignments did not have a significant impact on a student's accomplishments in the class.",
                "Homeworks and lectures covered a wide range of topics and class moved at a good pace. Sometimes feedback was hard to understand, but professor was generally accessible to talk about questions.",
                "This course was hard to follow and at times could be overwhelming I think the lectures didnt well prepare me for how difficult the exam and homeworks would end up being, as the lectures generally had very clear examples whereas the homeworks involved much creative thought. The material is interesting but the course was generally hard to follow",
                "There was one major gap in the content of the course, and I think it was an important one. I have no idea why anything that we learned was important. This was the fourth or fifth linguistics course that I have taken, and in every other class that I have taken, it has been clear why the content is important: it had applications in tech, it was providing a philosophical/metaphysical groundwork for the study of language, it was exploring generalizable phenomena that teach us about the human capacity for language. In this class, it felt much more like we were taking a tour of the world's languages, and pointing out cool things that occur in different languages. I never felt like we had a strong theoretical basis for what we were doing. When a certain phenomenon didn't fit into our framework, we bodged it on and made it work, even when that was clearly not an elegant solution. I feel like we were much more focused on learning how to write SPE rules than we were on learning anything about language. \r\n\r\nI also thought that there were some problems with the organization of the final project. It was assigned, and the first stages were due, just a handful of weeks int the semester. At this point, we had barely finished learning about the IPA, and had only just begun to actually start to discuss phonology. I had no idea how I should pick a topic, what possibilities there were, and what I should look for. I wound up picking a language that I knew very little about, and was miserable throughout the entire process. I didn't find any of my results to be particularly interesting, and I don't think I learned much during the process. I did, however, spend many mind numbing hours listening to audio recordings and making phonetic transcriptions. Ugh. I won't miss that.",
                "I feel like the weekly quizzes were too much, as if the class were in person we wouldn't have actually done such long quizzes every week in class. Other than that, it was great.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Burns is a good lecturer, office hours are helpful, and the content overall is important for Linguistics majors.\r\nWeaknesses: The connection between the p-set and the lecture would not always be obvious.",
                "Strengths: the lectures worked well in the interactive manner and with the notes shared/on the screen; I liked the notes that Professor Burns wrote on the screen during class; the material was interesting and intriguing. Weaknesses: the quiz and the problem set almost every week was a lot of material during the pandemic; the quizzes began as short early in the semester but were sometimes the length of a problem set. Another difficult aspect was not having the Zoom connected to the Canvas site; this made it hard to log in at times when we could not find the password and room id. I would have also appreciated the lectures recorded for future reference."

This was in some cases very effective, but it could also be extremely limiting, both as a result of technological foibles and the mismatch between some aspects of the course, such as the release schedule for assignments, and the online nature of the entire affair.",

As a result, I would recommend taking the course Credit/D/Fail, if this is an option, for anyone who is not interested in the fine mechanics of linguistic science.",
