                "composition, form, color, a bit of graphic design history, process, and what it means to be a designer!",
                "I've learned so much in this class about visual language, graphic design, and how we approach communication and the messages we share. With the projects and assignments we had over the semester, there were plenty of times when I was challenged creatively and had to think about ways to approach these assignments in a more nuance and unexpected way. One of the ideas that I took away from our readings was making the expected unexpected by elevating our initial perceptions of something. I hope to incorporate more of that in my future work.",
                "I developed both a technical and conceptual understanding of graphic design",
                "This class was such a great introduction into graphic design. As someone with not a ton of graphic design experience, it really expanded my understanding of what graphic design is and what it could be. The class provided interesting assignments that helped us explore basic graphic design concepts like composition, typography, learning\/researching design history, translating ideas into visual language, and exploring different tools\/technologies along the way to help us best achieve our design goals. Like many other art classes at Yale, the art critiques were a great way to learn how to talk about and give feedback on each others work, and a great way to learn from seeing other peoples work. On the weeks wed have readings, the readings were insightful, really interesting, and I think really helped me contextualize what graphic design is and get a glimpse into the discourses that are happening in the graphic design field."

                "The class and Prof. Dale did a very good job of covering the fundamentals of graphic designs to establish a foundation for students who want to pursue it in the future.",
                "Nothing it was amazing",
                "Strength: lots of opportunity for feedback, TF was super useful, very engaging\r\nWeaknesses: Some turnaround times for assignments were very short, so there would be a lot to finish within 1 day, wish we learned more about techniques for Adobe",
                "Strengths: Prof. Dale is a design genius and is clear and honest with her feedback. I felt both challenged and enlightened by this course. The assignments were fun and great exercises of creativity and design.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more time for individual feedback on design projects.",
                "Its perfect as is!",
                "I really enjoyed the assignments that our class had because they all contributed to my level of creative growth and engagement. A lot of these projects did help me explore ways to use tools differently and branch out to programs and devices that I've never used before like the photocopier and exacto knife. In addition to the projects, we also had occasional reading assignments that I found really interesting most of the time. Some of the things that I believe could be improved would be having possibly more resources on learning the design programs we were introduced with, encouraging more independent practice with graphic design, and exploring new ways that we could do critiques such as using notecards, post-its, etc. to engage with our peers' work.",
                "The course was VERY well organized and had a great environment. The instructors were amazing and I genuinely learned so much. I think it wouldve been nice if wed spent more time becoming actually familiar with Adobe photoshop, illustrator, etc and if we uploaded our projects to the Google drive throughout the semester instead of at the end of the course all at once.",
                "Very well structured with each assignment setting out a clear goal\/topic that we were exploring while leaving plenty of room for creative interpretation and exploration. A really good intro into Graphic Design as a field and what it is\/could be. Our professor Luiza Dale, our T.A, M.C,  and my classmates formed a really nice and supportive creative environment\/atmosphere. Critiques were helpful and respectful, and a great way to learn and get inspired from other peoples work. On weeks wed had readings, we would choose two readings from a curated selection, and that was a great way to ensure what we read was engaging to us. Overall, all the readings were really interesting and widened my perspective on design. We had a visiting designer\/artist and that was a great way to get insight into someones practice and approach to design. Luiza is super insightful and responsive and very interested in giving us support and helping us succeed. She gave great feedback and was eager to provide extra information on what working in the graphic design field is like and overall gave great insights and recommendations. I got the sense that shes really in touch with the contemporary graphic design landscape and interested in graphic design history and discourse. Like many art courses at Yale, M.C, our T.A. was from the graduate program, she was a great presence and very helpful, and it was interesting to get insight into the graduate Graphic Design program as well. The workload could definitely be slightly high depending on the amount of effort\/focus you gave to the class, but I found it manageable. It was also good that the workload was very consistent from week to week, so you knew what to expect, and could plan ahead. Many assignments built upon the previous assignment or were organized into smaller parts which made it more manageable. The final project was carried out over multiple weeks which made it really manageable and low stress. The final critique was with a visiting artist (our visiting critic was great), and I do think it felt a little brief as we had limited time to go over everyones body of work, and I think it would have benefited from more time and therefore been more in depth. However, on the flip side, I think you can also argue that it was good that the final critique wasnt longer, as it made it concise and relatively low stress."
