                "strengths: professor suthor is fantastic. many of the images on her lecture slides are photos she has taken herself and she does an excellent job of really giving you a sense of what it's like to physically encounter the art. i found this perspective particularly helpful when understanding baroque sculpture. the tfs were also wonderful. weaknesses: sometimes it's unclear what the takeaway should be from the analysis of a particular piece.",
                "I course material is extraordinarily interesting. However, it is sometimes difficult to take notes given the specificity of each art's analysis.",
                "This course has lots of interesting material. However, the lack of organization made it really hard to learn. Professor Suthor would just kind of go through a bunch of slides every lecture and while her lectures were interesting, I came away from each one not knowing what I was supposed to take away from it. Before the midterm and the final, I basically had to go through all the slides (which only had the paintings on them and no notes) and memorize the artists and the titles and just pray.",
                "This was a wonderful course. The material was highly interesting and presented in an engaging way. The historical background provided made the artistic analyses more meaningful and interesting. I had a great time in the lectures.",
                "The course can at times feel unengaging even though the material is interesting. Some of this has to do with its structure and style, but as an underqualified undergraduate, I am unsure if my feedback is that helpful. With that caveat in place, a suggestion: perhaps a section would make the class more engaging.",
                "Strengths: The course content is incredible and Prof Suthor is extremely knowledgable. She provides ample opportunity to discuss material out of class (you MUST go to one of her close looking sessions in the YUAG, they are optional but extremely well done). \r\nWeaknesses: This having been said, I think there is less emphasis on the assignments and therefore there was much confusion about due dates\/how to approach the papers. I think this could be cleared up with earlier communication. I also think a section could have been helpful for this course because there is so much content it would be helpful to review weekly.",
                "I thought that this class was very well taught and that the lectures were filled with the most interesting paintings and art."

                "I would highly recommned this course to anyone interested in learning how to appreciate and analyze art.",

                "yes!! one of the most interesting and most approachable courses for non-HSAR majors. Loved the TF's and professor Suthor",

                "I would recommend this if a student, like me, is generally interested in art history in Europe.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot from this course. It's definitely not for someone who has not taken an art history course before, as there is little guidance around essays\/exams. I cannot imagine how hard this course would be if I hadn't written a visual analysis\/done IDs before. However, the time period is extremely interesting and Prof Suthor is an amazing professor!",
