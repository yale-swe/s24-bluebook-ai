I developed a strong sense of what policy briefs should look like, and how they can be used to persuade politicians and donors alike.",

Was better able to understand equity  which is surprisingly complex and confusing (and is necessary for a good global health response). Each unit of the class was different and useful. Provided a good survey, but also went into detail each class.",
                "This class taught me a lot about what global health is and is not, and what it should be. I developed lots of critical thinking skills through reading literature and having very engaging class discussions. I definitely understand the limitations and issues in the global health field, but I also have a better sense of how health interventions can be the most effective, impactful, and sustainable.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Critical analyses were fun and handed back within a day. Panter-Brick is amazing and well connected in global health. The course content was interesting and the workload wasn't bad at all as long as you're diligent on the front end. \r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "I really enjoyed the seminar-like style of class with a couple students leading presentations each week. The CA were short and forced you to think critically about the information that you were given.",
                "Strengths: strong, specific feedback from Professor Panted-Brick. She encouraged us to tell our stories, which promoted a strong sense of community in the classroom. Many of us became friends outside of class due to the encouraging environment that our professor fostered. \r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "I absolutely loved this course. PB is such an amazing professor and really facilitated class discussion. She provided such clear feedback and was extremely helpful.",
                "I loved this course!",
                "The seminar format of this course really could be improved. I didn't like the student presentations; they just summarized the readings and we did not have many interesting discussions because the presentations took up so much time. They disincentivized students from doing the readings and by the end of the semester I don't think many people were doing them, because the presentations just summarized them at the beginning of class. I would love if Professor Panter-Brick came in with questions to guide the discussion. Since the nature of the readings is just summary / content, there isn't much to analytically discuss. Instead, it would be interesting to focus our discussions on applications of the readings (for example on colonial thought) and how we maybe see it play out at Yale or back home or in our lives. I loved when people shared their personal experiences in class. \r\n\r\nI really liked the structure of assignments, however I felt that the CA's did not improve my writing. When I actually thought through an interesting thesis and made arguments and well-organized points to back it up, I got poor grades. When I just summarized the readings and did not make any cohesive argument or original thesis, she gave me my best grades. This was a bit frustrating.\r\n\r\nProf. Panter Brick is sweet, loving, and very kind. She's also super prominent in the field of global health, so it was really cool to be able to learn with her. \r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moments in the class were when Prof. PB posed tricky questions and we got to debate them in a free, nonjudgemental setting. She asked \"should vaccinated people sick with covid be prioritized over unvaccinated people?\" And we had a great discussion. I think the more of this, the better next time!",
                "CPB  a huge strength. She loves and cares so much for her students, it's so clear. But she also is so knowledgable. It's a great combo and was visible in the readings and class discussions. I also really like the research memo format. Very kind and helpful structure to help you become a better critical writer.\r\n\r\nThere was one flaw with this otherwise great course  I wish CPB spoke more. She is an insanely smart (yet humble) professor, but too much of class time was devoted to student presentations. As a result, I was mostly hearing other students. I totally get that its great to let students speak, but CPB has so much interesting stuff to say and teach us, and I wish I heard her voice more, rather than that of my classmates. We had a great squad and I loved everyone in the class, so its not like there were section a**holes, it was more that CPB is just uniquely cool and knowledgable on this subject, unlike us. (Its a mean take, but if you were in class, youd agree.)",
                "I loved how conversation-based this course was. Every class felt like a group discussion, stemming from student presentations, and it really encouraged everyone to share their thoughts. The environment was so fun and stimulating, and I learned the most from what Professor PB and my peers had to say. It wasn't a very structured class but that was conducive to the flow of conversation.",
                "Strengths: Professor Panter-Brick is an incredible professor and I really valued her anecdotes/insights from her many years working in global health fieldwork. I also really enjoyed the seminar style of this class, as our discussions often challenged the way I think and pushed me to think more deeply about certain issues. The critical analysis writing assignments were also helpful in my learning, as they forced me to write concisely while also formulating a crisp argument about a topic of my choosing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes I felt that people in the class agreed with each other too much. I know this is a common problem seen across Yale seminar-type classes, but I think pushing people to challenge one another's ideas is extremely important to learning"

                "Absolutely. If youre interested in health policy, you should apply to take this course. We learned so much, but much of the learned was facilitated by the genuine interest of my classmates. Their vulnerability and willingness to learn, alongside Professor Panter-Bricks passion and experience, enabled the strength of the course.",
                "Yes! Loved it.",
                "YES! Prof. PB is amazing, and I would highly recommend taking a course with her at Yale. She facilities an academic environment that many of strive for at Yale, and the coursework itself is extremely interesting.",
                "As mentioned in the teacher evaluation, I was frustrated with the grading on assignments and it seemed like I was being incentivized to write summary pieces with buzzwords instead of improving logical thinking and making an argument. The topic is super super interesting. I learned the most from doing the readings themselves, not from discussing them in class. If you are interested in global health, the breadth of the syllabus is great. Prof. PB is so sweet and we did lots of classes outside. She had us to her house a few times with sparkling cider and she is warm and easy to talk to.",
                "100% Especially GHS students. CPB is a wonderful professor and a very good person to know. I learned a lot about global health, and the units allowed us to think of each piece separately and then tie them together. The class is not challenging and CPB brings together a great group. Would def recommend.",
                "I loved this course and I was always excited to go each week. It made me realize what I want all my classes to be like. All the students actually participated and had really interesting opinions and questions. Professor PB was so fun and made the atmosphere of the classroom really easygoing. We touched on a broad range of topics but I feel like we went quite in depth with them all. I wish I could keep taking this class! We all truly bonded and had earnest conversations.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to learn more about ethics and how/if it is at the core of global health work. This course serves as a great introductory course to global health and there is a lot that can be learned in the course. Professor Panter-Brick is a wonderful professor and I gained a lot by speaking with her about her experiences in global health work internationally."
