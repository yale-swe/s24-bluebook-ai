He is also extremely accommodating of his students with regards to assignment extensions, course pace, etc. \r\n\r\nOne thing that made the course material more difficult for me to keep up with was the fact that the class met once a week for 2 hours, as opposed to twice a week. At times it was a lot of material at once, and also the weekly class set up made it such that it was easy to disengage from the class at times.\r\n\r\nOverall a great course that I would highly recommend!"
