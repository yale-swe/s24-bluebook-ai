It will develop your ability to write, speak, (and more importantly, listen) thoughtfully about difficult and complex topics with people from a variety of backgrounds. These conversations can get heated and there is much nuance not only in the course topics but many of the current events that took place throughout the  semester.",
                "I learned about the ins and outs of fascism and how it spurred its evil form throughout the world in the 20th century. I also learned a lot of history I didn't know about Britain's ties to the Nazi government, Italy's colonial past in Ethiopia, and most interestingly, fascism in visual culture! We later tied all we've learned from the 20th century to today and discussed how modern radical politics around the world is too eerily reminiscent of the global fascist past.\r\n\r\nLastly, I became a better writer in this class, improved my discussion skills, and learned how to read for the main idea:)"

                "I gained substantial knowledge about the dynamics of illiberal democracy, and delved into the historical contexts of fascism and populism across Europe, the Middle East, and America. The course presented an exceptional platform for enhancing my writing abilities, guided significantly by Dr. Young's dedicated efforts in meticulously reviewing and providing feedback on our papers.",
                "Strengths- Dr. Young is SUCH a great strength. She is highly intelligent, attentive, caring, charismatic, and engaging in discussions. I highly appreciate her input every week and how she helped contextualize the week's topic. It was incredibly interesting to discuss the current events from the past week and to tie them to our class and weekly topic. So many of them were relevant; I was always astonished! Another strength was her feedback for essays! Wow, I've never had a professor read my papers so closely (and twice!). And she always responded when asked to review outlines and ideas for the paper. The class also has very interesting guests!!\r\nWeaknesses- Only two improvements come to mind. First, I really WISH this was a biweekly seminar. Once a week is never enough:( it would highly improve the class. Second, I wish we could discuss the readings more. They are wonderfully presented, but then the discussion questions are more related to contextual questions that I'm very happy we discussed, but we often skipped questions that would engage more with the readings directly. Overall, the discussions were still very interesting and helpful!"

                "Dr. Young is truly stellar. Her dedication, investment, and attitude towards her students is unparalleled and the classroom environment she curates is one you'll be looking forward to every week. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to take this course, you won't regret it.",
                "YES! A wonderfully taught course with an excellent professor. Are you interested in discussing fascism and the global far-right with an expert in the field who is good at teaching, leading discussions, and giving feedback for your papers? If you answered yes then please take this course, if you can get in. Dr. Young is the best reason to take this course, but also consider how it is incredibly interesting (at least most of the readings hahaha), the guest speakers are really insightful, and you get to discuss current events and politics in a really open and respectful way that is so refreshing and a change from so many other classes I've taken before. PLEASE take it unless you despise once-a-week seminars (which is valid...). Also, you get the chance to rewrite papers which is really awesome:)"
