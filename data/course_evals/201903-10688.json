   "comments": [
    "C#\r\nProcessing\r\nPython\r\nGitHub\r\nESP32 - Hands on experience",
    "Basic understanding of hardware",
    "how to apply creative thinking to hardware development and construction, rigorous introduction to electronics (soldering, circuit design, motors, microcontrollers).",
    "This course taught me so, so much. Not only, as a CS student, do you get a beginner's introduction to parts of mechanical engineering, you learn how to think both creatively and technically throughout the course. Projects are mostly defined and limited by your own creativity, so it is relatively open-ended in terms of more things that you may pick up throughout your time in the semester. You both code and build extensively, so if you're looking for a moderately involved course this ain't it friend.",
    "Wow so much. I learned vast amounts about hardware, electricity, practical coding, servers, networks, and then about the intersections all of those things, and then still more also about best practices for working with any or all of those things. This was the most learning-dense class I've ever taken, at least as far as knowledge is concerned that I imagine I'll hold onto and continue to use. I feel empowered in a way I never have before, certainly not after any other computer science course, to imagine and to create.",
    "I learned so much about Wired and Wireless communication between devices. I learned about sensors and electricity. I felt like I understood a lot more about what goes on inside different systems. So much so that I recognize how integrated systems operate, especially the ones we take for granted in our everyday life. I am now familiar with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32 microprocessors . Best CS elective.",
    "I developed a working knowledge of project design and construction from conception to implementation, and I deepened my ability to work well in a team context",
    "Developed knowledge of using hardware and embedded system to solve problems; used the ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and gained an understanding of wireless and wired communication, and an elementary knowledge of some electrical engineering.",
    "I learned basic electronics and embedded systems programming for creative uses.",
    "I learned so much about basic electronics and how to make art with arduinos.",
    "I gained an overview of the various technologies used to create embedded systems. I also developed skills in presenting creative technology, such as building adequate enclosures and creating comprehensive documentation.",
    "On a concrete level I learned how to use a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) and a microcontroller (ESP32), how to use the Processing coding language to create artistic visualizations, how to wire up electronic components (such as LEDs, Motors, and various sensors), and a bit about networking (bluetooth low energy, wifi, and mesh networks). On a more abstract level I developed the ability to take a rather loose prompt\/assignment and produce some kind of creative output within a relatively short timeframe.",
    "Going into my 8th term, I have taken a lot of courses here. Few have been as formative as this class. Unlike so many classes, Creative Embedded Systems teaches practical skills that feel inherently valuable, or at least fulfilling. I think that harping on classes for not teaching anything \"useful\" is dumb, but CES has truly caused me to grow as a student and worker. I have a set of skills I did not have before taking the class. Many of these involve working with physical materials to create some sort of project\/product. Time management, self-discipline, CEID stuff, all of that."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of very interesting material covered that I really recommend to everyone in STEM or Art. The workload is erratic and a little hard to balance at times so take this class during a more relaxed semester.",
    "Passive aggressive comments",
    "It's pretty intense--there are a lot of projects, and you don't have much time to complete them. The instructors self define the teaching style as a \"Trial by Fire,\" and they're not wrong. This class will test your strength--both physically and mentally--but you will build dope stuff. Highly recommend taking this course.",
    "The structure of the course was very balanced, with every week alternating between a lecture and a lab. This helped a lot with both learning high level concepts as well as getting hands-on time working on relevant things. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would say is that this course is extremely time consuming. However, it's not in a way that makes you feel drained-- in fact, it's the only class I wanted to spend my time on because the results were so tangible and rewarding.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is the marriage of learning-by-doing and the freedom for each student to decide what projects to pursue. I was never not engaged. When else are you given tools and space and told to invent the coolest thing you can imagine? Really never else. And that experience is so exciting and educational. The weakest moments were the times when Scott and Mark tried to direct our inventions the most (ie. the mesh networks installations). I think because this was a new class and they were stressed out about the administration's reception of it, they tried to get our class to have two big showcases in a row, in opposition to the otherwise universally accepted rhythm of courses over a semester (a slow build with one final crescendo at the very end). Obviously it didn't go well. I think in general they sent a bit more of their stress onto the class than we deserved.\r\nI'm a senior Computing and the Arts major in the visual arts track, and this was the first course I've *ever* taken that felt like it was made for me, like it was actually in my major. I was shown how the world of computers and engineering can be a space for artistic practice, and the revelation is like a great sigh of relief, like I haven't been wasting the last four years after all.",
    "The Tuesday Lecture, Thursday Lab setup was perfectly designed to facilitate our understanding of the devices we were working with. Weak: I wish we could have done a CEID info session all together so we would get CEID access altogether and that wouldn't be even the tiniest bit of an issue.",
    "The courses structure is divided up very well, into lecture, discussion, and lab work periods within the two time slots. I think the instructors this year struck a wonderful balance of hands-on instruction and hands-off time for us to explore the contexts they taught us",
    "The course did a great job of promoting students to build cool projects with interesting tech and homework prompts. The main weaknesses were that there were too many assignments and so each one felt a bit rushed. It would also have been really helpful to have continued support with each project instead of having to figure things out we were never taught alone.",
    "Strengths: projects are fun, you get close with your classmates, lots of room to be creative, in-class labs are helpful, collaboration is encouraged\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading is weird (sometimes points are taken off for things you had no control over), instructors actually dont teach much when it comes to hands-on learning (they are more like guides or enablers giving you the tools to learn rather than professors), projects are a TON of work",
    "The strength of the course is that we are given full freedom to pursue any sort of creative application of certain technology. We also had many thoughtful discussions about how to design our creative technology and how to present it in a public space.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is the pace is a bit too fast. Because we were working with hardware and software in a creative capacity, it was often difficult to finish a project every two weeks. As a result, I often felt like I was turning in work that I knew did not live up to its potential. However, I was usually able to make faster progress when I was able to complete the technical challenge during work days in class. It would be great to have more hands-on time with the technology during class rather than lectures.",
    "The strength of the class was in the openness of the assignments. Aside from a few listed requirements, people could do whatever they wanted with assignments which meant that people were often creating completely unique and interesting things. There was a lot of creative freedom, which is great if you enjoy that but might be difficult for those who prefer a bit more structure. Sometimes it was a little difficult to think of what to make, but that was \r\nbecause I wanted to take the time and effort to think up something worth making.\r\n\r\nI think the only weakness of this class was the pacing, which is understandable. Mark and Scott had a very ambitious curriculum because they wanted to teach us so much, which they did! The only problem was that we operated at a pace that was just crazy fast and overwhelming at times. I would say half of the class pulled an all-nighter at some point during the semester, which was a combination of the pacing, less-than-great time management on our end, and the determination to create spectacular things. Still, after a semester of churning things out on a bi-weekly basis, the entire class was definitely experiencing some burn out which can be summed up with the words \"module 6.\" All things considered, this was also the first time the class was ever taught, so if it's taught again I'm sure they will rework the curriculum.",
    "Strengths: GREAT to have a creative practical CS class; nice balance of self-starting and group work, so you have obligations that feel creatively tied to you but also are motivated by having group members; almost totally creative space; skills learned are cumulative; tangible results from the class; good potential for class bonding; fulfilling work that is as motivating as you make it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: generally sloppy class organization; often opaque reasons for making our lives harder re: deadlines; judgment often favors those with previous experience making physical projects since their projects will build on their knowledge (whereas some will start from square 0); grading schema seemingly arbitrary--little to no consistency across students, little to no correspondence between points taken off and importance of criteria failed (that is to say, sometimes we would lose an inordinate amount of points for something that did not seem important at all to the project)."

   "comments": [
    "It's great! If you're interested in STEM or just want to make kinetic sculptures, this is the class for you. It's hard to balance the workload though so keep that in mind.",
    "Its a lot of work but you learn about hardware and microcontrollers through projects",
    "Absolutely. I learned more in this class than any other CS elective I've taken. That being said, the lectures are pretty boring. Where this class shines is the projects which push students to creative and electronic design extremes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is ready to learn and ready to grind. The material in this course is so fun, and it really is rewarding to put in all the effort and get great results out of the course that you'll be able to take with you for the rest of your life. There doesn't seem to be a class that's exactly like it, so definitely try it out if you are ready for high-intensity fun.",
    "Yes, absolutely, unreservedly. If you can take this class (and enjoy inventing stuff obv) YOU MUST!",
    "This is certainly my favorite CS course I've taken at Yale. The only others I've enjoyed have been the CS\/MUSIC courses by Scott, so I may be biased. This class made me feel like I was wiring an entire system myself and I could do anything that my creative mind could come up with within the parameters set by the instructors. The creative elements and the technical elements were all there and I absolutely loved it. Be warned it was a little more time-consuming than most classes, but ultimately absolutely worth it.",
    "In a heartbeat. I didnt truly have any idea how to implement something from start to finish until I took this course- it provides a context for a Yale student, head full of theory, to actually put it into practice.",
    "Yes, its quite a bit a bit of work but youll gain a lot knowledge of hardware, even if youve had no previous experience, which was the case with me. Modules can take quite a long time to be graded, so getting feedback can be a bit difficult, but instructors were always available to answer questions. \r\n\r\nThe length of the class showed on Tuesdays - it was an appropriate length for labs on Thursday, but Id say the almost two hours got a bit tedious for lecture\/breakout sessions.",
    "YEAh! its very fun overall. Just start early on your assignments",
    "I would recommend this to any student who is interested in creative applications of technology. I found that students interested specifically in building creative work gained the most from the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, because I think it is the best class I have taken at Yale. As a CPAR major, I wish there were more classes like this at Yale, because it is the first time I felt challenged both artistically and technically within the same classroom. \r\n\r\nOn the CS side of things, I think it stands out as a project-based class. For me, it always meant more to take the material from class and apply it to a project than a pset. With the creative freedom given in this class, you can really personalize the material with your own ideas.\r\n\r\nOn the art side of things, I don't think I've ever felt as proud as I am of the things I made in this class. Furthermore there is a huge emphasis on documentation, so at the end of class you have a nice little collection of work to add to your portfolio in the form of photos, video demos, github repos, and short written blurbs.\r\n\r\nIf you can manage to get into this class, I would highly encourage you to take it. You should expect to put in a significant amount of time and work into the class, but don't let that scare you away because making things you are proud of makes it totally worth it.",
    "Yes, without a doubt. This class pushed me to the limit, not gonna lie, but it always felt worth it. I put in 110% to this class, without intending to, because I realized that I actually cared about the work I was doing in it. Sure, Scott and Mark could be frustrating at times, but I am much more grateful to them for having put this class on than I was ever frustrated by them. The class was a lot of work.  A lot. It sneaks up on you, too. Don't be fooled. But it's good work, and it feels good to do things that are cool and interesting and your own ideas. Scott and Mark (who probably won't be there in the coming years) make a big deal out of documentation, which can be tedious, but is really good practice, and also satisfying to do. All in all, yes, I lost way too much sleep over this class, but yes, it was worth doing, and I would do it again. Highly recommend."
