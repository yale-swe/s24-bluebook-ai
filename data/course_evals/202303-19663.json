I understand that some topics needed to be covered again at some level for completeness, but I think we could have covered a lot more if we had left out parts of ARPES and Fermi Liquid Theory in favor of more coverage on topological materials or some other topic.  This might also help the time constraints given our propensity to go over time each lecture.  To me, it makes more sense that dedicated students would eventually take both classes, so if this was to be offered more frequently, I think that would be a more apt structure."
