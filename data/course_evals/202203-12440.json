                "The strengths of this course were its thoroughness and the knowledge of the Professor. Additionally, I really appreciated that Professor worked to bring one of the directors of the films we watched into the class to speak with us and teach us, it was an extremely unique and valuable experience. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - location of the classroom, and I would have preferred two 50-minute classes a week, one for before viewing the film and one for after.",
                "The course format is very straightforward and each movie was clearly selected for approaching the theme of the class from slightly different angles. Students were encouraged to dictate their own opinions in the course, but often the discussions were held up by the professor's comments (not complaining, his insights were very valuable)",
                "Strengths -- fun movies, fun professor, not intense, lots of opportunities to provide your thoughts, good engagement\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- N/A unless you're someone who needs a very structured course",
                "I enjoyed the selection of films, but secondary source readings were generally not very helpful. I was also often frustrated in class by the leminar format. I wanted to hear more from my classmates, but the professor tended to dominate the conversation. Each comment from the undergrads was responded to directly by the professor instead of allowing a classroom dialogue to form."
