                "Strengths: love the survey-aspect\r\n\r\nWeakness: Beginning of the curve had a super high learning curve, felt like we were expected to know a ton about fossils, but I had no background.",
                "The material was great -- the professors truly do care about their fields and are very communicative and helpful. The course itself is horribly structured. There is no effort made to make transitions as we change professors, who have three different teaching styles. More importantly, in class lectures are not reflected in most test material or open assignments. The exams are extremely overwhelming entail extreme \"outside research\" to answer because they do not connect with the in class taught material. Any broad and \"open-ended\" questions have a particular answer, including on exams and the essay. Regardless of what may be asked, there is a particular answer for each question and oftentimes, the answer is indecipherable because it wasn't taught. There is an expectation of students to read the professors' minds on assignments, exams, and the essay when students are here to learn, not be grades as though they are equivalent to experts in the fields.  The course made no accommodations for the difficult learning environment, cramming material that turned out not to always been relevant to exams.",
                "Strengths: Each of the 3 professors in the teaching team had different interests and expertise. \r\nWeaknesses: 3 exams and 1 paper, which was a lot of work.",
                "It was nice that the sections were broken up with take home exams and homework assignments. My only suggestion would be to add a little more \"structure\" to the course. I had difficulty with knowing what was expected of me with certain assignments.",
                "Strengths- I sort of liked having the variety of different professors teaching this course.  Each is an expert in their respective field, and it was great to learn from a team that was clearly very passionate (and who really cared about the students).\r\nWeaknesses- if the midterm exams weren't take-home format, I would have had no idea what to study.  Lectures often seemed composed of a lot of incredibly specific things and broad themes escaped me at many points.",
                "The professors were absolutely amazing; if I were just to audit the class and sit through lectures, every lecture was like a story. Unfortunately I've been having a hard time focusing, so the online aspect was a bit painful. I liked that we had three different professors for three different portions of the class.",
                "The content, while a bit over crammed into this one class, was interesting and the professors were very engaging. Where the course lacks is how the expectations for the writing assignment are not very clear. Draft and\/or paper proposals reviewed by staff would likely promote better essays.",
                "not a gut course for non-stem majors trying to get a science credit at all!",
                "Overall, I really liked the class. Each section was really wonderful. Derek's section was really well done and was a phenomenal introduction to the course, but I personally wasn't quite as interested in some of the details on preservation. Bhart's content was the least organized, but I also loved how much passion and energy he brought to the lectures. Celli's section was really fascinating, very compelling, and a great way to tie together the class.",
                "I enjoyed the three-part format of the course, as it helped break up the lectures and brought in more diversity of lecturing style and topic focus. The course had a few too many assessments I think, as 3 large exams and a major paper made for a challenging workload at times.",
                "The course was organized. I can identify topics ok.\r\n\r\nI think the second part of the course had the slides missing info? but it was ok because the lecturer adjusted for it on thebexam \r\n\r\nI also wished we could see our exams afterward (to see where pts were lost)",
                "The format of the course and the enthusiasm of the instructors was great. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness is the lack of transparency in grading. Assignments are returned with arbitrary grades with little feedback and no rubrics. This was frustrating at times.",
                "Strengths: fairly engaging lectures, all three professors were fairly responsive to student concerns and input\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only Prof Hull geared her lectures well at non-science majors, and we didn't get to her until the end. Prof Briggs and Prof Bhullar would benefit from including more text on slides and focusing on explaining the basics to non-STEM students rather than trying to sound really fancy. We also NEVER got feedback on the first midterm which meant that as someone used to writing papers, I had no chance to improve how I tackled science exam questions until the final. Frankly this came off as very unprofessional -- it seems like you should not be allowed to assign a second exam until you've provided feedback on the first one, because otherwise how can I be expected to learn and improve?",
                "The course was well taught.",
                "This course covers a lot of material, which is both its biggest strength and its biggest weakness, I think. Naturally, you learn a lot and gain a pretty comprehensive view of life throughout time, but at the same time, it can feel like you're not taking much away because you don't study any one topic or time period in great depth. Of course, I think that that's sort of the point of the course, so it's not really something that can be improved, but is rather just something that students should understand going in to it.",
                "Strengths: 3 different professors\r\n\r\nWeakness: lots of topics to cover",
                "Overall I really enjoyed the class and I was constantly engaged and interested. I wish that the lab could have been offered this semester. I thought that the overall design and structure of the course was very well-suited for virtual lectures. Something that I did not like is that it was very hard to receive feedback on psets and exams. I felt like I didn't really have access to feedback and so had trouble understanding what I was doing right and whether or what I was learning.",
                "Quite easy but the content is very boring.",
                "Strengths: content was rich and interesting\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the amount of content was very overwhelming, and the course did not always feel very structured. Having three different professors was also difficult  because we had  to adjust to different  teaching styles with each  new professor. the  take-home exams were ridiculously extensive, and took many hours  longer than professors and TFs explained it  would (the  instructors  said the exams might take  about 3 hours, and students wound up working  on them for 7  hours or more).",
                "The grading was very vague. Turnover time for exams was very long. We'd finally be notified the exams were graded, but often weren't given our grade unless we specifically asked the TA for it. Even then, you'd get back a letter grade with no other information, and would have to ask the TA for grading specifics, and even then the TA would say they couldn't return your exam or the marked up graded version in case we save it and recirculate it for future years, so you'd have to specifically ask them what points you got on and off of, and even then it was super vague\/confusing\/arbitrary feeling. The first and easiest improvement that could be made is using the grades page on canvas. That wasn't used at all this semester. Then, distributing a clear rubric for graded exams and also showing students where they got points on or off.",
                "I liked learning about the periods of earths history, but I thought too much time was spent on fossils.",

                "the course sounds super interesting and the professors are really nice, but it just does't work out. this si the only class that i couldn't stay awake during. it was presented in a bad way, the assignments were to overwelming and the grading was super harsh without having a clear idea of what was expected from us.",
                "It was a very interesting course but because it was online it was not interactive.",
                "Terribly formatted, very unorganized, and also is pure memorization.",
                "It's a lot of content: if I had not been able to do this course virtually (with the ability to rewatch lectures and use my notes for the exams) I know I would have had a much harder time understanding and retaining the material. It's a lot to cover (it's the history of life!!) so I found the classes sometimes went too fast (or the pace was ok but it was so much material that by the end of the lecture I realized I had not really retained much of it). The exams and exercises were helpful towards better understanding\/applying the material. The course itself was really interesting for the most part; I particularly enjoyed the second part of the class with Professor Bhullar (his lectures are engaging and I found the material in this part of the course to be the most interesting). I think that overall I enjoyed the course but it could benefit from going at a slower pace at times.  I also appreciated the sections, which helped solidify my understanding, and the fact that they were not all mandatory (this flexibility was greatly appreciated!).",
                "A strength of the course is that 3 different professors teach the material over the course of the semester. Therefore, you get 3 different experts lecturing on their respective research, which makes for some interesting variety throughout the course. I liked the lecture format and the relevant exercises, which helped reinforce the material. Also, I can't stress enough how much I liked the take-home exams. Taking the exams at my own pace dramatically lowered stress and actually helped me learn AND retain the information (since I could look up answers to my questions as I was taking the exam). Compared to other classes which had in-class exams, I found that I retained the information for this class much better. However, it would have been nice to get quicker feedback on exams\/papers\/relevant exercises quicker since grading often took many weeks (I didn't know about 75% of my final grade until the last few weeks of the course).",
                "Huge portions of this class were absurdly boring. Who knew the history of life was so dry? But I guess if you really like fossils you don't mind dry."

                "Yes, you can learn a lot about paleontology and (paleo)ecosystem in general. I learned a lot of cool facts too!",
                "Yeah 100%. People will say it's not a gut, but just put in the work and you get an A. All of the work was take home, so you just had to do your research and spend time answering the questions, and you can get an A.",
                "Not at all. Individually, the professors are amazing.  They are experts in their fields and want students to dive into their respected sections. Together, this course seemed to have two components: lectures, where professors taught us about fascinating \"history of life\" concepts, and assignments, that had to do with concepts within the course, but were horribly written out, explained, and assessed harshly. Multiple times, instructors said \"the next part is much better and you'll get better grade,\" to which many students still performed badly. Unless you're willing to commit multiple days to exams and the essay, to which you write massive essays per question that you must do conclusive research on, you won't be geared for success in this course, even if you focus in all lectures and ask questions. Feedback on every assignment was insufficient and no sense of guidance existed for students who performed poorly. Do not take this course unless you're willing to commit an extreme amount of time to its assignments and still perform poorly, while having instructors who expect you to be an expert in their field in four weeks.  All in all, it is impossible to know your grade and true understanding of the concepts because grades aren't all shared and assessments do not reflect taught material.",
                "I would only suggest this as C\/D\/F. Feedback took over a month to receive, and even at that it was just a letter grade.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you are coming in with some prior interest in the subject.  I took this course as a prerequisite for my major, not because I was fascinated by the topic, so it was sometimes difficult for me to stay engaged during lectures.  On the other hand, if you're quite interested in the topic coming in, be warned that most of your classmates likely won't share your enthusiasm.  The course may not be rigorous enough for you.  The ideal student for this course would be one that is interested in some aspect of paleontology\/fossils\/dinosaurs\/evolution and is seeking a relatively low workload credit (although the essay is the one assignment of the semester that requires a good amount of time).",
                "I would recommend this all students. I think anyone could enjoy this course. However, I'd probably mention that the exams and assignments do take a long time and that they should be patient and prepare to portion several hours over multiple days to do them if necessary.",
                "Not at all! Unless it is your major do not take it",
                "Yes! If you are genuinely interested in the content. It felt like the type of stuff you would learn a little bit about at a science museum exhibit, except in WAY more detail, which I loved. The take-home exams are kind of like long worksheets--they are open-note so they have given you all the information but you have to search through it, pull out relevant details, and comment on their significance. They take a bit of time but are honestly kind of fun and pretty easy to do well on if you put the effort in. The grading is very reasonable although they didn't always give us our exams back which was frustrating.",
                "The class had some lengthy take home exams. A decent science credit for non science people.",
                "Id recommend this course to a student lookingnfor a gentle but rigorous approach to earth science and evolution",
                "The COVID semester was hit or miss for this course. If it was improved in person then I would recommend it. If you're a non major looking for an interesting science credit, it was a good experience and I would recommend.",
                "I would recommend it if you really care about all three topics but I would not recommend it to non science majors because of the major issues with grading and feedback",
                "Yes I would because it was very engaging and I learned a lot",
                "I would only really recommend this course if you have to take it for a requirement, as I did. It was an enjoyable enough course and I did learn some interesting stuff, but if I'd had the choice, I would have rather taken another class on the history of life and paleontology, one that went into greater depth in one area.",
                "Yes, if and only if they have some curiosity on learning about all of life and its history",
                "Yes I definitely would! This course was super interesting and engaging, and the professors and TAs all seemed very excited to teach.",
                "Yes if you need a science gut.",
                "If this is  required for your major, obviously  take it. But if  this is not  required for your major and  you plan to  use it  as  your  science credit\/as a 5th class, I would definitely reconsider, as this course includes a great deal of content and there is a lot of work involved on students' parts.",
                "Yes. It is a solid course geared toward learning about how the earth came to be.",
                "\/",
                "I would recommend if they are interested in the material. Be prepared to put in the work for the tests and the essay, though. They were a lot of work, way more than I anticipated.",
                "No. I woul not recommend this course to anyone. I would recommend doing research with the professors, but not taking this class. Take regualr Bio instead. This course is a waste of time. I was super excited about it, and I thin kthat it has great potential, but it just wasn't executed well. it was very boring, extremely difficult. i think it's a made-up course that is supposed to be intersing and not super stressful for both stem and nonstem kids, but the workload was insane. it was usper stressful, the feedback was nonexistant, grades were made up, and there wasn't any way to imrpove, becuae the professors are changing and everyone has a differnt style. they are super nice and pretend to really care, but they give extremely long tests and homework and just cut you off. i was super interested in this class, but my performance in the class did not refelct my level of intrest and the amount of time that i spent doing the assignments. i wish i dropped the course... also htey gave the last grade of the last test after the pass\/fail deadline. i am very unsatisfied. the worse course at yale i have taken so far. i will never take a evolutionary bio course again. we have other classes too, but i think that this class forgot that.",
                "Great course, learned a lot of fun facts about the history of life.",
                "If you want to take a pretty easy science credit which is also quite interesting then absolutely.",
                "Yes! The professors that teach this course are amazing and they teach everything in a very passionate way. The material itself is also interesting and worth learning about. It has changed my perspective on how I view the world.",
                "No, this class is purely memorization and the TA's have no consistency in grading. Your grade has no reflection upon who you are as a student, but rather, who your TA is.",
                "If they are interested in the material, yes! This may not be the case for everyone but I think it took a lot of work (basically had to rewatch most of the lectures to really grasp the material covered on the exams)--I think the exams were fair, it's just a lot of material so it can be hard to keep up. I think the three instructors all really cared about their students and were always willing to help us. I also learned a lot of really interesting things about the history of life that I don't think I would've learned elsewhere (ex: birds are reptiles! I now can't look at birds without thinking of dinosaurs, which I think is pretty amazing).",
                "Yes, it provides a great perspective on the world around us today that would be great for any major or non-major",
                "Absolutely! If you are interested in the material, the class does a great job of giving a basic overview of the origin and evolution of life on earth. Having 3 different professors giving lectures throughout the course also breaks up the monotony.",
                "No, no, no. Not unless you for some reason love fossils and fantasize all day about digging them up. I am still in search of a stem class for non-stem folks that isn't awful."
