                "Zoom made this difficult, as did the lack of a clear intended result. The competitiveness of the major also pushed us to create a deliverable that was appealing to judges, not necessarily to our research partner.\r\n\r\nStill, the practical work experience and group collaboration are very big highlights, as is Professor Eckert.",
                "One thing that I really appreciated was that Sue gave the capstone team the responsibility of shaping our timeline and work streams. Although at first this was difficult, as there was much work to be done, it put the team to the test and caused us to think critically about our research design. Even though we had this responsibility, Sue was also there to provide advice and guidance in the development of this process. Another strength of the course is the real life application of the report that the capstone team wrote  our work can save and change actual lives across the globe. There were no major weaknesses in the course.",
                "Since we lived in a virtual world this semester, we were able to set up meetings with people around the world. However, there was a false sense of free schedules since school was online that students were very available for somewhat inconvenient meeting times. I just wish that more of our interviews etc... fell within our scheduled class time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this course is traditionally dependent on the students to set their own schedule for deliverables etc... However, this was a semester where it would have been helpful for clearer expectations around how much progress we should have made on our project so that we could have avoided some of the last minute grind that occurred.",
                "The greatest strength was definitely the access we had to our professor and a wide range of experts in the field we were engaged in. The fact that we were able to conduct interviews with people directly engaged in our issue was invaluable. The capstone was initially quite challenging because it had a lot less faculty led direction than other courses Ive taken at Yale. However, I actually appreciated this further in the project as it allowed my team to develop an independent set of recommendations."

                "Jackson saved so much money by not sending us to travel, yet spent none of that on its students this year.\r\n\r\nInterviews with guests were often easier to coordinate. \r\n\r\nIt was difficult to work as a group simultaneously, and we did not feel supported by Jackson to find ways around this (i.e. meeting together in Horchow with masks on)",
                "See above in question 4.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I wish that the school would have provided our instructor with more training about the virtual resources available to her. It seems like we could have benefitted from an expert investing time to show her how to use the teacher side of canvas (specifically the files section) to post articles, and documents for us. We ended up having to use email, and the email chains simply became long and confusing with too many attachments hidden in different parts.\r\n\r\nLastly, I wish there was someone available to help our professor learn more about Google Docs. It is universally the preferred method for students to work together easily, and in the end we had to walk her through how to use it so she could edit\/provide feedback to us. We could tell it was frustrating to her that we were relying on a newer tool, but she did ultimately step up and work with us to learn how to do it. It was disappointing that it took until the last week of the project to develop this way of collaboration for our team, and I just feel bad that there was a disconnect between us students and our instructor about collaborating on documents. This seems like an easy fix where she could have asked for someone to explain to her how to use it, or for someone to have checked in with us (not the professor checking in) in the middle of the term to make sure we were using all available tools.",

                "Absolutely. Even though this course is required to complete the Global Affairs major, it has been one of, if not the, highlight of my time at Yale. One of the aspects of the major that I was looking most forward to was the capstone, and it certainly met my expectations. I learned so much in terms of content and conducting research. If possible, try to take it with Sue. This course has made me re-think my future career plans in the best way possible.",
