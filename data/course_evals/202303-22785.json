                "I wish the writing assignments were graded more in-depth, but besides that, it was a fantastic course. Very interesting content and engaging lectures made for a great course.",
                "The course is well organized and well taught. Professor DeLuca did an exceptional job of crafting engaging and informative lectures. I would have appreciated learning about some of the quantitative methods deployed by Professor DeLuca.",
                "strengths: very good lectures and slides, great summaries of readings, interesting speakers, had room for engagement in class\r\n\r\nweakness: some readings were very long",
                "strengths: clear expectations on assignments, expansive and thorough exploration of the history and development of voting rights, a great balance of history and actual law\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sections felt unnecessary and not beneficial, some readings were a bit dense or excessive, lectures can be a bit disengaging",
                "Strengths: I think Professor DeLuca was awesome, and really made class fun. I enjoyed every single lecture, and never felt like the topics were irrelevant or boring. The material was almost always interesting and engaging. One of the weaknesses is that at moments the reading load was heavy for a polisci lecture, but that was tweaked as the class went on. I think the biggest weakness was that the grade distribution didn't necessarily make the most sense to me because there was a lot of writing compared to other classes I have taken, yet it only counted for 60% of my grade. The final exam wasn't super hard, and was similar to the grades I got on the writing assignments. I just didn't love that some of the projects that took time and effort were relatively small in terms of the percentage of the final grade. I think the class may be served better by not having a final exam and the policy memo being the final project, and each writing assignment's graded weight increase proportionally.",
                "Professor DeLuca is an obvious strength to this class! His teaching style is great and he's very concise with the information he wants you to know. He goes into detail about election regulations\/law that are genuinely interesting and adapts to what he perceives the class is most interested in. While not a weakness, the weight of class assignments does feel off, since the few writing assignments are comparatively more difficult and more time consuming than the final exam (40%), but each of them individually have very little weight to the overall grade.",
                "The structure this course couldve been better a discussion section was pretty unnecessary considering the lecture aspect of this class was smaller and discussion oriented.",
                "The content was chosen well, and the course was organized in a way that made sense, both chronologically for the historical parts of the class and thematically for the conceptual parts of the class. Although I wished we had the opportunity to discuss campaign finance law, the topics we covered were very interesting and provided a great foundation for understanding elections in the United States.",
                "My recommendation would be allowing us to play around with Dave's Redistricting as some sort of class assignment: an assignment where we have to gerrymander our home state or something would be incredibly fun! I really liked the op-ed, SCOTUS briefing, and policy memo assignments as well."

                "yes! this class will teach you the basics of voting law in the US and it is not stressful at all. Professor DeLuca is super accessible and helpful, and this was just a good learning environment. Also, if you took Con Law with Amar before this, this class will be a breeze. They talk a lot about voting rights cases that Amar covers, and DeLuca covers them in less detail so you'll feel super far ahead. If you are looking for a super manageable class where you will still learn about relevant political information, this class is for you",
                "Absolutely. Professor DeLuca is great, and the course is amazing, even if you're not majoring in Political Science.",
                "I would recommend this course. Professor DeLuca does an exceptional job.",
                "if you are interested in learning about the history of voting rights and the current state of voting rights, it would be a great class, but you should be present in lectures",
                "Yes!!! Professor DeLuca is wonderful and you are able to learn so much about the world of election law that you probably did not know much about. You really get a thorough understanding of the past, present, and future of voting rights and get to engage with incredibly important SCOTUS decisions and other materials that delve into the complexities of voting rights and law. It is very easy to do well. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes! It's a good introduction into the history of voting rights as well as the key legal and political debates surrounding important issues such as voter ID laws and election administration. Professor DeLuca explains all the concepts very clearly, and all of the assignments are designed for students to engage with the content beyond lectures.",
                "Yes I think everyone should take this class in order to gain an understanding of the history of voting rights as well as the current issues facing America in this respect. I think the important thing is it is NOT a law school class, and if you are expecting that you might be disappointed. But as an undergraduate political lecture I think it addresses the concepts in a far more digestible manner.",
                "Yes! As a poli sci major, the course topics were genuinely interesting and I felt engaged with the material in nearly every lecture.",
                "Yes, if someones interested in election laws law",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you enjoy learning about American politics and want to better understand the mechanism that determines the officials who will represent the people. It incorporates a fair amount of American history, mainly from the post-Civil War era and the Civil Rights movement period through present day.",
                "It was a typical lecture course in American politics; if you're already familiar with the VRA and concepts like Reynolds v Sims and the reapportionment revolution already ring a bell, there'll be little new material to learn. It's a nice gut for those experienced with redistricting, reapportionment, etc. Be prepared to become incredibly grateful for the VRA and incredible shocked at how pervasive gerrymandering is."
