                "great class, could chill out at end of the semester",
                "Strength: Prof. Humphrey is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. Interesting and engaging lectures about a broad range of topics. Got to see lots of aspects of the problem on a surface level. Very accessible for any major; different parts will be challenging depending on your background. I knew nothing about this before and now I know a good amount.\r\nWeakness: Assignments were arbitrary/unscheduled/random. Not always clear what we needed to know for the exams. Due to time/scope could not go super deep in any one topic.",
                "Strengths: Professor Humphrey was a great and engaging lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: Group projects always suffer from the problem that some people pull their weight more than others",
                "This course is designed to spark students' interest in something that can be fixed/improved about research/engineering/medicine related to tissue engineering. Professor Humphrey does a really good job with this. Most of the class is organized around a group project that builds off of the material taught in the first half of the course. As such, the second half of the course is mostly group project work, and there was very little material between the midterm and the final. Considering the group project requires a presentation and a paper due at the end of the semester, the final exam seemed like an unnecessary addition. It wasn't much different than the midterm, and we had already plenty of grades (10 homework assignments, a midterm, final presentation and final paper).",
                "Course is well organized!",
                "Strengths: lectures are very interesting, the group aspect of the course was nice\r\nWeaknesses: some concepts difficult to learn and find outside, supplementary material about, lack of practice for concepts/delayed feedback on homeworks",
                "Strengths: Professor Humphrey makes each lecture deeply engaging. Everything is done on blackboard, and the pace is manageable and makes time for questions and tangents. This course reminded me a lot of my favorite high school science classes in that you don't need a background in biology to be able to deeply engage each day and ask more about the subject. Assignments are light, and the final project is reasonable. Weaknesses: not too many. The final was a little more difficult than expected",
                "Strengths: wonderful and engaging teacher\r\nWeaknesses: if you don't take notes religiously you cannot do this course",
                "Uncertainty with grading. I wish our grade was structured more into check-ins i.e. we would turn in a proposal, receive a grade that would count towards the final paper category, and get concrete feedback. This would alleviate some of the uncertainty among the grading. I also think an in-class second midterm instead of a final, and a faster turnaround for presentation grades would have been useful."

                "Yes! Really interesting course that isnt just a regular lecture. Professor truly cares about his students and a great way to work with peers across various fields",
                "Absolutely. I took this for my science credit and greatly enjoyed it. I found the professor and the topic deeply engaging. The class was ~30 people and yet felt closer to a seminar than a leminar/lecture. Professor Humphrey learned all our names. Just a small heads up that there is some amount of algebra and partial differential equations that come up in the mechanics discussions and on midterm/test questions.",
                "Absolutely. Forwarning, however, there is little work outside class for most of the school year. 90% of the work takes place in the last couple of weeks. There is a paper, presentation, and final.",
                "Yes- This class was amazing, largely due to Professor Humphrey constantly encouraging everyone and maintaining an overwhelmingly positive attitude every day.\r\nI will say that one thing that felt problematic to me was that 75% of the final grade was unknown at the deadline for Cr/D/Fail. This is because of ungraded homework assignments, a final presentation, the final exam, and a final paper.\r\nIf you take this course, I would also advise getting started on the final project early, and meeting with your group outside of class time early-on. Professor Humphrey is always willing to provide advice and guidance along the way.\r\nAlso, even though other reviews mentioned an interdisciplinary approaches/projects, I think it is far overstated the course is at heart a biomedical research course. I dont think any of the projects this year had any large non-biology component, but more of a we could use computational modeling and artificial intelligence to improve our approach in the future or a brief economic assessment of the market for something like a bioreactor."
