                "I like how the course meets frequently and gives a lot of work (meeting its 1.5 credit designation), since the repetition helps me learn. A weakness may be that some asynchronous assignments feel less helpful\/relevant to the current course material, but this could be improved by spending some time to introduce the assignment and talk about it instead of just having a canvas post dictate the assignment for the day."
