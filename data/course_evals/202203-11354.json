I also gained a lot of practice in logically explaining my thoughts in Korean rather than just a simple statement. We also did a lot of societal/cultural segments that taught me a lot about the Korean workplace and issues such as gender discrimination, racism, etc. in Korea.",

I especially enjoyed having debates in Korean which helped improve fluency but also gain valuable insight on topics related to Korean culture.",

                "Very fun, relaxing environment to learn Korean! Strengths were having the course based upon a korean drama, but the weaknesses are that sometimes just talking about Misaeng can get a little repetitive and redundant.",
                "The strength is definitely the instructor. Professor Back was so enthusiastic about this class and it showed! It was also very nice to have a mix of heritage and a few non-heritage speakers so we could have a variety of perspectives during debates. Having a smaller class that encourages interaction was extremely helpful in becoming comfortable in making mistakes in front of my classmates, and it built a lot of camaraderie among our class. Another strength was the weekly TA sections, in which I was able to speak in Korean for about an hour with a TA. It's really important to not just learn things in class, but also have to produce Korean in organic situations, which the TA sections were perfect for. Weaknesses: Some of the course material felt dated and not very relevant today, especially the Misaeng worksheets we had to fill out. The drama that we watched throughout the semester, Misaeng, was also extremely difficult to follow because of the complex business plot (even reading English subtitles was difficult).",
                "I enjoyed having debates as a class and receiving feedback from my instructor; however, I wish we could have gone over new vocabulary in class before having to write sentences for our assignments. Although I was able to have many of my questions addressed through meeting with the teaching fellow, it would have been more convenient to have already discussed them in class.",
                "more focus on using vocabulary would be nice",
                "I love the small seminar environment of this course as well as the professor in trying to engage her students. I wish there were more opportunities to have fun while engaging with the Korean culture through activities."

                "Yes, especially with Professor Back! It was very nice to be in a heritage class and you get very comfortable and close with your classmates throughout the semester. It's also just a very fun class, and I looked forward to attending each time.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The workload was not heavy at all, and the instructor provided very useful feedback. I enjoyed doing the assignments and attending class every week. The teaching style of my instructor was unlike any I have seen in other language classes; it was interesting, and I truly enjoyed being in my instructor's class.",
