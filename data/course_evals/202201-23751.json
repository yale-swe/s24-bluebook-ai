                "I gained incredibly valuable insights into the political discourse of mass atrocities. By studying a historic overview of the atrocities and genocides throughout world history, I have gained skills in identifying the legal components necessary for making a genocide determination and a greater appreciation for the real-world, global consequences of mass atrocities. Through readings, discussions, and my senior thesis research, I have gained a deeper degree of seriousness regarding genocides, especially with the contemporary violence occurring in Ukraine right now.",

                "There was a supreme focus in this class on the history of genocide studies and the details of actions by the international community to stop genocide. This class opened my eyes to the breadth of genocide claims and the complicated and ever-changing definition of genocide. We largely did work through analytical papers but also wrote much shorter briefs defending or attacking a genocide claim, both modern and historical. Ultimately, the class was a synthesis between a tradition political science seminar based on the readings and a history class with a deep dive into the timelines of mass attrocities.",
                "International Relations! How international justice is viewed and restored. The difficulties surrounding genocide and genocide determination. The influences of power, gender, race, and religion on mass subjugation.",

                "The readings and assignments are engaging and thoughtful. The simulation exercises are educational and a ton of fun, definitely a highlight of the course. Weaknesses are few and fleeting, overall an excellent course and would highly recommend.",
                "The course seemed to veer off track at the end of the syllabus a bit, and there weren't major through lines across weeks. It might be helpful if the professor did more framing during seminars about how the weeks fit together.",
                "While the topic of the course is extremely interesting and Professor Simon is an expert, the seminar meetings felt very disorganized. It was hard to take structured notes or know when to participate. Sometimes our discussions felt very directionless with little relevance to the readings.",
                "Strengths: Perfectly structured (I genuinely feel like I got a comprehensive introduction to the field of mass atrocities studies)\r\nWeaknesses: I think the simulation setup could use some reworking (less time spent on the formal statements and more of the informal back-and-forth discourse)",
                "Tended to be a lot more lecture than discussion. Readings are very interesting. Topic is interesting and Prof. Simon is absolutely so brilliant and knowledgeable about it.",
                "Not many strengths. A lot of interesting material but everything felt incohesive.",
                "I thought the pacing of this course was strong, but the seminar discussions were often lacking. Professor Simon spoke a lot and often had very interesting things to say but I think it encouraged people to disengage. I was disappointed that it felt like people were not heavily engaging with the readings. When it came time for the simulations, people were definitely engaged, but again time management was a bit of an issue."

                "If the course/meetings could be restructured to be more focused and discussion based then I would recommend this course because the material is interesting. However, I wouldnt recommend it as it is now to students who like structured classes and discussions.",
                "Definitely! Even if you only have minor interest in the topic, the course covers some really intriguing material",
                "Yes but you should shop it first and see if you like the lecture / teaching style of Prof. Simon.",
                "I would not recommend this course. It was a very disorganized one that had interesting material but failed to engage me towards the end of the semester.",
                "Yes if you are interested in the topic but it can get a bit heavy.",
                "I very much enjoyed the class and would definitely recommend it to another student. It was engaging and well-focused. The readings were very interesting and matched the weekly seminar topics for the most part. Prof. Simon is also quite excellent and makes himself very available to his students.",
                "Yes! Professor Simon does an excellent job at student engagement with his assigned readings, projects, and speakers. The topic of this course is rather dark and can be difficult to stomach, but as the work leaders attempt to gain more power, the knowledge that one walks away from this class with is ever so important.",
                "Honestly, I'm not sure. While I want to give an enthusiastic yes because Professor Simon is very genuine and the subject material is interesting, it was not among the most engaging seminars I have taken. Sometimes it felt like the discussions were directionless and people were zoned out despite the professor's best intentions."
