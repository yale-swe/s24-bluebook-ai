   "comments": [
    "Great intro to epidemiology.",
    "Really enjoyed a lot of the readings.\r\nA good general overview of epidemiology\r\nGreat lecturer in terms of charisma and knowledge and ability to explain difficult concepts\r\nImprovements suggested - lectures set out in a clearer manner - like biostatistics, so you can use the lecture notes as summaries of the topic. Don't freeze the room so much - had to take 2 sweaters to class every day in the middle of summer!",
    "Strengths: It is an excellent course for public health people to take\r\nWeaknesses; Only one person presenting the course, so monotonous. \r\nImprovement: More even distribution of course material through the curriculum for example less time on studies and more on the other aspects which were rushed over during the last few classes like effect modification and confounding",
    "Strengths: Mayur is a great instructor and make us think critically. He has useful examples from the literature and stimulates discussion in class.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of important concepts and models are reviewed really fast in class although I understand that time is limited and that we can expand the concepts outside the class with books and articles. \r\nAnother weakness are the assignments feedback. These are really well done and applicable to our learning. I did my best to solve all the assignments and to apply the concepts that I thought I learned. However, my assignments scores were really low and my TA did not provided strong feedback so I felt my learning was not strong and felt frustrated with the assignments.",
    "Good course.  I really liked the instructor.  With a research background\/inclination it was very thought provoking.  A couple students without a similar background, brought to my attention that the instructor assumed that some basic concepts were self explanatory and failed to address these which hindered their comprehension of the material.  The teaching assistant did not engage the class in any capacity --> she was not present during lectures, made no attempt to get to know us, and my sole interaction with her was her asking me to move from the space where I was studying so that she could have office hours.",
    "This course covered essential concepts of the epidemiology, and helped me to interpret public health journal articles in a more critical way. However, sometimes I felt the pace of the course was somewhat fast. I think it was because it was an accelerated course, and some of the concepts were related to biostatistics we did not learn.",
    "The course was helpful and useful. My one suggestion is on the pacing of the course as a whole - we spent a few weeks on course design, which I felt could have been condensed into fewer lectures. The concepts towards the end such as bias and confounding were a little rushed through as a result.",
    "I think the course was well taught.",
    "Excellent",
    "Very useful information, high yield information regarding study design and interpretation, engaging instructor, logical progression through material. Exam\/HW questions were occasionally difficult to interpret or were not clearly associated with lecture material.",
    "As a foundation course, it established the basics of what we'll need to know. Followed a logical path and Mayur is wonderful. Given the nature of a lot of dual MPH\/MBA students in the summer course, could be improved by ensuring content is completed before the MBA compulsory things begin",
    "I think it was a great class. I would have preferred more textbook readings. I felt the textbook was definitely a useful tool.",
    "This class was a helpful introduction to epidemiology. It is difficult to cover everything in the short summer semester, but I think the lectures are well designed. I think having the TF participate more in class would be a great improvement. Also, it might be beneficial to add a 5-minute break in the middle of the class to refresh mind.",
    "very good, informative, funny, demanding, great environment",
    "Great teacher too much time dedicated to study design relative to analysis",
    "Good. Clear lessons and plans and i understood the road map and objectives for the course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the end exam was arduous and took close to 7 hours.",
    "It provided a helpful broad overview of types of public health studies, which I had no understanding of previously. I think having more practice problems available to try out before we had our final exam would have been helpful to ensure I was understanding the material correctly."

    "Hilarious witty teacher. Stimulates critical thinking outside the box",
    "See above",
    "Strengths: Fluent diction, good language skills, well read and lot of information\r\nWeaknesses:  Doubts raised during class not explained well, more doubts than before the class, no use of whiteboard to demonstrate points, less involvement of class in the lecture\r\nScope for improvement: Curriculum design- better distribution of the material and the classes over the entire course- less focus on the various study designs and more on the other aspects like the survival analysis, prevalence incidence rates and so on and also advice on how to study epidemiology\r\nThe use of various reading material based on other researches is a good approach but it went beyond what a student could read before class because assignments took a lot more time. There was no time for personal reading and understanding course material.",
    "Great instructor, he is very knowledgeable and provides useful examples.",

    "The course was well-organized, and he helped us understand the concepts intuitively with a good sense of humor.",
    "Mayur was great, he was very helpful and made the class engaging and interactive.",
    "Mayur is a great professor and I learned a lot from him especially from the personal experiences he shared with us. I will be taking more of his classes.",
    "Excellent",
    "Instructor was engaging, thoughtful, and approachable. Was always willing to field questions and delve deeper into any challenging or confusing material. Tied the lecture material to our professions\/careers\/demographics when able.",
    "His knowledge is remarkable, and his passion for the field is genuine. His readings selection made a dry subject interesting",
    "He's amazing. That's my evaluation.  No weakness all strength I like how the course was structured.",
    "Mayur is really good at explaining the concepts and evaluating studies. I really enjoyed the discussion held in class on relevant research studies and how he guided us through critiquing the papers. I like the general course structure, but it was quite fast-paced towards the end. Maybe throwing the simple OR, RR calculation lectures before going over all the study types. This way students can have more practice on calculation.",
    "very knowledgeable, responsive to feedback & supportive",
    "Awesome",
    "good. I really enjoy Mayur's style of teaching, he is so knowledgable and helpful. He made an effort to get to know all of us quickly and establish a strong rapport.",
    "Mayur was a funny and engaging professor. I wish we could worked through more example problems in class."

    "Highlight of the AP MPH thus far. Decent introduction to more rigorous study designs and analyses.",
    "Yes - good background overview of epidemiology",
    "I think the course itself is good but would not recommend it to another student. I think I know less now than before and am more confused than ever.",
    "I would recommend it. Really good course to start thinking about epidemiology.",
    "Good course.  I really liked the instructor.  With a research background\/inclination it was very thought provoking.

I would recommend this course to other students.  It is a fundamental course in understanding research design, which is a cornerstone of making informed public health decisions.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to new coming students because it is helpful to understand essential concepts to write and interpret research papers even if their major is not epidemiology.",
    "Yes, epidemiology is a useful class and I would recommend this to another student.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student.",
    "Challenging course covering major topics in epidemiology, study design, and study interpretation, that will be very useful in our future education and careers.",
    "An essential course which is taught well and will set you up for success.",
    "I like epi it was challenging at some points but a good challenge that makes you stronger in the end. I would recommend them to take the class as it will help you better understand study design and how to analyze your studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend - great introduction to epidemiology",
    "Course value worth work required",
    "Yes I would recommend the course based on the content but mainly Mayur.",
    "This course provided a broad overview of types of health studies. I would recommend it if you have no experience in epidemiologic studies and don't necessarily want to produce those studies yourself, but need to know when each is relevant and what the results mean. For others, I'm not sure we would have gotten into enough depth."
