I also improved Spanish reading, writing, talking, and listening.",
                "Significantly improved my Spanish reading and conversational ability.",
                "I learned a lot from this course - content-wise about indigenous cosmologies in South America, Latin American fiction, and questions of rights/legal frameworks for environmental issues. Skills-wise, I definitely think my reading, writing, and speaking in spanish improved through the course, and I also gained new strategies for analyzing texts. I found the class to be very thought-provoking and conceptually rich (particularly in regards to questions of agency, relationships between the human/non-human, and how knowledge/meaning is generated and spread)."

                "I do not see any weaknesses in the course. I believe it is structured in a way that is clear for student learning, particularly in course discussions, readings, and projects (such as the reader's theater and final project).",
                "very great for its first semester. maybe id suggest a different final project or a different rubric for the final",
                "This is an excellent Spanish course, by far the most instructive and engaging L5 course I have taken in the department. The work is thoughtful and clearly beneficial, the class conversations are vigorous and participatory, and the material is new and provocative. If you want to improve your Spanish as well as learn about a very interesting field of thought, this is an excellent course for you. Just be prepared to be detail-oriented in assignments and put in a fair amount of work. Since the course was new, some of the assignments required further clarification, and it was not always clear what was due when, but I think that should not be a continuing problem going forward, and it was not inhibitory.",
                "There were a lot of weekly assignments that helped improve reading but were often more than we could discuss in class. Having fewer readings that students can read more in-depth and have more nuanced conversations about in class would be helpful.",
                "The readings, reading responses, and assignments are all very well designed. I think that the reading responses could have been every other week rather than every week, which would have been more manageable for the students and professor. I particularly appreciated the creativity of the larger assignments, such as the reader's theater and the final project.",
                "Strengths: Varied assignments that didn't feel like busy work. The journal entries helped me reflect on what I had learned that week, and larger assignments were creative and allowed for collaboration. Weaknesses: Readings were interesting but too long, and a few had to be purchased."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students! The readings and the projects are fantastic, and the class is very interdisciplinary and reflective.",
                "absolutely! for improving spanish language skills and learning about important concepts",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone looking to take an L5. You will learn more than in most any other Spanish class--both in terms of content and skills in Spanish. The discussions are well-facilitated and everyone participates. The course benefits from Prof. Njera who has a clear vision for education and instruction--more so than the vast majority of professors at Yale. Everything she does in and out of the classroom is for a reason. Even if you don't agree with her all the time or get frustrated by the need to fulfill the various requirements she includes in all assignments, nothing in the class is random or inexplicable. It is a fair amount of work on the weekly basis, but the larger assignments are spaced out, so the workload is relatively even throughout the semester. If you want to take a Spanish class that will improve your Spanish and teach you a lot, this is a great one to take.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are dedicated to improving their Spanish. If students want to take this course just to maintain their Spanish or for fun, the workload is very high and it will take up a lot of time for a 5th class.",
                "Yes, I would. There is a fair amount of work and there is a very particular way that you are supposed to do it (each assignment has an elaborate rubric). That being said, I found that the expectations were usually clear and that the structure of the assignments did generally help my learning. The course material was robust and thought-provoking. This is the best Spanish course I have taken at Yale, and definitely worth it if you are willing to put in the effort.",
                "Definitely. It's a great way to expand your Spanish (and English tbh) vocabulary and knowledge of Indigenous theoretical frameworks regarding the \"natural world.\" For example, you'll learn about Aztec metaphysics and the Capitalocene, and you'll walk away with a new manner of interacting with the energy forms and species around you. You'll even look at mosquitos differently. Be prepared to read and listen to a lot of Spanish, but if you're looking for a somewhat philosophical class and you're interested in texts and beliefs regarding energy and spirit, then you will truly appreciate this course."
