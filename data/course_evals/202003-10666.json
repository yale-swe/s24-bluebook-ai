                "Heritage Russian obviously caters to many different levels of Russian, so I think the rigor of assignments definitely helped me improve my Russian by throwing me into the deep-end (think never having written a sentence in Russian to writing essays in half a semester) and this was sometimes intimidating. When I had just started sometimes the homework assignments with walls of text instructions that it would take me a while to even just finish reading, so I wish the course maybe slowed down a bit in some places. Overall though the method of teaching was really beneficial.",
                "It is a difficult course in concept because everyone was starting out at different levels, and this is a weakness simply inherent in heritage-speaker courses. Professor Titus was extremely accommodating though and did a great job meeting students halfway, it was just easy to feel personally insecure. She certainly fostered a positive learning environment.",
                "The course was slightly disorganized I think by the pure nature of it being online. It often seemed like we were jumping from one topic to another and it seemed difficult to keep track of all the rules we were learning. Oftentimes our homework did not match what was on the syllabus, also, so that could be improved. In general, a slower learning pace and a more thorough step-by-step of how to think through the rules on the whiteboard would have been helpful.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course had a wonderful TA and a very caring Professor who were very helpful in answering questions.",
                "strengths - very small class (we were just 6 people), a lot of support any time you need it, just a very fun class where you learn a ton\r\nweaknesses - it's a little unclear how to follow the syllabus in terms of the homework and the tests, but I was never overwhelmed"

                "This class was essentially taught as it would be in person, just on Zoom. The only difference was that tests could be taken anytime in a 24 hour slot, which was very nice and helped me be less stressed about exams.",

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any Russian speaker- you don't know how exciting it is to improve your Russian until you do it. The class may seem a little fast if your literacy skills are weak, but it is very much worth it.",
                "I think it is valuable for heritage speakers because courses designed for English-speakers will never target your linguistic needs in the same capacity. It was certainly hard at points when the expectations seem to exceed your capabilities, a lot of knowledge is assumed. If you fall behind, the topics compound one another, making studying for exams very daunting. I would say the course does the best it can, and Professor Titus would always meet students with reason.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to native speakers of Russian with no former training.",
                "I loved this course! It was one of my favourite classes. I had no idea how much I could learn for three months, but now I can speak and write actual essays. I learnt so so much and had constant support. I love the TA and going to office hours. I also requested a language tutor and that was  ahuge support. As a whole, this is a super fun class where you can learn a  lot if you put in the work. The class itself is not heavy on work load compared to other classes, but this allows you to be more relaxed and to learn just for the sake of learning."
