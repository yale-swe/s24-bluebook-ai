                "I learned a great deal about German cultural history of the 20th and 21st centuries, and how that history was reflected in the works of filmmakers throughout that stretch of time.

                "I found this class to be incredibly useful in regards to thinking critically about film. The readings that we were given, as well as the viewing of the films themselves, were tremendously entertaining and illuminating. I found myself ingesting a bevy of material that I would otherwise never have touched and I am thankful that this course offered no shortage of interesting articles, books, and other theoretical texts that I can now apply to my own practice as well. I also learned a great deal about Weimar cinema in general, a topic that I was familiar with in the first place. In short, this course was challenging in the best way."

                "This course's sole strength is the films which it discusses; many were truly excellent, and all but a few were definitely worth watching. However, no aspect of the class added anything which watching these films on one's own time could not replicate, and in many cases the class experience worsened the films in hindsight. The readings were at best irrelevant to the films under discussion and at worst hyperfocused on specific aspects which seemed incidental both to the movies and to our discussion thereof; by the midterm, perfect recall of all these readings' arguments was expected. Class discussion, meanwhile, was laughably disorganized, consisting of equal parts wasting time rewatching scenes we had already seen, sitting around as Professor Naqvi fished for specific, nonobvious answers to questions about those scenes, and reading long blocks of text which had little relationship to anything else. Logistics for the class were a nightmare. When the midterm was postponed a week before it was set to be given, we were informed that this would be offset by the cancellation of the final, despite the fact that no final exam had been planned at any point. The final paper's due date was stated as three different times in three different places. Our first response paper deadline was sprung on us with a week's warning, despite the fact that said assignment was a significant percentage of the grade. Less than half of the supplementary materials on the syllabus were actually covered. The only way to improve this class is to throw the whole thing away and start again from scratch, deciding whether it is to be a lecture course with a broad range of topics or a seminar which undertakes a few deep dives, and to tear up every lesson plan, syllabus draft, and assingment text which has been associated with it thusfar. A new number might be appropriate as well, perhaps a new professor, perhaps a new department, perhaps a new university; anything worth saving was produced in a movie studio, not in New Haven.",
                "Strengths are the wide range of films and genres we cover. Weakness is the loose structure of the course. There were only 5 assignments total (including a midterm) which did not really allow me to see how how I was doing in the course until the very end. As someone who has never take a film course before, it was very tough for to adapt to the structure of the class and really learn HOW to approach the content. This would have been fine if I had known that my approach needed to change earlier on, but this was not possible. I'd advise that anyone who wants to take this course for fun, make sure you have some film analysis knowledge before hand.",
                "i appreciated that this class mixed lecture style presentations with seminar style discussions and also gave the opportunity for separate screenings.",
                "The course has many strengths. Fatima is an excellent professor and is extremely generous with her time, thoughts, and overall engagement with the class. The syllabus as well holds a wealth of fascinating material that we were able to cover throughout the semester, both the mainstream and the obscure. The writing assignments never felt like a chore, which I also appreciate. It is rare that I enjoy writing an academic paper, which I'm happy to say was the case in this class. \r\n\r\nThe course has very few weaknesses I feel. I'm honestly not sure how I would improve it."

                "I would not recommend this class to another student under any circumstance. Though I really enjoyed many of the movies which we watched, I would have enjoyed them much more watching them in my room for my own pleasure, as every other aspect of the class was simply awful. Classtime dragged on and on as we alternated between logistical and technological difficulties, rewatches of scenes we had already seen in complete silence, leading questions with one expected answer which was both non-obvious and in many cases impossible to ascertain without prior knowledge, and long excurses on seemingly random subjects. Some aspects of any given film were discussed endlessly, far past the point where any student had any curiousity or insight on the matter, while others were left totally unmentioned despite their central role in the film itself. The same was true of the readings, some of which were endlessly litigated and relitigated in class discussions, with passages not only included in slide decks but read aloud in full, while others were perfunctorily thrown on the syllabus and never mentioned again. It was thus impossible to know what material would be applicable to our midterm questions, some of which ended up expecting perfect recall of certain readings. At times the class resembled a poorly managed seminar, with long periods of silence prompted by poorly conceived discussion questions, and at times it resembled an unplanned lecture, with long slide decks which were never finished, clips shown at length followed by surprise they had been shown, and constant failure to include all content promised on the syllabus. The screening periods were similarly mismanaged, with every moment where the film was not playing punctuated by an almost farcical attempt to provide pedagogy and discussion without any preparation for either. Avoid at all cost!",
                "I'd recommend this course to anyone who enjoys german culture, film, or needs a german course requirement.",
                "yes, especially other film majors. I think having a knowledge of german cinema is vital in the overarching study of film.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. The assignments are intellectually challenging but physically relatively simple and the material covered in the class can be applied to practically anyone from any background or concentration. Much of the material covered is not exclusive to the world of film, which I really enjoyed. Fatima is also really easy to talk with and genuinely feels invested in the success and engagement of her students."
