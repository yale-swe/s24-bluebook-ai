                "Strengths: Everything! Professor Aldrich is beyond kind and genuinely cares for all of her students, taking the time to chat with them before class and making the classroom space a welcoming environment. The readings themselves were all fascinating and, for the most part, manageable, with the one improvement being a slight emphasis on quantitative analysis at certain sections of the course. The discussions were great, and the instructor made a normally \"dry\" topic super exciting and engaging. The assignments were all enjoyable; a class \"case study\" on one country (these can be blogs, podcasts, etc.) and a research poster in place of a final paper (although she mentioned next year it will involve original research). Weaknesses: none, incredible course, an amazing instructor.",
                "Strengths: very interesting topic, course assignments very creative and meaningful, professor very knowledgeable/engaged/kind\r\nWeaknesses: maybe a little less theoretical readings and a bit more examples from modern day",
                "Unfortunately this class just falls flat. There was so much promise in the syllabus and the readings are pretty solid (albeit very rudimentary for such a high level class), but the professor did not do a good job of structuring the course. It was overall quite basic and I felt as though I was hardly challenged when I showed up to class. The professor's teaching style just needs work and it seemed like she wasn't familiar with the subject material."

                "I would certainly recommend this course to another student! The course itself really changes the way you view electoral systems and political parties, for better or for worse (although for me it interestingly made me more sympathetic to the \"idea\" of a political party). Prof. Aldrich is just so kind and tries her hardest to make the topic enjoyable (succeeding 95% of the time, the other 5% is because this was a 9:25 am and we were all sometimes tired), and you should definitely try to take a class with her as an instructor at some point!",
                "Absolutely! The topic is super interesting, and professor Aldrich is one of my favorite professors at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. The readings are interesting, the projects fun, and Professor Aldrich is great.",
                "I felt like this course was perhaps a little off from the normal semester, but the discussions just stuck mostly to summaries of the readings rather than analysis and weren't as satisfying as I'd hoped. Subject material is interesting and Professor Aldrich is quite kind and willing to help.",
                "No. As I said earlier, the course just does not live up to its name. It seemed more like an entry level course than a high level course and the instructor was not up to par, seemingly not familiar with her syllabus and its materials. I felt as though many questions I asked were not even answered in class rather just dodged."
