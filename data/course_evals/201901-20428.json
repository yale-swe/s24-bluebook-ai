    "Gained new grammatical and expressive skills, new vocab, new knowledge of Deaf culture and historical figures. My ASL has visibly improved from this time last year or even last semester, and I am confidently able to jump into conversation with Deaf people around me, though I'm far from fluent. I specifically have a stronger understanding of grammatical structures in ASL, which are really different from structures in English or any spoken language I've learned.",

    "Honestly, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I was excited to attend class every day (and it was literally every day). The activities and assignments were fun and inventive. I learned a lot and I felt excited about the progress I was making. Jessica is an incredible teacher and we're lucky to have her.",
    "Strength- engaging and fun material, structure of class facilitated learning in a fun way",
    "The course was well taught with relevant subject material and useful assignments. The only improvement I might have is sticking more closely to the schedule outlined in the syllabus so that we can get to all topics\/assignments",
    "Professor Tanner is amazing and mixes up the classes with presentations, vocabulary, and speakers."

    "Yes!!! Even if you don't think you have a reason to take ASL, take it. Jessica does an incredible job, and her classroom is fun and inviting. It will get your brain working in new ways. She explains concepts so clearly and expects a lot of us.",
    "Yes yes yes please take this class if you have any interest in deaf culture or sign language.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Tanner is incredible and learning sign language was a delight. I cant wait to continue next semester!",
    "Absolutely! Professor Tanner is fun, friendly, and an amazing teacher. The subject material is interesting and exciting and important to know. Definitely take this class if you can get in!",
    "Yes! If you are looking for a language that is different and exciting take ASL!"
