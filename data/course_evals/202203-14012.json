I highly recommend the course to anyone who is curious or wants to delve deeply into a single work of literature. The Tale of Genji is one of the most significant works ever written, not just in the Japanese canon, but globally. I had a great time delving into discussions of the readings, covering every topic imaginable. Also, Professor James Scanlon-Canegata is fantastic and has so much knowledge about the topic. It was great to be able to create and discuss theories about the work throughout the year."
