   "comments": [
    "This course is a great way to develop comparative analysis skills. The first paper, which focused on the comparison of two texts, and the second paper, which focused on reception, taught you how to clearly and carefully consider primary sources both relative to one another and relative to their roles in the literary canon. Seminars discussions were fruitful and added a whole new layer to the novels themselves.",
    "I learnt so much in this class. How to have a riveting discussion, how to actually write an essay properly, how to get excited about office hours! I learnt all about Walter Scott, of whom I knew nothing before, and more about Jane Austen. The genre of historical fiction is fascinating and I have now started to think about the contrasts between history and fiction in a much more serious manner.",
    "Not only did I become more adept with handling complex secondary material (Franco Moretti, Georg Lukacs), but the class on Austen and Scott had helped me to see how novelists who had apparently different concerns and subject material were, in truth, not as dissimilar as we might often think at first.",
    "I learned both close-reading skills and methods of conducting research. I also learned more about the digital humanities and how to incorporate it into my research. Re: course content, I feel I have a strong understanding of Jane Austen and Walter Scott's often-converging publication history.",
    "Overview of two authors contemporary to each other. It was really interesting to see how Scott, who was incredibly popular in his time, compares to Austen, who is much more popular now.",
    "I gained skills in learning how to analyse and compare works of literature and authors styles. I also learned a lot about late 18th and early 19th century British literature in the context of world events at that time."

   "comments": [
    "Organization and material were both real strong points of this course, as was class discussion. The best part of this course was that it did not attempt to reach beyond its own boundaries. Scott and Austen are not 20th century writers and should not be read as such. It was refreshing to engage with them on their own terms rather than to artificially layer on modern social and cultural concerns.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses to speak of!",
    "This class was magnificent. It was incredibly interesting and the selection of books we read was great. I wish we'd had time to read more, but I think six was the perfect amount. The class was so well organised that it always went really well. There was never a silent moment, and sometimes this was because we were all just so excited to talk, and other times because Professor Eccles had such a good plan. The size of the class was also good - it was just big enough to have a variety of opinions, but not so small that you ever felt like everything depended on you. Also, we would often get to class early just to talk about our thoughts, and leave late because we couldn't stop talking! I enjoyed the \"field trip\" to the DHL, and honestly I have nothing bad to say about this class.",
    "Due to the small seminar size, class discussion were always engaging: I always did feel comfortable bouncing off ideas with my classmates. I particularly enjoyed how Professor Eccles would encourage all of us to visit her during her office hours, and how she would show concern for us not simply as students but also as people. \r\n\r\nI took a while to warm up to the course at first, but I felt quite intimidated when we were all asked to go around in a circle to express our preliminary thoughts on the book. I enjoyed the class much more when that practice was removed at the second half of the semester. Moreover, I wonder if it might be better to read Pride and Prejudice and Waverley separately instead of reading them together. I found it easier to focus on one text at a time, which was the case for the books after Mansfield Park.",
    "Strengths: Professor Eccles created a well thought-out and well-organized curriculum, with specific guiding questions and themes each week to aid us in understanding the era, reception, and focuses of Austen and Scott. She chose excellent books to give us an understanding of each author, and she engaged the class fully in each. We were given a great deal of help and guidance on assignments and discussions were robust. I also really enjoyed reading Pride & Prejudice at the same time as Waverley and comparing each side-by-side, which I know was a particular experiment of Prof. Eccles'. Weaknesses: none. A really, really wonderful class.",
    "Discussion was always engaging! Often it would start before the class even began and trail on afterwards. Everyone seemed very close.",
    "This course was really strong in its emphasis on discussion and the texts we talked about, and we were given a lot of helpful and thorough feedback. It also incorporated a lot of different ways of thinking about the novels we read, which kept the course really engaging."

    "Yes definitely if you are interested in the novel as genre of literature or the turn of the 19th century!",
    "Yes. Yes yes yes yes. I'd recommend any class with Professor Eccles, but this one specifically because I've taken in. If you have any interest in literature, in English, in stories, in Austen, in Scott, in England, in Scotland, in 18th century life, in 19th century life, in the past, in how the past informs the future, in how to write an essay, a good one, in how to plan to write an essay, in talking about manners, about culture, about fashion, in reading scathing reviews and wonderful reviews, in seeing how the world is so connected... Basically if you have any ounce of interest in anything at all, you should take this class. PLEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. My best class at Yale. You will want to write the essays. The first essay I wrote for this class was the first essay I didn't cry once while writing. And I'm a Junior English Major who loves English, so that says something.",
    "Yes! Professor Eccles is lovely: she really cares about you and your reactions to the material. You will really learn so much from this course, especially if you take the time to ponder seriously about the concerns that Austen and Scott were grappling with during the nineteenth century.",
    "Yes, absolutely -- this was my favorite class I've taken at Yale and the class I've been most intellectually stimulated in. Professor Eccles was absolutely wonderful; she was prepared for every class and led some of the richest, most fruitful discussions I've had in the English department. The subject of the course was interesting -- looking at Scott and Austen from both modern perspectives, from the perspectives of their readers at the time, and from the perspective of each other -- but I think Professor Eccles is responsible for really bringing that subject to life with careful insight and an ability to engage students. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to think deeply and critically about what it means to create canonical or forgotten texts, but also anyone who wants to take a class with a brilliant and genuinely caring professor. Workload was not overbearing -- the same as any English junior seminar -- and I enjoyed all the books (it was particularly fun to read Pride & Prejudice in an academic setting). This was such a  fun class, by which I do not mean to minimize my intellectual engagement; I think reading books and engaging critically with them should almost always be fun, exciting, or at least meaningful, but this is the first time at Yale I have truly felt that to be true.",
    "Definitely! Though I think a lot of my enjoyment came from my fellow students, I really loved this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. All the literature we read was made really accessible interesting through our discussions in class, and the assignments were fun and interesting."
