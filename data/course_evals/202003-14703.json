                "This course was an excellent primer on the economic conflicts and challenges facing China's future development. Each class covered a major hurdlefrom the US or Chinese perspectiveand students were expected to contextualize the topic with their in-class comments. I have gained a new appreciation for the codependent relationship between the world's two economic suprerpowers.",
                "To think more critically about issues surrounding China and its economy. Learned build my arguments more effectively and coherently",
                "I learned about the key transitions of the Chinese economy, including the challenges and opportunities for Chinese economic growth looking forward, as well as key obstacles and turning points in the U.S.-China codependent relationship. Much of the course was grounded in an empirical analysis of these challenges, and we analyzed both the U.S. and Chinese strategic goals and initiatives. I also had the opportunity to refine my argumentation through two op-ed pieces and a longer research paper on a topic of my choice.",
                "Learned about all about Chinese politics, with a focus on the country's economy. Lots of insightful information regarding China and its relationship with the rest of the world, as well as threats to Chinese economic growth in the future.",
                "I learned about the inter-workings of China economically, and how their relationship with the US has impacted that.",
                "I learned a lot about China's economic model, mostly about how China has been shifting from an export-based growth model to consumer-based growth model fueled by indigenous innovation over the past decade. I also learned a lot about how China has engaged with the US during this economic shift.",
                "Learned a lot about US-China economic relations, the economics of trade and trade deficits, and got a very clear snapshot of the Chinese economy. COVID-19 has made macroeconomics really interesting to study, and I thought the course did a great job incorporating that pandemic's economic and diplomatic significance into our discussions this fall. Grew a lot more comfortable reading non-empirical economic papers and work from the IMF. First half of the course focuses on how China's economic development has influenced relations with the world and the US (a codependency), but I thought the second half of the course included really interesting weeks discussing risks and opportunities for the current Chinese economy: a consumer-led rebalancing, AI and Chinese tech\/innovation, and SOE reforms.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of contemporary Chinese politics and their historical origins. I also got a better understanding of the current political tensions between the US and China and strengthened my ability to apply a macro-economics perspective to current events in China.",
                "This class was an excellent political and economic investigation of the next china anchored in contemporary events.",
                "I developed a more complete understanding of the Chinese economy and its perils and opportunities in the near future. I also learned the application of economic principles and analysis to real world problems. The op-ed assignments stressed the importance of conciseness in writing for economics, and the final paper definitely was a challenge but also an interesting and well worth it one. The insights on China's past, the codependent relationship between US and China, and China's emphasis on technology are all very enriching."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: weekly critical questions ensured broad student participation in class; Professor Roach balanced lectures and discussions very well; students learned a lot (through readings and lectures) while also having the chance to voice their opinions; TAs gave solid feedback. IMPORTANT NOTE: Some people will write that Professor Roach is too soft on China, but this is simply untrue. He encouraged open discourse on everything from human rights to cyber espionage. Students are just surprised when they are forced to give China a fair shake on economic policy issues.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: student presentations were often poorly built and delivered; lots of people checked out during these presentations and weren't engaged unless Professor Roach called on them; class was recorded despite FAS policy on seminars; some grades from TAs felt arbitrary or forced on a curve.",
                "This was a great in-depth seminar about China and its future growth trajectory. The course was well organized and structured and very easy to follow along. You learn a lot and the professor incorporates a lot of current events into it, so you know everything you're learning is relevant.",
                "Strengths: Professor Roach is a great professor. He is truly so organized and makes the 2 hour seminar incredibly meaningful and worth it. The seminar never drags because he leaves time for lecture, discussion, and then importantly, student-led presentations. The student-led presentations allowed students to have a stake in the class content and organizational structure and kept everyone engaged. Moreover, Prof. Roach always does his due diligence by reading over our critical questions and combining them into effective, focused discussion topics that allows everyone to contribute to the discourse. The topics covered are diverse and really cover the entirety of the U.S.-China relationship through multiple lenses.",
                "Professor Roach is a great professor, obviously very experienced in the area, and provide a unique perspective on a complex issue. The class was structured well and fostered student engagement.",
                "The seminar could use a break in the middle.  An hour and 50 minutes is a long time to be sitting down focusing on one thing, so a break in there would've been nice to get up and stretch or move around.",
                "Strengths: Professor Roach is extremely knowledgable about China's economy and has so much experience studying this area. Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures can be dry, especially since they are pretty long and happen only once a week. Also, some of the assigned readings can be long, tedious and sometimes redundant so that there's not much motivation to finish all of them. It would be nice if there were some guidelines on how to approach doing some of the readings and what things I should look for so that it would be easier to complete them in a time efficient manner.",
                "Strengths: Extremely relevant course material, and Professor Roach is truly an expert. Even though it was only on a Zoom call, it was a cool opportunity to have him teach each week; having to submit 3 \"critical questions\" before each class meeting became a staple of my Sunday routine, and while they were sometimes tedious, I thought they did a good job making me reflect on what was interesting about that week's readings; final research project is a very nice chance to pursue your own interest in a course topic and shape the final product, and I appreciated having a proposal due long before the actual paper was due at the end of the term; I was worried that Professor Roach wouldn't be that engaged in the class because he was teaching two sections, had TFs for each seminar, and because he was a more established professor, but I was really impressed with how hands-on he was with the course, always sending emails about class organization or articles he thought we would find interesting. Weaknesses: Long class meetings would start to feel a little dry sometimes, and I wonder if the course could use some multimedia or other contemporary resources to remind everyone halfway through class that what we are learning about is currently playing out in China and the United States in real time; student presentations each week felt like they dragged on towards the end. I think they're a nice opportunity to hear from classmates but could be shorter. Not necessarily a weakness, but the course is taught kind of like a \"lemniar,\" with Prof. Roach lecturing for the first half and occasionally choreographing student input by calling on people to offer an observation or ask a question based on the \"critical questions\" they submitted before class.",
                "Class-time was very structured and effective in facilitating student learning. I appreciated the workload, which was not too great to be overwhelming, and the discussion style in which students were pulled into the debate via the questions we had prepared on that week's topics. The rigor of the in-class discussions motivated me to spend extra time preparing for class, and I found that I grew significantly as a thinker and seminar-participant because of it. Lastly, the in-class presentations were always very interesting, although I wish that the preparation materials were given a few weeks in advance so that the preparation time is not so overwhelming for presentors.",
                "The course could be improved by more discussion of politics in China and the fundamental differences of the Chinese political and economic system. Perhaps also more discussion of the human rights issues in China.",
                "Strengths: seminar format which allowed for students to express their perspectives, which I found to be particularly fulfilling as everyone was so intelligent and had very interesting points to share in discussion, group presentations which add a level of engagement and responsibility and offer an opportunity to deep dive into a topic that interests you.\r\nPossible improvement: Every class session was very structured with a Professor's presentation-critical questions-student presentation format, which makes the course very organized overall; however, rather than just having everyone output their ideas, I wish there was more opportunities for discussions that go back and forth between students. I also wish there was a small amount of time set aside each week (or through a discussion post on Canvas) for discussion of the most recent news and developments, which I think will add to the class by making it even more relevant."

                "Yes! Anyone who is interested in the U.S.-China relationship dynamics or the global power struggle and wants to view it from an economic lens should take this course. Professor Roach is very knowledgeable in this subject area and has really great insights from his experience working in the region. This is a great elective for both Global Affairs and Economics because it allows you to apply a lot of broad macroeconomic concepts to a rapidly developing country and explore the challenges and opportunities this presents. You get the opportunity to improve your argumentation skills through two op-ed assignments and a large research paper as well as your presentation skills through a student-led presentation. However, my one caveat is that if you are interested in discussing the human rights aspects of the China-U.S. conflict, this course is likely not the right one, simply because it is spent deeply diving into the economic side of the equation.",
                "Yes! The class is well-taught, informative, and relevant.",
                "I would recommend this to an economics student that would like to learn more about China's economy and their plans for the future.",
                "Yes, Stephen Roach is a legend in this field. If you really want to understand China's economy in depth, this is a terrific course to take. If you decide not to take this course, you might consider reading Professor Roach's book which covers a lot of the same material.",
                "If you have an interest in the Chinese economy or international trade, yes. If not, you might find some of the content a little niche or dry. I am personally happy I took the class. I feel I learned a lot from Professor Roach and emerged with lots of new knowledge about trade deficits and the direction of China's economy. Over the course of the semester, I already could sense more comfort reading stories on China's economic recovery from the coronavirus and know I'll feel just as informed when talk around Chinese tech, tariffs, and structural reforms resume. Professor Roach is an economist and not only aligns with most other economists in opposing tariffs, but also seems to be less suspect of China and some of its economic practices than most other commentators right now. Hearing his perspective was valuable and interesting, but I sometimes left class feeling a little more confused, having followed what has become mostly a bipartisan consensus around accusations of forced technology transfer, for example, but then hearing Professor Roach call some of those accusations into question.",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in Chinese politics, US-China relations, or even just macro-economic analysis of policy, this is a very engaging and interesting class. The coursework is never redundant and instructor feedback is helpful and inspires growth in student analysis, discussion, and writing. The classes themselves are very well structured and discussions are facilitated to maximize students' analytical engagement with class topics.",
                "Absolutely. This seems like THE class to take on modern China.",
