Really gets you thinking and solving problems. Similar to playing chess or solving Rubik's cube. If you want to be a doctor you should take this class. It is similar to treating patients where you take all the symptoms you see in the patient and make a judgment of what to diagnose the patient of having. Similarily this course's \"symptoms\" are the different components of the molecule where you will then \"diagnose\" which reagents got you to your final product.",

I learned a great deal of new reactions for the first two topics and applied all of what we had learned so far to learn about some topics in biochemistry like fatty acid synthesis, peptide formation, synthetic peptide formation, etc. I feel like I got a better understanding the chemistry that is involved in the upper level biology classes I will have to take later on.",

            "comments": [
                "There is a massive disconnect between Jason Crawford and Aaron Clark in this class. Jason is constantly trying to lecture about biological concepts, and Aaron writes the tests, so the tests are always pretty much strictly chem. This means that many of the exams do not overlap with the material we learned in lecture, and it makes for a strange experience because I never know what to prepare for the exams. I wish there were more communication between the two or the curriculum were more organized to be sure that what's being presented in lecture is what's on the exams.",
                "strengths: i suppose it's an ok lecture course\r\nweaknesses: could be improved a lot. not very structured, sometimes the practice tests weren't as helpful as they could be in preparing",
                "The course is ambitiously designed to cover a lot of material in a short time and sets students up very well for biochemistry. However, the course desperately needs problem sets. The main weakness was a continuous push and pull between the professor and the preceptor. The professor taught mechanisms and reactions (and a lot of biochem/chemical bio) while we were examined mainly on orgo applications of what we had learned. This made it so there was little practice for exams, and the practice exams did not cover all the content we did and had extra topics we didn't cover (and they were given online so a different level of difficulty was realized). All of this is to say that the course needed practice problems, and we didn't have them. Also, a 50% final exam does not seem to be the best way to assess student learning in the course. Dropping a midterm was great, but a single final exam worth 50% doesn't seem reasonable or fair.",
                "Strengths: content is good and interesting. TAs and peer tutors\r\n\r\nWeakness: no way of checking yourself or your work (you learn from the mistakes and points you get off from tests). Grade is 100% exams. Just lecture class and exams (not enough structure). Lots of self studying. Stuff that comes up on tests tests you on stuff not discussed or warned of in class",
                "I think the main weakness of the course is the lack of problem sets. There are optional practice problems on Achieve, but a lot of them don't have to do with what we actually talk about in lecture. The course is very loosely structured and exams make up our entire grade--but without problem sets, there is no structured way to consistently practice for the exams. \r\n\r\nAlso, moving from off-sequence to on-sequence chemistry classes revealed that there are discrepancies between the curricula, and this class was taught seemingly without awareness of that fact. It would be best to either offer CHEM 221 in the fall or standardize curricula across off- and on-sequence CHEM 220--or at least make sure the 221 professor is aware of what discrepancies might exist.",
                "I think the intentions of the course were well, and the professors made themselves available to students by way of office hours. However, pedagogically, I think there are a few areas of improvement. Firstly, it would be helpful to provide students with psets (instead of the Achieve practice problems) to work on throughout the semester. This would serve a twofold purpose: first, it would help students build a better understanding of what kind of questions may be asked in exams so that they can start thinking in the right frame of mind, and second, it would give students a chance to show their knowledge of orgo in settings outside exams, giving them an opportunity to boost their grades as well. It would also be helpful if the lecture notes were a little bit more organized and if they were regularly posted on Canvas after each class to ensure that students have the resources to learn the material adequately.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Crawford is a wonderful lecturer, Dr. Clark is a great preceptor, and there were a lot of resources to help ensure that i understood the material. I am grateful that classes were recorded to facilitate re-watching the lectures to better understand the material afterwards. Weaknesses: having an exam immediately after spring break was more difficult than I had anticipated it would be. Would have appreciated optional problem sets to verify that I understood the material before the exams",
                "The course overall is great but requires a lot of memorization, even though the profs will insist it doesnt. Knowing the chemical trends can certainly help, but its an empirical not predictive science, and most mechanisms must be half logicd out and half memorized. The trust the profs put in us to review material on our own (and therefor the lack of HW) was great and let me manage my own schedule and learning nicely. On the other hand though, the fact that the exams were worth so much (final was 50% of grade) was not ideal and super stress-inducing. Overall, though, this course was well run and good at teaching us the material.",
                "The biggest weakness is the grading breakdown. 50% midterms 50% final is not helpful for learning and retaining content. Instead, you do nothing most weeks of the semester and then cram the week before a test.",
                "The TFs, peer tutors, and instructors were fantastic. This class has a relatively low workload (since homework is not weighted in the final grade), but your grade is dependent on solely exam scores. The lectures were generally good, but sometimes a little unorganized as Professor Crawford would often jump into explaining something or showing a reaction mechanism without telling us what mechanism this is, what biomolecule we are looking at, etc. This made studying for exams or reviewing content more difficult as you would have to piece together what everything was and how it related to each other. This was particularly true during the last third of the class, but was the only downside.",
                "Strength: Dr. Aaron and the TAs. They did a fantastic job delivering the content in an affective way.",
                "The teaching is pretty disorganized and it can be hard to follow along with the examples Dr. Crawford give because he doesnt really give much background on what he is teaching before jumping into examples. I do like how the last section of the class started introducing me to biochem.",
                "The lectures were dull at times",
                "Strengths - lots of interesting content, exams were written well\r\nWeaknesses - the grading system was 50% midterm, 50% final exam and that's a really scary split up. I think having some sort of extra credit option or homework category would be beneficial.",
                "The course was very challenging, and I wish there was a mandated homework and section grade to give a buffer for students who don't perform very well on exams. However, there was a lot of support through office hours and study halls. The teaching staff was very responsive.",
                "Strengths of this course were Professor Crawford's passion for the subject. Weaknesses were that the course was very stressful because 100% of your grade is exam-based, and you truly have no idea of what your score could be if you are performing in the middle range.",
                "The strengths were the recorded lectures. It could be improved if the grade was not solely determined by exam scores.",
                "The greatest weakness is that there is little support in between midterms to help students learn and retain information. Sure we have the achieve but it rarely aligns with the information that is tested and thus made it virtually useless (do not buy Achieve for this semester). I highly encourage this course to take into consideration problem sets, even as long as it's optional, so that people can keep up with the lecture material. The greatest strength of this course were the practice exams that were released a few days before each midterm. They accurately reflect what will be tested while being challenging. Even so, the keys the the practice exams were horribly written (basically unreadable) and sometimes there were no keys to the practice material so that was very annoying.",
                "Strengths: Aaron Clark!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Jason Crawford.",
                "The strengths of this course were the pacing of the class and the material that was tested. This course however had units that were too filled with too much material and then units with less material. I think the different units could be reorganized in a way that balances the three exams out. Additionally, I like how the topics for each exam were laid out because it narrowed my studying and preparation for the exam.",
                "I think the strengths include learning about mechanisms. However, the exams were long and much more difficult than I think the class material.",
                "It was be very fast-paced, but the review sessions were very helpful.",
                "It was intimidating that the course was 100% based on exam grades.",
                "Strengths - interesting in how the chemistry was related to biological concepts. Crawford is a good lecturer and knows what he is talking about. The recorded lectureres were extremely helpful as I could go back and research to find things I missed the first time.\r\nWeaknesses - it was hard to capture and understand all of the concepts of each class the first time during lecture. I found myself writing things down that didn't make sense until researching the lectures.",
                "The professor is probably great for biochem, absolutely garbo for orgo",
                "I wish wed had psets or more practice problems in general so we had more opportunities to practice the material before it was time for the exams.",
                "This class was very poorly organized it was hard to find the connections between the course lectures and the exam content until review sessions that would be held just days before the exam. The course content was often not applicable to the topics at hand. More information on the syllabus about the materials and the content is essential. This lack of structure makes it so hard to know what we are talking about in class. There is barely a textbook for the course.",
                "I think some weaknesses of this course was that it was entirely exam based - it often didn't feel like a holistic measure of how much material I understood. I found myself really struggling during the midterms at times despite having spent extreme amounts of time prepping for the midterm.",
                "Strengths: instructor lectured well, teaching team was very organized and responsive \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was at 9 AM",
                "Professor Crawford is an amazing professor, and he made it very easy to understand difficult concepts in the class. Additionally, the Teaching Staff and Dr. Clark were very adept at explaining things and breaking down the reactions and mechanisms into understandable formats. There also aren't any assignments, which makes the workload light but can make it hard to grasp concepts through examples. I think one major weakness is that when it came to biological molecules and applications, the course lost a lot of the focus it had in the beginning and started to become less comprehensible.",
                "Strengths: Aaron Clark is absolutely amazing. The lectures all connected to each other.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- lectures twice a week\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- lack of linking between lectures made them a challenge to follow\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n- live demonstrations\r\n- nonscience analogies to make the concepts feel more personal",
                "The class was taught in a pretty confusing way  the content is interesting but definitely challenging.",
                "The course required a lot of self-direction with the only grades being 2 midterms and 1 final. This was a strength and weakness because it saved time for people who could grasp material quickly but for someone who needed more help sometimes it was difficult to identify gaps in knowledge without homework / more structure. Weakness was that the final was 50%",
                "Weaknesses: Not having homework/assignments that keeps you engaged between the midterms and kinda lower the weight on the final (because 50% was insanely a lot). \r\n\r\nHaving two instructors, both of whom are lovely and exceptional, who had somewhat different ways of approaching the course -- Dr. Crawford was more focused on biological chemistry while Dr. Clark was more into the actual organic chemistry.",
                "This course was difficult, but it always felt like there was support outside the lectures if you just asked for it. While it was nice to not have psets, without proper homework (achieve did not do a good job reflecting the course material), it was hard to practice putting what he learned in lecture into action. Strong practice questions -and not just previous exams from other professors who valued different topics- would have been so helpful!",
                "This course felt like there was too much material to internalize all of it enjoyably. Likewise, the way that professor Crawford taught the course felt confusing, as he rarely connected lessons to overarching concepts or explained how different mechanisms/ideas were related to each other.",
                "This course was quite stressful as the lectures did not feel helpful. We spent classes watching mechanisms be drawn and explained with a biology focus when the tests were more ochem focused. Overall, the details of lectures did not seem to match what we were eventually tested on.",
                "Strengths: lecture format of class made it much easier to learn (in comparison to flipped classroom in CHEM 221) and having no homework and only practice problems was extremely helpful and made it a much better learning experience. Instead of trying to get the work done by the deadline, I was able to take as much time as needed to actually understand the content. Weakness: we were just thrown a bunch of reactions in lecture, and it was difficult to follow along and recognize what we needed to learn. Especially when biomolecules were used, the names were dropped with no explanation, which was hard to conceptualize. Some more organization when presenting the material would have been nice.",
                "I think this course was very disorganized and was one of the worst structured classes I have taken. There was no homework or PSETS and our only grades were three midterms and a final worth 50% of our grade. we had no practice of material as there were no psets and there was only optional achieve hw which even the TAs told us not to do because it did not relate to the course content. The class was taught by our professor which was hard to follow but the exams (our only grades) were written by the TA and often the professor did not even know what was on the exams.",
                "This class took years off of my life, to be honest. When you go to section and even the TA is confused about whats being taught, thats when you know things are bad. Dr. Crawford is a nice guy, but his lectures are incredibly unstructured. I had to teach basically the entire syllabus to myself from online resources and Organic Chemistry as a Second Language. There are no problems sets and no quizzes, so your entire grade rides on three midterms (with one drop) and a final, but the tests are all over the placeon our exam 3 test, we were tested on exam 1 material (which was taught months before) without warning, literally just to trick us. To top it off, there was no curve in this class even though the average on 2/3 midterms was in the low 70s. Given that this subject is generally regarded as one of, if not the hardest, pre-med requirement, this seemed like an unnecessary and honestly cruel way of educating. If you can help it, protect your sanity and take this course somewhere where they actually want the students to do well and learn.",
                "The biggest flaw of this course is that there's no assignments or ways to assess our learning prior to exams.  This meant a lot of us went into exams feeling prepared and then realized we had gaps in our learning.  The practice exams were from previous years when the course was on zoom and therefore open-note, so they weren't helpful in assessing how prepared we were for the actual tests."

                "If you don't have to take the course, i would not recommend it\r\nIf you do have to take the course, it's better than orgo 1 and, though requires a lot of work, is mostly interesting content",
                "You're probably taking Orgo 2 for a requirement, so if you're taking it you're going to take it. STUDY for the exams, keep up on content as the semester goes and ask for practice problems anytime you can.",
                "Yes if you plan on taking bio chem in future, this is a good Segway. Very engaging and you actually enjoy what you're learning",
                "I would only recommend this course to students who are interested in organic chemistry and who are ready to put in the work to practice the content that is being taught in class rigorously outside of class, attend office hours, and build a strong understanding of the content.",
                "Yes - you likely need to take it for premed/chem major requirements, but I enjoyed the class and I thought the material was interesting. The teaching staff is excellent",
                "If youre interested in organic chemistry then yes!",
                "It's not a bad class. Jason is great at explaining concepts and much of what you learn is really interesting. The class would be much better if the grading structure was changed, but it is not bad overall. Especially take this class if Aaron Clark is co-teaching. He is an amazing teacher and cares deeply about his students.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in chemistry or need it as a requirement.",
                "Probably a requirement. If you are interested in biology, take OCHEM II with Crafword. If not, like me, you should probably consider taking it with Scott Miller instead since he talks about topics more relevent to real chemistry.",
                "If you dont have to, dont take this course",
                "Yes! This class is so cool!",
                "I would if you have to take it or are premed. I think a lot of what I actually learned is very helpful to future things that align w my interests in medicine.",
                "I would recommend this course only if it's required by a major or post-grad goals. It's one of the hardest classes at Yale, so I would advise students to proceed with caution.",
                "I would if it is required",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is looking for a deeper dive into organic chemistry, however I would not recommend it to someone who is simply looking for a science credit.",
                "I do not recommend this course. I honestly enjoyed first semester orgo and thought that second semester orgo would be the same experience but alas it's definitely NOT. First of all, a third of the course was biochemistry, which although helpful, could be streamlined to be taught way more effectively. What made first year orgo bearable was that we were given reaction, their mechanisms, and problems that we could apply them to. However, second semester ergo is very unorganized and sometimes you learn through examples before even knowing what is the purpose/general idea of what is being taught. Overall, that made it very frustrating when trying to review for exams. My biggest piece of advice would be to read \"Organic Chemistry as a Second Language.\" I'm begging you PLEASE READ IT!! I learned more in that book than I did in lecture and it was more than enough for the tests that they administered (except for the third exam which covers chemical biology).",
                "Only take this course if it is for your major or you need to do it for premed. Although if you're premed, honestly just skip this class and take biochem instead. There are only like 10-15 med schools that require orgo 2. Save yourself the struggle.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are pre-med. I think this is a great course to take after organic chemistry 1 and before biochemistry. It covers topics that will be needed for the MCAT and will always prepare you for biochemistry. I felt as though the end of this course was a linkage between organic chemistry and biochemistry.",
                "Only for their major",
                "I would! It builds upon Organic Chemistry 1 knowledge, and I believe that the content goes much more in-depth. The amount of biochemistry was also helpful, because I believe it helped me prepare for Biochemistry next year.",
                "I would recommend this course if one is really interested in chemical biology, and if of course it is needed as a premed or other school requirement. I found the material really interesting but it could be a lot for one who doesn't have strong background in general chemistry topics.",
                "its probably a req, so not much choice",
                "Probably not, but most people take this as a requirement anyways. I wish there had been more correlation between what was taught in class and what was tested on the exams, especially the last one. It didnt help that the lectures were done by one person and the exams were written by someone else.",
                "No. There is no reason to take this class and struggle on your own if you are not an MB&B major with specifically the Medicine concentration. Credit/D/Fail the class. Even when you may feel that you have learned a lot, it is frustrating to see your scores not reflect that it is quite hard on your mental health. I have felt some of my lowest in my confidence and performance in this class and I have really enjoyed organic chemistry as a topic. The organization of the course is just absurd and I have performed very well in ORGO 1. ORGO 2 is not worth your time and effort and wellbeing.",
                "A very well-organized class",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student unless they are a chem major. While I learned a lot, it felt very disheartening to see that not translate into exams, and as a pre-med student whose strength is not chemistry, I found this class highly challenging.",
                "Yes! I really enjoyed it! Especially compared to first semester orgo, the workload felt very manageable.",
                "Yes, if you need to take it. If you don't have to take it, there really isn't much point in taking this class, as it is just memorization of tons of reactions and mechanisms (though some are definitely interesting).",
                "Yes! If you liked Orgo I and are interested in how chemistry and biology are related, definitely take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about chemistry from a biological standpoint. The content is challenging but it builds upon each other making this more of a marathon of a class. Content wise the reactions are very intriguing, and I believe learning the mechanisms enabled me to really want to know WHY eat molecule behaves the way it does for the first time.",
                "Yes for requirements, yes if youre interested in chemistry of biological molecules you do learn a lot about that",
                "Unless you need it for a major, I would not recommend. This course is run very differently to other chemistry courses. There are no shoe in points in this class. You learn a ton of information, but there are no homework assignments meaning the exams are the entire grade.",
                "If you have to take it... you should take it. But I would not recommend taking it for fun.",
                "Yes if necessary for pre-med requirements.",
                "I enjoyed this class a lot more than CHEM 220, but I wouldn't recommend it if it's not needed.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoyed orgo one and wants to develop their organic chemistry intuition a lot more and see orgo applied to biology.",
                "Most students take this course as a requirement so it is hard to answer this question. However, i do really enjoy the course's content and have taken organic chemistry courses before in HS and really loved it. However, this particular class I would not recommend to anyone because of how it was structured.",
                "If youre taking this course, you probably dont have a choice. Still, Id recommend you take it at another school and get the credit transferred or take it post-bacc.",
                "If you really enjoyed orgo 1, then you will be fine in this course.  Otherwise... be prepared for a lot of studying and frustration."
