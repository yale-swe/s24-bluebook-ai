                "I think one strength of this class was the class environment. This was a great way to get to know other first years and see how discussion sections worked at Yale. I also think Professor Tannenbaum did a great job providing readings that gave us a comprehensive understanding of the history of medicine in public health in America. I think she also did a great job bringing questions (from our reading responses) to help shape the discussion. The field trips were also great exposure to the resources that we have available to us at Yale.\r\n\r\nI wish we'd received some guidelines or paper examples before our first papers. The tips that Professor Tannenbaum provided to us having read our first papers was excellent, but I felt very ill-prepared to write a college paper (as compared to what was sufficient in high school) before our first paper was due.",
                "No weaknesses. I learned so much.",
                "A strength is definitely the course material itself -- it's super interesting and fun to read about, which made the class enjoyable. A weakness of this class was the fact that a lot of the learning was facilitated by discussion, which personally was difficult for me.",
                "The strengths were the various types of readings included in the curriculum. I enjoyed both the textbook and the various books that we read throughout the semester. It felt a little bit too large because certain people didnt get a chance to speak, but it was great to get to hear from so many different perspectives.",
                "The course readings were a little challenging to navigate through. I think it made it more difficult to embrace the course and its topics. However, I think the instructor really makes sure that the students engage in the course, whether it may be during in class discussions or discussions on canvas.",
                "The readings used in this course were a strength but also a weakness. They were very informative but also very long at times, meaning that we would be having a class discussion in which half the class did not complete the assigned reading. I know that might happen anyway, but as someone who genuinely tried to do all of the reading as assigned, I can say that it was maybe a bit too much.",
                "The discussion in the class was engaging and the readings were interesting. A weakness was that such a large portion of the grade was based on the research paper.",
                "Prof Tannenbaum is so knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I could listen to her speak all day. There are a lot of readings, but you can get everything you need by skimming.  \r\n\r\nPapers are not badespecially since Tannenbaum gives great feedback to improve."

This class was a great way to learn about the history of medicine and public health in America and to get to know other first years. Additionally, the field trips broke up the monotony of a typical class and are very helpful for writing the final paper and learning what resources are available to you at Yale.",
                "Yes. Great community and professor.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student if the subject material is something they are interested in.",
                "I would. I found this course very engaging because Im very interested in STEM, but I dont think I want to pursue a major in STEM. Learning the history behind medicine is a way to continue these STEM interests while developing my writing skills.",
                "I would recommend this course since it is interesting to learn about the previous pandemics, given that we are currently in one. The aspects that partook in the spread of previous pandemics are somehow similar to how the current one we're in started. This course has a heavy reading workload, and sometimes, it might not be interesting, but the topic in itself are and hopefully pushes the students to continue the readings further.",
                "I would recommend this course. The readings were interesting and the discussions were good.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was super interesting and a great class to take my first semester as an introduction to college level history classes.",
                "Yes, particularly if they are interesting in public health or medicine, because it gives historical context for today's climate.",
                "Great course if youre interested in history, though if youre taking this to fulfill a writing requirement be warned that your writing skills probably wont improve much by the end of the course.",
                "Yes, the readings were interesting and I learned a lot about the history of medicine and public health. The trips to the libraries and museums were also exciting.",
                "YES! Great HSHM course. Learning about intersection of society and medicine should be required for any pre med majors, but I found it just as interesting. I absolutely loved listening to Professor Tannenbaum and learning so much.",
                "Definitely recommend to students who are interested in viewing medicine from a different perspective."
