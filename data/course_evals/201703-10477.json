    "- The Big Bang as a model and its evidence\r\n- Galaxies and their characteristics\r\n- Various methods to measure distances between space\r\n- Cosmological principles and their measurements\r\n- The Evolution of Stars\r\n- The characteristics of stars",
    "I learned how to measure astronomical distances, how galaxies are formed, and how the Big Bang model answers questions about the origin of our Universe. I got to observe stars at the planetarium once.",
    "I think the most insight I gained was about theories of the origin of the universe and a potential multiverse. It changed my perspective.",
    "This class taught me about general concepts in astronomy and gave me a foundational knowledge of stars and galaxies , how they were formed, how they evolve, and what will become of them.",
    "I learned the basics of astronomy, cosmology, and how astronomical distances are measured.  This course ignited a passion for astronomy within me that has led my excitement to pursue the field further in future courses.",
    "I actually learned an immense amount about star formation and our galaxy and neighboring galaxies that was much more interesting than I originally expected.",
    "The course covers various concepts that span the study of astronomy. Three topics are the large ideas within this course: measuring distance to astronomical objects, how galaxies form and evolve over time, and how the Hot Big Bang Model was developed and what evidence supports it. Although the course is labeled as a QR, many of the problem sets end up being paragraph explanations of concepts that we learned during the week, such as describing what an elliptical galaxy is. The actual math used in this course is purely algebra, no calculus and shouldn't be a problem as long as you know the formulas.",
    "I did not necessarily gain any new skills, but I did gain an abundance of knowledge about the subject matterI knew nothing about astronomy, and I learned to calculate distances to stars, all about galaxies, and about the Big Bang. Class discussions helped a lot and I often was questioning my existence here in the Universe.",
    "Astronomy 120 taught me how to measure distances to objects in space, how galaxies form, and how the big bang model became the leading model for the creation of the universe. The course also taught me how to think and look at data in astronomy, as well as problem solving skills.",
    "I learned so much about the universe and the phenomena that inhabit it. How stars form, how galaxies form, what theories there are for the birth of the universe, and everything in between. On top of those concepts, I learned some pretty important equations and what consequences certain characteristics of the universe would have based on those."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was very well-run!",
    "I personally dislike the flip format. I also feel like the class was very much geared towards mathematical formulas and equations rather than conceptual analysis.",
    "My biggest disappointment with this class was that it was a flipped classroom. It's true that there is merit to being able to watch lectures over and over again, but if I pay attention the first time and don't understand, how is listening to the same thing going to help me? There was one explanation available at a time, and then whatever questions I had on the material I didn't know how to ask in class because it wasn't immediate in my mind. If you want the value of having lectures recorded, maybe lecture in class and record that? I also thought that a flipped classroom meant we would be doing more practice problems and p-set practice in class, but that was not the case. I found it hard to focus in class because the organization of discussion wasn't clear. The room was way too big for our class, making group discussion too scattered and intimidating. One inherent strength of this course was that it was interesting.",
    "The course is a flipped classroom which, in my opinion, is not as effective as lecture-style teaching. I often found myself unintentionally falling asleep during the 1-hour videos I had to watch over the weekends. However, the extra time for practice problems in class was beneficial. I would suggest to make the class lecture-style and then make discussion sections required sessions for practice problems.",
    "In my opinion the flipped classroom setting was very harmful to my learning which made learning the concepts extremely difficult. Professor Faison usually packed in more in the lectures that would fit in a classroom setting and didn't address it all in class practice so there was way more information being covered in lecture than we could actually thoroughly cover.",
    "This course opened my mind to new, previously unexplored ideas and concepts of the world and the universe.  The professor was personally engaging and passionate, willing to answer questions about astronomical concepts beyond the curriculum.  The weakness of the course was the TF's, who offered little help and often distracted from the professor's lecture by talking rather loudly to small groups of students as he spoke.",
    "I was not a fan of the flipped classroom look of the class. The lecture videos were extremely clear and well done, but I felt sort of lost in class sometimes when taking notes. We did not get handouts of practice problems or have them uploaded and this made it difficult to study for the midterm and final. I also think the problem sets were at times based on our ability to find things online or in the textbook, which doesn't seem to help much in the grand scheme of trying to learn something. The class, though, was very interesting for the most part. I think finding the proper way to present this interesting information would make for a great class.",
    "Strengths: Concepts were interesting, the professor is engaging, and there's a lot of group work within class time, so if you don't understand a concept, you can always ask someone else. Classes are not lectures, they're more like guided practice sessions with some lecture in the beginning to further explain concepts that were covered in the required video lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As mentioned before, this class is a flipped classroom, where lecture videos are uploaded onto Canvas and then you watch them and come into class. I, personally, found this to be both a convenience and an inconvenience. The lecture videos are always online and they're ready for you to watch at any time anywhere, so there is convenience there; however, the fact that they're not technically \"homework,\"makes me forget to watch them (although watching them does count towards a participation grade). This system does make the class more entertaining and engaging than it would have been as a pure lecture course, so I wouldn't say that the flipped classroom is all bad, but be aware going into this course that the style of teaching will be a little bit different compared to other courses.",
    "It was really nice to have a class in a flipped classroom setting. We spent the majority of the class time doing problems at the board and discussing topics with the class rather than being lectured at, making the class much more interactive and interesting.",
    "A strength would be the teaching fellows and the class discussions, which were good. Practice problems in class were also helpful. However, I hate how the class was flipped. I was very inattentive while watching the lecture videos outside of class.",
    "I really think the flipped classroom style is a weakness of this course. I wouldn't recommend it going forward. However, the material of the course itself was extremely interesting, and it is easy to tell that Dr. Faison is an expert and passionate about the subject.",
    "I think the class benefits from having some genuinely interesting content. The flipped classroom format is interesting and I think it works for the class, as lecture videos are interesting and full of important information for class. The days where we would have class, we would do exercises based on what was in the lecture videos, giving us the opportunity to work through what we were learning.",
    "The flipped classroom style for me was not as effective and engaging as a lecture in class.  The class time could be separated so that we could go over big concepts and write notes and then work on some practice problems afterwards."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's a great course that teaches you some abstract concepts you would otherwise not know much about. Very thought provoking!",
    "Yes, but with a grain of salt. There was a big time commitment, but I didn't always feel like my time was being effectively spent.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have background knowledge. These were the students who knew what was going on and could keep up, otherwise it was a struggle for us.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to receive introduction to he fundamental concepts of large-scale astronomy.",
    "I think this is a great class for non-STEM learners and STEM learners alike. This class has the reputation of being an easy science credit, but I think you can really take so much more from this class if you engage yourself. Just considering how we came to be and how we find into the universe is supremely interesting to consider.",
    "Chill class. It was really enjoyable to learn about the galaxy and go to the observatory and use the equipment! The problem sets weren't too difficult, but had an awkward due time Friday nights at midnight. Professor Faison always made himself available with office hours three days a week while also willing to meet up people outside of those hours. The only thing about the class is that it's graded on a normal curve such that the average curve is a B, BUT anything >=90% is a guaranteed A.",
    "I would recommend this course if any one (or more) of the following apply...\r\nA. You have an interest in astronomy.\r\nB. You want to learn more about astronomy.\r\nC. High school physics wasn't that hard for you.\r\nD. You're okay with saying \"We don't know\" as an answer to most questions.\r\n\r\nA lot of people recommend this course because \"it's a gut,\" and sure, the math is relatively easy and the concepts aren't all that hard, but even so, the class proves to be difficult sometimes. Many of the concepts covered are wayyy out there, and it takes a while to wrap your mind around it. That, on top of the fact that a lot questions truly do have no answer other than \"we don't know\" in astronomy, can make this class frustrating.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to take this class just for the pure gut, then be careful because it is not as gutty as you might think. But, an A is a 90 or above, there's a curve, and the math is easy for a QR credit (no memorization of formulas hurrah), so it isn't all bad. I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in any sense to astronomy. It is a good course in itself.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who would like a QR credit. It was not ridiculously hard, and the workload was manageable. It was also interesting to learn about, which is always a plus.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student, because the material is so interesting. However, I would add the caveat of the flipped classroom, which sometimes makes it harder to stay engaged.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who loves astronomy or who interested in learning more about it. There are some important concepts that I feel everyone should understand, so I'd also recommend it to someone who is looking for a challenge."
