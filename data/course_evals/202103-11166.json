This class was very helpful in developing my skills as a writer, particularly with analyzing works of fiction. I also learned about the Portuguese diaspora and the breadth of their influence in the world."

                "Professor Jackson's breadth of knowledge is amazing and the reading list for this class is so special. You won't encounter most of these texts elsewhere in the academy, and I especially enjoyed the novels by Pinto, Couto, Agualusa and Saramago. The unit on Braslia was also a highlight  the prose by Lispector and Niemeyer's statement on the pilot plan are beautiful, powerful, political literary works. \r\n\r\nThe class was more of a lecture than a seminar, and the lectures weren't always particularly well-organized. I think there could have been a lot more discussion (especially because the students generally seemed very excited & engaged  there's a lot of reading, but my impression is that everyone or nearly everyone was doing it & was ready to talk about it). There weren't clear directions for presenting on a given week's readings, and we sort of abandoned the practice a couple weeks into the semester. If more thought was given to the structure of a given class period & to the supplementary materials that would be presented in each meeting, and if student engagement, dialogue & active learning were higher priorities, this could be a really wonderful class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Jackson is extremely passionate about this class and that makes for a great learning experience. The class is very well structured and you learn about a new city each class. Professor Jackson gives great feedback and is very understanding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussion can sometimes feel slow and sometimes is more of a lecture than a discussion."

                "Yes  the Lusophone world is so fascinating and woefully understudied in disciplines like literature, history, urbanism, ER&M and sociology. It expanded my conceptions of colonialism, hybridity and diaspora and introduced me to some amazing writers.",
                "Yes, this is a fantastic class! I would highly recommend this class to anyone that is trying to develop their writing skills in a topic that is very interesting and most likely new to them."
