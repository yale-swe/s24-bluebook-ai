Black and Indigenous Ecologies has also improved my writing structure as the professor gives really thorough feedback.",
                "In this class I learned how to strategize the way I approach a close reading essay. I also learned how to work on my tone in non-argumenative essay to mitigate potential author bias. Also I just generally learned more about Black and Indigenous Ecologies.",

                "I learned how to approach college-style writing assignments and how to develop a college-level paper. I learnt how to conduct efficient research, how to create a strong thesis, and how to connect my own thoughts to those of others.",
                "I furthered by close reading skills and analyses of texts. This class is also a great opportunity to learn about non-Western perspectives about ecology!",
                "I gained so much knowledge from this course from the readings, professor, and mostly from my peers! I developed my analysis skills around reading and sharing my thoughts in class. I also worked on my analytical and research-based writing.",
                "Learned to write different types of papers. Also learned to build confidence to speak up in class.",
                "I developed my writing skills significantly and strengthened my argumentative ability. I learned a lot about the necessity for decolonization and ways in which the valuing of Black and Indigenous ecological worldviews can contribute to the momentum of such movements.",

                "I developed knowledge about ecology and different ecological philosophies by taking this course. Through assigned readings I was able to become more comfortable reading densely written academic texts. Through essay feedback I was able to better organize my writing and sharpen the arguments I make."

                "In general, ENG 114 courses are reading heavy, but it would definitely be a lot more engaging, and perhaps more accesible, to introduce and encourage other forms of academic media, such as podcasts or shows. This class in particular does it occasionallywe watched a clip from a TV show, read an interview transcription, and watched a movie toward the endbut it would be great if such alternative medias were sprinkled throughout the course and more robust.",
                "I think the course is great! Some of the readings in the beginning were pretty dense so I started off a bit lost but the readings were interesting nonetheless!",
                "Assignments are very structured in all the ENGL114 courses",
                "The course was strong in how it was organized, the level of instructor-student communication, and the variety of texts we interacted with. The course was weakened by the overabundance of class discussion and the lack of in-class instruction on how to craft a strong essay.",
                "There are only strengths! Rasheed had an amazing selection of works that we went over, the discussions were also great, and I really appreciated the great feedback on essays.",
                "The strengths of this course is definitely the continuous relevance of the course material. I really enjoyed how the class stuck with the main themes around Black and Indigenous Ecologies, but in multiple different ways. We explored various communities worldwide and perspectives around ecology and environmentalism. I enjoyed learning about different perspectives and being pushed to discuss them in class. \r\nA weakness of this course is the fairly similar structure of every class. We pretty much just discussed the readings in the first half of the class--which I appreciate--but I wish we could have done more interactive or group work in class.",
                "Maybe including different types of media for seminar readings. Most of the readings were packed scholarly articles. Perhaps including a video would be more engaging.",
                "The main strengths of this course are definitely the professor and the syllabus. Professor Tazudeen genuinely cares about his students and his passion for the course material is palpable in every class session. His feedback on final essays and drafts are comprehensive and supportive. The readings in the syllabus are extremely interesting and enlightening. Whenever a student needed more time on an assignment, he always provided extensions and support. There are truly no weaknesses of this course.",
                "there are not any weaknesses i can think of, i really enjoyed the way this class was conducted",
                "The strengths of this course were the assigned readings, which were intellectually challenging and exposed students to a wide array of ecological philosophies. The readings introduced me to authors with interesting ideas, which I will continue to explore even after this end of this course. Professor Tazudeen also gave his thoughts of the readings which were fascinating to hear and increased my curiosity about the subject. A small weakness is the difficulty of the texts at the beginning of the semester, the course could be improved by switching the order so the more dense readings are in unit 2 rather than unit 1."

He is also incredibly patient, which means you can feel comfortable making mistakes now while youre still in the learning process. Taking this class as a first-year will definitely better prepare you for college writing in the future.",
                "Yes! If anyone is interested in different ecologies this class would be wonderful!",

                "YES",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I greatly enjoyed the course and how it gave us the freedom to explore subjects of our own interest under the topic of the course. I thought Professor Tazudeen did an excellent job in cultivating a productive class atmosphere and experience.",
                "Yes! If you are at all interested in different communities relationship with environmentalism while wanting to improve your writing, this is the course for you. Rasheed is an amazing and supportive professor and the courses content is great.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students! We learned about and discussed the perspectives of Black and Indigenous peoples, whom are almost never valued in western educational institutions. I read really interesting readings and was pushed intellectually and encouraged to connect the course material to my own life, which is very important.",
                "I highly recommend this course! The topics we read and discuss about are very important and should be taught to everyone.",
                "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. I consistently reference the readings in my other courses and in conversations outside of class. This course prompts critical thinking like no other class you have taken before. Professor Tazudeen is absolutely incredible and all of the students in the class were always excited to read and discuss more of the course's literature. If you are considering taking ENG 114  take this section!!",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to students who want a professor who genuinely loves what he does and comes into class each day with that mission in mind. As well as, anyone who wants a professor that will always make time for you outside and in class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I was the most interesting course I have ever taken. Aside from Professor Tazudeen's amazing instruction and thorough feedback on assignments, I would recommend this course for the assigned readings alone.  This course was a great introduction to ecological thought and helped me become a stronger writer. I would retake this course if I could."
