                "The class was an amazing introduction to philosophy. It taught me a new way of thinking and approaching problems from a philosophical, metaphysical standpoint.",
                "This class opened my mind to so many interesting topics to think about! And I already was a philosophy major before taking it!",
                "Fun class - philosophizing about time, identity, and social construction was very enjoyable for me. Hard to pinpoint specific \"skills\" I learned, but I definitely feel like my understanding of the world has gained a new perspective.",
                "I learned about verious topics in metaphysics, the views on those topics held by philosophers from different periods, as well as their real-world implications. The course featured a variety of authors, ranging from classical philosophers to contemporary analytic philsophers from diverse schools of thought. I learned just how much of an impact the metaphyiscal views adopted in the background by a society affects the daily lives of members of that society, including our own. I honed my ability to express my own views on these crucial issues throught the numerous writing assignments of the course.",
                "This was an amazing course! I have learned the ability to critically think about myself and others. I always wanted to take a class that makes me think about the world in a different, beautiful way, and this class definitely did this!",
                "I learned a lot about different areas of metaphysics, including: what IS metaphysics? what are some ways of thinking about time? what are some ways of thinking about free will? what constitutes personhood? what does it mean to live?",

                "The way the course flowed from topic to topic was very natural and the pieces we read were all very interesting and insightful, along with the encouragement of critical thinking of these topics.",
                "The course had a very manageable workload and length of reading. The discussion posts were graded promptly and fairly and the professor/Teaching Fellow provided meaningful feedback for each one. The course was taught in a lecture format which I think worked well for some topics but not as well for others. Towards the second half of the course, the numbers had thinned out enough that I think a seminar format could have worked much better. Some of the best moments in the class were the full group discussions. The professor did a great job of introducing many ways of thinking about each subject and never pushed their own views on students.",
                "Professor Dembroff is definitely the main strength of the course. Their ability to carefully curate accessible philosophy readings, facilitate discussion both online and during class, and foster a welcoming class environment is definitely what makes this course as great as it is. \r\nThe weekly Canvas discussion posts initially seem to be tedious/lots of work, but I felt that they kept me more accountable to stay engaged in the material, and it was a great opportunity to have a conversation (albeit digitally) with others in the class, outside of class. Professor Dembroff often included some of these posts in their lecture slides as well, giving even more continuity between the class lectures and Canvas discussions.",
                "It was a little hard to follow along at times, especially as a newcomer to philosophy. However, I felt the review sessions helped to clear everything up. It would have been nice to have a second review session at the end of the year to help make sure we properly understood everything.",
                "I have mixed feelings about there being no proper papers in this class. I feel that it is an important skill to be able to develop and present philosophical arguments via writing, and that skill is not trained much in this class. Instead, the majority of learning is understanding the position of other philosophers. Of course, this too is valuable, and perhaps studying \"the pros\" is particularly important for metaphysics vs. other areas of philosophy. \r\n\r\nThe final project though is an amazing assignment! You really get out of that what you put into it. I think I learned more from developing that story than I did from anything else this semester!",
                "Strengths: Dr. Dembroff is a great lecturer and is able to concisely parse very nuanced/subtle arguments. The discussion posts were interesting and allowed us to engage freely with the material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could this be transformed into a seminar? I think that the lecture format isn't as conducive to learning about everyone else's perspective on the very subjective material.",
                "strengths:\r\n\r\nProfessor Dembroff was an excellent lecturer, among the best I've had the fortune of learning from at Yale. Their choice of material was diverse and highly engaging. The discussion posts on canvas were a joy to complete every week.\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n\r\nNone whatsoever.",
                "This course was my favorite class I've taken at Yale! I'm so thankful to Professor Dembroff for offering this class and for being the most amazing professor!",
                "The strength of this course is Robin Dembroff, a legendary professor who cares deeply about student learning and does incredible modern analytic philosophy. Anything they teach turns to gold and metaphysics is no exception.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to try out some technical philosophy and gain a deeper understanding of how to view the world.",
                "Id definitely recommend the course to someone who has had little previous experience in philosophy and is interested in learning more about metaphysics. The readings are relatively accessible in both length and density, and Professor Dembroff does a wonderful job combining both traditional lectures as well as more interactive discussion (both during class and through discussion posts on Canvas  I think the Canvas posts were, surprisingly, one of my favorite aspects of the course). On the other hand, if you are looking for a course that delves deeply into one or multiple topics in metaphysics (time, personal identity, free will, etc.), this may not be the course youre looking for. Unfortunately, due to just the number of topics covered, the time that could be devoted to each one was limited. But even so, the course is absolutely worth shopping at the very least  as a senior, I can confidently say that this was one of the most enjoyable courses Ive taken at Yale, and one that will stick with me going forward.",
                "Absolutely, the material was incredibly interesting, and the professor was fantastic!",
                "Yes!!!! Professor Dembroff is an amazing professor and metaphysics is a very cool part of philosophy. This class is exciting throughout, but becomes especially engaging towards the end, when you begin to study social metaphysics/ontology, the professor's area of expertise. The guest lectures are a nice touch (though honestly I always preferred Dr. D to them.) Dembroff aims to make this class both accessible and \"deep\", so that it's a great choise for both somebody taking their first phil class or for a senior in the major.",
                "Yep, great regardless of major, no prereqs necessary, pretty low workload - a great fifth class.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to every other student at Yale. The course is interesting, both for philosophy majors and those who have never taken a philosophy class. The course managed to be highly stimulating while remaining accessible, in large part due to professor Dembroff's unique teaching style. I sincerely believe that any Yale student would benefit from learning the material in this course.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this class to another student! It is an honor to take a class with Professor Dembroff!",
                "Absolutely",
                "Absolutely!! Its approachable, thought-provoking, and will spur lots of fun debates and conversations as you begin to notice metaphysics at work in the world around you. If Dembroff is teaching, definitely, definitely take this course.",
