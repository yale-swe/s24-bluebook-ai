The readings were very interesting and I felt that ancillary to the takeaways relating to international security, I developed a rough understanding of the methods that were used in some of the papers. However, I will say that there are so many readings in this class (and so much other work) that any knowledge, skills, or insights that I developed were hampered by not having enough time to learn what I needed and wanted to learn in this course. I feel if the course had half as many readings, assignments, and other time commitments (meeting twice rather than three times per week plus required section, for example) would have increased my learnings very substantially.",

Professor James Sundquist tends to make things more complicated and confusing than they should be, not in a way that offers insightful new perspectives, but in a way that sometimes confuses both himself and the students. The Professor is also too ambitious, trying to cover too much in a single course. For example, he tries to teach R (which he really shouldn't) but has no idea how to. You end up not learning anything substantial - I would learn more just by reading the news.",

Readings were well designed to reinforce class material, although my favorites were when readings included research papers or case study specific books such as the Stearns reading on the DRC civil war  in those cases I really felt as if the readings complemented the lectures rather than merely acting as repetitious content.",

                "Strengths: I thought the concepts were interesting, and things were pretty well laid out. I also thought the sections discussions\/activities were engaging and that the quizzes were fairly straightforward. I also really enjoyed all of the guest speakers we had. Weaknesses: I felt like the exam questions were sort of out of left field based on what we talked about in class, and that it was sort of unclear what we really needed to take away from class and also from readings. Also, the readings were super long, and often, I felt, did not really add anything to my learning experience. Lastly, we were given way too little time for the midterm, which made it nearly impossible to include the type of detail they were evidently looking for.",
                "I liked that James taught the section, it felt good to have face-to-face time with the Professor in a small group discussion. I don't like the three days a week structure, because it felt like we used the Friday wildcard very seldom in a productive way. I also think that the data visualization was not helpful and needs to be taken out of the syllabus. I enjoyed the readings of the class, and to be honest the quizzes motivated me to do them, so I would be inclined to keep that. I think both exams should be papers instead, the exam format doesn't make sense for this class.",
                "Strengths: The course is well-organized and the expectations are very clear and fair. The workload is very reasonable and the exams are not difficult to prepare for and do well on.\r\nWeaknesses: It meets four times a week (M\/W\/F for 50 min + Thursday discussion section). The course is also an arguably less rigorous (or at best equivalent) version of PLSC 111: Intro to International Relations. I think that course should be made an alternative for the Global major requirement. It doesn't have anything to do with Professor Sundquist, but I hope the DUS will take this into account.",
                "The entire format of this course was a weakness, from the 4-day-a-week class sessions to the inconsistent grading. I did not like it, and once again emphasize to anyone reading that the 225\/275 sequence of GLBL is a valid reason to avoid this major, since both are quite dry and disorganized.",
                "The only strengths were that the instructor genuinely tried very hard to make the class engaging and that the workload was very reasonable. There are three main categories of weaknesses: the curriculum, the course's structure, and the instruction. Regarding the curriculum, the issue is that the course is extraordinarily surface-level, focusing almost entirely on broad and general claims about international relations and very few thorough explorations of an example from history or modern-day situation (I don't think that there was a single case study or example that we discussed for more than 10-15 minutes).  The net result of this is that I struggle to think of a single useful or actionable insight I gained that would help me in any future work in international relations. The course is also poorly structured: meeting for three lectures plus a discussion section each week felt like way too much of this class, and the discussion sections never felt like they had a clear purpose. Finally, regarding the instruction: while I think that most of the issues with this class stem from the curriculum set by the department, I do think that the lectures themselves tried to accomplish too much without going sufficiently in-depth into any one topic. For example, instead of trying to explain a broad theory, discuss several examples, and understand several articles in one 50-minute lecture, it would have been much more helpful to do one (or maybe two) of those things. Additionally, especially in the first half of the semester, the course felt overly dependent on the main book we were reading. Using the readings can be helpful for organization, but it really felt like there wasn't anything from lecture that I couldn't have gotten by just reading the book. Overall, the course did not feel valuable or particularly enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: very organized, geared towards students and student learning, received good feedback on papers, plenty of office hours, student feedback was implemented throughout the semester, professor obviously cares so much about the students and content\r\nWeaknesses: poor communication regarding grading standards or expectations for exams",
                "A strength of this course is that Professor Sundquist brings in interesting guest speakers. A weakness is that it is a huge time commitment. 3 lectures a week plus Professor Sundquist leading section is just a lot of time to spend on one course, especially for only one credit given that it is almost the same time commitment as a language course. It also just feels a bit all over the place from a content standpoint and there were very few themes that carry over, especially in the second half of the course.",
                "I appreciated the class' focus on essential material and found the workload fitting. However, I wish the class was two 75-minute lectures a week versus three 50-minute lectures. Additionally, I wish the class had more opportunities to demonstrate understanding of the material outside of the two reading responses and exams as I had a hard time participating in discussion sections.",
                "Strengths: Lots of opportunities to learn and engage with material (section with the professor, three classes a week), very interesting topics and generally good layout of the class themes (although the first half was definitely more structured than the second half)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Slide outlines were difficult to understand, there was not much discussion on fundamental international security theory, with most concepts being covered through commercial books like Blattman instead of core academic or philosophical papers; also, the lectures on bargaining theory felt almost as if the professor was making things up as he went since they took up several lectures, included math, and yet were never brought up again",
                "Strengths: Instructor is clearly very passionate and cares a lot about his students (he runs all the sections, which is rare for a class that has TAs). Readings are usually pretty interesting, exams are fair. Reading responses force you to really think about what you are learning.\r\nWeaknesses: While I understand the motivation behind switching to a MWF 50 minute lecture format, I don't think it really delivered. Aside from the few Fridays when we had speakers, it often just felt like a filler day that people only showed up to because there was a quiz. MWF lecture + Thursday section is a lot for one class. I honestly think going back to two days a week + section would be better.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting and engaging ideas, relevant to contemporary events. Work-load was well-balanced. \r\nWeaknesses: Has a strange combination of qualitative and statistical analysis. I am not sure this is necessary when global majors are already required to take AQA. It simply provided random, but not enough to foster in-depth understand, statistical methods and considerations. Sometimes failed to connect theoretical and historical concepts to contemporary examples and ongoing events - even though the contemporary situation warranted it.",
                "Strengths: James is an amazing professor!!! He hosts a ton of office hours every week, is always available to answer student questions and is clearly dedicated to student learning. Jason and Paulina were also awesome TFs. I also thought the material was super interesting and the readings weren't too boring. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think the weekly quizzes were super helpful in ensuring people paid attention; they just tended to cause stress at the end of the week. I also think it was super hard to see what your standing was in the class, and having your grade be dependent on two papers and two exams that are pretty ambiguously graded is a little challenging.",
                "Strengths: Topics are very interesting, readings were the best part. Professor Sundquist genuinely cares about his students. He is very understanding, accommodating, and approachable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: From papers to weekly quizzes to midterm to final to weekly mandatory sections. This course felt a bit unorganized and wanted to tackle everything at once. Although it kept you on top of the readings, many of the topics were not discussed sufficiently in detail and lacked in terms of consistency. The shorter lectures did not benefit my grasping of the material. It all felt a bit rushed and I wished we could have touched upon the topics more deeply, as they are all so interesting. I was not a fan of the format of the course. The two days of lectures, one day of section, and another day of quiz\/games\/guest speaker felt overwhelming and at times had to be restructured because of unforeseeable circumstances or simply just being disorganized.",
                "Professor Sundquist is a gem of a professor that cares about his students in and outside of the classroom. We also had lots of speakers come in and different classroom styles, lecturing, debates, panels, and the professor teaching the discussion sections made it feel like a leminar where we all got to know each other really well.",
                "Strengths: clear course structure, lecture materials are well organized, extensive support for assignments\r\nWeakness: material is very basic, not sure what concrete things I took away from the course, EXTRA CREDIT FOR MIDTERMS NOT CLARIFIED EARLIER (we were told not told in advance that attendance for certain classes would give us extra credit)",
                "I dont like how it was evaluated, I studied a lot and didnt feel like how much I knew was reflected in how I was graded",
                "One strength of this course is that the readings are genuinely interesting. They are worth reading as much as is possible. However, for a course that meets three times per week plus a required discussion section (in addition to the other amounts of work given), this amount of reading is hard to get through. Several speakers were brought to class, and I did find these talks very interesting.\r\n\r\nA glaring issue I have with this course is the amount of work and time that is expected for one credit (and for a required class that many are not interested in). As mentioned above, the course meets three times per week, has a required discussion section, has quizzes on the readings on Fridays, two 4-page-minimum reading responses, a data visualization project (even though there is 0 coding instruction in the course) and the instructor has mentioned adding PSets to that load, as well. Frankly, I wasn't interested enough in the class to feel that this amount of work was justified, and I did not feel the workload actually contributed to my learning. In many cases, the workload made me feel I was spread too thin and that I couldn't do any of the assignments well.\r\n\r\nThe deeper issue I had in this course was a weird disconnect between teaching, readings, and evaluations. Almost all evaluations (quizzes\/reading responses\/midterm and final) require an intense understanding of all of the readings to actually do well. I feel the instruction we received in class did not contribute to my understanding of those readings (as ought to be required if your evaluations are based on readings) but rather focused on illustrative examples and broad summaries which, though interesting and sometimes helpful, did not actually align with what we were then being evaluated on.\r\n\r\nI would end with a note on grading in the course: several classmates along with myself felt that it was often unfair, focused on understanding of the reading beyond what could be expected with the amount of readings we were assigned, and that the teaching team was not interested in giving us better grades for marked improvement that incorporates comments from earlier assignments. This was demotivating for myself and for many of my classmates and decreased my investment in the course.",
                "Strengths: You get to learn some basic IR theories. It's interesting to learn why countries start war from a theoretical and academic angle.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor and the course structure. We have to meet this professor 4 out of 5 academic days, at 9 AM, which is crazy. The professor takes himself way too seriously to set up a course structure like this. This course requires mandatory section attendance, mandatory quizzes on Friday mornings at 9, essays, midterm, final, and kid you not, a coding assignment which is clearly beyond the Professor's teaching ability. Most of my peers and I both feel that we don't receive enough positive feedback and support from the instructor or the TAs. It really sucks that this is a required class for such a popular major.",
                "Strength: James is a really sharp, earnest professor who puts a lot of effort into making sure that the course is best tailored to student learning; he frequently solicits feedback on the course and adjusts the schedule\/material\/assignments accordingly. He is very knowledge and intentional about the structure of the course, the information covered, and the student experience, so he is extremely open to working with students one on one to ensure their success. The course material itself is broad and a comprehensive overview of all aspects of conflict. It incorporates theory and quantitative information in easy-to-digest units which makes the content very straightforward. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Feedback on assignments isn't always the clearest, and it's hard to know exactly what kind of answers they're looking for on exams or reading responses. The feedback we received on reading responses specifically felt a bit nit-picky and less substantial. More explanation on these fronts would be extremely helpful. I think the course could have benefited from a more general introduction to IR theory in the beginning to make sure everyone was on the same page and had the same language to discuss the case studies. Additionally, lecture could be made more engaging by asking students questions or incorporating small discussion periods. I wish there was more of a conclusion to the end where we are challenged to synthesize the information learned across the course.",
                "This class is certainly well-intentioned, but in practice, it is poorly executed. Sundquist is a nice person who means well. However, it is odd that the Jackson School would place an instructor with no security background in this role. The course puts aside grand theory  not only in security but pedagogically. As a result, students are left with the jumble of half-baked ideas that is Glbl 275  one of my least favorite classes Ive taken. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were simply not engaging. Sundquists reliance on attendance quizzes indicates that he understands this. The concepts presented in the lecture are extremely simple. Most lectures could be summarized in under five minutes. As a student with an interest in Security, I am usually extremely engaged in any course dealing with Security. However, by the fourth week of class, I struggled to make myself attend. There simply was no benefit to be gained from large portions of lectures. \r\n\r\nSundquist chose to lead all sections himself. Oftentimes, Sundquist was overly ambitious when choosing section topics. Frequently, wed end a section having started an activity that could take the whole section in the last five minutes. Discussion sections, as implied by the name, are primarily intended to be spaces to discuss the material, contrived activities took up a majority of section time. \r\n\r\n\tThe readings for this course were poorly chosen. For a supposedly foundational course, we read very few foundational texts. For example, we only read 1 chapter of Mearshiemers Tragedy of Great Power Politics. While Mearsheimer is certainly an extremely controversial figure in IR, its odd (and indicative of bigger issues) that we were not critiquing his work. In fact, Mearsheimer is the only IR scholar on Sundquists entire syllabus who was named in the last TRIP survey (a survey of IR academics) as a top influential IR scholar in the past 20 years. Nuno Montieros syllabus had seven of these scholars. Instead of engaging with seminal texts, Sundquist chose to ground large parts of the course in Christopher Blattmans new book, Why We Fight. Blattman is not a security expert, and, to put it bluntly, the books intended audience does not appear to be academia, making it an odd choice. \r\n\r\nAssignments: The exams for this class need some attention. I understand the necessity for exams in this kind of lecture course. However, these exams did not require serious thought but rather encouraged rote applications of buzzwords. Notably, rubrics explicitly penalized students for going beyond this. To succeed on the exam one must simply take every theory that Sundquist favored as scientific fact.",
                "Course is not organized particularly well and lectures feel disconnected from one another",
                "I  really enjoyed the sections being taught by the professor instead of the TFs. I think this created more continuity and consistency in what we learned. I think instructions and expectations surrounding the reading responses could have been made more clear.",
                "The course covers a lot of cool subjects, but I wish more was written on the slides rather than solely spoken, to accomodate those who struggle to listen and write at the same time. Meeting four times a week was a large time commitment. I did not like how the weekly quiz was in the first two minutes of class on Fridays at 9:25am.  There were too many readings for each week. The rubric for reading responses and exams was unclear. I felt like the teaching staff was not very accommodating to extenuating circumstances.",
                "Course readings were generally quite engaging and comprehensive, the professor encourages free expression of a diversity of opinions and the assessment structure is reasonable given the course load. However, I would have liked to see the discussion sections delve deeper into the reading. Generally, I felt that the course could have benefited from increased scholarly depth, since the lecture topics are already somewhat familiar to students of Global Affairs, which is the target audience of this course.",
                "Strength: James tries and cares. Weaknesses: Should not meet 4x per week. James should not lead section. More applications instead of broad definitions and theories. Better written exam questions. More discussion of current events.",
                "A strength is definitely Professor Sundquist (see below). I think as an introductory course and a major requirement, it does satisfy what the course might conceivably cover. Honestly, I wouldve loved if we could have gone more in depth, but I understand that with the breadth of what we had to cover that might not have been possible. For example, I wouldve loved to spend more time looking at the academic papers and critiquing the correlations or conclusions the authors drew, and its implications on what we learnt  for example the data analysis part couldve been more specific to a conclusion that we all had to draw, and been more rigorous.",
                "Strengths: The course assignments are clear and pretty straight forward - the exams are quite easy. The guest speakers are interesting, and the interactive aspects of the lectures was fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lessons aren't always that engaging and there could have been more interactions with the TFs. \r\n\r\nThere were also Friday quizzes; it was a bit tedious at the beginning but did help solidfy knowledge to go over the readings and concepts one more time before the quiz.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sundquist and the TFs were clearly very committed to making the course as good as it could be, and they were extremely supportive; the lectures were well-organized and easy to follow; the readings were interesting and applicable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material is a little elementary for people who are already third- or fourth-year students in the Global major (everything I learned had been touched on in more detail during other classes); the grading was a little hard to follow; other students did not seem very engaged and rarely did the reading",
                "If all of the readings could be made accessible, it would make it more seamless and easy.",
                "Strengths: Professor Sundquist is amazingworks really hard to try and make the class work for both students and the major! Super approachable and really wants to get to know his students. Relatively light workload, and since the class is still finding its role\/structure and with a new professor, the assignments can sometimes be altered as the semester goes along. Compared to some other GLBL classes, I think this one actually delves a little bit into international relations theory, rather than just learning about current events. Also invited practitioners from Yale's World Fellows Program to help us see get more \"insider\" knowledge of how international groups work, and another strength was also a Friday section presentation led by one of our TAs Jason Hug (who is ex-military), and it was incredibly insightful to see everything from a military perspective. It isn't totally there yet, but sort of like a hybrid, definitely something I envisioned more from a GLBL class as opposed to a class like GLBL101 Gateway to Global Affairs, per se. \r\nWeaknesses: Because it just got a new professor, and has been having a higher turnover rate for some time now, the class is still struggling to find its place in the GLBL major, structure is not yet fully designed or agreed upon yet either, and because it has a relatively new professor, the students will be sort of learning along with the professor about what works and what doesn't. Additionally, in terms of content, it doesn't feel like I learned anything super extraordinary That being said, it's not a \"terrible\" thing, rather just a natural consequence of it being a relatively newer class and new professor. With time, I think these weaknesses will be smoothed out a bit.",
                "can see the professor cared, but sometimes difficult to stay engaged.",
                "The main strength was how dedicated Prof Sundquist was! You could tell through his lectures and leading discussions that we was so dedicated to helping us learn. Awesome examples, interesting topics (especially later in the course), and a great overview of current literature. Did what a introductory class was supposed to do while still being fun (poker games, guest lectures, etc). The only weakness I can think of is perhaps the class needed a bit more time to discuss what we had learned in class -- section felt very short to cover the material of the week sometimes.",
                "Professor Sundquist is really dedicated to International Security and is quite knowledgeable, yet this course would be better with a bit more curriculum guidance from Jackson and after a few more years to figure out the optimal format for this class. Having the class three times a week early in the morning with an additional mandatory discussion section means you will be going to this course four times a week, necessarily rendering the course load to feel heavier than it should. Lectures felt scattered and not entirely useful to the ultimate goal of the curriculum. If you are a Global Affairs major and have to take this, I would recommend skipping Intro to IR because this course essentially repeats the content and readings such that it is so repetitive you will be bored. Jackson needs to fine tune this course.",
                "Not a great class to be honest, but he tries.",
                "The course could have spent less time on bargaining theory at the beginning of the semester. More well-defined examples of constructivism, realism, and liberalism would have helped as well. Lastly, I wish there could have been more grades as the only influential ones were the reading responses and exams."

                "I would only recommend it if you need it for the GLBL major. There are other Jackson seminars which are more exciting and approachable.",
                "It's a mandatory course for the Global Affairs major, so if you're Global yes.",
                "This course is a Global Affairs major requirement. I would probably not take it otherwise. I think there are much better, more specific options that teach regional security material (China, Russia, Northern Ireland, Middle East...) instead of trying to universalize concepts that, frankly, often seem trivial or oversimplified. (\"Uncertainties,\" \"intangible incentives,\" \"commitment problems,\" etc. are useful but too simple to draw serious social scientific conclusions from.)",
                "NO. This course met four days a week for no discernible reason, the Friday activities were not useful for the exams, and the grading was incredibly arbitrary. There were literally no guidelines for how to tackle the answers on the midterm, and the example final exam answers that Professor Sundquist decided to show the class he then nitpicked and said they probably wouldn't receive full points. If this class is MWF with section and exams instead of essays, keep a wide berth. Professor Sundquist also took section over, so I had almost no interaction with \"my\" TA (I'm not even sure who it was). This class caused an undue amount of stress for being an approaches\/survey course, and I would not recommend it whatsoever. For some reason, this class was also a magnet for the worst kinds of global affairs majors, and somehow the same 6 people would speak 3 times each in lecture.",
                "This course is not so bad or unbearable that it should make you decide not to major in Global Affairs - but don't go into the class expecting that it's going to be a favorite, or that you're going to learn much that's valuable for a future in international relations. I hope that the Jackson School takes a close look at its two required core courses soon - they've been getting subpar ratings for too long, and there is definitely a lot of room for improvement.",
                "I would recommend this class to Global Affairs majors.",
                "It is a required course, but I would recommend that you take it as early as possible given that it is a survey course. While it was sometimes interesting, I just feel that as Junior I did not want to take a survey lecture course and would rather spend more time diving into case studies. However, Professor Sundquist is really earnest and works really hard to make this a good course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I have learned so much and can not wait to apply the information to classes in the future.",
                "Yes, if you are a global affairs major since it is required. Otherwise, it's great for non-political science types who want to be better prepared to comfortably talk international security or politics in general, but for those who are looking into a career in political science or something similar, a more theory-based or data-based course is probably better.",
                "Yes, good class for Global majors. Came into the course expecting the worst based on past reviews, but it turned out much better than I thought. You learn a lot of important theory and get good practice reading political science papers.",
                "I would recommend it to students wishing for a survey course on international security and affairs. But I would not recommend it for each of the factors\/topics it claims to teach i.e. history, political theory, methods\/statistics, or application to real-world events, because each of these were covered broadly but not with enough depth to foster greater understanding.",
                "100%!! I think this class gets a bad rap because it's part of the global core and everyone has to take it, but it is definitely a class you should be excited about taking! Go in with an open mind and being excited to learn about a broad variety of topics in international security. This class is set up for you to succeed and is a pretty smooth class especially when compared to other classes at Yale, so don't worry about having to take it.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student if it were to remain in the same format. However, the course material is very interesting.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Sundquist and this class are only going to get better as the years go on. Especially if Prof. Sundquist ends up taking our suggestions for next year, this Global Affairs major requirement will be fabulous.",
                "No, unless you are a GLBL major. I had to be at this class four times a week (three classes, one section) and it was honestly exhausting having to show up for a class where engagement was minimal. The most interesting part of the course, the data visualization part and guest lecture series, could be a bigger part of the course in future iterations.",
                "Not really but its a major requirement",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. For reasons of workload, pedagogical weaknesses, the unnecessary four meeting times, and others, I would encourage students to look for alternative courses. Unfortunately, Global Affairs students were required to take this course my year, although I earnestly hope that requirement will be removed (or that alternative courses will be offered, at the very least).",
                "Yes. I had to take this class as a global affairs major but I enjoyed the class a lot more than I thought I would. GLBL 225 and 275 both get a bad rap for being unenjoyable core classes for the Global major but this semesters was very fine. I think Professor Sundquist gets a lot of heat from some students for his quirky personality but he is a very nice person who is obviously very passionate about teaching. The workload for the class consisted of two response papers, weekly quiz (which were basically reading checks and only a few sentences) an in class midterm and final. The workload was very much doable and nothing that I really had to stress over during the semester. \r\n\r\nThe worst thing about this class by far was the fact that it met three times a week in the morning and the one class you could not miss was the Friday morning one (because of the weekly quiz).",
                "No. Absolutely not. If I could go back in time, I would major in something other than Global Affairs to not take this class. You can only take that many courses at Yale, don't waste your time unless Yale changes the instructor or completely redesigns the course. Ask anyone who has taken this class, and I would assure you that over 85% would not have taken it if they had the choice.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's an effective overview of the causes and consequences of conflict and increased my understanding about many past and current events. It teaches very relevant and applicable knowledge.",
                "I understand that this course is required for those who to complete the Global Affairs Major. Still, I do not recommend taking this course.",
                "Required for major, if not - no",

                "This is an absolutely horrible class, for so many reasons. Firstly, it met 4 times per week because James taught sections. The last two sessions of the week (section on Thursday and class on Friday) were a complete waste of time. More importantly, James is utterly unqualified to be teaching this core class and it shows. His slides look like a middle schooler made them and the class felt like a mediocre middle school social studies class. The lectures were neither a mile deep nor a mile wide, they were just a mess. They were incredibly disorganized, with random examples\/anecdotes unrelated to the topic and takeaways that barely scratched the surface of the topic. I don't think James really knows much about international security. I did not gain anything from the semester other than a massive headache of having to deal with a class that took up so much time. It's truly baffling how a class that meets so often can teach you so little. It's unacceptable that Jackson does not do something to fix this class.",
                "It is a good introductory course. Im not sure if I wouldve taken it had I not been a Global Affairs major however. There are other introductory courses, and in general I enjoy courses that are more specific and delve into more historical details (thats why I loved the lectures on Congo and Ukraine and Political Memories). However, that is a personal bias.",
                "It's a required class for global majors, so I wouldn't really recommend it to someone who is not a global major. That being said, I think it gives a solid basis of international security and some broad insights into many different topics.",
                "For students interested in Global Affairs, this class is a worthwhile survey course of topics in the major. I would definitely recommend it to younger students looking to explore their interests in the field. I feel that more experienced students would be better served to take a more detailed class (but, of course, they are the ones required to take it).",
                "Yes. This topic is crucial for understanding world politics and conflict. The readings were quite informative and interesting.",
                "This class is a major requirement; as a GLBL major, I don't think I would have wished to been required to take this course since it itself still doesn't even know what role it is supposed to play in the major. However, I think that if it were much more structured, and the major and professor had everything sorted out, it would be a strong GLBL course. Just at the current stage, I think it has some things it still needs to work on in order for it to become a required course. That being said, I still would say that it was very helpful for me to learn about frameworks to view the international order and global geopoliticsdefinitely a strong course for people interested in GLBL.",
                "you have to take it if you're global.",
