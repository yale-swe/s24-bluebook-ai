I did not learn any nontrivial facts about sustainability.",

                "the lectures were interesting \r\nthe exams were sometimes a little rouge as the questions were not something we had covered in class",
                "weaknesses: truly everything. the professor was shit. the course material as nonsensical. the psets were garbage and had nothing to do with the class.",
                "The lectures had very little structure and seemed to just be long-winded overviews of the topics.",
                "The assignments were really fair and straightforward (for the most part), but the tests were a little out of left field.",
                "All weaknesses no strengths. The material was ridiculously easy but the tests and problem sets were made impossible by Professor Dollars lack of effort and raging incompetence.",
                "Strengths: Not a particularly difficult course, and most if not all students take it for the science credit. Pretty low time commitment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course material is randomly scattered across the lectures with virtually no organization. Lots of material consists of memorizing random facts and numbers with no understanding of why. Problem sets are not intellectually engaging and are designed to trip you up for no reason. For example, one problem set involved an extremely complicated bean counting activity that was supposed to simulate trophic levels, but was so confusing that the professor needed to send THREE separate emails to provide corrections to the confusing and contradictory questions.\r\n\r\nExams test random fact knowledge with no coherence. One question asked, \"as a proportion of its body weight, how many insects does a luna moth eat each night?\" The answer is zero, because luna moths have no digestive systems. This was totally irrelevant to the course and designed to trip up those who \"weren't paying attention\" to the professor's every word. Another exam question asked which of the (off-screen) filmmakers in a documentary \"was obsessed with corals\" -- was it the director of photography, the producer, the casting director...? You get the point.\r\n\r\nEven the TFs were so fed up with the course that they signed onto a petition that one student wrote to the DUS. The DUS ultimately agreed to work with the TFs to write the final exam, instead of the professor. However I believe some of the exam questions were still written by the professor, and anyway this doesn't make it a good idea to take the course.\r\n\r\nThe TFs did their best to help but from what we undergrads heard, Professor Dollar refused to give them answer keys in advance, prohibited them from providing problem set help, and monopolized the creation of the exams at the expense of student preparation. One TF even quit mid-semester.",
                "This course was not taught based on a textbook. It seemed as if information was being pulled randomly without a sense of direction, making it difficult to find out what exactly we should be trying to learn for exams.",
                "I sadly cannot think of any strength of this course. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, there are many, the most important of which are the following: \r\n- the professor emphasized that this course was about \"broad concepts,\" but proceeded to focus on minutiae and did not make it clear which concepts he was referring to (to the point where during the review session the TFs could not speak to what the broad concepts of this course were)\r\n- each lecture essentially consisted of the professor going over 80-100 slides of arbitrary information loosely related to the environment \r\n- the course content was not adequate for the university level (it would have perhaps been adequate for a middle school science class) \r\n- the professor seemed unmotivated at all times \r\n- the professor did not respond to emails, refused to give relevant information on grades and the class curve, and was hostile toward students in front of the entire class",
                "Oh boy. It's difficult to make sustainability or the environment boring, but this class should have been so much more exciting and engaging than it was. A lot of people will write negative reviews about this class, and I don't think all of that is fair. Most of it is a result of the grading as opposed to the course - we didn't know what grade we were sitting on until days before the Cr/D deadline, the first midterm was shockingly hard given the content (class average was a 60%), and we were explicitly told some things wouldn't appear on midterms which... then did. But the grading and stress of the class aside, the course itself was probably good. There was just a lot of conflict between the professor and the class which did make it harder to get the most out of the material, but overall I did learn something, even if I'm glad it's over",
                "There were not a lot of strengths to the course. It was very unorganized and not cohesive - I left each lecture unsure of what the takeaways were supposed to be and how they connected to content from previous weeks. We were also told the exams would be conceptual and that \"we did not need to study, just come to class and pay attention,\" and then very specific questions were asked. Professor Dollar was also very defensive when we brought up our concerns and so no improvements were able to be made until others got involved. We also never got feedback for any assignments we turned in.",
                "Better support for students is absolutely required. Exams could be improved substantially and actually test learning instead of random memorization of facts that hold no bearing about what we are learning in class. Better coverage of assignments in class would be helpful. Also, receiving feedback on literally any assignment would be appreciated especially when massive amounts of points are taken off with no explanation even after requesting feedback multiple times. This course might be interesting (subject matter wise) if a different professor with more respect, support, and care for students and their learning was teaching it.",
                "Strengths: the East Rock activity was fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course was really poorly organized. I had no idea what we were going to talk about in class on any given day or how the course was going to proceed over the weeks. The material was either really vague or really specific and I don't feel like I learned much at all. The exams were also poorly written and simply did not test on useful knowledge. Even after students brought up this issue (with a petition that was ill-conceived in my opinion), the final exam was still full of questions where students had to memorize statistics. The material that was fair game for the exams was completely arbitrary. They didn't test on \"concepts\" but on random facts, and just in general were not very good at assessing knowledge, possibly because we hadn't learned much to begin with. I've taken other science credits at Yale and know what a productive exam looks like. Other issues included lack of feedback -- we did not really know what we got wrong on homework assignments.",
                "The lectures did not go very much into detail about specific topics, but they covered a large range. I felt that the problem sets did not aid me in understanding class material, nor were most of the questions relevant to the class exams.",
                "The class was poorly taught.",
                "This was somehow the most anxiety-inducing, stressful course for me this semester, despite the fact that it left me feeling like I had learned nothing beyond some fun facts that I might learn in a 1st grade environmental science unit.",
                "I would honestly say this course's weakness overpower the strengths. Although the material was interesting, I feel like this class could've had more potential to be a more engaging and enjoyable class to all students. The way the information was presented was in a confusing and poor manner. The professor provided slides that were not extremely helpful. There was one photo or word per slide which made it difficult for students to study for an exam. Although the professor would explain each slide during lecture, it would've been better if he would've provided more information per slide to study and also for students who are visual learners.",
                "Out of 15, this is the worst class I have taken at Yale. This class simply should never be taught again. There was a petition going around because all 50+ of us were utterly disappointed with the trajectory of the course. There are many other environmental classes at yale that will actually teach you something.",
                "This course had no true strengths. Anything that wasn't a weakness was mediocre at best. I will say the TFs were really great and made the best of the situation they were given. I feel bad that they had to be a part of this course. Thank god they are getting paid. This course could be improved by not existing.  Psets had nothing to do with what we learned and were made up by completely useless calculations that have no relevance to anything ever. Tests were supposed to cover broad concepts but instead ask ridiculously specific questions about random details from lectures.",
                "Streamline the information the class covered.",
                "This course should be completely redesigned and taught by a new professor. The slides were incredibly hard to follow, they were badly organized and presented very little retainable information. The professor provided his students with no support or assistance and tried to prohibit the Teaching fellows (who were fantastic and understood the material much better than the professor) from providing assistance too. The intention of the class was presented as a big picture analysis of climate change, sustainability, and how the development of mankind has affected the planet, but assessments were designed to trick students and only test their knowledge of the mot trivial and irrelevant details of the lectures  completely contradicting the original description of the course. And despite this being the case multiple times, the professor continued to lie and instruct students on the incorrect material to study for exams. Similarly, problem sets demanded students to use skills and information that was not discussed or taught in class and the professor was not willing to provide additional instruction despite the continuously unclear and even incorrect instructions.",
                "It needs to go over content that is tested",
                "Strengths: Provided big concepts regarding the interaction between humans and the Earth\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of feedback in problem sets.",
                "This class could be improved in every single aspect. PSETs were riddled with mistakes, fixed a couple hours before the midnight deadline and extensions were not granted on account of this. No feedback was given on our answers or our grades. Exams were constructed in an impossible way and when complains were lodged or concerns voiced there was no response and little empathy. It felt like students were being set up for failure which, for a group of people who are generally conscientious students who care about their academic success, was a recipe for anxiety and stress. \r\n\r\nWe were told this class would be conceptual and were consistently blindsided by PSETs and exams. There was no section / office hours / space to address concerns. Even the emails of the TAs were hard to obtain. At one point, after the last class of the semester, someone emailed the entire class asking for the TA email addresses as they had been unreachable otherwise.  their addresses were not on the syllabus or canvas. Consequently, emailing the professor himself often warranted no response, and several follow up emails.  \r\n\r\nThis class was at best uninformative, at worst condescending, and on every level unprofessional.",
                "A strength of this course was that it was super interesting and engaging. A weakness was the sheer amount of information that this course covered made it hard to keep up at times.",
                "Not very organized or well structured. Not clear instructions or feedback.",
                "This course was not organized well. The psets were poorly made and the professor would often mislead us during our preparation for exams. The TF's were one of the only good things about this class.",
                "This course was extremely disorganized. The lectures had a lot of extraneous information, which made studying very difficult. Exams had very specific data that was not focused a lot on in class, so students had no way of knowing they needed to study that. The presentations were around 100 slides long every class. The course covered way too much information, and there was a lack of focus on sustainability. \r\n\r\nHomework was returned with grades averaging 70-75%, and we received no feedback on why we got points off. The grading felt arbitrary, and the homework was disorganized. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual challenge of this class was very low, and yet it was impossible to receive an A. I took AP Environmental Science in high school, so I had a solid understanding of what was covered in the course, and yet I would continually get lots of points off all assignments.",
                "Needs to organize the lectures and problem sets and exams to be more cohesive. The exams picked up items that were quickly passed over during lecture. Problem sets were just busy work.",
                "Strengths: Structure and flow of course, starting with basic human evolution moving towards energy. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assessments did not match what was covered in lecture. No discussion section or even office hours provided. Broad subject material which would not necessarily be a bad thing, however, there was specification and detail in the wrong areas. Problem sets/homeworks were tedious, yet time intensive busy work and did little to reinforce concepts covered in class.",
                "This course could be improved by having any other professor teach it. I learned more from the TFs than I ever did from professor Dollar. This class was horribly organized, horribly taught, and every aspect of the class was misrepresented to us by the professor. He was also disrespectful to TFs and students on countless occasions. Avoid courses with professor Dollar.",
                "Weaknesses: Everything. Do not take this class. The only way I would take this class again or recommend it to others is if Professor Dollar is no longer teaching it. I refuse to take another class with him."

                "I would NOT recommend this course to another student. The course was extremely disorganized and confusing to learn in. Assignment instructions were extremely difficult to understand and the professor would give no clear instructions while in class. He'd always say the instructions are self-explanatory and that the assignment shouldn't take a lot of time, while in reality, they were not self-explanatory and would take a lot of time due to their confusing nature. Additionally, this class was extremely disorganized that the instructor made me have unwanted stress for losing the first exam (eventually it was found.)",
                "Absolutely not.",
                "No. Do not take this class. This is the worst class I've ever taken. It's definitely a good idea for a course but was executed horribly.",
                "Absolutely not, I would actually strongly recommend they avoid this class and this professor.",
                "No, as you are tested on broad concepts not really gone over in class.",
                "No. Unless serious change is made or it is taught by someone else.",
                "Yes, but I would warn them that this class was fast-paced and covered a lot of information.",
                "No. Unless this class is restructured I would not recommend it to anyone. It was a very frustrating class.",
                "Yes - interesting subjects, engaging lectures, fun/relevant assignments, and simple/straightforward to do well",
                "No.",
                "No",
                "If it was taught by another professor, maybe. The course has potential and it is important subject matter, additionally it is an important course to have for non STEM students, however I would not recommend it if it were taught by Professor Dollar.",
                "I would actively warn students to avoid this class at all costs if taught by Professor Dollar. The TFs were great  if they were teaching the course it would have been good. Dollar actively misrepresents assignments and evaluations, organized the class horribly, and was very rude and disrespectful on numerous occasions. This was the worst class Ive ever taken, a disappointing experience, and a huge waste of time and money. Again, this is not because of the topic but rather the professor.",
                "No. Do not take this. Professor Dollar is rude, dismissive, and does not care about his students or the content of the class. This was by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. He changed assignments constantly without changing deadlines, mocked students, and made us feel uncomfortable. Dont take this."
