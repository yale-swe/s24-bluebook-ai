Room for creativity in projects/choice of text to translate.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: hard to think of any.",
                "Strengths: I really liked the format of this class. Readings were really interesting, and having students present weekly also made discussions much more lively and engaging. The translation project was also fun. I enjoyed how creative I could get with the final product, and workshopping translations in class was helpful. I also appreciated how flexible the course was with our fluency and language skill. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more drafting and peer reviewing time on our longer essays, like the midterm book review. I would have appreciated more feedback.",
                "Strengths: The workload was perfect. I felt engaged and challenged, but never overwhelmed. Professor Francis facilitated a student-led classroom setting, trusting us to go through essential aspects of translations. Workshops were very positive experiences, and I felt supported by my peers and by Professor Francis.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "strengths: organized very well, the small class size made it great for discussions, and being able to focus on your own work and bring your own desired topics/themes to the class was a great experience, Prof. Francis took into account when the semester was going to get busier and adjusted accordingly in terms of class work, which was helpful \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the deadlines could get a tad bit confusing since the syllabus didn't seem to be updated and instead reflective of the deadlines of a previous iteration of the course, this wasn't a huge deal but did make it harder to plan ahead at times."

                "Absolutely. Probably one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at Yale. If you have had any interest in translation, this is a good class that tackles the \"problems of translation\" from different angles, providing breadth in a way that is still very accessible without any extensive background.",
                "absolutely!",
                "Yes! This seminar gives you a really comprehensive introduction to the politics of translation, without being too demanding or intensive. The translation project is flexible and gives you the opportunity to put your readings into practice. This course made me fall in love with translation.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I had taken translation classes at Yale, but I was met with a wealth of new material and perspectives that I had never considered. Students were encouraged to follow their interests, which led to a very diverse range of texts that we translated. Classes were structured very well. The format was interesting, in that many people were translating from languages that their peers did not know. I thought this would be difficult to overcome, but instead unlocked new perspectives that were very interesting to consider.",
                "If you're interested in literary translation, yes! This course covers a wide breadth of relevant scholars' work as they relate to translation, and it was extremely interesting as someone who had never explored this field previously.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students who are looking for an introduction to the art of translation and may simply just be curious about the role of translation in the dissemination of knowledge and art. Professor Francis does a wonderful job of engaging students at all experience levels and is an extremely encouraging mentor throughout the process of our translations! The readings and content of the course were extremely memorable and I truly enjoyed my time in the class."
