                "It was nice to have recorded lectures and that allowed my schedule a little more flexibility but since it was difficult to work with others and learn from my peers sometimes.",
                "The course is extremely interesting and cool to learn about, however, Professor Steinacker's recorded lectures are not the most engaging (given it is hard to be engaging on recorded lectures). I am of the position that Professor Steinacker does too many mathematical proofs during these lectures, as I enjoy learning about the conceptual side of topics more.",
                "I think an improvement could be how the material is taught. The professor always shows us extremely simple examples in lecture and expects us to automatically be able to complete extremely hard examples on our homework assignments. This gap is hard to bridge on our own, and I think some more help from the professor would be great.",
                "Strengths: Recorded lectures were well-organized, and there were ample materials (lecture notes, formula sheets, etc.) for further studying. There were also ample office hours to receive help on the homework assignments and prepare for exams.",
                "Professor Steinacker was very engaging and I appreciated how much effort she put into her videos and into making sure students were learning. The psets were challenging but ultimately helped me to gain a better understanding of the material.",
                "Review videos are extremely helpful",
                "Strengths: Super well-organized and understandable even for people without any physics background! PSETs are hard and take a long time but there is so much help available. Exams are reasonable and reflect course content well!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly nonethis is an awesome class!",
                "The organization of this course is great, as well as the level of support available. I went to peer tutor office hours every week, and there was a spreadsheet showing when everyone was available to help, with what problems each week.",
                "The strength of this course is definitely Professor Steinacker - she is an excellent lecturer and her willingness to accommodate students made this term feel a lot less stressful that it could have been. Her enthusiasm for teaching and for physics shines through in every demonstration and every problem worked out on the board. The solutions to past PSETs and the class notes are incredibly well-detailed and well-planned. The homework is well-calibrated and interesting, though a bit long.",
                "This course is a lot of work but it truly engrains physical principles. It could be improved by making problem sets a bit shorter of have different style problems mixed in use they take about 8 hours a week to complete.",
                "Strengths: Steinacker is amazing, she puts in so much work to make great lectures and sets up the course for student success.",
                "This course is quite good. I learned a lot and had fun solving some interesting problems. \r\n\r\nProf. Steinacker does a lot for students, whether it be recording additional appendices to lectures for those who are curious or providing written lecture notes. I appreciated these notes and appendices a lot and it helped me to learn the material much better.",
                "I don't think there are any particular weaknesses of the course.",
                "Professor Steinacker is a great teacher. She's very nice and supportive and you can tell that she really cares about her students. I love that she has tons of office hours and there are also tons of office hours with tutors.",
                "Adrianne is amazing at giving lectures, and keeps students engaged with the lecture. She recorded a lot of demonstrations despite the covid situation (and this is a lecture course, not physics lab..!), which was so entertaining and nice. She also posts lecture notes for each class which are very thorough, and also holds exam review sessions, which help A LOT in exams.",
                "I have no suggestions",
                "The lectures are easy to follow, despite the challenging subject content. The test corrections are a great strength, helping alleviate the stress associated with messing up on a test.",
                "This is an incredible course that is organized very well in terms of topics building off of each other. Little improvement needed!!",
                "strengths: amazing teaching team that was very patient and really wanted to make sure students learned the different topics",
                "Professor Steinacker was a very nice professor and was very helpful at office hours. There was a lot of support in the course in general. She made physics very enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Steinacker is a great lecturer; a ton of resources (class notes, office hours, review videos before exams); a good mix of calculation and concepts; the math needed really was not too difficult or tedious; interesting range of topics; well organized and grading was clear and fair; homework made up a pretty large percentage of the grade so there was not too much pressure when it came to tests; very accessible even to students who have no prior experience with E&M\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: psets are extremely long and expect to go to office hours each week; grading for psets was a little slow so you wouldn't get feedback before you turned in your next pset",
                "It's a well-structured class, and it's very interesting. My one critique? Went way too fast. Too much material caused the class to feel so overwhelming.",
                "Steinacker is amazing! Wonderful woman and teacher. Definitely the course's strength.",
                "Once again, this course's biggest strengths come from when its circumstances are directly applicable to real-world scenarios, while its weaknesses come from when it is unable to equate increasingly complex models with actual applications. That being said, I believe Professor Steinacker succeeded here more than she did in Physics 180: despite the difficulty of the material, I felt that I was better able to make connections I struggled with first semester. The other strength comes from her flexibility, as well as that of the course: the availability of office hours, as well as her email, made it very easy for me to resolve any sources of confusion. Finally, Professor Steinacker is quite kind and amicable: she recognized me in a course of over 200 students, and managed to make me feel well-respected despite its large size. Her flexibility in light of COVID-19 was unexpected and quite beneficial, and I sincerely respect her decisions to give her students a bit of a rest when it was most needed. For that I have nothing but respect for her.",
                "Even with the recorded lecture setup, Dr. Steinacker's passion for the subjects we reviewed was evident. Problem sets were on the longer side, but they encouraged students to collaborate with peers and attend office hours, contributing to a greater understanding of the material. Tests were difficult, but the opportunity to receive credit for corrections alleviated pressure substantially. There was quite a bit of historical context before introducing a new topic which I found interesting, but know that many of my peers did not feel like this was necessary. The demonstrations were a huge plus and the fact that we could give explanations for these processes using what we've learned is an idea to marvel at.",
                "Overall, I thought the course was very well organized and effectively structured to support student understanding. The two main weaknesses I noticed in the course were that the last few lectures were a bit too dense\/over the allotted time and that sometimes the questions in exams and problem sets were a bit too vague to understand without clarification at office hours or over email.",
                "The course is laid out in a clear way.",
                "The recorded lectures were great because I could pause the video to draw diagrams and comprehend what was being said.",
                "I wish the lectures had better examples in them. I could follow the examples she did in lectures but when it came to the homework it seemed like the questions were way different.",
                "The course was very well structured for student learning.",
                "One strength was the professor. Her lectures were very engaging and informative. I do wish that we would go over more difficult examples in class.",
                "The course was entirely pre-recorded leading to lectures with too much content. I think that the course could be taught in a series of practice problems rather than a continuous lecture.",
                "Professor Steinacker is an amazing lecturer who made the material very engaging for me. Office hours were abundant and although the psets were very challenging, I knew there were always resources to help me get through them.",
                "Office hours were incredibly helpful, as were the posted resources on Canvas like solutions to past problem sets and typed lecture notes.",
                "Recorded lectures were very helpful and in depth. Length of videos would be very long and dragged on, difficult for online learning.",
                "This course is excellent, and very engaging. I can only imagine that when taught in person it is even more so, especially given all the in-class demonstrations that would normally take place.",
                "Professor Steinacker is awesome",
                "Prof Steinacker is amazing. I dont know what Phys 171 is like but Steinacker is super thorough in her explanations, she goes at a good pace, and she explains everything so well that I usually understood everything in the lecture without having to watch them again.",
                "biggest strengths was the study halls. I felt this helped me understand my work the most, and the help was always beneficial.",
                "I thought this class was almost all strengths, but I especially liked the structure of the lectures and our physics groups for working on psets.",
                "I wish there were more demonstrations. Theyre very helpful when theyre used, but when were watching a blackboard or whiteboard for a 75 minute video (which feels infinitely longer than in real life) it can be really hard to stay focused and engaged.",
                "Generalizes physics concepts in the sense that mechanics and electrostatics aren't that different in terms of calculus.",
                "The strengths of this course are the amount of res courses and study hours\/office hours, peer tutors there are.",
                "I think the strength of this course is Professor Steinacker. She is very passionate about the subject and explains things in a very clear way. She is also always open to help, and very flexible and kind. One thing that could be improved to me is that I feel like it was kind of hard to focus on a recorded lecture. But that is also just my learning style, I know some others prefer recorded to live.",
                "Prof. Steinacker and the teaching team are one of the most supportive teaching teams. They always answer questions, and they really want students to understand the material and succeed. There were so many office hours that were helpful, and the exam reviews were especially beneficial. The demonstrations and lectures were interesting, and the problems were challenging and really helped me to grow. The material is difficult and a bit abstract, however, so it takes some time to grasp some of the concepts and connect multiple lectures together.",
                "One strength of this course is that it was recorded - this allowed me to fit the course in whenever I had free time in my schedule.  Also, another strength is that the TFs were excellent. I received support when I needed it and they played a pivotal role in my learning this semester. The problem sets were also super helpful, as they helped me master material and prepare for exams.\r\n\r\nI do not have any weaknesses to note.",
                "Great office hours. The instructor and peer tutors were very helpful.",
                "strengths: Adriane is a wonderfully dedicated and thoughtful teacher",
                "Strengths: well put together lectures, a teacher that cares, interesting material, fair exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class went quickly and could benefit from more examples done in class",
                "The frequent office hours are a big plus. It is also really helpful to form a study group, as suggested.",
                "A major strength of the course was the recorded lecture format, and the accessibility of office hours and help available. I don't have any particular weaknesses to point out, but it seems that the problem sets, exam question, and class notes we are at varying levels of difficulty, making it hard to do problem sets without outside help.",
                "STRENGTHS: Learnt super-fundamental ideas about the universe like how things work at a really fundamental level. Prof. Adriane (Queen, Mother, Friend, everything! <3) presented very engaging lectures every class. She's so concerned about your understanding and will go out of her way whenever you need help. You'll be in good hands if you take this class with her. WEAKNESSES: The material is not the easiest (and could, in fact, be categorically hard at times) so you should prepare yourself for a good deal of intellectual challenge (by no means unsurmountable, though).",

                "The large amount of office hours between Professor Steinacker, the TFs and the peer tutors allowed for virtual engagement despite the pre-recorded lectures.",
                "Professor Steinacker required us to form study groups and I think that really helpedespecially because it's so hard to meet new people with virtual learning. It was nice to have a support group and people to work on PSETs with!",
                "I think this course was excellently transitioned to a virtual learning environment.",
                "I really struggled with the recorded lecture format.",
                "Written notes and compartmentalized lecture recordings are fantastic. Rather than releasing a single 75 minute recording, I like how she breaks it up into 3 or 4 smaller recordings with a coherent theme.",
                "I liked that each tutor only covered a couple problems because it made study hall more efficient. I liked being able to watch the recorded lectures at my own pace.",
                "I think Dr. Steinacker did a fantastic job in her lectures",
                "The professor and teaching team was amazing and extremely helpful! Online office hours was very convenient and useful since I didn't have to go anywhere and could easily pop in to ask a question.",
                "The office hours were very nice and helped me learn a lot more about physics. It caused there to still be some engagement with other students in the class. Working with student groups also helped facilitate engagement with other students.",
                "Although the participation questions did feel tedious in the moment, I think they did help a lot with keeping me engaged in the lectures and making sure that I did not fall too far behind. The huge selection of office hours was also great.",
                "Recorded lectures are the greatest thing to ever happen. They make the class so much more accessible for neurodiverse students. Please keep them.",
                "As previously mentioned, Professor Steinacker was very open to adjusting her coursework to the COVID-19 pandemic, and adjusted to an online format quite well. I found her course as sufficiently easy (well, as easy as physics can be to a non physics major) during the pandemic, and she did very well in making us feel welcome remotely.",
                "Although the class was a recorded lecture, the plethora of resources available for students to meet with TFs and Dr. Steinacker herself gave us plenty of opportunities to seek help should we need it. The use of blackboards and cuts to demonstrations allowed students to follow along with each sequence of ideas and made each class feel like an actual lecture experience. The use of the document camera when necessary was also highly appreciated as this allowed for the clarification of some complex topics which would have been cluttered on the chalkboards.",
                "I appreciated the flexibility of recorded lectures and the due dates given for the class participation component of the class.",
                "The recorded lectures made it so difficult to learn. Especially being at home, these lectures were very difficult to focus on, and I felt I was at an extreme disadvantage to students on campus.",
                "The recorded lectures succeeded greatly. Peer tutor office hours online were also great.",
                "I wish the class had a live component instead of entirely being recorded.",
                "Although I understand why recorded lectures were necessary, I think live lectures would have been more interactive. However, Professor Steinacker's recorded lectures were excellent.",
                "The recorded lectures were beneficial because I could reference them while doing the Psets. I wish there could have been more interaction - we were supposed to form study groups but I feel like we should have had more formal discussions.",
                "I thought the course went as well as it could considering the circumstances! Office hours were readily available, the posted lectures allowed for some extra flexibility in scheduling, and Professor Steinacker was accommodating to student needs.",
                "The office hours and availability of the professor was very helpful.",
                "This course was well-adapted to virtual learning, and I especially appreciated the 24-hour window to complete exams in, especially given that we were allowed to use our course notes and other materials as needed. While the exams were still extremely challenging, being able to complete them without the concern of a ticking clock running down made me better able to focus on applying what I'd learned. I also appreciated that Professor Steinacker held office hours of her own (in addition to the peer tutors\/TAs) 4 days\/week, so I could engage with her and get real-time insight on the concepts we were learning.",
                "Recorded lectures are not awesome",
                "Study halls were sooo helpful. Because I had class and work I could almost never go to Prof Steinackers office hours to ask questions about lecture though. Perhaps it would be possible for her to hold them in the evening or late afternoon? Although I know she has homework help during that time",
                "the lecture setup and office hours benefited from the pandemic, since the virtual setting made it alot easier to seek help.",
                "The recorded lectures were great for being able to go at my own pace (and the PCLs held me accountable for staying on top of classes) and I appreciated having a pset group to talk to and get to know\/",
                "The recorded lecture was nice since I could rewatch lectures.",
                "I think that having recorded lectures often made it hard to focus and stay engaged with the material because there was no opportunity to participate. However, I really liked that there was a really large amount of office hours available because those were extremely engaging and helpful, and definitely made up for the lack of personal interaction in the recorded lectures.",
                "The recorded lectures with demonstrations embedded were engaging, especially because I could go at my own pace. I also appreciated the many times for office hours, so I could get all of the help I needed.",
                "Having the lectures recorded was very helpful, as I could watch the lectures whenever it was convenient for me.",
                "the recordings were very thorough - Adriane did a wonderful job!",
                "Succeeded: lectures translated well online, recorded demos were interesting, take home exams seemed fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NA",
                "This course worked very well with the covid format. The lecture recordings were set up efficiently and clearly and I think it was actually a better learning experience because I didn't have to rush while note-taking. Normally I probably would have missed half the notes.",
                "The act of recording the lectures and allowing us to watch was very successful and giving us more time for the post-lecture assignments so we could watch on our own schedule was also extremely helpful. I think trying to keep the lectures within the time frame could be improved.",
                "My time with a tutor was essential for helping me take the final steps towards understanding the material."

                "I would recommend this to a student who likes physics already. I think loving the material would make this course a good one.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! I tend to struggle with physics, but this course helped me understand the concepts quickly and enjoy learning.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to a student looking for an introductory physics course. Professor Steinacker was wonderful and the workload was manageable.",
                "Definitely! It was hard but I feel like I learned a ton and it was as painless as physics could be.",
                "I would totally recommend this course if you need to take a physics class. It's difficult, but there's a lot of support if you're struggling, and Adriane is wonderful.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student that intends to go into any field where physics knowledge may be useful.",
                "Absolutely not but you probably have to take it for a prerequisite anyway.",
                "This is a great course to take for a physics requirement and Dr. Steinacker is a wonderful teacher who truly cares for her students.",
                "Yes, I really liked the way PHYS 181 was organized. There was a lot of help available and office hours to help complete the psets, and all the exams were open for 24-hours so they didn't feel stressful. Steinacker really cares about student success and sets up the course for us to succeed.",
                "Yes. I didn't have physics knowledge coming into this year, and now after 180\/181 I feel like I understand so much more and am excited to potentially learn more physics in the future. The homework problems are interesting and make good use of problem solving abilities.",
                "This class is essential for future engineers and those majoring in a natural science. It is not an easy course but I would recommend this class to students nonetheless.",
                "If you like physics, then absolutely! The psets are long, but they're fine if you just do them at office hours\/study hall. And Professor Steinacker is so nice. There's lots of support.",
                "I assume that many people will take general physics because of their major requirements or because of premed requirements, and that would mean that they might not necessarily like physics. That was me as well, I never really enjoyed taking physics since high school, but I'm glad I took PHYS 181 instead of the other general physics courses here at Yale because Adrianne was one of the nicest professors I ever met. She really shows a great example of someone who loves learning and teaching physics. Sometimes I would even get excited about physics along with her!",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to other students interested in physics, specifically electricity and magnetism.",
                "YES! Take this course with Adriane Steinacker, she is incredible and truly wants all of her students to understand and appreciate the concepts taught.",
                "Yes, if you are really interested in physics!",
                "Yes, this class gave me a very solid understanding of the basic principles of E&M.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about the foundational concepts of physics in a fun and engaging way.",
                "I would recommend this course. It is a great introduction to physics in a very supportive environment.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who needs a physics credit! While it was definitely difficult, it was very rewarding and I do feel like I left this class with a pretty comprehensive understanding of all the topics we covered, which is a huge improvement from knowing nothing about E&M. Despite being hard and time-consuming, there are so many resources available so that you never feel lost or abandoned as long as you put in the time and work expected. Since this semester was online, the exams were 24 hours, which I found manageable, and I liked that homework made up a pretty large percentage of the final grade since that takes pressure off for the exams.",
                "Yeah, it's a good time, but this course can be a pain in the butt. I'm ambivalent.",
                "I would recommend this course over physics 171, but it may be better (or at least work) to take the 200 level sequence if you are able. If you need it for a requirement and have a background in calculus through, say, AP calculus AB\/BC or math 115, I would recommend this over 170. Do not take it for fun--you will regret it.",
                "Odds are that students taking this class won't have a choice at this point. Regardless, the class structure and many of its ideas are very similar to 180's with the caveat that you can't readily visualize what's going on and relate to past experience. That being said, Dr. Steinacker does a great job of pointing out parallels to tangible processes. So if you felt like 180 was a great class, carry on and you'll do fine. If 180 didn't go the way you planned, this is an opportunity to acknowledge what went wrong and make the best of it.",
                "Physics 180-181 with Steinacker are classes that are designed to help students succeed, not weed them out (unlike intro chem\/bio classes). Highly recommend taking over 170-171.",
                "I would recommend this to any student pursuing a career in STEM to acquire a basic background in physics, especially since this course was very well done.",
                "Yes, if you have to take any sort of intro physics, this is the course to take.",
                "Yes, this course provides a fantastic overview of introductory physics and will give you a solid foundation for whatever pursuits you may have in STEM for the rest of your time at Yale.",
                "If a student has to take it, they should. I was interested in physics, but I do not feel like this course stimulated my interest.",
                "Yes, I would, if they are interested in circuits. We focused a lot on that and I think if anyone is interested in that, this would be a great class to take.",
                "If you have to take it yes, if not then probably not.",
                "Yes. Professor Steinacker is amazing and you should take this course with her.",
                "This was a required course for me, but I think that anyone in a STEM field would benefit from taking it.",
                "No, take it during the summer.",
                "Yes! The course was a wonderful introduction to physics at Yale and I think I am well prepared for future courses now as a non-physics major.",
                "Yes, but only if the course is required for your major or you are interested in expanding your knowledge in physics.",
                "I would recommend this course as long as you have a strong foundation in integral calculus and you commit to attend office hours every week, not just optionally when you have time. The material in the class can seem \"easy\" but in application it can actually be extremely challenging. That said, I absolutely discovered a love for physics in this course (I also took, and loved, 180 with Prof. Steinacker) and that is partly because of how much joy she takes in what she's teaching.",
                "Yes, if they need physics",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in physics, engineering, or any other mode of STEM. Professor Steinacker is an amazing professor who made this course enjoyable despite the virtual circumstances. It may not be easy, but the intellectual challenge is great for understanding greater STEM concepts to be used in future upper-level courses.",
                "i would reccommend this course if you have to take it for your degree, but i also really enjoyed the course, and although it will be some work and you have to be engaged it is still a great course to take.",
                "Yes! As a person who didn't love physics coming into this class, I really appreciated how Professor Steinacker cared so much and taught the material so well. Definitely worth taking!",
                "If you like physics, absolutely. Steinacker is a lovely professor and she clearly cares about the students and loves what she teaches. If you dont like physics well, buckle up. Its a rough semester for those of us who are more physics-impaired. Its interesting material (much more so than 181), but its very conceptually challenging, so be prepared to hit the books. The exams in the online version of this class were especially challenging, but Id imagine that will change when the course goes back to in-person.",
                "Yes. Physics major or not, the instructor is amazing at teaching and making students understand the concepts of Physics.",
                "Yes, the professor is amazing.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot in this course and professor Steinacker is an amazing professor. While the course is hard, if you have room for that in your schedule I'd recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this course because I learned a lot of problem solving. Even though electricity and magnetism was really difficult, I felt that I was encouraged to ask questions and apply certain concepts within electricity and magnetism.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student seeking an introductory physics course. This course, while workload is high, was very rewarding and I feel like I learned a significant amount this semester. That said, if you are a pre-med student, it might be worth taking PHYS 171 instead, just because this course is a bit more distanced from the biological sciences. If you are an engineering major like me, then this class is right for you.",
                "Great introductor physics course. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
                "Yes, I think this is a wonderful class to take! It is also likely a requirement if you are taking it.",
                "Super tough class, but definitely had the resources to learn the material if you had a lot of time. Rewatching lectures were super helpful, however wish there was a live component that helped solidify these concepts.",
                "Absolutely. This is a good way to learn physics",
                "Yes, it teaches physics concepts clearly and there are lots of resources for help.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because Dr. Steinacker is an amazing lecturer and teacher, but if you don't like physics, it's not for you. Also, keep in mind that calculus is used in this course, especially multi-variable calculus, and while I didn't take math beyond Math 115, Math 120 certainly would have helped.",
                "Absolutely--but hopefully you're curious about the natural world, not a hater of math, and not looking for a gut.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. This is one of the courses where you have the chance to really see how learning the material applies to our daily lives, and it's quite fascinating."
