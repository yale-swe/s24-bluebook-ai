                "I learned a lot about Victorian England in this class, about 'technologies of the novel' and viewing literature and literary history as a succession of different approaches/technologies/methods that lend themselves to different historical moments, about politics in literature, and about literature's potential for unpacking complicated sociopolitical issues. \r\n\r\nI became a better reader in this course so I could understand and keep up with long texts and contribute thoughtfully to class. I also learned how to pursue the threads in books that interest me specifically  Professor Markovits very much encouraged an attitude of exploration, curiosity, and self-motivated interest when it comes to reading.",
                "I learned a solid overview of Victorian Era literature.",
                "I learned how to read and write about Victorian literature. I suppose I could have read any of these titles on my own -- but I doubt I could've gotten a tenth as much out of them. Especially because I wasn't familiar with the period, Professor Markovits's context and questions were critical to understanding the texts. I also really appreciated the chance to revise the midterm paper and submit a draft to be revised for the final paper.",
                "My writing greatly improved in clarity, and I improved at incorporating secondary sources. But more importantly, I became such a better reader! This class transformed how I approach reading  now I can see the ways on which novels are advancing political arguments."

                "This course was incredibly well organized, the syllabus was great, and the topics we considered in class never failed to captivate me and motivate me to continue exploring our assigned novels outside of class. Professor Markovits approached literature with such an air of passion and curiosity it was contagious and inspirational. It made midterm and final essay-writing a joy as opposed to a drag,  as I felt I had free-range to really pursue a topic that interested me. \r\n\r\nSometimes the discussions were lacking a bit in class and I wonder if Professor Markovits could allow students to engage with one another a little more directly as opposed to engaging with each student comment.  Her responses never failed to be constructive, very educated, and interesting. However, sometimes they allowed students to get away with minimal commentary/contribution and therefore made the discussions stilted or one-sided overall.\r\nAlso, Middlemarch would have benefited being taught just a smidge slower - perhaps with half-a-week more - as most students felt rushed and as if they could have appreciated it much better with just a couple more days.",
                "If youre interested in Victorian literature you should definitely take the course, but it can become dry if not fully invested",
                "Strengths: Professor Markovits is a superb discussion leader. She knows so much about the subject but still approaches the class as a learning experience. The syllabus is well constructed, and it was rewarding to build on our understandings and themes across the different novels. I really enjoyed both writing assignments and learned more about myself in the process of writing. Professor Markovits gives detailed, thought-provoking feedback on both content and style. Weaknesses: I wouldn't have wanted to lose any of the titles we read, but I would have liked more time with each week's readings. Especially as we read Middlemarch, it was difficult to get through the assignment while still trying to read for plot and style. The readings are serious, and I would recommend that students make sure they have enough time to read each text thoughtfully.",
                "Strength for sure is Prof Markovits: shes terrific at leasing seminar. There were no real weaknesses to this class. If I had to say something I would say there was quite a bit of reading, but all the reading was so delightful I wouldnt recommend cutting anything  that would be a a great loss!"

                "Yes, absolutely! It was a challenging course, and as long as one is able to engage with the readings, you will gain a much, much deeper understanding of Victorian literature more broadly, but also an understanding of historical political and cultural phenomena present in the works---highly, highly recommend!",
                "Yes! This is a great course for getting acquainted with Victorian Era literature and many British literary classic novels, as well as lesser-known but still great ones. The course is also a deeply engaging one, taught by a deeply-engaged professor. There is a lot to read every week and sometimes it's overwhelming but most of the time it's just very fulfilling. The assigned essays are great opportunities to begin exploring what it is about literature that interests you, and what research. methods you enjoy.",
                "I would recommend if genuinely interested in Victorian literature, but its very hard if not fully invested. Many texts are similar, so make sure youre into it!",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite seminars at Yale. What could be a better way to spend a Yale credit than reading great novels with a brilliant professor and a dedicated seminar? Whether you are an English major or just interested in the subject, I would highly recommend the course as a way to learn more about the period, the novel, and human nature. The readings and writing assignments are fascinating. I don't believe it would be possible to read the texts independently and learn as much as you would in this seminar.  Just be ready to complete long reading assignments!",
                "YES! A fantastic class. But make sure you have enough time to do the reading!",
                "One of the best English classes Ive taken at Yale."
