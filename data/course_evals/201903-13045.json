    "I became a much much better writer of papers about literature during this class. I also became much better at reading a large amount of reading in a short amount of time, but still reading closely.",
    "I learned to improve the pace and flow of my arguments when writing. I was challenged to continue to grow as a close reader and to base all of my arguments in even closer readings. I learned a lot about what makes up American literature, and what it is as a genre.",
    "This was such a stunningly curated study of American literature.  Sunny's selections were brilliant and brilliantly organized and juxtaposed, too. Especially by the second half of the course, I was incredibly compelled by every piece of writing. I understand and appreciate her impulse not to make it a survey course, as she wrote in the syllabus, but I thought it still provided me with many threads and a great appreciation for American literature. And for its diversity, too: for the classics and simultaneously for the many different people who create American literature.",
    "Over the course of ENGL 127, I learned how to write at a college level. Now, I feel comfortable articulating my thoughts during fast-paced group discussions.",
    "I learned to be a better writer and have a more organized writing process. I developed an essential foundation of American literature through this course and have grown to appreciate it even more.",
    "Sunny gave us a really rigorous introduction to the techniques of literary analysis. We learned to close read, to analyze a literary work in relation to academic texts, to search the archive and use archival material to enhance our understanding of a text, and to revise. She's phenomenal at leading discussions and really got everyone, even those who were taking a Yale seminar for the first time, to engage in the class.",
    "how to use archives to go deeper in a piece of text",
    "A great variety of some of American Literature's best.",
    "We covered a diverse range of texts by Herman Melville to Toni Morrison to even Le Thi Diem Thuy -- authors of texts that all could be considered \"American\" in their own right yet are all unique in their own way. In doing so, we considered and reconsidered what it means for literature to be \"American\" while covering a host of other difficult and complex themes and ideas during each discussion section. From the discussions, writing responses, and essays, I became a better writer and speaker, able to digest, talk about, and write about a variety of literary concepts through close-reading. The three  essay assignments also provided a great foundation on how to do research for literary papers and incorporate archival\/secondary sources into papers."

   "comments": [
    "Strength- great content, open ended paper topics, engaging discussion\r\n\r\nWeakness- very few assessments\/papers. There should be more frequent papers to really improve a student's skills. Also, you will have no idea how you are actually doing in this class grade-wise.",
    "I think this course was very well taught. Class discussions were excellent and facilitated very well by Prof. Sunny. Assignments were challenging but not overwhelming. Prof. Sunny was available for help and was clear in what she expected us to do. The readings were interesting, and the class was engaged which encouraged me to always be engaged. I also received the best feedback on my writing from Prof. Sunny that I have ever received. I really don't think there were any weaknesses of the course!",
    "Strengths: most of the texts are pieces of literature that are important to read at some point, the papers are manageable, the two visits we made to the Beinecke were really interesting\r\nWeaknesses: seminar discussions weren't very interesting, the reading assignments can be too long and you might not have time to actually finish the readings even if you want to",
    "The small class-size is a definite strength of this course. There was time for everyone to share their ideas. The range of works chosen for study, too, was surprisingly diverse. I would suggest that the professors continue pushing the limits of what is considered to be distinctly American literature!",
    "I think the course was fantastic, definitely my favorite of the foundational course sequence. We read amazing books and thought about really interesting topics. It could be interesting, in the future, to think more about how these texts cohere (or don't) in a literary tradition, which could then lead to a cool and critical understanding of \"American literature.\"",
    "strengths: close-readings\/partner\/group work\r\nweaknesses: I got lost when we spent so long on Moby Dick?? meanwhile, I don't think we spent enough time on Gertrude Stein. I also wish we ended each class discussion on the novels we read with a reflection on what it means for that particular book to be considered 'American Literature'",
    "Strengths: The chosen works!\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "A strength was definitely Professor Xiang's ability to facilitate discussion and guide us through difficult concepts in an engaging yet accessible way. I think the writing assignments themselves (including the weekly reading responses) were also very helpful in terms of just improving our comfort-level with close-reading and talking\/writing about these difficult texts. Given that this is a foundational course for the English major and an introductory literature class, I feel as though it accomplished just what it advertises itself to do: provide a solid foundation in reading and writing in an inviting and accomodating seminary setting. A weakness that did come with this class as it does with many seminars is the tendency for weekly discussions to get into a tedious rhythm. Although I think Professor Xiang did a great job in steering away from that rhythm I think even more non-traditional discussion formats (a question is a posed and the students talk about it) could be introduced to make discussions more exciting."

   "comments": [
    "Yes- its hard for an intro English class though. Super engaging and interesting. Lot of reading. Hard grading on papers.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! I think it is an awesome collection of familiar and new texts, well taught, and a class I looked forward to attending each day.",
    "This is a reading-heavy class. You will definitely read your fair share of American literature from Whitman to Dickinson to Melville. The papers are manageable (two 4-5 page papers and one final paper 7-8 pages long) and you only have one reading response per week but Professor Xiang will usually not ask for a response during a week when you have a paper due. I did think the reading assignments were sometimes unreasonable (reading over 100 pages of Moby Dick between classes was particularly awful) and I felt the volume of reading didn't really correspond to the quality of our conversations in class. Professor Xiang cares about the class but I often wished she would ask different, more stimulating questions during seminar discussions. It was also hard to receive specific feedback from her during office hours. If you're not really excited about the texts in this course, then consider shopping something else.",
    "If they have an interest in American literature or want to be an English major, I would recommend this course. Otherwise, it may be a bit difficult to get through Walt Whitman and Moby Dick.",
    "Yes! Though I probably wouldn't recommend 127 to anyone who isn't a first-year or an English major trying to fulfill their requirements, I would say that everyone should take a class with Sunny if they can.",
    "Yes! Professor Xiang is kind and amazing, probing us with thought-provoking questions.",
    "Absolutely! A necessity. Some great books worthy of digging deep into, and some great author worthy of learning all about.",
    "Yes  I thoroughly enjoyed the authors we read and the discussions that followed.",
    "Yes! If you are not an English major or are not sure if you are one, take this class if you are interested in a introductory literature class that really emphasizes student learning -- especially with Professor Xiang, who helps make your personal learning process easier to see and realize. If you are an English major, you obviously have to take this class more or less, but I also do recommend taking it with Professor Xiang. I really enjoyed the texts we read in terms of their racial and cultural diversity and their connections to one another -- while there is a lot of reading, they do paint a great picture of American literature (which is one of the points of the class). A word of advice: if you do take this class, try to have fun with the papers -- choose topics that interest you."
