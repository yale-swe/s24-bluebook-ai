Every single thing we read in this class was illuminating and I feel far more educated today than four months ago.",

                "Strengths were the quality of assignments and readings. I felt like each assignment targeted a different part of writing, which I really appreciated. The readings were a little overwhelming at first, but as the semester progressed I enjoyed them a lot more. Maybe introductions to writing resources could be improved. I did not feel like I was getting timely feedback on my writing, which I would have liked to incorporate that feedback into my later essays. It felt like I was missing mistakes because of this.",
                "Readings were very insightful.\r\nIn-class discussions were very interesting. I liked how the idea of chaos was connected to a lot of other topics.\r\nThe process of writing the essays was really good. I feel like I became a much better and clearer writer. \r\n\r\nEssays prompts were a bit vague. This was sometimes helpful when it forced me to build my own idea. Other times it made it overly difficult.",

                "I really liked almost all of the texts that we read, and I thought that the material was very interesting. It was nice that we looked at a variety of disciplines, from science to literature to the environment. Professor Lutz was very knowledgeable, and he could often bring new information into our discussions.\r\nHowever, the topics sometimes felt a little disconnected. I wish we had done more to relate the environment to the previous topics, and to try to tie everything together at the end. Also, we were behind schedule for much of the semester, which meant that we had less time to discuss many of the texts than had originally been planned."

There were a lot of pauses, and a few students and Prof. Lutz did most of the talking. Also, we occasionally went into break-out rooms of 2-3 to discuss, but I think that groups of 3-5 would have made for slightly better discussions."

The first half of the course was relatively science-focused, although we also looked at the history of chaos and modern meanings of chaos during that part of the course. The discussions weren't the best, but that probably varies a lot depending on the particular students."
