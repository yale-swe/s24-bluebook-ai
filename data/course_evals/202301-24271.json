I wish we learned more about day-to-day language, as I can communicate about gender and colonization, but not about basic cooking techniques or how to get around a Spanish-speaking country by myself.",

                "The curriculum is great for practicing and honing your already-developed Spanish-speaking skills. Could maybe use a little bit of a refresher on grammar at times.",
                "I believe the main strength of this class was its active style of teaching, focusing more on learning to use the language to address relevant cultural topics through writing, class discussions and projects than on memorisation.",
                "This class is beneficial as it forces you to engage with the language, which is essential.",
                "The course improves your Spanish and your literacy in important topics. Daily classes make it extremely hard, especially when you have not done an assignment and need to catch up.",
                "Objectives could be a bit better explained, but this course was taught in a far more organized fashion than my previous Spanish classes at Yale.",
                "strengths: excellent teaching, fun and collaborative environment, great feedback from professor, fun assignments \r\n\r\nweaknesses: wish there were more straight vocabulary lists and grammar tests to improve understanding of fundamentals of spanish"
