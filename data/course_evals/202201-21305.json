                "This course was heavily influenced by my thesis advisor, who was very busy and frankly did not have time for me or the other students. This course could be improved by having more thesis advisors who are eager and willing and have the time to engage with students.",
                "The strength is that the class is very open ended and allows you to write about something you are truly passionate about. However, there is little to no guidance about what to do, feedback was minimal, and the overall structure felt very disorganized.",
                "The individual faculty mentors were a strength of this course. Mine was Julien Berro, and he was very helpful in my writing process. The biggest weakness was the disorganization surrounding the poster session. It doesn't make any sense to present a poster on a literature review, and the guidelines were sent out late and kept shifting. I think that having everyone give a flash talk instead would be much more effective, given that the content is review and not primary research. It feels silly to give review posters.",
                "More mentor involvement. I needed a mentor to check up on me more often. Granted, I should have asked, but still.",
                "weakness - not well organized, no dept wide guidelines for things",
                "This course was well structured. You could have as much or as little interaction with your faculty mentor as you wished, and the deadlines ensured that nobody ended up in a situation where you found yourself suddenly swamped with a bunch of work in a tight time frame.",
                "The thing about the MB&B senior project is that it honestly feels underwhelming. I'm not sure if this is an intentional choice by the department to not stress out the seniors, but not only is it short and also non-research-based, but I had very little contact with the faculty advisor I was assigned, and the poster session at the end, while interesting, was not well-attended by other people in the department. Overall, I didn't really feel like my senior project was very impactful, and because it was short, it also just wasn't that hard  which made it not satisfying to complete. With a word limit of 4,000, I've written longer papers for many humanities classes than I did for what is supposed to be a capstone of my major.",
                "Expectations for the course were not well set. There was very little guidance and faculty interaction. Mentoring seemed optional. That may be preferred for most students.",
                "there needs to be better advisement and feedback for the senior project, and more accountability on the mentors to support the students",
                "I liked being able to pick any topic to delve deeply into researching. I think having more class meetings or deadline reminders would be helpful.",
                "The strengths of the course are that expectations are set early on, and the student is given ample time to commit to quality research. Additionally, my research advisor was accessible and provided clear guidance.",
                "The course has lots of freedom, guided by faculty mentorship. However, since it is so flexible, it can sometimes be challenging to know what you are doing and if it is right.",
                "Not a lot of work\r\nWould be nice if there were more checkpoints during the semester so you don't fall too far behind",
                "No real guidance very self directed",
                "Very disorganized. My mentor never made time to meet with me.",

                "Yes. It is however, the senior thesis and a required class. That being said, it is still a great class to take!",
                "There is nothing objectively wrong with the MB&B senior requirement, but in a word, it's disappointing. I don't understand why the major forces us to do a literature review when every other bio major has an option for a research thesis, and indeed almost every single MB&B major I know has conducted multiple years and summers of research. Not only that, but the essay itself is incredibly short, just 4k words, which is kind of nice on one hand because it means that it's not that much work, but I would rather put in more work and come out with a product I'm proud of that feels like it has synthesized all areas of my Yale education. Instead, it felt like any other term paper  again, some may disagree with me and prefer that it is less work, but I just felt incredibly underwhelmed by the entire process. Having written and published another literature review through my lab which was more than twice as long, I was initially hoping to turn this project into a pub as well, but my PI and I both agreed that it would require substantial additions (again, 4k word limit) in order to reach publishable status. So I guess I'm just really not sure what the point of the senior project is at all. Either make it a longer essay and require that our faculty advisors provide more support and guidance throughout the process, or just please offer the option to do it on our research like every other STEM major.",
                "Yes. It's required plus you get to pick what you learn about. That's pretty ideal as far as college experiences go.",
                "Yes, I would but it is also required by MB&B.",
                "Absolutely. Preparing a senior thesis or research project offers a chance to think critically and write about an interesting topic under the advice of a seasoned researcher.",
