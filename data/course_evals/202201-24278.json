                "Tons! This is a course that invites students to fully immerse themselves in artistic practices and thinking. You lead with the materials and interact with the environment, learning how to translate what you see into lines, shapes, and shades. I learned how to approach drawing and how to experiment with materials. You learn by doing in this course, which means from class to class, you get better at drawing simply by engaging with the project of that week. I learned how to think artistically and critique others' work, as well as how to decide what I want my own work to look like (and how to make it look that way).",
                "I really enjoyed this class, and I learned a great deal about how to approach visual art-making.",
                "Sorta a bit of everything honestly! Obviously, I learned how to draw a lot better (drawing is about observing and isn't hard so much as it requires practice); but also, I feel like I learned a lot about how I view the world. The process of art and drawing helps you understand how you see the world, and how you approximate it. I feel like I learned as much metaphysics as three philosophy classes just by understanding how I experience the world and decide what lines to draw through art. This class is epic because it combines physical skills with personal growth, and I would HIGHLY recommend anyone thinking about this course to apply and or take it jeez it's that good.",
                "Definitely helped me get a better understanding of form and observation\/basic drawing stuff. Helped me gain confidence and explore my artistic skills and interests.",
                "I gained a lot of skills in this course, both related to drawing and to general observation and analysis. Justin is a fantastic professor, and I feel that I learned a lot about drawing from life.",
                "This course offers both tangible skills in better understanding light, proportion, style, etc., but also gives you a foundation in understanding how to view your own art and the work of others. I came in with almost zero knowledge or ability and left feeling much more confident and excited.",
                "I learned about techniques for drawing.",
                "This course was an amazing introduction to drawing. It was a very low pressure supportive environment in which we learned basic skills, techniques, and concepts about drawing. I learned both about how to draw but also how to see the world better in order to best draw it."

            "comments": [
                "No weaknesses. This is an experiential learning course that excels purely because Justin is an insanely talented and insightful instructor. The focus on the materials, the thinking, and the process relinquishes students from the burdens of \"making something look good\" or \"getting a good grade\". I never once thought about my grade in this course--we were never given any nor did it ever cross my mind. I showed up and engaged with the course the best way I could, and I was rewarded with insight and fun (really!). This class is truly a gem, and you should not hesitate to take it should it ever pop up again.",
                "There was a delightful amount of freedom allowed in the class. It is a heavy workload but we get to fun things really quickly; I loved doing the art modeling and I enjoyed that there wasn't a restriction on what we were allowed to do.",
                "Strengths: Justin Kim. Fantastic professor, very much cares about his students, incredibly smart man, and someone who knows his shit about art and philosophy. I think some of the best moments in the class were when he analyzed my\/our artwork: I feel like, through looking at my art, he understood me in a way that few people did, because he could tell from my drawings. He is a phenomenal professor, and I'm so lucky to have had him teach me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a three-hour class, or at least it was when I was taking it. Those three hours are necessary and used quite well, but any class that is three hours is tiring. If that's not something you want to do, then don't.",
                "It was nice that it was at a time that didn't conflict with other classes but it was a little too late in the evening for this tired senior. Also I felt that we did a lot of figure drawing in charcoal\/I wished for more diversity in how we spent class time.",
                "I loved the feedback that we received from Justin and from our peers. Justins responses and the individually-designed assignments that we did felt very thoughtful and were very effective. I do kind of wish that we had gotten to know a medium other than charcoal a little better, but at the same time I feel that I now know how to use charcoal at a level that I couldnt if we had spent less time with it.",
                "Strengths: Justin is such a thoughtful and kind professor. He has his students go through a great process that leaves them more skilled and better able to understand how to understand their art. The class follows a clear progression that simultaneously builds tangible skills while allowing students to draw what excites them. No real weaknesses.",
                "The biggest strengths of this course is its emphasis on being open and accessible to anyone regardless of drawing ability.",
                "The strengths of the course are that there are a variety of interesting assignments and in class projects. I never found myself bored or confused. Yet, the class was still decently challenging.",
                "This was one of the most well-organized courses I have taken at Yale. Every minute of class was planned out and while we did a lot every week, the 3-hour sessions flew by."

                "Absolutely 100%. Justin will probably change your life and you'll be glad you got to work alongside him. His focus on challenging you as an artist completely removes any semblance of expectations or anxieties: this course is about learning and engaging with the materials and the world. If you want to sit in a room with great people and draw and have your mind blown by how interesting art is (and not have to think about grades or right answers or formulas), this is the course for you! Take it to experience what its like to immerse yourself in the craft--purely, without any strings attached.",
                "Yes!",
                "100%! Take this course, and any course by Justin Kim! Superb professor, incredible person, challenges your beliefs with compassion but also in the understanding that his comments will make you see the world in a (potentially) different way, or maybe they won't. You'll learn about drawing, and you'll learn about yourself. I would take this any of my four years here at Yale.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Yes, this course is amazing. Especially as a non-art major, it was great taking this course both to expand the ways that I think and to be required to set aside time each week to work creatively. Justin is a professor that I will remember for a very long time. Much of his feedback stuck with me for days or weeks after I received it, and a lot of his advice is very applicable to life outside of drawing. He is very kind and a very impressive artist.",
                "Absolutely! It was such an incredible class. I've done almost no drawing in the past and I felt totally comfortable with the pace and content of the class. We go through different exercises that allow students to open their perspective to the process of drawing. Justin is a kind and thoughtful professor, class flew by, and homework was interesting and fun.",
                "I would recommend this course to another STEM person like myself looking to take a fun and interesting elective outside of their comfort zone.",
                "100% this course was one of my favorite courses Ive ever taken at Yale. It was so fun & educational. I really enjoyed it and strongly recommend it for people who want to learn to draw.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes absolutely. Justin is a great teacher and cares about his students beyond just their coursework. It was a great way to spend Tuesday evenings and I learned a lot."
