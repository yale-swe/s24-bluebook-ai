                "This course definitely improved my speaking and writing in Spanish. All of our lessons were taught in entirely Spanish, which was new to me. I was forced to think on my feet sometimes, but the class environment was very supportive. Professor Acosta was understanding of varying levels of fluency among the students. Additionally, I learned a lot about early Latin American colonization. Toward the end of the course, we gained insight into some Latin American perspectives on the patriarchy, capitalism, and even environmentalism.",
                "I found new ways to think about creative works in conversation with academic articles, and of course, my Spanish improved. I also found this class to have interesting connections between different areas of social justice, different countries, and colonialism.",
                "As every class relied on student discussion, I felt as if my ability to not only speak Spanish but also understand a variety of different accents in Spanish listening to my peers improved greatly as the course progressed. I also gained greater understanding as to the culture of Latin America and its struggles throughout history, especially in terms of exploitation.",
                "Learned how to analyze and discuss wide-ranging writings and media related to the culture and history of Latin America. Many of the readings covered sophisticated concepts (i.e. Colonialism, Eurocentrism, etc.), which required a level of analysis that I had never before done in Spanish. We also learned how to summarize and synthesize these topics in reflections and essays throughout the semester.",
                "I gained greater insight into the political climate, history and culture of Latin America through reading articles, book passages and watching movies in Spanish. I was able to develop my ability to communicate more complex ideas in spanish verbally and through writing."

            "comments": [
                "The fact that the course ended up being 15 students (I think it was originally supposed to be 25) created a wonderful seminar-type environment. There was lots of opportunity for participation, which could be both rewarding and stressful at times. I do feel like the materials we ended up reading strayed slightly from the course's original declared intention (an introduction to the cultures of Latin America). The first half of the semester was really focused on Latin American colonization and the early development of governments on South America. Toward the end of the semester, though, a lot of our readings became abstract short stories or political essays that just happened to be written by Latin American authors. A lot of the authors seemed to have very similar political perspectives, as well. I don't think these sources need to be excluded from the syllabus; instead, I would have liked to see how the ideas in each work connect to certain prevailing political headwinds or specific events in different Latin American countries. For example, Professor Acosta explained how the work \"Casa tomada\" was a commentary on Peronism in Argentina.",
                "The class asked us to investigate many new areas and authors, without making the class dull, or too work-heavy.",
                "The strengths of this course is the diversity in media that we looked at in examining Latin America from pre-colonization to modern times, ranging from essays to short stories to poetry to film, and the discussion-based nature of the class. Professor Acosta created an environment where every student felt welcome to speak and participate, even if they were not native Spanish speakers, which I appreciated. A weakness of the course is that I did not receive much specific constructive feedback on the papers I submitted for this class. While we had multiple writing workshops where I was able to receive lots of helpful feedback from not only Prof Acosta but also my peers during the writing process, after turning the papers in I felt as if I did not receive many critiques on how specifically I could improve my writing after the paper was read.",
                "Strengths: \r\n1. The class is content-focused as opposed to language focused. Of course, you will learn and discuss complicated historical\/cultural topics in Spanish, but at no point is the class focused on teaching you Spanish grammar, writing, speaking, etc.\r\n2. Relaxed atmosphere\r\n3. Straightforward structure - do the readings\/content before class, come to class prepared to discuss, discuss in smaller groups for the last 15min. Minimal lecturing - only really used to contextualize the readings\/content.\r\n4. Great visit to the Beinecke - got to handle original hand-written documents from Simn Bolval, Bartolom de las Casas, and more\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1. Inconsistent grade turn-around time",
                "The resources used to drive discission and the open-ended class discussions made the class very interesting and informative."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student wishing to fill their L5 Spanish credit. The instruction and grading seemed more focus on generating critical thinking and fostering interesting discussions than penalizing mistakes. A lot of the pieces we read were quite thought-provoking and the seminar-style class environment was great.",
                "Yes absolutely Professor Acosta is wonderful",
                "Yes! This course is a great low-stress class to practice your Spanish and gain exposure to more Latin American media and history. Professor Acosta creates a welcoming environment, all of the readings and videos for class were engaging, and, as a non-native speaker, I truly felt as if my ability to speak, read, write, and understand Spanish improved thanks to this class. We also got to visit Beinecke to look at even more texts which was cool!",
                "Yes! This was a great L5 course with a relaxed class atmosphere, and with very interesting concepts. As long as you meaningfully engage with the readings, class discussion, and writing assignments, you will gain a lot from this course. I have no regrets taking this as my first Spanish course at Yale!",
                "I would because it opens our minds to seeing the history of Latin America more in-depth and from a different perspective."
