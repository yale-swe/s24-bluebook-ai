                "Strengths - Professor Kalogerias' slides are really detailed and makes the class lectures very thorough. This is especially useful for this class with so many equations and definitions. Also made revising for the exams efficient. The psets are long but can be done if started early. \r\n\r\nWeakness - this class felt like two tracks, one in class with a lot of vigorous mathematical proofs and another for psets that were mainly application and calculation based. While I appreciate the proof aspects to help us gain a more solid understanding of the material, at the current rate there is just too much content to cover rigorously so I could not fully keep up with all of the mathematics.",
