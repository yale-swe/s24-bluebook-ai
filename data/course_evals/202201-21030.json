More importantly, I learned how these facts and facets about the U.S. constitution can be used to interpret its meaning, apply it to various situations, and build constitutional arguments. So, in the end, I learned how to think a bit more legally, and appreciate the powers and responsibilities given to the Federal Government, the states, and each branch of government, and it gave me a deeper appreciation for understanding the complexities of present political issues!",

                "lectures long and rambling",
                "Lectures were pretty disorganized. Readings, lunches, and sections were great.",
                "Strengths: the course covered a lot of ground and served as a comprehensive primer to the field of Constitutional law. The syllabus was interesting and well-designed, and I feel more prepared to begin a journey into the legal field after taking it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were often quite hard to follow\/discern the main idea from.",
                "It's a lot of reading. I also feel like second half of the semester was a lot faster paced.",
                "The strength of this course was the knowledge imparted by Professor Amar and my TAs assistance in answering my questions. If you can, please sign up for a section! Attendance is not graded and it can only help you with exams and papers. A weakness is that, although Professor Amar is an amazing lecturer, any lecture where a professor speaks without slides and limited notes can go on side quests sometimes. Oftentimes these \"rants\" were very rewarding though!.",
                "The lectures are definitely a bit rambly- I found section much clearer. That said, the lectures were still pretty interesting.",
                "Professor Amar is extremely knowledgeable about the course material and the history surrounding it. The lectures were a little hard to follow at times, but otherwise, the course was very good.",
                "Strengths:  Professor Amar is at the TOP of the field of American Constitutional Law.  He has spent several decades studying and thinking about the topic, and it shows.  Amar loves interacting with students and hosts them for lunch after class where you could talk to him more about any subject you wanted, constitutional law or not.  Professor Amar was definitely the highlight of this course.  Most of the TAs were also very knowledgeable and friendly.  My TA was incredibly helpful in preparing our section for the exams.  They also give you the option of taking a time-pressured version of the exam or taking it home and having more time to complete it (the exams are graded on different scales of course), and both versions are open-book.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Unfortunately, not all PLSC 233 TAs are created equally.  I had an extremely difficult time interacting with one of the so-called \"Head TAs\".  Sometimes, it felt like they miscommunicated important things several times and kept changing the course policies on the fly (even after Amar himself told me a different thing...) to the point where it felt like I had a huge target on my back throughout the semester because of this...  I do not think this Head TA should be allowed to TA for an undergraduate course again because of the previous reasons.  Your TA can really make or break this course for you as teaching quality by the TAs can widely vary.  Yes, they are all Yale Law Students, but some are better at teaching clueless undergraduates constitutional interpretation than others.  I heard many stories from my friends in the course about their discussion sections, and how different theirs were from mine.  It also took them forever to return exams and assignments as we did not get our midterm exam grades back until several weeks after the drop date.  Finally, this course has a very strict curve (imposed by the Head TAs...), so you really have to work your butt off reading all the cases to get an A.",
                "Amar rambles about topics he cares about and doesnt signpost enough during lecture. Would really benefit from slides or visual cues. Unclear whats important. Ultimately better to study from textbook than lecture notes because you look back at them and they make no sense",
                "The lectures were not always related to course material. The sections were a wonderful compliment to lecture and reading",
                "strengths: good structure\r\nweaknesses: way too much reading",
                "Expectations about readings were at times unclear, the reading load was heavy, and Amar's lectures can be a bit rambly. This is part and parcel of taking a large lecture course.",
                "The strength is the content and knowledge amar has, the downside is that its a lot of reading",
                "The strengths of this course are due to my section leader. Without I would have been lost and I don't think I would have appreciated how interesting the course material was. The lectures tended to be rambles and at time unhelpful. Definitely sign up for a section if you take this class.",
                "Great Credit-D class. Lectures are interesting.",
                "A strength is how interesting the material is, the lectures are, and even the exams here. A weakness is how few learning checkpoints there along the way, and then how high stakes the final is as a result. Also the fact that the optional research paper which woukd have been cool to write is due a day before the final.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Amar. He is so knowledgeable and passionate about the Constitution and US history, and wants all students to succeed in the class. He is also surprisingly accessible and cares about the students. My TA (Rebecca) was amazing, too. There was a nice variety of cases covered that provided a nice introduction to case law. Weaknesses: Prof. Amar. He is famous and he knows it. Since the class didn't have slides, Prof. Amar would often lecture about things over and over again for long periods of time. And he has a very particular view of the Constitution that he promotes rather than teaching the different sides. The exams and curve are ROUGH. Unnecessary readings.",
                "Lectures were beyond unorganized. I literally stopped going because I realize I did not absorb a single fact during class and I was better off learning everything for the tests.",
                "Strengths- Excellent lectures, good materials.\r\nWeaknesses- I hate to say it, but it needs more homework to keep students accountable for the material, especially in interpreting constitutional decision making.",
                "This course is well-supported and involves many fascinating topics and perspectives.",
                "Strengths: No one but Prof. Amar could teach this course so effectively. His work in-lecture drove the efficacy of the class.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings assigned for each week were too long.",
                "I found this course imbalanced in terms of workload in that we learned more than double the number of cases after the midterm than in the first half of the course. I understand that in the first few weeks, Professor Amar was focused on showing us the tools for constitutional analysis and therefore had the time to go through key cases line-by-line. But the enormous volume of cases after the midterm meant that it was very difficult to bring the same fine-grained analysis to the later cases. I'm not sure how to remedy this, except for perhaps spreading the cases out a little more or spending less time on historical cases that have been overruled by modern, post 1937 decisions of the Court.",
                "Always interesting and entertaining, often hard to follow and keep up with.",
                "The course material is interesting, and section makes the class function. The lectures themselves (which often go on incredible tangents), as well as the many readings assigned from Professor Amar's books, often do not seem that relevant to the content on exams. There is an excessive amount of assigned reading, most of which never emerges in any context.",
                "Lectures are really hard to follow and unrelated to content so most people just spend it multitasking on their computer if they show up. Sections are great though",
                "The lectures felt kinda long, but section was amazing.",
                "The course can be improved by making the lectures 50 minutes long and making section mandatory. I believe there were certain aspects of the midterm and the final exam that was not elaborated on in lecture but emphasized and elucidated on in section. This would make section mandatory even though it is not. I believe that I suffered and even was punished for not participating in section. That should be changed in my opinion.",
                "Very reading-heavy the second half of the semester (about 20 cases before midterm, about 80 after)",
                "This course was highly disorganized, consisting of rambling lectures given by Professor Amar that lacked any cohesion or apparent teaching plan. The only real learning occurred in section, where we rapid-fire went through the many cases we were supposed to cover in that week's lectures.",
                "strengths: I enjoyed the full in-depth analysis of the Constitution, seeing as it was not something I have ever studied before. I think professor Amar did a fantastic job explaining the reasonings behind specific cases and outcomes as they applied to each case.",
                "Strengths: the greatest strength of this course was the teaching team - Professor Amar and the teaching fellows. Professor Amar provided informative and engaging lectures every week, and the teaching fellows supplemented these lessons, while bringing in excellent insights of their own. The course material was also excellent, with a good balance of historical precedents and contemporary issues. Points for improvement: perhaps it would be helpful to streamline the cases covered in the latter half of the semester, as there was a wide range of cases covered.",
                "Professor Amar's passion, as well as the TAs' passions and guidance, are unmatched. I did find Professor Amar's lectures a little difficult to follow, however, as he tends to speak very quickly.",
                "Lectures could have been more focused. Spent too much time on Powell and crammed in too much post Spring break. It was almost impossible to keep up.",
                "The lecture was sometimes hard to hear and almost always hard to follow.",
                "Discussion Section is a big pro",
                "This course teaches Professor Amar's philosophy of Constitutional Law. It does so very well and very engagingly. Case law readings could be better distributed into the early weeks of the semester. Readings from _The Constitution Today_ felt superfluous. No coverage of case law from the Bill of Rights (although the course content is certainly adequate without it).",
                "This course is incredibly interesting, but there is simply too much material to cover any of it with sufficient depth to develop a deep understanding. Prior experience is required.",
                "A strength of the course is the TAs that did a great job teaching the material. Something that could be improved would be having more detailed notes\/outlines for class lectures, as they were a bit hard to follow in terms of following the class. In addition, I believe its very difficult to read all the books assigned so I would recommend cutting those readings down a bit!",
                "Lectures could be wandering and unfocused  but I found myself engaged a lot. The syllabus could be better structured so we knew what reading we were responsible for each class. Overall good class",
                "Strengths: Professor Amar is one of Yale's brightest minds and he goes out of his way to make himself available to meet with students. Sections are also really great with great TAs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are often a bit disorganized and the reading load, while interesting, can be challenging to keep up with.",
                "This is a phenomenal course. I found it to be well organized and incredibly engaging.",
                "Lectures are TERRIBLE. Just Amar rambling with no slides\/outline\/direction whatsoever. Impossible to pay attention. Absurd amount of reading.",
                "This course starts off at a slow pace for the very first half of the semester and then quickly becomes difficult to keep up with because of the amount of cases covered within the readings. In the future, I recommend that this course be better organized in a way that allows for full engagement in the most important cases. I also recommend that there be a greater emphasis on the case briefings that are most important to the exams.",
                "I thought that a main strength of the course was how we emphasized the historical context of supreme court decisions. I thought at times that the readings were not manageable if I wanted to be able to complete homework for other classes, so I think it would be beneficial if they could be whittled down somewhat."

So if someone is interested in constitutional law but does not want to devote the time, I suggest taking it credit\/d to learn without the pressure.",
                "Yes. It's really unique in that you get to learn about the opinions of one of the US's preeminent constitutional scholars. It's very different from just a random lecture teaching core course material.",
                "Yes! A lot of past students have recommended taking it Cr\/D, however, I found it pretty manageable taking it for a grade. I'm considering pre-law and this got me used to the format of a law school exam and the type of thinking required.",
                "Unless you know you're into constitutional law and\/or definitely plan to attend law school, I'd skip this class. The concepts are fascinating and Amar is a character, but the lectures are sprawling and pretty disorganized. You get most of the information from reading Amar's books and then write up huge outlines with hundreds of pages of information to try and nail the exams. Despite the reputation, the grading is fair (it's not too harsh, but relatively challenging to ace). There are a lot of tryhards, though.",
                "Id recommend it as a fairly low stakes way to explore constitutional law, although it really depends how much you vibe with Professor Amar. Ill say that for people who are considering but not sure about law school, Im not sure this will lead you to a clear decision.",
                "Yes, I think this class is a must-take for anyone interested in law or politics at Yale.",
                "If they want to get an A or even an A- in this course, I would only recommend it to them if they are willing to put in many hours reading the casebook and like all 10,000 of Professor Amar's books.  I really did love this course, but it does take a lot of work to be at the top of this class to get an A.  Professor Amar is one of the best scholars at Yale University, and you can't go wrong with taking a course from him.  That being said, students should know that this is not an easy A gut.  However, if you're just looking to learn some constitutional law from a Yale Sterling Professor of Law that is willing to teach undergrads and don't mind credit\/d'ing it or getting below an A-, then this course is perfect, and I would highly recommend it.  This course is also good if you're considering law school, it will give you a taste of it!  \r\n\r\nMake sure to choose your TA very very carefully, some are way better than others.  I would recommend going for a TA that is a second- or third-year law student as opposed to one that's a first-year (the first years can really be hit or miss as a TA, some were great this year, but not all of them...).  If you can find one that is a \"Coker Fellow\", then that's even better because it means that they teach first-year law students how to do law school.  \r\n\r\nIf you have the opportunity to take one of Professor Amar's seminars before taking this lecture, definitely do that as you'll already have somewhat of a base of constitutional law and interpretation methods.  And definitely go to the lunches after class if you can!  Amar is truly a Yale treasure, and it's a great opportunity getting to learn from him.",
                "Yes!",
                "maybe",
                "I would recommend this to any student interested in getting a solid grounding in American constitutional principles and dipping their feet into what a law class might look like. It was certainly interesting for me as someone who went in unsure about how much I would enjoy the material, but came out of it as having very much enjoyed the class.",
                "Yes, but its a lot of work",
                "This class was absolutely fascination (in my opinion). I think it is abolustely worth taking! And Amar is a one-of-a-kind professor, which makes this class that much more worth taking. If you try to keep with most of the readings and Amar's lecture discussion, you end up learning a tremendous amount!! Definitely worth taking if you have any interest in politics, law, or a new perspective on U.S. history and political history.",
                "Yes! Especially with all that's been happening in current news. This class will give you the tools needed to analyze any Constitution question.",
                "Yes, must take for every Yale student.",
                "I woukd absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants an introduction to how to think about law and the supreme court. And for every American student I think it s such an important course to know the fundamentals of our government.",
                "Yes. This course is a Yale classic for a reason. Because of this class I definitely want to apply to law school. While the exams were tough, it felt cool to actually apply case law and constitutional theory to real events. Professor Amar is great --- disorganized and often goes into repetitive tangents --- but someone who you should definitely hear. You really don't have to do the readings to do well if you prepare a lot for the exams. Also, it's important that you get a good TA to help you understand and unpack the concepts in lecture. I was fortunate to have a chill TA who really cared about the section, which will make or break your experience.",
                "No, whatever you do please do not take this class. It is marketed as one of those \"Yale^tm\" that you have to take before you graduate. Do not fall for it. I repeat DO NOT FALL FOR IT. It will make you not want to go to law school, not because con law isn't interesting, but the format of the class and rambling lectures do not prepare you at all for the class. The only redeeming quality is section, in which you actually attempt to cover some of the material that is on the tests. Oh, did I mention that the tests are actually the most painful assignments you will ever have to do? They take up your entire day and you end up writing these manifestos, immediately forgetting all of the material after it is done because you are so mentally exhausted.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. American citizens must understand their rights and how they are governed to allow our democratic society to function. It's also an amazing opportunity to be taught by Professor Amar, a top scholar in the field.",
                "I encourage other students to take this course if they have an interest for the U.S. Constitution. The readings can get heavy during busier weeks of the semester, so this interest for the topic is important to get people through the more difficult weeks.",
                "Absolutely. Prof. Amar is arguably the most important Constitutional Law scholar working today. His insights have shaped the legal landscape we inhabit and the existence of movements like the National Popular Vote referendums. That kind of insight can only be found at Yale.",
                "Absolutely . Various individuals have described this course as \"easy credit, hard A\" and I would wholeheartedly agree. Doing well in this class requires a massive amount of revision, effort, and engagement which I found to be extremely rewarding, because I came away with an extremely valuable body of knowledge and many different analytical frameworks. For individuals lightly interested in the subject matter, this course is very difficult to fail and Professor Amar's lectures are always fun and engaging.",
                "Yes, if you want to put it in the work to understand it and do well OR want to know the basics and learn from Amar but are Credit D-ing.",
                "Yes, if they are especially interested in constitutional law and willing to be frustrated with the course format.",
                "No, I would never recommend a student take this course, even if they are interested in constitutional law.  Akhil Amar is the most arrogant professor I've ever had the displeasure of taking a course with.  The only assigned readings are things that he has either written or put together.  The essay was literally a review of his book.  The lectures were incoherent, and writing notes was borderline impossible due to how off topic Amar would consistently get.  If you want a course where the professor simply inflates his ego, pretends to know topics out of his expertise (including rambling about literature and science), and assigns his own readings, this is a course for you.  If you want to learn constitutional law, perhaps read his books and self study, but this course will not help you better understand the subject.",
                "No. This is not a course you need to take before you graduate. If youre interested in constitutional law, listen to a podcast on Spotify. Seriously I learned more in a three hours of a podcast (Strict Scrutiny) as I prepped for the final exam than I did all semester long. The actual history of constitutional law is really interesting but you dont learn this in lectures. Professor Amar just talks about whatever he feels like and you dont get anything out of the class.",
                "If you are interested in the law, you should take this course.",
                "I would recommend this course because the professor gives great lectures that give keen insights on current events and a historical perspective that will increase a student's political, social, and national awareness. Despite this, I think that section should be mandatory.",
                "Yes. Absolutely. Without question. This is the best course I have ever taken. I cannot emphasize it enough.*\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: law nerd\r\n\r\nIf you take it, enroll in a section.",
                "This was the class I was most excited for coming into Yale. It turned out to be the weakest of my year. The disorganized nature of the lectures made them unenoyable to attend, and despite the compelling nature of the material, I often found myself disinterested.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in constitutional law. I quickly realized I did not have much interest in this type of law, which made in-depth analysis a bit more difficult to comprehend at times.",
                "Yes, I strongly recommend this course to any student interested in U.S. law, history, or politics. This course will push students to have a greater understanding about the historical and political underpinnings of the Constitution, as well as the development of constitutional law into the contemporary era - with an emphasis on some of the most pressing issues of our time.",
                "Yes! Even if you aren't interested in going to law school or pursuing a legal profession, the course offers a very comprehensive overview of American law and the Constitution (which are important to know about).",
                "I think with a good TA this class can be good. If your plan is to go to law school, consider just waiting until law school to learn con law.",
                "Yes it is essential that everyone learns this.",
                "YESS",
                "Yes! Prof Amar is a really engaging lecturer. If you are willing to commit to joining a section and doing all the readings, it is a really rewarding class and you will learn a lot.",
                "Absolutely, especially for someone with an interest or a hobby in Constitutional Law. Excellent space for discussion and laying foundation.",
                "I would recommend this course to those student wishing to gain a law school like experience. It will absolutely help you decide whether a legal education is right for you.",
                "Yes if they think theyre interested in constitutional law. But the course is a lot of work, so only take it if youre ready to commit!",
                "Would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about constitutional law, Supreme Court jurisprudence, or American legal history.",
                "Indeed. It's actually a lot of fun and teaches history as a by product. I think this course actually taught me how the government is supposed to work. It's not the way most people thinks it works.",
                "Yes! It is good history and good for analytical thinking. Good to get to know prof. Amar.",
                "This is a classic Yale class that I would recommend to anyone interested in the subject. The best part about this class is that Professor Amar makes himself available after class for lunches. I went a few times and it was always a super interesting discussion. The reading load for this class is very heavy and can be tough to keep up with. Lectures are entertaining, but can be a bit repetitive and disorganized. Often they consist of Professor Amar ranting about how everyone else is wrong about a particular part of the Constitution, which is interesting and entertaining, but means that you often do the most concrete learning in sections.",
                "Yep, its a good class",
                "Absolutely. The course material is important, lectures are consistently engaging, and the course is well-structured. I would recommend this course to anyone at Yale.",
                "NO. DO NOT TAKE IT. You don't need to have taken this course to go to law school, and I honestly don't know why else someone would want to take it. Lectures are TERRIBLE. Just Amar rambling with no slides\/outline\/direction whatsoever. Impossible to pay attention. Absurd amount of reading. Exams are insanely difficult and curved for no reason whatsoever. It's so, so difficult to do well. TAs don't give helpful feedback.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if the student were also in a discussion section."
