                "I appreciated being able to work with my peers for many of the assignments in class, but I honestly felt that I did not improve much as a Spanish speaker. A lot of the time, my instructor would open the class for group discussion and that would be all we did for the whole day. We also still have assignments dating all the way back to September that still have not been graded, which means I still do not know what my final grade in the class is. After exams, we would be given feedback about our mistakes, but we did not go over those mistakes in class enough for us to be able to actually learn from them.",
                "Being constantly exposed to Spanish and forced to listen to it all the time in class was nice. I would have preferred more grammar assignments though, I felt we did not cover as much grammar as I would have liked to.",
                "The course is well-structured, and I believe the extracurricular learning experiences were informative. However, I felt some of the coursework and reading was tedious, and we didn't have enough time to dedicate sufficient time to learning through them.",
                "Strengths: the class was fun, Profesora Tortora was very kind. Weaknesses: incredibly disorganized, often didn't understand directions for assignments.",
                "I really loved the project nature of the course. The projects made me do research, work collaboratively, and implement the language in fun and immersive ways. I also loved the ELC's as a way to further immerse yourself in the language. Overall the collaboration in the class was amazing as it forced me to speek Spanish to my peers while learning about their lived. The only weakness would be Supersite, as the exercises felt very tedious.",
                "The class provided a great structure for  learning aspects of culture and grammar. There were many different ways for the students to use what they had learned to express their opinions.",
                "Strengths is that the class is small and very interactive. Cons is that a lot of the work felt like busy work"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but I would not recommend my particular professor. Professor Tortora was definitely a nice person, but I honestly did not feel like I learned a lot from her. As sad as it is to say, I really do not feel like I have improved much in terms of my Spanish speaking and grammar. As I mentioned above, she also takes an extremely long time to grade assignments, and with the grade calculations being turned off on Canvas, I've had to manually calculate my grade based on the 8 assignments we've been given back so far. She's also not the best communicator, as my peers and I would often find ourselves confused on in-class assignments, and in my personal experience, she never responded to my emails. For example, when I had to miss two classes due to illness, I emailed her before class began to inform her of my absences. She did not reply either time. I was certainly let down by my experience in her class, and I think I would have had a better time in Spanish 130 with a different professor.",

                "I would definitely recommend this class as it was an immersion into the language through its culture. It was challenging at times, but overall I came out of it with a deeper understanding of the language and how to use it.",
                "Yes, I would. I think this course can greatly improve ones Spanish speaking skills.",
