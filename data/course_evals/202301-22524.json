                "I became a much more confident reader of law and legal documents, Supreme Court opinions, and translations of legal issues.  This course made me much more interested in going to law school.  Some of the readings were challenging, and Prof. Caplan's expectations for our comprehension of the reading definitely helped me grow my reading and analysis skills.  The writing assignments in the course were different from anything I've written before, and very different from each other, and I learned a lot about writing and legal analysis through each assignment.",
                "By taking this class you will realize how broad an umbrella \"legal affairs\" is -- how it intersects not only with American history and politics, but also literature, media and culture. This class convinced me to want to go to law school while also emphasizing the broad value of a legal education!",

                "This class enabled me to engage thoughtfully with both legal ideas and ways of communicating legal concepts to a broader audience. The course covers a lot of different legal topics, including the death penalty, social justice, and legal history, and different ways of writing about the law.",
                "I became familiar with new styles of explanatory, descriptive, and narrative-led writing. I learned to recognize some strengths and weak spots in my own writing. I also learned about some resources at the law school that exist for writing about the law or cases.",
                "There are two main focuses of this class: Reading and evaluating writing about legal affairs, and practicing writing about these issues for ourselves. The class focused on how the legal system works, salient legal issues, and the writing that surrounds it. Meanwhile, we were given four broad assignments to write about legal affairs, leaders, and cases. I practiced reading with a critical eye and writing in simple and engaging prose.",

            "comments": [
                "Learned how to write about legal affairs",
                "Strengths - Professor Caplan is very passionate and dedicated to his class as well as very knowledgable and friendly, we read some fascinating texts that really made me think about our criminal justice system and introduced me to several acclaimed writers, the proposal-draft-revision format of each essay was extremely helpful and gave a lot of room for improvements and time to focus on each piece, Professor Caplan also gives amazing feedback and is always there to support you if you need extra help and guidance, the class is very organized \r\nWeaknesses - I think that although this is meant to be a class for those without prior knowledge of law I did feel at times as though I was a bit lost or behind my other classmates which made it difficult for me to actively participate (however he does assign a few students to be \"lead readers\" each class which will require you to participate), the readings could be lengthy at points, grading is tough  but that can be both a good thing and bad thing, I think it pushed me to learn and do my best despite being a bit disappointing at first",
                "Strengths: the professor is knowledgeable about legal reporting and the American legal system in general, and you can learn a lot from his personal experience. Also, the syllabus is carefully crafted, and a lot of the readings are essential if you're at least remotely interested in politics/history/law. Weaknesses: probably a weakness for the ENGL class - during the discussions, we rarely talked about writing itself. Also, the discussions were not always too engaging.",
                "I think the sequence of the course was very clear and Prof. Caplan was an excellent, though demanding, instructor.  There were a wide variety of course readings that were interesting both in their content and style.  The writing assignments were interesting and challenging.\r\n\r\nI think one area for improvement would have been to incorporate class writing workshops before our revisions were due, so we could incorporate classmate feedback in our revisions.  This is how my English 120 class was structured and I loved the opportunity to incorporate my peers' thoughts into my revised essays.  I also sometimes wishes class discussions would wander a bit more.  They were very structured and Prof. Caplan wanted us to get specific things out of each reading, but sometimes I wish discussions could have veered a bit and focused more on what we thought was intriguing about the readings.",
                "Strengths: readings and writing assignments were each unlike anything I'd been asked to do in any other class, so a great learning opportunity. Also, the length of the papers really allow you to hone in on sentence level clarity, which is a skill transferable to many other modes of writing. \r\nCons: sometimes we were reading over 40 pages for each class, which for a twice a week seminar could get difficult. I also think it would've been more helpful to workshop papers between the draft and final, rather than after the paper had already finished, in order to be able to integrate edits.",
                "Strength: diverse selection of topics to read about\r\nWeaknesses: The class engaged very little with each other and students did not have many chances to discuss each others ideas. Instead, class discussion consisted of the professor asking questions and students responding so it was much more of a 1-to-1 discussion rather than class collaboration; You feel like you have to say what the professor would want to hear rather than your own opinion/ideas; Some pieces were very boring to read; Very little instructions given for assignments and no rubric",
                "Strengths: Caplan's responses were quick and detailed. I rarely didn't understand what he was asking me to improve on. I always left class with a new understanding of the law and how it functioned/was meant to function.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I always wondered why workshops on our papers were after we turned in the final draft. I'm used to them being before the final was due so were could improve with our peers' critiques in mind.",
                "Professor Caplan's ability to lead discussions--asking probing questions and pushing students to clarify and strengthen their arguments-- is a major strength of the course. The readings were engaging and covered a diverse range of topics and viewpoints, and Professor Caplan really tries to keep the reading to a manageable level (about 75 pages per class). The writing assignments were each a bit different, allowing us to try out different kinds of legal writing. The main way I think this course could be improved would be limiting it to upperclassmen or students with a decent legal background, either from previous classes or professional experiences. I think the discussions would have been more fruitful if this had been the case. I understand the desire to make the class accessible to all levels of background, but with the focus on both legal writing and legal concepts, I felt like we were not able to dive into the writing aspects because much time was spent getting everyone in the class to a baseline of legal understanding.",
                "I enjoyed the readings and class discussions, and I felt the materials were selected well. Some readings could have been pared down more for the sake of time, but the content was interesting nonetheless.",
                "This was a great course. The readings were well-chosen, and the writing assignments were engaging. I don't think there were any weaknesses to this course, I really enjoyed it and feel like I learned a lot and practiced useful skills in reading and writing about legal affairs. For the writing assignments, it was very helpful that each assignment had a proposal, draft, and final version. I really felt like I had a good amount of time to grapple with what I was writing about and produced the best result.",
                "The readings are engaging, diverse in structure, content, and perspective. Class discussions flowed well. The assignment prompts were clear but offered enough flexibility to allow the student to have a lot of discretion when selecting a paper topic."

Professor Caplan is so nice and extremely helpful (although at first he may seem a bit picky about certain things), you just have to make sure you read his syllabus thoroughly and follow it accordingly, I genuinely do feel like I learned a lot in this class and I will probably visit Professor Caplan for help as a tutor in my future writing courses !",

                "I would absolutely recommend this class. If you're at all curious about law school or journalism and are prepared to work hard on the essays, go for it! This is not a class to do halfway.",

                "If you want to learn about the law or write about the law, take this course. It touches on many different aspects of what law can be, and Professor Caplan facilitates discussion like no other professor I've had. It was challenging and made me cry on more than one occasion, but that's only because I loved it so much and wanted to excelled. Sometimes, you'll feel like you're in a rut, but Caplan is always willing to help before and after classes.",
                "If you are interested in the law, and especially how to translate legal concepts and jargon for everyday people, I would highly recommend this class. Professor Caplan is one of the best professors I have had at leading discussions, and the readings and writing assignments both felt manageable and worthwhile.",
                "Yes, this course is excellent for anyone who is interested in the law, whether or not law school happens to be part of their future plans. Being able to compose a clear argument for those less acquainted with legal terms is a useful skill, and it can be applied to any number of topics within writing.",
                "Absolutely. For any student interested in the legal world and the journalism/scholarship that surrounds it, this class is perfect. I really enjoyed the reading and writing assignments, and really appreciated Prof Caplan's insight into the salient issues we discussed in class. One of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale, hands down.",
                "Yes, absolutely! If you are interested in journalism, the law, and especially both, you must take this course. Caplan is an incredible professor who cares deeply about his students and their learning. Your writing will improve so much by the end of the semester. The readings are diverse and engaging, and class discussion flowed seamlessly almost every class. I cannot recommend this course enough!"
