                "I learned a lot about global health financing and policy, and got to learn about my peers' interest and work in the field.",
                "Lots of info on health economics and financing",
                "This course supplied lectures on a variety of global health-related classes, including global health financing methods (including transition/sustainability, innovative financing methods, etc.), ethics, case studies on specific interventions, etc. A large portion of the class was dedicated to student presentation on their work, so the topics varied with student interests (this iteration included presentations on e-waste, coal ash, industry-funded research (emphasis on the tobacco industry), global health diplomacy, a case studies for specific health interventions in a variety of contexts, and more).",
                "This course provided me with useful framings of the systems of global health, considering health financing, assessments, and policy-making.",
                "financing for global health, modeling helps determine global health trade offs, several interesting case studies from student presentations.",
                "The class placed a lot of emphasis on cost-effectiveness and global health financing, which I personally found to be very engaging and aligning with my interests, but I know a few of my peers were not too keen on the emphasis on global health institutions in this course."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Hearing about other GHS scholars' interests in global health was incredible. Everyone comes at the discipline from such different perspectives, and it was fascinating to hear the diversity of perspectives.\r\nWeaknesses: The course itself was a bit dry. We focused a lot on the economics of global health, which is obviously very important, but not very relevant to a lot of our interests (which were more tied into equity in global health). This was also more of a lecture than a seminar, which was unfortunate because we all have such different perspectives (e.g. economics, biology, engineering, statistics) that a more discussion-based class would have been great.",
                "A strength of this course were the student presentations. It was awesome getting the chance to hear about all of the interest and work that other students were engaged in ranging from: sustainbility, multilateralism, rural health, and medical ehealth records. Also, Professor Hecht was truly very knowledgeable in so many areas of public health and he brings so much context to conversations topics that come up in class. A weakness of the course was the limited number of student disucssions on some topics considering the significant amount of reading that was often assigned for some weeks. Also, I'm unsure about how the actual grading will result by the end of the term.",
                "It was quite disorganised. There were no clear guidelines on how assignments were being assessed and guidelines were often very hand-wavy. The student presentations were very interesting.",
                "The student presentations were the highlight of the class",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed the student presentations. They covered a variety of topics, and it was a joy to hear from people so passionate about what they were talking about! I liked the assignment structures. There were three 1-page essays. I thought they were a great challenge to engage with readings in a way that prioritizes brevity (a key skill that I'm still working on!).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Reading load was very heavy, but we didn't get much of a chance discuss these in class. I think one way to improve this would be to add discussion boards (but emphasize the casual aspect of them--don't need people to write essays on these! Just share thoughts). It felt hard for everyone to be able to speak up during the brief class discussions. I would NOT cut the class presentations to prioritize this though.",
                "I think the class could have benefitted from more discussion and more student engagement in the structure of the lessons.",
                "I really enjoyed the student presentations. The financing and modeling lessons provided interesting perspectives to global health.\r\nHowever, the class was much more of a lecture than a seminar. We did not really have opportunities to discuss as students or reflect on the material. It also felt like a very specialized class, not a comprehensive research colloquium. I wish there were more opportunities to reflect on wider global health themes and learn from my peers.",
                "Student presentations were incredibly fascinating and engaging a huge highlight of the program. It was a fantastic class and I learned a lot but it should not be required in my opinion. It felt like a global health financing class which, though interesting, is different from a research colloquium. I think rather than scrapping the research colloquium format that the GH program should create a research track and a practice/policy track. seniors should be able to choose which colloquium they take either based on their track of interest of based on what they feel they have missed in their global health education thus far (eg. if you have not taken a global health finance class you have the option to take this). especially since the program is expanding this allows you to preserve the small group cohort feel while not taking on more topics than one can fully tackle in a single semester.",
                "I think the strengths of this course was the opportunity to listen to so many of my peers presenting on their interests and past work in global health. The presentations were definitely the highlight of the course, and I loved hearing about how passionate everyone was about their global health interests.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the course was quite disorganised, and it lacked the discussion and collaboration that many of us were hoping for in our senior colloquium. Classes oftentimes just ended up with the professor lecturing on the topic for the week. The unique thing about a class like this is that everyone has self selected into this group, and is passionate about the topics, and will definitely do the readings needed to contexualise discussions, so there can be less lecturing. If there was more opportunity for collaborative exercises, such as through collaborative problem solving, debates and discussions, this course would really add value and cap off the global health scholar experience well."
