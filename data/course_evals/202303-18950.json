I also learned different grammar structures, and I was able to understand many of the differences between Arabic and many Western languages.",

                "Truly awesome and totally mind-blowing.",
                "This course was very well taught. I believe the professor made this course significantly better than what I was expecting. The constant engagement and reading were very helpful, as were the continuous assignments. Having to do a bit of Arabic every day made grasping the language much easier than if I were just doing it a couple of times a week. I truly think that the professor made this class much better than anything else, and his high spirits and constant encouragement made the class feel attainable.\r\nThe biggest weakness the class faced was the infrastructure of the online textbook. It is not very user-friendly for those who do not have an accessible keyboard. Moreover, there were multiple mistakes present in our workbook that made it difficult to find patterns in terms of language acquisition. Moreover, the workbooks present an extreme financial burden on many students, and it is a little ridiculous that we students are paying upwards of $200 for a workbook that isn't fully correct.",
                "Given the pace of the class, I often felt like the material was rushed through. As a result, I often had to spend a lot of time outside the class in order to really grasp the class concepts. However, the professor was great about answering questions during the class and created a very nurturing environment where people felt comfortable to ask for clarification.",
                "This course could not be any better. Professor Elbousty is so encouraging of his students, and deeply cares about all of his students. I can't think of any weaknesses in this class.",
                "The course's strength lies in the engaging teaching style of the professor, which keeps students attentive and participative.",
                "Very interactive learning environment. Homework was not always symmetrical to skills taught in class. Section proved unhelpful most weeks."

                "Yes, but specifically with Professor Elbousty. Learning Arabic is no easy feat, especially in an institution as rigorous as Yale. I took this course as an Arab woman who did not know how to read and write Arabic, and took this course specifically to learn that. I have a better grasp of this language than most, as I am a native speaker. However, I found that Professor Elbousty made this course attainable for all students, and was able to tailor the class and the assignments to each student as they needed. I firmly believe that this was the best language course I have ever taken, and if I don't have the pleasure of taking another one of his classes, then this will be the best language course I will have ever taken.",
                "Yes, I think this class, especially with Jonas Elbosuty is a wonderful introduction to the Arabic language. Despite the fact that Arabic is a rather difficult language to manage, I genuinely looked forward to going to class every day.",
                "Definitely, If you are passionate about learning arabic, don't hesitate to take this class.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to others, particularly if they have an interest in learning Arabic. The engaging teaching style and comprehensive curriculum provide a solid foundation in the language."
