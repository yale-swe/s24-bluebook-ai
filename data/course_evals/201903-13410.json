    "How to write, read, and analyze better. How to write essays that experiment with new styles, ideas, and perspectives. I learned so much from this course, it's crazy lol. I learned how to be more creative, expand my style, and draft and revise. Wow this course was so good. I learned so much about narrative and how it shapes how we interact. How narrative plays a crucial role in day-to-day conversion, science, and law. How we learn through narrative, moralize, and understand ourselves. This course was great.",
    "Overall, this course helped me with my writing tremendously. I learned how to organize my ideas and connect them to allow a smooth flow in my paragraphs and facilitate the understanding of my reader.",
    "Better writer",
    "I developed skills in analytical writing and reading",
    "This class taught how to construct a research paper and how to write an argument. Furthermore the class scope on stories and narratology was a very unique and interesting topic where I learned a great deal.",
    "This was a great class to learn about how to write like a college student. Professor Eklund was absolutely fantastic!",
    "I learned how to improve my writing skills through revisions, reevaluations, and practicing styles and tones from different writers.",
    "I learned a good many techniques for writing longer, more complex papers. I had never written more than a 4 page paper in high school, but I now feel more comfortable with planning and writing lengthier papers. I also improved in my ability to synthesize a lot of sources, finding gaps in the existing literature to add my own two cents.",
    "I've developed\/learned revision skills, planning skills, how to identify a problem, claim building, creating a strong conclusion, writing long research papers, how to do research, amongst other skills.",
    "I was able to improve my writing and learn more about the role of storytelling in the natural world.",
    "I developed a much further developed voice when writing. My sentence structure improved greatly and I feel that I am truly a better writer."

   "comments": [
    "Everything was great: teacher, material, the progression of papers and their difficulty.\r\n\r\nOnly thing that could be improved might have been the fairy tale unit. I didn't really enjoy those readers as much as the others.",
    "Wonderful teacher",
    "English 114 is very fast-paced and you get a lot of things done in a short amount of time. This is a plus and a minus, but there's always (usually?) enough time for what needs to be done. My professor was a huge strength to the course.",
    "Craig is an excellent professor and you learn a great deal about stories and how to write a paper. You can tell that he really cares about his students and the subject material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class is only as engaging as the other students because it is a seminar. I wish that the professor constructed the class better to really get his students to engage. At times, participation in the seminar was frustrating.",
    "Honestly not much weaknesses. Everything was very smooth and the deadlines were very reasonable.",
    "the course is well rounded in that it touched upon different areas of \"telling stories\" and encouraged students to look at the different pieces of writing and perspectives before beginning to write the essays.",
    "The class discussions were definitely a highlight of the course, and our professor really helped guide the discussion to interesting new places. I occasionally felt a bit of a disjoint, however, between the course material and the papers we were writing. It made me less inclined to spend time on the readings that we did not have to write about.",
    "Strengths: discussion amongst students, creative assignments, excellent feedback, and helpful revision exercises\r\nImprovements: more revision time for some of the other papers, and more time in between papers, sometimes they overlap a bit, but not anything that is not manageable (this is more of an English 114 improvement)",
    "This is my favorite course. The topics were very interesting, and the class was very engaging and fun. I really enjoyed our end-of-semester activity, where we pieced together a story for a hypothetical murder case.",
    "The small class setting was beneficial because it allows everyone to engage with the professor."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Learned so much about writing, stories, and how we use narrative to understand our world.",
    "Yes. It was a fun course and despite me being a science student I really enjoyed it.",
    "Yesss!! So fun and such a good course",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially if it's with Craig. He's an amazing professor and his enthusiasm for the material and for teaching makes the class one I looked forward to. It was a great place to start as someone not confident in my writing abilities. The course topic, stories and narrative, was really suited to the class and I enjoyed the readings. Definitely take this class if you get in!",
    "I recommend this class to all! The topics that are covered are so unique and informative and the class really challenges your perspectives on stories. This is a great writing credit the feedback you get will really improve your writing.",
    "Yes! I think everyone can benefit from taking 114 regardless of major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Despite it being an English class, it has a philosophical tinge to it that will leave you thinking and exploring the idea of narrative in your readings and writings.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student looking to grow more accustomed to the rigor of college writing. Even as a sophomore, I feel like I did learn a lot about strategies for writing longer papers that will help in other classes as well.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I think it's an excellent English 114 class and Craig chooses very engaging readings that many can identify with or find their own intellectual journey through.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. This course is very fun. Although there was a lot of writing involved, it wasnt as bad as I had expected.",
    "Yes, Professor Eklund is incredibly helpful and puts time in to help you become a better writer."
