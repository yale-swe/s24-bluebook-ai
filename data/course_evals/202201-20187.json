                "No - this course was poorly organized, had no solid backing reference material, no active TA participation to help smooth things, and the syllabus wasn't really solid or followed. Although the instructor did try to make the course accessible for those without a specific algorithms background, the course assumed some background in optimization that many students did not have, and thus did not cover how the actual linear programming and optimization topics worked, just on how optimization was applied to different network scenarios. However, the biggest challenge for the course was the instructor's lack of organization, especially in regards to assigning homework and the final project."
