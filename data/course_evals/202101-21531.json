The level of academic prowess you have to engage in is incredible and for many, it serves as a preparation for even higher science courses or medical school. This class helped me identify how I actually study when the material appears overwhelming  and how to problem solve (synthesis questions are no joke).",

Exams were cumulative, so key concepts from CHEM 220 were strengthened (IR, alkene/organometallic reactivity, acid-base organic chemistry, substitution/elimination reactions).",

            "comments": [
                "It was very clearly taught",
                "strengths: regular workload, clear expectations\r\nweaknesses: not very interesting or engaging, at least to me, plus a lot depends on the quality of your TA",
                "Strength - 24 hour exams, this helped much with the stress of other assignments, group projects actually ensured that I had to know the material which I enjoyed. \r\nWeakness - would not record review sessions which was unhelpful considering I used to look back on recorded lectures, disliked the cold-calling that Aaron had sometimes, discouraged me from attending class due to this anxiety since I do struggle with orgo work",
                "Strengths: adapted incredibly well to the online format. Virtual lectures were very helpful and easy to follow. Discussion sections were used to work through challenging problems that would resemble those seen on exams. Plenty of opportunities to work with TFs in office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pacing of this course was odd. I think too much time was spent on benzylic reactivity and related concepts, and far too little on carbonyl reactivity. I'm not sure whether or not it's necessary to include intro biochem stuff -- in talking with friends at other schools, it seems like learning about proteins/carbohydrates during organic was fairly unique (I did enjoy learning about these topics, but their inclusion may have contributed to the pacing issues). The NMR project included topics that had never been taught before, which made it a bit frustrating to work through. These are nitpicky complaints -- the strengths of this course far outweigh the weaknesses, especially relative to the previous semester (CHEM 220).",
                "Like most chem classes thus far, the exams are nothing like the p-sets and students are really sent into them completely blind and unprepared. The lectures and course itself are also poorly organized overall, and both could be improved significantly to help students figure out exactly what they need to learn and focus on.",
                "I can't think of a single strength for this course and I dreaded it every day this semester. The exams consistently took students more than 7 hours to complete and often contained information that we had never learned. The projects took over 10 hours to complete. The content taught in lecture oftentimes was centered on biochemistry and it was never clear which aspects were important or relevant to our understanding of organic chemistry.",
                "I found that course assignments (both the group projects and weekly Sapling assignments) aligned well with the course material and prepared us well for each examination. The abundance of review materials and practice problems was also helpful. Furthermore, the course material incorporated various concepts from both earlier and more advanced courses in the chemistry sequencethereby providing context.\r\n\r\nThe weakest element of the course was its pacing. Lectures progressed through course content rather rapidly, and the exam schedule (consisting of three midterms and a two-part final) did not allow for much time between assessments, particularly at the end of the semester. While it is helpful that the lowest of the three midterms can be dropped, it may be beneficial to distribute the exams more evenly throughout the semester. Separately, while the group projects were incredibly formative, they took far longer than the teaching team estimated; either shortening the assignments or providing more time to do them would be helpful.",
                "less sapling problems at times",
                "The professor, Dr. Crawford, was a great lecturer. I was glad that the course decided to adapt 24 hour open-note exams.",
                "Organic chemistry is a difficult subject and there really is no way getting around that. I think this course is taught in a logical fashion where material builds on top of itself every week. One thing that could be improved would be the use of Sapling as homework, only because sometimes the program itself could be picky on its inputs and sometimes the material being quizzed on Sapling was not reflective of the material being taught in class.",
                "The course was much higher quality than the last semester's variant. The engagement between the instructor directly with the students certainly helped in feeling comfortable asking questions, and the requirement of doing examples. Additionally, the usage of photoshop to actually draw molecules and mechanisms greatly benefited my understanding.",
                "This course was very difficult to understand because the lecture material was only vaguely related to the homeworks and the homeworks were not at all representative of the exam material. Simply put, you could go to lecture and understand the material and still really struggle on the exams. However, this course did improve from first semester as the addition of the projects allowed students to work on problems that were more relevant to the exam material.\r\nThis class needs to have weeklyu written problem sets, the sapling was a waste of time and very not helpful. Sapling sets should be shorter and more conceptual while written assignments should focus on synthesis and mechanisms. There was very little feedback on how you were doing in the class until exam time which made it really stressful to understand what concepts you needed to focus on.  Additionally, there should have been a comprehensive list of reactions and mechanisms so that students had the resources to memorize this required content.",
                "The course covers a lot, but could easily be improved by providing more support for students who are struggling. While I know there are many office hours and sections, when falling behind I felt like I was alone and I couldn't get back on board.",
                "Strengths- The professor was an excellent lecturer. Aaron Clark was also great in his availability and his ability to interact with students. \r\n\r\nWeakness- The exam questions were often a bit harder than the problems went over in class, but I think that was the nature of having take home examinations. No complaints really. Excellently taught course. Much better than OCHEM 1.",
                "The Sapling psets were not assigned on a consistent basis, so it was easy to forget the due dates (the day of the week they were due changed almost every week).  They should be due on the same day of the week every week.",
                "Strengths: the TAs, walking through mechanisms slowly during class, biochemistry applications\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Clark always making trick test questions, not enough exam practice, not enough difficult practice questions during class, sapling was not directed toward the course content, projects become the work of 1 person in the group",
                "Strengths: Professor Crawford was a great prof, answered questions, and taught well and explained material well\r\nWeaknesses: Hard class and exams were not always a good measure of how we understood material",
                "This class allowed for more flexibility, making our exams open for 24 hours, however, these exams were very stressful, and I often found myself using up most of that time to solely focus on them. This put me behind on classwork for other courses, as well as sleep.",
                "Exams are very difficult and don't correlate very well with the weekly homework assignments, but that may be due to the remote nature of the class. In person exams are probably more fair",
                "The strength of the class was that the lectures were easy to follow and the content was well supported.",
                "Energetic professor, sections not that productive",
                "I felt sometimes that the mode of testing was difficult. I appreciated the 24 hour window, but found it difficult to compete with peers who may have used the entire amount of time when we were supposed to be able to finish the test in 90 minutes, and other students may have had other classes or assignments due that day.",
                "Actual slides or some organized notes from the professor to look at.",
                "The professor had energy in the lectures, which made in easier to stay engaged. I enjoyed the group projects and I felt that the professor organized the course in a way that discouraged the type of competition that sometimes happens in pre med classes.",
                "This course was great, but I personally was not a fan of the organic chemistry group projects. They took a really long time and those, along with 3 midterms, felt like a lot of work throughout the semester.",
                "Class was taught really well, grading wasn't as stressful this semester, ample opportunities to show understanding with take-home midterms, projects, and manageable sapling hw. The workload did get a bit too much in some weeks especially if there was a project and pset the week before a midterm. The teaching team as usual was phenomenal, especially Dr. Clark. I really appreciate how we get a review day before each midterm as well",
                "Lectures were taught clearly and engagingly. However, some of the earlier lectures could have been taught faster so we had more time for later material that was a bit rushed. I wish the Sapling due dates weren't changed almost every time.",
                "Strengths - adapted well to online learning, exams were for the most part fair, professor taught well\r\nWeaknesses - one portion of the final exam was all multiple choice, and each question was worth so many points without much opportunity for partial credit.",
                "It was a pandemic class, so a lot is left wanting, but so were a lot of classes this year. I just wish the place were a tad slower.",

                "The recorded lectures were very helpful",
                "The class was well organized and the projects allowed for collaborative work despite the online nature of the course.",
                "Strengths: having projects were really helpful since it really tested our knowledge and I like being able to work in groups. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The professors notes could sometimes be hard to follow and Im personally not a fan of being called out to answer a question during class.",
                "Jason was a great lecturer and his use of a drawing tablet to illustrate all the reactions and draw out the mechanisms was very helpful.",
                "Strengths: My TA was an absolute godsend and was incredibly helpful and great at explaining topics that confused me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not all the TAs were like this, and especially when it came time for the projects, it was really frustrating that they werent allowed to actually explain things for fear of getting in trouble for telling us too much.",

So it felt like a self-study course a lot of the time\r\nthe exams (open note/book, open for 24 hours) were also much easier/less stress, but they didn't really encourage me to study or to learn the material thoroughly beforehand",

                "I know that the timed exams were almost universally despised last semester, but I think they should have stayed. I found that they forced me to study in a way that take-home exams didn't, and led to better long-term retention. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were very effective. Screensharing live-drawn notes is the best way to teach science classes in this remote environment.",
                "While this course was more accomodating than CHEM 220 in its 24-hour exam periods and ability to drop 1 exam, the professor and preceptor did not treat its students with kindness nor compassion.",
                "I appreciated that the virtual lectures were live rather than pre-recorded; this allowed students to ask questions in real-time, thereby reducing the number of clarifications that students need to make outside of class. The virtual discussion sections were also helpful.",
                "The 24 hour open-note exams and recorded lectures were very successful in helping me learn the material. I hope the lectures continue to be recorded as we transition to in-person classes.",

                "The lectures were recorded, which was a great benefit. I could go back and watch them as many times as I would like.",
                "24 hour tests were not ideal because some people would spend nearly the full time whereas others would spend near the suggested 90 minutes. Particularly when we're told near the end of the course that there is no grade distribution, the teaching team made it suddenly feel like  acompetition as to who could spend the most time and gain out the most points. Furthermore, when there is collaboration going on during exams, it makes it difficult to do as well as those people. \r\nIt was helpful to have mechanisms drawn out but it would have been more clear to follow with technology such as an iPad to write on. Additionally, the group projects were difficult because they became the work of 1 person rather than equally splitting it up (mainly because that is the nature of what happens with group projects). In the future, a more complex set of problem-set questions to be completed individually would be better. It would have also been nice to have a time to meet our peers. It was difficult to form study groups without knowing many people in the class.",
                "Flexibility with exams succeeded. However, this flexibility was not extended to the final exam, so it was really unfair after a semester of being used to one thing and then being switched up at the end",
                "Difficult to learn online.",
                "I really liked the Zoom breakout rooms! We did not have them often, but when we did I found it very useful.",
                "I genuinely believe professor Crawford and Dr. Clark did everything they could to be fair and understanding during these difficult times. The exams and projects were all fair, but pretty challenging even considering the amount of time we had to complete them. Still, I felt that everything was fair.",
                "I loved that the tests were 24 hour, it really reduced the stress from first semester",
                "This semester was much better adapted towards online learning especially with the take-home midterms and the projects, definitely reduced stress compared to last semester where midterms were multiple choice (no partial credit), timed, and done on zoom.",
                "Discussion sections were helpful. Take home midterms were very helpful.",
                "Succeeded - good that lectures were recorded, available office hours\r\nCould be improved - design the exams so that differentiation is easier - everyone was doing really well, so made it quite competitive innately",
                "The course practices were adequate to learning in a pandemic. Professor Crawford and Aaron were both great help during the class.",
                "Good job",
                "Having 24 hour periods for exams was very helpful since it is more accommodating to remote students living in different time zones.",
                "I think having the live lectures recorded and the take-home exams and projects made the class accessible and accommodating especially during the pandemic.",
                "Making the tests open for the duration of a day allowed for others located in different time-zones to adequately prepare and take the exams.",
                "I liked how we had 24 hours to complete exams and that there was an emphasis on writing rather than just multiple choice as was the case in first semester orgo. I like virtual zoom office hours since it easier to discuss with other people.",
                "The use of the drawing tablet was incredible and I'm also glad that my TA used it in our discussion sections. Jason was very receptive to answering questions in the middle of lecture as well.",
                "I appreciated the option to watch the live lectures as recorded videos, as I had a conflicting class that I had to attend live, but it would have been nice to get another opportunity to engage with Professor Crawford (i.e. through office hours) as going to live lecture was really your only chance."

                "No, not really. Unless you are pre-med which 90% of the people are.",
                "Even if you don't have to take this class, do it. It is difficult and shouldn't be a fifth credit, but it's so worth the time and effort.",
                "Yes -- I don't care what anyone says, organic chemistry is super interesting. Working through syntheses is like mathematical proofs without the math. If you like that kind of reasoning, you will enjoy this class a lot. Completing organic chemistry is very rewarding.",
                "This course is what it is. If you're looking at taking it, you probably don't have much of a choice unless you change your major or career path. Find some friends to work with and to help keep you afloat and definitely have some study buddies.",
                "No. I honestly thought that the material of this course was interesting, but the ways that it was assessed were abhorrent. I would not recommend this course to anyone unless you absolutely have to take it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as long as that student is willing to put in a decent amount of extra time; the concepts that we learn are useful from both a chemical and broader scientific standpoint (especially for premedical students), but they do not always come easily. Doing well in this course requires persistence and good study habits, but it's worth it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course for another student if they are interested in learning basic organic chemistry. The second semester organic chemistry claimed to be more biologically focused than semester 1, but the two were about the same.",
                "Yes, I think this course provides a strong foundation in organic chemistry, especially for students pursuing a career in the sciences or if they are pre-med.",
                "I would take this course if you have to. I did not find organic chemistry particularly amazing, but it was interesting and the material was well-presented enough that it seemed like worthwhile course.",
                "No, unless it is a major requirement.",
                "no.",
                "I would, of course, only recommend this course if you are pre-med or a chemistry major. The class was well taught and the professor did an excellent job, but the material is just difficult and there is no real way to get past that.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in lots of outside searching independently. The information as presented in the course is not sufficient to succeed highly on exams. You will likely need to watch many you tube videos, seek out extra practice problems, and form study groups.",
                "Only take this course if you have to. Dr. Crawford did make this semester pretty facilitated to learning, but still felt there were a lot of issues with consistency. Organic chemistry in general is a hard course, so you have to put in a lot of work if you want to do well.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in organic chemistry or biochemistry.",
                "I would recommend this course if a student needs to fulfill a requirement.",
                "Yes if they are interested in field.",
                "I thought that OChem II had taken into account feedback about instruction during the fall semester and appreciated efforts to make distance learning easier. Even so, this is a hard course!",
                "Organic chemistry isn't for everyone (including me), so I would highly recommend choosing any other science class if orgo isn't required for your major.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I think this is really helpful material to know for biochemistry. I was debating whether or not to just go straight into biochem but I'm happy I took this class first. It's still a premed requirement at some medical schools so better to be safe and I think you learn a lot of about how to think about organic chemistry and be more intuitive when looking at how compounds react with each other",
                "Yes, it's an interesting topic.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless it was for a pre-requisite.",
                "I wouldthis to another penned student that did not do too well on orgo 1. Dont take it for fun!",
                "If you must",
                "This was better than first semester orgo. Professor Crawford as a lecturer was more engaging and explained things well.",
                "I would recommend this only if it is a prerequisite class",
                "Absolutely! Professor Crawford was fantastic and this class is really good, challenging but very rewarding!",
                "Only if you're required to take it.",
                "Only if they're chem major or premed",
                "Yes, the class was well lectured, although, some segments will have to be self-taught due to the time restrictions of the course.",
                "I would recommend it. If your are premed, you have to take it regardless. However, compared to first semester orgo, the content here was more interesting although more challenging. The key is to always do practice problems and to go to office hours.",
                "Yes. I didn't need Orgo II as a requirement but if you're going into biology, I would definitely recommend you take it. Especially towards the end of the course, you learn a lot about carbohydrate and protein chemistry that I'm sure will be super helpful in biochemistry. If Jason Crawford is your professor, take it! It's a hard course for sure and you need to put in a lot of work but overall, I thought the course was very rewarding.",
                "Im definitely in the minority here, but I greatly preferred CHEM 221 to CHEM 220. Not only was the lecturer more understandable this semester, but the topics just made more sense as they began to have more real applications, especially to medicine. Certainly dont take it just for fun unless you hate yourself, but if its a required course for you, its not the worst.",
