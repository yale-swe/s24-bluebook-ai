                "Reading philosophical literature. Learning about the medical profession and how humanities is important to it. Learning about the way to think.",
                "I have a better sense of what life is like on the doctor's side and a basic understanding of several philosophical texts.",
                "I developed a deep appreciation for many works and the authors we read. Coming from a STEM-rich background, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the texts we read--I developed such an appreciation for the humanities and its connection to medicine, philosophy, and leading a meaningful life. I also learned a little bit about medicine.",
                "Learned more about what it means to actually be a doctor beyond just diagnosing. Learned about philosophy, which was difficult at first but enjoyable later.",
                "This course did an amazing job of preparing me for a career in medicine.  I learned so much about what it means to be a good doctor and a critical thinker.",
                "I learned how to participate in seminar discussions.",
                "I learned so much about the medical field and what it means to be a doctor in a world plagued by so much uncertainty.",
                "It is impossible to encapsulate in a few sentences what I developed in this course. I learned a lot about how to view medicine from a physician's perspective, which I had not known much about prior. I learned how to read and interpret philosophical texts and relate them to the sciences and medicine. I learned how every idea has many facets and perspectives from which we can discuss them, and I learned that experience is at the heart of truth. I developed my writing, especially in regard to narrative writing and supporting my own personal stories with concepts from our class material. Most of all, I learned that I should chase my passions as Dr. Morrison has done, as that seems to be key to living the content life we all desire.",
                "I learned how to view the medical field from a humanities perspective. Also, I loved expanding my knowledge in Russian literature and classic paintings.",
                "I learned new ways to view medicine and even the larger world. I read classical thinkers, modern practitioners, and so many various writers' works that connected the practice of medicine to that of humanity.",
                "Loved this course. Learned so much and have a new interest",
                "This course completely altered my outlook on the medical profession and the work that doctors do. One of the biggest takeaways for me was learning how huge of an influence the human experience, and exposure to both arts and humanities, is in the world of medicine -- and how absolutely crucial it is to engage in such humanistic study as part of one's preparation and training en route to becoming a physician. This class has taught me more about what treating a patient is about beyond the hard science -- the empathy that is required, the importance of observation and listening, the awareness of one's own biases and assumptions. Beyond the medical scope, this class has helped me reconsider many of my perspectives on daily life and my interactions with others. Our in-depth study of numerous philosophical views and biographical analysis of numerous writers offered me fresh angles from which to consider the ideas introduced within the course. Through class discussion and sharing opinions in an open-minded way during classtime, I was able to formulate and consider many new ideas about how to live as a human being, which I believe will stay with me for the rest of my life.",
                "Beyond learning about the true role of a medical professional, I gained a new perspective on life. I learned about what it takes to be happy and the essence of what makes us human.",
                "Engaging with a variety of bibliographical, medical, and philosophical texts that allowed me to gain new insights about the field of medicine. Exposure to historical scholars like Tolstoy, Wittgenstein, Dostoyevsky, etc. A fascinating interdisciplinary lenses to apply humanities and ethics to science and life overall. Definitely changed my perspective on what it means to be a doctor and what is involved in the profession.",
                "Usually in pre-med, you learn how to be a doctor, with biology and chemistry knowledge. But this course taught us what it means to be a doctor, such as what emotional troubles you will face, and how to become better at being empathetic towards a patient.\r\nThrough this course, we read stories and accounts of doctors who face moral dilemmas through medicine and who grapple with the question of bringing humanity to a science-driven field. In the second half of the course, we discussed philosophers and how their ideas apply to the field of medicine. Dr. Morrison taught us how to use the texts to question events in our everyday lives, and make decisions that make us empathetic to someone else's humanity."

            "comments": [
                "Dr. Morrison's passion for the course is infectious and it's so clear how much he loves teaching. We also went on several field trips and spoke with many accomplished authors/ experts which was fun. One major downside is the way that class discussions are facilitated. We are called on to speak one at a time which restricts the flow of conversation. If the class had a fishbowl/ Socratic seminar style we would be able to dissect the texts together more as a class. Also occasionally Dr. M's lectures would take up the majority of class time and not leave time for discussion.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Morrison is such a sweetheart, and he was without a doubt the best part of this course. He cultivated such a welcoming and caring environment, and he is truly a role model! The books we read were also great--some of the texts about philosophy are a little dry (I just don't enjoy philosophical texts all that much), but he made them engaging through his lectures. Dr. Morrison also does a great job of bringing in guest speakers and taking us to various places on campus (Beinecke, Art Gallery, British Art Museum, Botanical Gardens, etc.). so that we weren't stuck in the classroom all the time. Dr. Morrison's lectures were also closely tied to these events, so they never felt disconnected or disjointed. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Morrison's lectures sometimes ran a little long, leaving only fifteen minutes or so for discussion. It became hard to participate meaningfully with such a small amount of time left for the seminars. The lectures are fascinating, but they are sometimes a little too long. Additionally, I was a little disappointed by the quality of seminar discussion at times: the conversation became very cyclical and lacked deeper thought or investigation of the texts.",
                "Strengths: Engaging discussions, interesting readings, exciting conversations with authors and experts, very kind professor\r\nWeaknesses: Clear feedback was not really provided for essays",
                "This course absolutely couldn't be improved.  It's fun, engaging, and you'll learn so much from taking it.  It's a perfect balance of medicine and philosophy that will keep you engaged and constantly teach you new things about the world.",
                "A weakness was that sometimes we didn't get to go over the readings we had completed for the class.\r\nA strength was that the readings were very interesting and I thought the course was on a topic that few courses have explored.",
                "Weaknesses: 1. There were no concrete prompts for the two papers. The lack of instruction made it hard to gage what Dr. Morrison expected. He made it seem as though the requirements are rather loose/open to interpretation as long as we get the general idea for the paper. However, he ended up marking off points for not including a specific writing style he never specified we needed. This happened to me as well as a few of my other classmates, which made the grading seem quite arbitrary. Also, the class structure was such that he lectured for 60-65 minutes out of the 75 minute class on writers of the readings, but I do not feel that the lectures added any value to my learning. This time would have been better spent in discussion. This long lecture also took away chances for participation, which definitely hurt many students since he still expected everyone to participate at least once each lecture if they wanted full participation points, but this was often not possible. \r\nStrength: The readings were genuinely fun/interesting and taught me a lot.",
                "Strengths: engaging, enlightening, diverse, thought-provoking, inspiring, well-organized, facilitates critical thinking and writing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
                "Strengths of this class include the diverse nature of experiences as discussions are not the only thing to partake in. The course introduces students to many different places, topics, and ideas and is interactive. The course could be improved by the addition of more trips/hands-on experiences rather than the same type of discussion for every class.",
                "Some strengths include the field trips we take as a class as well as the course material itself. The only weakness may be the quantity of readings assigned for each class because we don't get to go over all of them.",
                "This course was absolutely fantastic. It was thoroughly engaging, all-encompassing, and riveting. A strength of the course was its discussion-format; we were able to read passages independently, yet come together to discuss each class. The lectures were captivating and really set a foundation for our discussion. Hearing others' thoughts on how works connected to their lives and the art of medicine was very insightful.",
                "No weaknesses. I felt like in this course I was really exploring what yale has to offer.",
                "One major strength was the discussion element of this course -- Professor Morrison really helped facilitate a welcoming classroom setting where everyone could contribute and have their thoughts heard and appreciated. I personally am not the most outspoken or extroverted student, and even I found myself speaking and contributing to discussions more often than I had anticipated. \r\n\r\nAnother strength would be the flexibility with which we were able to approach the assignments in this course. Students had plenty of room to add their own sense of creativity and approach topics from their own unique perspectives, which I deeply appreciated. It made the class more enjoyable overall and helped us better appreciate one another's unique takes on different topics.",
                "Strengths: well-structured course, readings were interesting, grading wasnt too strict and allowed for creative freedom\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the lectures would be too quickly-paced and dense.",
                "I loved everything about this course from the trips to Yale Art Gallery, the British Museum, Marsh Botanical Garden, etc. to Dr. Morrison's gem of a personality to the relaxed class discussions. There are quite a lot of readings and topics covered during lecture. The workload is very reasonable and felt like an escape from my other courses. At times, it may feel overwhelming given the breadth of the information but mostly because it is all very interesting. The philosophical readings may be hard to understand and difficult to engage with due to the language and ideas. Lectures could be a just bit shorter and slower to give more time to process all the quotes and for class discussion. But it's all a small weakness in comparison to how thought-provoking and rewarding the course was.",
                "Strengths: Definitely one of the best courses I will ever take at Yale. Dr. Morrison truly loves the subject he's teaching and it's clear through his lectures and discussion leading. Learned the emotional toll doctors face, which is never usually talked about. Was introduced to a variety of philosophical ideas and found ways to apply these learnings to our lives. \r\nWeaknesses: Truly none, I loved this class so much."

                "Absolutely, this class was extremely useful to me as a pre-med student but all students (even non pre-med) agreed that this class was useful in learning about life in general. The field trips were very enjoyable and contributed to the grounded philosophical ideas presented in the class. Guest speakers of renowned authors helped form my view of the profession. An absolute must take for all pre-meds and heavily recommend for everyone else. A truly incredible class.",
                "Yes! Dr. Morrison is incredible and the class is informative and interesting without being overwhelming.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially those who are considering a career in medicine. Dr. Morrison practices in NY, and he makes an effort to connect the content from class to his own patients' stories--it's a great way to learn about the humanism of medicine. It also sheds light on the more difficult, nuanced questions pertaining to life as a physician: many students in the class, including myself, were able to more clearly answer the question of whether we wanted to be a doctor after taking this class. It's an easy workload (readings each week, two informal group speeches, two essays) with high reward.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in medicine or you want to decide if this is the field you want to go into, but don't assume it's an easy A.",
                "YES.  If you're considering this course, please please take it.  I promise you'll love it.  It's by far the best course I've taken.  Especially if you're premed, you'll come away with a new understanding of your future career and what it takes to be a good physician.  But even if you're not premed, you'll still love it and learn so much about the world.",
                "Yes, I would. I thought the topic was very interesting and we got to go on a lot of cool field trips.",
                "Yes, definitely. The readings were so interesting and honestly necessary for people so that they can gain a deeper insight into the medical field and how the uncertainty within in affects everyone, not just premeds and doctors.",
                "Yes absolutely. Whether they are sure about their future in medicine, unsure, or simply interested in the intersections of science and the humanities, I would definitively recommend this course. The readings were fascinating, our class discussions were interesting, Dr. Morrison's lectures were engaging and enlightening, and our field trips to various places such as the med school library and the botanical gardens were always a welcome interruption to daily monotony. Our assignments always felt meaningful and personal because we had the freedom to write about any topic we chose, and our presentations were engaging, fun to work on with classmates, and facilitated a lot of learning.",
                "I would recommend this course for a student who is interested in the course topic.",
                "Yes, and I have already recommended this class to many others. We learn so much more than just medicine, and the course was really enjoyable.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student, regardless of whether or not they are interested in the field of medicine as a career path. Not only did I learn a tremendous amount about the practice, but I learned even more about humanity as a whole. The interwoven nature of philosophy, narratives, and science that Dr. Morrison highlights is truly a refreshing take on a time-honored practice. I will never look at the field of heath-care in same way, and that is definitely for the better. The knowledge and lessons learned from the seminar will be some that I will carry with me forever.",
                "Yes, this class was amazing! You will learn so much valuable information even if you aren't premed.",
                "Yes definitely. Super thought provoking",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is one of the most life-changing courses I have taken at Yale and I have learned many lessons from it that will stay with me for the rest of my life, regardless of whether I enter the medical profession.",
                "Definitely, yes.",
                "Absolutely!! Although I am interested in science, I am not a pre-med student. Regardless you learn so much and form a new perspective on the field of medicine. The readings are enjoyable and engaging. Class discussions are interesting. Guest lectures, frequent field trips, and Dr. Morrison's overflowing passion make the class that much more valuable and priceless. It's an amazing opportunity if you get the chance to take the course.",
                "YES! Dr. Morrison is a wonderful professor who truly knows so much about various doctors, literature, and philosophers. We were able to talk to many of the authors from texts we discussed in class. This would be great for anyone out there; you learn a lot about empathy and what it means to be human in a very sciencey world. Also Dr. Morrison finds great ways to get out of the classroom and do fun things, such as visiting the Botanical Gardens or the Center for British Art."
