                "In this course, I reinforced and sharpened my verbal Italian skills, both written and oral, while thoroughly reviewing grammar concepts from previous semesters. More specifically, we worked through the first 7 Lessons\/Units of the Immagina textbook, which reviewed present tense, reflexive and reciprocal verbs, pronouns, adjectives, passato prossimo, imperfetto, passato remoto, trapassato, imperative, partitives, adverbs, conditional tense, ad subjunctive mood. While all these topics were covered in earlier levels, Immagina covered them slightly more in depth compared to the previous textbooks, with more advanced readings and videos included as well. Therefore, grammatically this course served as a good review and sharpening, rather than a source of many new topics\/learnings. This course also furthered my language skills through some outside readings, namely an excerpt from Dantes Divina Commedia and two films: Songe Napule and Pane e Tulipani. Finally, by creating small recorded videos on my hobbies and a famous Italian artist and via in-class discussions, I increased my comfort with speaking clearly and professionally in Italian.",

                "Strengths: speak in Italian for the entire course so it helps you develop problem-solving skills when you don't know a word or conjugation; no weaknesses",

                "Strengths- Deborah is great, and the movies were entertaining \r\nWeakness- the readings (letteratura) are BORING and generally hard to follow",
                "It is an enjoyable class to attend everyday and the workload was manageable.",
                "Strengths: the small size made it easier to talk in class and participate, we used breakout rooms which were great to practice with other students, we watched movies, read stories, great professor\r\n\r\nWeakness: none, overall a well structured language course",
                "The course was easy to be engaged with several breakout rooms and opportunities for discussion. The class was structured well and reviewed the majority of Italian needed to feel comfortable with the language.",
                "The greatest strengths of the course were the outstanding instruction and class atmosphere, as well as the daily seminars themselves. This was my third semester with Deborah, and other students\/professors are always impressed by how much weve learned from her. She is demanding while also being understanding and reasonable, and her classes are very engaging overall. As a result, the daily classes were fun rather than tedious, and we were able to have quite lively discussions (for a morning Zoom class at least :). The main weaknesses of the course were the somewhat repetitive nature compared to previous levels and the lack of unstructured time for discussion. Almost all the technical grammar from this semester we had already learned, yet we still spent the great majority of our time on it in terms of homework, exams, etc. Class was almost always more fun and worthwhile when we had more open-ended discussion, though it was sometimes quiet\/awkward; however, I think wed get more comfortable with it if we practiced more. In fact, the other main strength of the class was the instruction from outside the book, whether it was the weekly essays, which were fun and greatly increased my writing skills, or the two films, which led to more lively discussions. Similarly, I think doing more outside readings, like the Divine Comedy this semester or The Decameron last semester (or even more films) would greatly increase learning and engagement. We were much more adept at the Italian language, so we could definitely treat the course in a bit more of an advanced way.",
                "I love the teaching format. the exercises we do and stories we read are entertaining as well as help us learn. I also did like the exam format, especially with online classes. there were a lot of exams, but it made the course easier to manage."

                "In terms of virtual learning, the best practice of this course was honestly running it as close to normal. We still had synchronous daily classes, which kept me very engaged in the course, and the structure of homeworks, exams, etc. were also similar to in-person semesters. I think the synchronous format of exams worked well, though there were often some technological struggles so giving a bit of extra time was always a good decision. There are no major sources of improvement, but it would have been nice to do presentations live in class or at least watch our VoiceThread presentations together. Those always felt a bit disconnected and lost in the ether. Similarly, I know we had some kind of live YUAG presentation planned, which would have been more engaging than just making a video independently on it.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to further solidify their basic understanding of Italian in a fun and manageable class setting. It follows a very similar structure to previous levels of Italian, with daily classes and a focus on grammar. However, there is also a decent focus on Italian culture, with occasional outside readings and films as well. I would not necessarily recommend this course to someone with an advanced background looking for an early advanced class focused on literature, as we only read occasional short stories and stuck mostly to the book. Nevertheless, I think anyone would get something out of the intensive grammar review, regardless of Italian background. And for someone looking to shore up their technical knowledge before moving to advanced classes, it is perfect. Most of all, this class is just a fun way to satisfy the language requirement and learn more about an amazing language and culture!",
