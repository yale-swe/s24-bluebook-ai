                "I learned how economists model human behavior, and then I learned how/why these models are imperfect.",
                "A familiarity with the foundations of rational choice theory, as well as the critiques against it. I feel more able to discuss choice theory, probability, economic models, philosophy of science, behavioral economics.",
                "I learned about choice theory, economics, and scientific philosophy.",
                "Not much really. This course was honestly a chaotic amalgamation of basic concepts of choice theory without rigorous definition and a bunch of behavioral economics content taught unsystematically so that you don't really learn. I took behavioral economics before taking this class and didn't really learn anything here.",
                "I gained insight not only into choice theory as a decision-making model from an economic perspective, but I also learned the intros of philosophy of science and how to evaluate paradigms.",

            "comments": [
                "Because rational choice can answer so few questions concretely, often it feels like we end class with more questions than we started with, and no answers. This can be disappointing. While we do walk away with more understanding, framing some conclusions as more absoluteeven if they're about how we approach or answer these questions, even if we don't know the answerwould improve the quality of the course.",
                "I really loved this course, and it taught a lot of the tools needed to ask some deep questions about choice theory and modeling human behavior. I did think, though, that the part of the class where we learned the \"tools\" went fast, and there were some mathematically/conceptually difficult topics we didn't spend much time on.",
                "Strengths: This course gives a lot of freedom in molding the midterm and final assignments to your interests, allowing students from various backgrounds to explore the areas that align with their goals and academic interests.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The flow of the course seemed a bit clunky at times, with certain lectures never being referenced after their day. Because of the breadth of topics explored, the course did seem a bit surface-level at times, though the readings provided great jumping off points for further independent research. However, I did not take away many insights from class outside of few discussions that we had surrounding my area of interest.",
                "Though I really enjoyed the material, I felt as though the second half of the course (aimed at discussing the RCT critics) was not sufficiently thorough. I dont feel as though we evaluated the arguments, so much as we simply discussed the existence of heuristics and biases. \r\nI think the class would be improved, and more coherent, if we spent a little less time on intro to philosophy of science, and a little more time engaging deeply with the criticisms of RCT.\r\nLast, I think the student experience would be improved if there was a math pre-req  or more support resources. To someone with no math credits at Yale, who has only completed the intro Econ sequence, some of the psets involved a kind of problem solving that I felt unprepared for. I did not always feel able to fully understand the math discussed in lecture.\r\nIm not sure whether this is the case for others, but I also mightve gotten even more from the class if the reading requirements were smaller (fewer total pages), but more emphasized in class.",
                "Strengths: I think that both instructors were very different but effective in their own ways. The course was very casual and I felt like it was a relaxing environment to just be curious and learn. Overall, I loved this class.",
                "Strengths: when you ask the professors after class, they are very knowledgeable, patient, and informative.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: when they teach together in class, it is chaotic and hypnotic.",
                "I think a strength of this course is that it incorporates qualitative and quantitative assessments (p-sets and essays), and the essays can be about something you are interested in. A weakness I found was that, despite it being a seminar, many of the classes were just lectures which were sometimes unengaging."

                "I would recommend this course to any student who is looking to further explore their interests in any field related to choice theory (economics, policy, cognitive science, behavioral economics, philosophy, etc.). The midterm paper allowed me to explore an idea I had for my cognitive science thesis and to get feedback on study design, which will be incredibly helpful in my pursuit of my thesis this fall.",
                "Yes, I think this a great low stress environment to think critically about choice theory and how descriptive it is of real human behavior. If youre interested in the topic this is a great course for it.",
                "No. It is designed poorly. I think it would be a better course if it were taught by either one of the two professors alone.",
                "Yes, assuming you have a prior interest in the material. Professor Samuelson and Professor Samuelson are passionate about the material and will go out of their way to help students understand the material and to develop their own ideas.",
                "If you are interested in how people make choices, yes! I think having two professors makes the class more interesting, and you read some really interesting material.",
                "This course is fantastic for anyone interested in decision sciences. It is a much more humane philosophy centered way to study economics."
