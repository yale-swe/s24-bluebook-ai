    "I furthered my mathematical knowledge and developed my problems solving skills in this course.",
    "I gained a good understanding of Calculus 2, and was able to feel reasonably confident in my ability to progress to Calculus 3.",
    "Some Calculus",
    "I developed a more thorough understanding of how to approach mathematics, specifically, calculus II, with a more systematic approach than what I was previously taught. I learned the many applications of what we studied and, quite frankly, obtained a newfound excitement for the field of mathematics as a whole.",
    "I think I gained a good overview of calculus.",
    "Integrals and series.",
    "Calculus as well as techniques to search for methods by myself",
    "I learned most of the concepts from this class in high school, but I didn't understand series which this class did a good job of explaining.",
    "I learned Calculus",
    "I was able to review what I had learned in Calculus BC in high school along with some topics that I didnt learn yet.",
    "I developed knowledge of mathematical concepts I had not yet covered, skills in mathematics that will be useful in future courses, and a new understanding of math as a whole. I also learned new and interesting ways to tackle problems I had been presented before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The teaching staff in this course isn't really the best. Some of the teachers are very good people with lackluster teaching abilities, but it also partially depends on your learning needs. My professor, for example, was somewhat chaotic and hard to follow. I could understand his teaching, so it did not both me as much, but many of my classmates were lost because he was all over the place.",
    "A stronger emphasis on the practical applications of the subject material would help make the class more engaging.",
    "The course itself is fine however, I feel that my teacher was not engaging and organized and thus left a lot to be desired. I often had to self study concepts and found that to be more useful. More practice problems could be done. However, the practice tests that are supplied are very good for learning.",
    "Strengths: would be an easy transition-to-college class if youd taken BC Calculus in high school\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very very difficult class if you didnt take BC Calculus in high school, difficult to find course materials\/peer tutoring\/office hours in the beginning, because its never explained, just kind of hidden on Canvas",
    "Overall, it is strong in that it has problem sets due every week to make sure you keep up and understand the material. However, the lectures are sometimes relatively unstructured and it can feel difficult to keep track of everything.",
    "It was hard to get feedback when psets took weeks to be graded.",
    "I think this course was chaotic and disorganized. I felt that going to class confused me more than not going. I ended up learning better on my own from the textbook.",
    "I had no idea what was going on in classI feel like the actual class time was a waste of time, at least in my section. I wish we had gone over more practice problems in class instead of examples that were meant to show the concepts but were just really confusing.",
    "I felt as if I didnt learn much during class.",
    "the pre learning thing really made no sense. Also the textbook isn't very good and doesn't really line up with the way the course is taught so one of the two needs to change.",
    "It is very complete but maybe the integral part of the course takes too long. I liked the daily quizzes.",
    "I feel like the instructors should be on more of a level playing field. Even before I took the class, I heard from upperclassmen that my grade and understanding of the content is highly dependent on which instructor I got which I found to be true based on what I heard from people in other sections.",
    "The course package was the most helpful to facilitate learning.",
    "No weaknesses, The class was very well organized and presented.",
    "I felt that the lectures were a bit boring, and some points were unclear.",
    "This course's strengths are its smaller class sizes and use of \"Explores\" to introduce information prior to learning it in class. I found the explores to be very helpful; they gave me more confidence to participate in the classroom. Sometimes the explores were a bit confusing, however, and in those cases I felt class to be difficult. I think they should focus more on visual representations and the logic behind the material rather than going through the exact proofs that will be re-done in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but with another instructor.",
    "Absolutely not- I only took this class because it was necessary for my major, and while I really liked my professor, I absolutely hated the class. If you didnt take BC Calculus in high school, you will be at a severe disadvantage in this course and its nearly impossible to keep up. I worked relentlessly in this class and it wasnt until the very end of the class that I even remotely appeared to be performing at the same level as my peers, no matter how hard I worked.",
    "Yes, as it will adequately prepare you for higher levels of math and courses that require it.",
    "If you need it for your major",
    "I think that the actual content is very interesting. I really like math! But this course made me dislike math. I discouraged others who were considering taking this course.",
    "Only if they needed it for their major requirements",
    "I would definitely recommend although just be careful the professor you take as this can make or break your experience throughout the semester and, quite frankly, math in general.",
    "If you need it for your major and have a solid foundation in Calc I, then yes.  Otherwise I wouldnt recommend.",
    "no, but its a pre-requisite for a lot of majors so people have to take it",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to calculus and mathematical method in general.",
    "Yes, I feel like I have a good understanding of most of the content covered in this class.",
    "Yes! Great for learning calculus",
    "I only recommend this course to students who want to pursue higher math rather than those who just need math credit."
