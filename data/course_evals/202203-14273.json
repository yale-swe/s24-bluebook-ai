Close reading, revision, and creative exercises culminated the experience while initiating a constant state of artistic engagement. I feel much more confident in my writing skills after this class.",
                "I learned a lot about writing and how to write at a college level. I loved the topic of the class and the freedom we had with our writing assignments.",

I learned the usefulness of outlining and reverse outlining to give my thoughts structure and organization. By constantly submitting drafts, having one-on-one conferences with my professor about my writing, and listening to the questions she'd ask me, I learned how to push my topics beyond my original ideas like I had done in the past. I was used to having a good idea, writing it out, and submitting for a grade. However, this class taught me how much better my writing can be when I move beyond my original idea, write, scrap, rewrite, and change my mind before getting a final result that is more profound, clear, and developed.",

There were no assignments that felt out of context or unexpected. The class understood the timeline of assignments and was able to accomplish most projects in a timely manner due to successful planning by Dr. Morse. \r\n\r\nThere were no weaknesses in the course that I could tell. It was a fantastic experience.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- Dr. Morse is an exceptional instructor, listener, and friend to students. She made classes a joy to attend and essays a pleasure to write.\r\n- The course is simultaneously rigorous and enjoyable. Whether by reading Where the Wild Things Are or by writing our own podcast essays, I felt enthusiastic to participate fully in the course.\r\n- The small class size facilitated intimate discussions.\r\n- There were ample opportunities to schedule one-on-one meetings with Dr. Morse for proofreading and advice. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I felt there was not enough time between the due date of one essay and the start date of the next. I think dedicating more time to review the essays we submitted would have been helpful for learning how we can improve.",

Had there not been as much questioning and discussion as there was in my group, I could see actual class time being less valuable.",
                "The course was structured so that every student improved from their baseline starting point. Good grades depended on participation however, which may have been a weakness for students not willing to participate."

I would especially recommend this course to first-year students and anyone looking to strengthen their writing skills and for a fun and exciting way to earn Wrs. Each of the readings and assignments is creatively driven and seeks to improve the writers voice. Students have a lot of input as to what the topics for their papers will be, and they will have the opportunity re-write, revise, and improve their pieces along the way through the drafting process.",

The workload was manageable. The professor was very encouraging and supportive. The feedback on papers was clear and detailed and I felt the grading was fair. The last 'paper' was more of creative project which I really enjoyed.",
                "TAKE IT! 114 has made me a more effective, intentional writer. Comparing my high school essays with those I've written in 114, I can clearly see how my communicative skills have developed. Whether you're majoring in English or simply completing the writing portion of the distributional requirement, you will love this class.",
                "Yes, this was a great introduction to writing at Yale and the other students at Yale and the professor was very supportive.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to other students. I thought that I had a solid base-level writing skillset, but this class developed my fundamental skills in ways I didn't realize I needed. The course structure was easy to follow, I got to collaborate with peers of similar writing levels, and my professor was particularly helpful in guiding me along the process of each paper.",
                "Yes, if you want to be a better writer this is for sure the class to take."
