                "Strengths: The syllabus was very well crafted with fascinating readings that provided a great basis for discussion but were also just a pleasure to read; the course developed very naturally in terms of week-to-week progression and building on knowledge from previous weeks; class discussions were always lively and insightful; and the guest speakers Professor Shapiro brought in were all wonderful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: cannot think of a single one!",

                "Very interesting discussions and readings. I don't have much negative to say!",
                "Strengths: Professor Shapiro is very nice, personable, and knowledgable about the topic of the seminar. Hearing about his experiences definitely adds to the course, and in my experience, he was pretty accessible to meet with on Zoom outside of class. The readings are generally interesting as well, and the workload is pretty straightforward (participation, a brief reading response every week, midterm paper, final paper). There were also very cool guest speakersmostly journalists, but also one political campaign operativewho added their valuable perspectives to class from time to time and gave a chance for us to engage with the class material in a more \"interactive\" sort of way. Weaknesses: The final paper felt a little bit hard to approach because the focus was supposed to be on the 2020 Democratic primary, which wasn't discussed nearly as much in class or in the readings as were the dynamics from 2016 or the 2020 general election. I understand the idea of applying our knowledge to something that we hadn't discussed at length, but it was kind of hard to rely on memory to choose and pursue a topic.",
