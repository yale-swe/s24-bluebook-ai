I learned that sometimes your idea may change over time and evolve into something new; the important thing is to keep making work and exploring your ideas. Not every idea you have is a good one, but keep having ideas. Keep pushing yourself to create more."

                "I really enjoyed the amount of looking at other work that we did in this class. Whether it be the visiting artist lectures for the MFA program or going to shows at Art Space or the YUAG or YCBA it really expanded the way I was thinking about different projects and methods of accomplishing a project-based goal. I do wish there was a little more accountability-holding for making work or more check-ins\/contact sheet editing throughout to be encourage more consistent work-making."

Lisa is a gift! Natalie was also the best TA Ive ever had at Yale! If the Art Department is looking to hire someone, hire Natalie!",
                "If you want to have fun, look forward to class, and grow as an artist, you need to take this course!",
                "Yes, it was a great way to get involved with the School of Art and the photography community at Yale",
                "Yes!! Lisa and Natalie (this semester's TA) were the absolute best. Watching your idea and the ideas of your classmates flourish and change over the course of the semester is something I wasn't able to experience in other photo classes, as this one is particularly project oriented. Throughout the classes, you'll hear guest lectures from photographers and artists of other mediums, as well as do creative assignments such as 'respond to a found photo.' Make sure you make use of the time you have with your teacher and TA, as any opportunity to talk to them is an opportunity to gain a new insight on something. Regardless of how this course is structured, you should take it! It's a great experience and I would definitely do it again if given the opportunity."
