I was familiar with a couple of the authors we read before taking this course, but my understanding behind their writings and the context of their writings has grown significantly. I also now understand how the history of Latin America and each nation within it is intertwined with the progression and the development of Latin American literature.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, by taking this course, I feel like my ability to read, write, speak, and understand Spanish has greatly increased.",

                "Strengths: professor's vast knowledge and willingness for discussion.\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of discussion",
                "One strength of this course is that the breadth of the literature we cover in this class is amazing. We start in the early 1800s with authors like Jos Mara Heredia and Gerturdis Gmez de Avellaneda, and work our way through the literary history to contemporary authors like Fernando Vallejo and Roberto Bolao. In between is a beautiful assortment of poems, essays, excerpts of books, short stories and more that are some of the crown jewels of Latin American literature. Overall, I found this course to be amazing.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that the discussions in class were not recorded, which would have been helpful for going back and reviewing the information we covered. Additionally, the professor delivered his lectures orally without slides to supplement them. I think that it would be helpful in the future to have slides with the most important points of the lecture as a guide for the discussion.\r\n\r\n Other than those two points above, it was a great class.",
                "A strength was the professor's connection to a fair bit of the authors we studied - he did know them in person, so this added to the points he made.",

This was easily done with zoom lectures.\r\n\r\nOne improvement could be having break out rooms to stimulate discussions between the students. I found this semester that break out rooms really energized me during online school. Another small improvement would be to record and upload the lectures to Canvas so that the students could go back and rewatch them if they needed."
