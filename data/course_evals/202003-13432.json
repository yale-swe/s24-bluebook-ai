The mystery behind many concepts was demystified, and the balanced combination of class lectures\/discussions on theory with ample hands-on learning and projects vastly accelerated my learning.",
                "My main takeaway from this course was a new way to listen to music: after taking this course, I returned to some of the electronic music I listened to back in middle school (Monstercat, deadmau5, etc...) and gained a much greater appreciation for the work of these artists. Being able to pick apart the different tracks that go into a song feels almost like a superpower (to me at least). Since most of music production is your creativity and tinkering, there's certainly only so much that this course can propell your soundcloud career, but this course does a well job of explaining ubiquitous concepts used in almost all music production (e.g common filters and plugins, envelope science, microphone science, etc...)",

                "Firstly that it was fun. It was fun because all the challenges and materials were presented clearly, with tangible\/realistic goals and an emphasis on hands-on learning. This meant that I felt confident trying new things and challenging myself in nearly everything we did. An exception to that was I definitely hit some walls during the supercollider collab pset (making synth defs), and in retrospect wish I'd asked for more help during office hours. I loved the close-listening we did early on that got us to think more objectively and more like producers about sound, and wish we'd had one more round of that later in the semester analyzing a completed song using our new vocabulary about EQ\/compression\/etc (even though we did already practice mixing a song together in class, which was good).",
                "Strengths: class community (everyone is passionate about electronic music), and the professor is happy to answer questions after class. The Psets are not too much work, yet one is still able to gain relevant knowledge from their completion. My favorite part were the musical composition projects, because you could essentially let your mind roam free\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think I would have enjoyed it more if the class modules were reversed between SuperCollider and Waveform. Supercollider teaches the basic coding science between computer music, while Waveform was a more user-friendly interface that seemed to be meant for more serious music mixing. It would been nice if the SuperCollider module came first, and then we learned to use waveform.",
                "Prof. Petersen is an absolute pleasure and his passion shows in his teaching. He is consistently engaged with what is a really packed syllabus. However, the breadth of concepts covered could be something of a double-edged sword; it felt, at times, like we were moving a bit too fast to accommodate the sheer number of topics and concepts in the course.",
                "Very strong and engaging professor with great projects, could work on more engaging lectures and activities",
                "This course was great, it was difficult online but we learned a lot",
                "This course has a great design and I loved the way it was split up into electronic music history\/technology, production, and sound synthesis. Each was a great topic. However I felt that the lectures were a bit disconnected from the assignments. I believe different homeworks could have been assigned that were more closely related to the lectures.",
                "A strength of this course is that you can really let your creativity run wild. Assignments are pretty open-ended and leave a lot of room for individuality. Another strength is the project format of the course -- there are no quizzes\/tests, just projects, which I thought was a good format for this type of course.\r\nOne weakness would probably be the readings that are assigned -- some of them are really dense, and a few didn't seem to have obvious applications to what we had been talking about in class.",
                "It was a big change moving this class to a virtual one, so I am sure that there exists a better experience for this class. Speaking from my Zoom experience, though, I feel that it was still able to retain the core purpose of the class and my classmates and I were still able to produce substantial work.\r\nIt could be improved a little with its pacing and a more concrete outline of what the class covers, as I felt like each class came as a surprise, a pleasant one at that.",
                "Collaborative learning in this course was exceptional. We had to document our experiences with our creative projects and share blogs with the class. CPSC 035 does a phenomenal job paving the way for learning from peers, which I definitely did. We were lucky enough to receive Arduino kits as early Christmas gifts to fiddle with. I wish we got to invest more time on that physical computing unit, and Prof. Petersen mentioned he planned to focus more on Arduino next time.",
                "This course is excellent. A wide breadth of topics are covered with enough depth to feel substantive, but without feeling slow \/ tedious. Material is interesting, and engaging. Assignments are creative, fun, and challengingno busy work or extraneous assignments are present. Clear teaching & effective use of class materials, even in a compromised format."

                "Class lectures and discussions, demos, hands-on learning during class all went remarkably well, given the situation, thanks to all the extra preparation the professor put into it.\r\n\r\nWorking on a partner for one of the SuperCollider psets was a surprisingly fun experience and a good way to meet get to know a classmate better during the pandemic. One idea I just had would be to pair people, at least early on in the semester, for peer critiques of each other's work before the deadline, which might strengthen the social cohesion of the class given Zoom limitations. I also would have been interested to be encouraged, maybe even forced, to collaborate earlier on. I didn't choose to collaborate with someone on the final project, even though I had that option, but I definitely would have taken the opportunity early in the semester on a project earlier (maybe not on a huge Waveform project that requires deeply focused attention\/individual work\/time, but maybe something smaller?).",

My one criticism is that when the professor shared his camera so that we could mics, the electronics kit, etc., it could sometimes be very choppy\/grainy (not sure if this was on my side or his camera) and difficult to see -- I would recommend supplementing these live demos with clearer pictures posted in a Canvas announcement or something similar.",
                "The adjustments were adequate and we were assured that taking the class is still worth it despite its modified state. Supplemental resources were provided and easily accessible.",
                "Despite being online, CPSC\/MUSI 035 was a great course for me to get my hands dirty, a nice change from watching the large lectures for other classes. Assignments required fun creative thinking to compose electronic tracks. During class we would work alongside Prof. Petersen's screen-share demos of software. The course does well in \"learning by doing\". Due to the virtual setting, teaching material got rather rushed by the end of the semester. Pacing of teaching material is an element that definitely requires improvement.",
                "Professor Petersen by far made the best use of technology for online teaching I've seen. Obviously not being in the music lab was a loss, but he made up for it very well with vivid media presentations and making sure to share files. Having all the files *before* each class would have been very helpful so students could have them open themselves (pdfs of slides, .scd files). Sometimes the ipad whiteboard was messy \/ hard to follow, though this was infrequent and it was overall a helpful tool."

You learn endless tools and techniques but it's always in service of creative goals like creating cool beats that you can dance to or making a song based on live input to a temperature sensor. If you have any motivation\/interest in music and tech, you will learn so much, do lots of hand-on work, and get lots of feedback.",

                "Yes! Especially if it is able to return to its in-person counterpart. The class was very enjoyable. I particularly liked seeing what other students had created through their blog posts and getting inspiration from them. It also gave us a lot of creative freedom, allowing us to explore different areas of music.",
                "Absolutely. I am interested in the cross of art with STEM. Prof. Petersen's course is a great start for learning the intersection of music and computer science. Having no previous programming experience, I will give a warning that CPSC\/MUSI 035 is not great as an introductory programming course. However, the class opened the door to my newfound love of computers that I learn about on my own. The course was the most outside my comfort zone, and because of that it became my favorite. Assignments took more time, all because I was so invested in my projects. While some assignments (SuperCollider\/programming for me) were tedious, all of them became incredibly rewarding upon completion.",
                "Absolutely without any hesitation. This is easily the coolest class I've ever taken. Now, I'll be sure to note my bias: I'm a (not particularly talented) musician and (experienced) programmer, so my interests fit this course very well. That being said, I'd highly recommend this seminar to any student with at least a small level of musical background (even basic understanding of chord progressions \/ melody writing is sufficient).\r\n\r\nThis class opens an entire world that I was largely unaware of beforehand. A huge breadth of material is covered, and each lecture always feels like something new and exciting. Assignments are challenging and will take timehowever time is given, usually 10 days each. They are creative & fun (ie write a song using a digital audio workstation), and never feel like busy work.\r\n\r\nStudents will learn the history of music and technology's close relationship, develop listening skills and vocabulary for digital production techniques, learn how to use professional music production software and apply concepts such as synthesis, recording, filtering & fx to write songs, and explore scripted music programming and basic circuitry control to produce live digital instruments."
