The Diaspora portion of the class was new and interesting but still a brief overview of all things.",

It tried to hit every aspect of Nigerian-ness possible without really doing Justice to any of them. Some of this content can be cut out. Even if someone has never heard of Nigeria before, they can learn about something like the food at a restaurant or dance at a party. Instead, we can focus class time on things like Biafra and other nuanced topics in Nigeria because there are a lot of them. The book Culture & Customs of Nigeria reads like an encyclopedia with little nuance or anything to really respond to. This class would benefit more from the articles and niche perspectives.",

However, it does not get into much depth and can often just feel like you're listening to a list of fun facts about Nigeria. For example, the Biafra war and its modern implications are not very well discussed, even though it is an important illustration of a major class theme (i.e., understanding the tensions that arise in a post-independence, ethnically-diverse African country).",
