                "Since this is a survey course, it felt like we were brushing over the topics sometimes rather than actually understanding the reasons behind the equations. This is expected since this wasn't a proof-based course. But it would be great to focus a bit more on the essential ideas behind the rules.",
                "strength: the information is very approachable \r\nweakness: sometimes it does go by very fast and the life science section did not have as much support as I think we needed",
                "The change in what we were learning between 100 and 101 felt very abrupt",
                "I think the course is taught well in terms of the umbrella part of the course and then the more focused life sciences section. The material was taught very quickly however and sometimes it would have been helpful to spend a little more time on concepts.",
                "strengths- good office hours, good feedback on HW\r\nweaknesses- slow grading (didnt have 2 pset s graded before the final exam)",
                "A bit of a jump when the course was split by subject in the second half. I don't feel that the course really benefitted from specializing in one topic, since the second half of the course was still general informations.",
                "Both Professors had great lectures, although Professor Reuning-Scherer goes very fast (which he owns up to at the beginning of the course) and I found myself struggling to keep up some of the time. I like the weekly psets and think they are a good way to assess comprehension.",
                "There was honestly too much material that was only briefly covered that left me very confused. The slides were also not helpful at all. The problem sets were not that difficult but it was hard to discern what answers were looked for. Overall, everything was very confusing in this class.",
                "Strengths - online lectures and office hours\r\nWeaknesses - feedback",
                "Strengths: well organized, helpful tfs, good lecturer \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Data camp",
                "Strengths: JDRS is very clear, the slides were organized, and there were lots of office hours. \r\nthe weakness was with Professor Jetz's section.. there was only one TF and there were not enough office hours. Professor Jetz was much less organized with the slides and material (there was a lot of talking but less info on the slides) which made it harder to review the information",
                "Strengths: there are a TON of resources for this class, especially the first half (the recorded lectures are really helpful and there are so many office hours). JDRS is the best lecturer I've had at Yale. Exams and psets were all fair and well-spaced throughout the semester. \r\nWeaknesses/improvements: I thought the second half of the course (S&DS 101) moved too slow in the beginning and too fast at the end. It would have been nice to have an Ed Discussion board or equivalent for 101 too.",
                "The first part of the course provided a broad overview of many statistics topics, but it was hard to contextualize them and understand their significance. I appreciate the exposure to many topics, but I am not sure how effective it is if you do not understand them, so I would recommend spending a little more time on the important topics and saving the minor ones for more advanced classes. On the other hand, the life sciences class was a deep dive into statistical analysis, and I enjoyed this format very much."

                "I would! I think that the most valuable portion of the course was the last five weeks in which I opted to focus on life science statistics methods and problems. I enjoyed learning R and thought that Professor Jetz was a brilliant lecturer and went at a pace that made the material fairly easy to digest and comprehend. I don't think I would recommend this course if not for that second, more focus component, as I already knew a good bit of the basic statistics information, but had never before experimented with R.",

To any student that is interested in research in any disciplines of Science, the content taught in this course is extremely useful for conducting research, and the inculcation of a statistical framework is also important to understanding literature in the field.",

                "Yes-- it's fun, not too hard, and I learned practical skills that I hope to use in my science in the near future.",
