                "I thought it was a very engaging course",
                "Well structured!",
                "I think this course is structured well. I liked that we had two papers rather than exams, and I enjoyed the Biology, the World, and You series.",

                "Strengths: great content and organized course",
                "The biggest strength is section. It's engaging and helps elucidate the topics we learned about in class.",
                "This course was a very good class. I liked how they incorporated different professors to teach different subjects that they excelled in. Each did a great job teaching the material and used polls and questions to keep students engaged. I couldn't really find any flaws in the course. Given the circumstances, I felt they did the best job possible.",
                "Depending on the professor and topic, lectures could be extremely boring and not engaging. The problem sets also varied in difficulty depending on the professor teaching the material.",
                "The psets varied too much by professor. Some psets had nothing to do with the lectures and you really had to look up the answers on google and hope you got it right. I didn't like how the TA's and professors did not change the structure or grading of the pset despite the fact that alot of us complained. This is a science class for non-stem majors but they graded us harshly like were stem students.",
                "Strengths: fits a lot of content into one semester! It really is a crash course on biology that's relevant to society. The topics covered are interesting, and I really liked the Biology, the world and You sessions which focused on topics we asked about.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The quality of lecturing was a little uneven between the many lectures. Prof Bamanyar is an excellent and engaging lecturer, but Professor Engelmans and Prof Paulsens lectures were a little bit too dense/information-dumpy for me as a nonscience major, and would contain a lot of detail that sometimes felt extraneous to understanding the biological processes being taught. Prof Bamanyar uses simplistic cartoons and comics to help clarify things and explain things in lay terms, which helps with conceptual understandings and makes things more accessible.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets are also very very specific, often requiring referring back to lectures (especially for Professor Paulsens lectures). Professor Yannicks lectures are straightforward enough that the problem sets should be answerable based on notes. I'm not sure how I would have managed the problem sets if I wasn't able to refer back to the recorded lectures!",
                "Strengths: the wide variety of topics! Everyone is bound to be interested in some of them\r\nAreas for improvements: Sometimes there was a level of biology knowledge assumed that was much higher than reality so it was hard to follow.",
                "Strengths: the material Weaknesses: too much at once... lengthy weekly problem sets on top of the lectures and section and 2 papers during the pandemic led to frustration and burn out during the semester.",
                "PSets often did not reflect what we learned in lecture and were graded way too harshly.",
                "Strengths: gave an wide overview of the different fields of biology \r\nWeaknesses: psets varied in difficulty based on the professors and some of them were very diifficult given that the students in the class are non-science majors",
                "I liked this course a lot",
                "I think that the weaknesses of this course stem mainly from the breadth it attempts to cover. I had a hard time engaging with the material when we moved on to a different broad scientific topic every week. Compounded with the changing professors and the focus in discussion section on superficial social and ethical concerns rather than going deeper into the science, it was difficult for me to further explore scientific thinking. This course might be better if it had explored only one or two of the topics, say the opioid epidemic or social issues and COVID or the politics of gene editing.",
                "A strength of the course was that it was engaging and the administrators made a real effort to have students interests represented. A weakness was that lectures were not required to be attended so it was somewhat easy to not participate.",
                "As a non-STEM major, I found this course interesting and engaging. Overall, its strength is the variety of teaching staff, experiences, and topics covered. Its weaknesses were relatively minor in comparison.",

                "Strengths- Lots of social topic coverage in the sections; sections felt interesting and based on student input. Some bonus point opportunities. Bio and You sessions are fun.\r\nWeaknesses- Depending on TF, harsh grading. Psets are graded like tests, which means little points dropping from the grade frequently. Not great communication about paper expectations.",
                "The strengths of the course were the sections and the special sessions. A weakness of the course was the occasional inconsistency in pset format and difficulty; as well as sometimes a lack of clarity in pset questions",
                "strengths - interesting topics\r\nweakness - lectures were essentially unnecessary and students did not need to watch lectures to pass",

The course format gave us a wide breadth, and although we did do some original thinking in each week's pset, we didnt need to track the same themes the whole time. Was super engaging as a humanities person in science. \r\nThe grade structure and section is a definite plus-- extremely manageable as a 5th class.",
                "I only found strengths. I thought the sections were excellent.",

I found myself drowning in work with difficult classes and thought that this would be a nice introductory course to balance the workload out, but it was not the case. Combined with my other courses, it contributed to burnout.",
                "Yes because you learn a lot about different biological topics but this is not a gut and takes some time to complete assignments",
                "Yes, absolutely take this course if you want to have a better understanding of the natural world and the human body!",
                "Yes",
                "I don't think I would. There are so many better courses for non-science majors that engage more deeply and successfully with specific scientific topics. Not only was this course not a gut, but it also didn't facilitate student learning/engagement to the degree necessary to both succeed in and enjoy the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students because it is an interesting way to learn more about biology within a social context.",
                "yes",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other non-STEM majors looking for an interesting introduction to molecular biology.",
                "Only take this is you have to.",
                "Would recommend this source to non-STEM students who are willing to learn the biology behind relevant topics",
                "Would recommend to non-STEM majors looking for a science credit. There are probably easier classes to get that credit, but this class definitely teaches you a lot that will last with you. Problem sets can be graded harshly at times, so definitely discuss them with other students/teaching fellows before submitting.",
                "Not really. I think it was marketed as an intro bio course, but had expectations above one. If you have a strong science background youll be fine.",
                "Yes! If you want a fairly easy science class with no tests and interesting topics, this is it.",
                "yes, its important to learn about how your body works and this class take on very current topics/trends",
                "Yes, this course is relatively fair and provides great insight into biology.",
                "In general, this course would be a good option for non-STEM majors looking for science credits, but try to find a good discussion section and teaching fellow that works for you as they are not all the same experience by any means.",
                "Yes! This is a great course for those who are looking for a science credit.",
                "YES its a GREAT science class for non science students. It does ask you to actually pay attention to the material and to learn how to put together scientific sources, but it focuses on each week or two weeks having a single, contained theme rather than trying to have you retain info for the whole semester. The papers are super approachable and actually very good exercises in applying scientific literacy.",
                "Yes, it covers a lot and is very interesting.",
                "Absolutely. One of the few classes where you learn a ton, the workload is light, and its actually enjoyable."
