                "The course gives a good overview of what the different engineering disciplines offered are. I wouldnt say it gives too much concrete knowledge in any besides Electrical and maybe some Mechanical Engineering but it is helpful to understand what each looks like if youre still choosing your major. The end of the semester is spent on a large group project which develops project-based learning skills and is one of the best parts of the course.",
                "How to work as a team for the final engineering project. Also learnt useful skills for the first time like coding on arduino, processing, and laser cutting.",
                "I learned basic electronics, soldering, and arduino coding in this course. The first half of the course offered the basic skills needed to complete the project, during the second half of the course, in which many more skills and knowledge could be developed as necessary.",
                "I learned so much in this class about engineering. I came in without much knowledge (I already knew a little bit how to code but that was it), but I learned how to work with Arduino, CAD, laser cutters, solder, and more!",
                "I gained a lot of independence and became better at figuring things out and troubleshooting. My ability to design and model increased, and I was exposed to several arduino components.",

                "Strengths: the use of the ceid is very nice, since all the tools and resources were available to us. The professors were always available to help, and let us, for the most part, attempt to bring our ideas to life\r\nWeaknesses: Before the projects started, there was a long period of sitting in lecture and feeling like it was pointless. Some of the material was not relevant, and read as an info-session on what engineering departments are available at Yale. Also, all of the projects had clients affiliated to Yale, which took away some of the feeling that the stakes were high.",
                "I think the biggest strength of this course is the engineering skills it teaches students. I think that a weakness is the unrealistic time students are expected to work on the projects outside of class.",
                "The final project is a great experience and gives a good introduction into engineering and really working hard on a project. The intro lessons are good overviews but wont help much going into actual classes in the subjects.",
                "Strengths: You get to know your classmates really well as you work in teams, and the professors are also very hands on! Our final project building an LED panel was super cool and we got to go on a trip to West Campus",
                "This course assumes no prior knowledge which means that the first half can feel repetitive or slow. Another weakness is that you are not allowed to choose who you work with for your project or what you are working on. The support on the part of the faculty with completing the final project was superb.",
                "There are no weaknesses. A strength is that you get to work in a group on your final design project, which is really nice because you can each focus on a different aspect of the project but also collaborate with other members on it.",
                "Strengths: This is a project-based class first and foremost. If you want to work on something and get a hands-on experience, this class is perfect for you. The instructors are good at leading the groups in the right direction, and Larry especially becomes very involved in the final weeks, always making time to meet with group members.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not what I would call an Introduction to Engineering class. If you've never used a computer-aided design software, coded, or used arduino, then this is great, but if you have, then a lot of the teaching section of the class will be review. I didn't feel like we really \"explored\" different fields of engineering much, and having done a fair amount of coding and some modeling on computers in the past, I didn't learn very much. Working on the project taught me valuable skills and was very rewarding, but it can also be time-demanding.",
                "It was great. The part I disliked about this course was the heavy coding-oriented teaching and lessons during the semester."

                "Yes, working on an independent project is very valuable. Even non-STEM people should try out this course.",
                "I would recommend this course because I got to work with my hands inside the CEID, and it was a good contrast to have a project-based class alongside my exam\/essay-based classes. I would warn students that during the project phase, this class requires several hours a day spent in the CEID working on the prototypes.",
                "Yes, especially if youre not sure about engineering. Its an enjoyable course that isnt wildly stressful and the teachers really care.",
                "Yes! You learn so many useful skills, and in the final project you can really play to your strengths.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to gain basic engineering skills. Only take this course if you are willing to put in more than 10 hours a week during the second half of the course to work on your project.",
                "Yes! I highly recommend this course!",
                "Yes, especially if you want to decide if you want to be an engineering major! I came into the course thinking that I might want to major in engineering, but I did not know what type specifically, and this course helped me gain enough knowledge to decide upon a major and future career path.",
                "If you're looking for a hands-on, project-based class, then yes! If you've never coded, used a computer-aided design program, or used arduino, then yes! If you're looking for something else, then probably not. This class exposes students to these concepts and the project, and while group projects can often be stressful, this one is very rewarding. It is time consuming though!",
                "Yes, if you're interested in engineering but unsure of which course to head for, this is a course that'll allow you to touch all areas of engineering.",
                "If you're even minorly interested in engineering, take this course!!! I can't stress this enough, it's absolutely amazing!!!\r\nThe work is time-consuming but there is so much support, and it's such a great hands-on introduction to engineering. You get to work on the stuff you're interested in, try out new things and overall just develop these really important foundational skills for engineering but the best part is that it's fun! This is not a very theoretical class, and your final product at the end is just so satisfying. It's. definitely worth it!"
