    "Through this course, I learned the origins of social formation theory and its connections to the history of Third World liberation. I developed skills and reading philosophy and critical theory, and gained new understandings of the ways in which my subject identity has been established within the context of the social formation.",
    "I learned about the theory of the Third World Studies movement, and I was introduced to a lot of philosophical concepts I had only vague knowledge of.",
    "great introduction and understanding of seminal critical theory readings and anti-colonial epistemologies",
    "This course gave me the words to speak more confidently about social justice. The course used an interdisciplinary mixture of history, sociology, and a bunch of other studies I'm leaving out to build to social formation theory, which is a simple but profound concept that has really grounded the way I figure myself in the world. Knowledge is power!",
    "I learned how to think critically about power and institutions in the world and within my own experience. I read non-Western canonical authors.",
    "This course facilitated my understanding of power structures of the world through historical discourse and engagement in topics on nation, race, class, gender and sexuality. I was able to better comprehend the dense readings and understand the message authors were attempting to explain. I also feel I have a new perspective of the world and mentality of oppression and third world-ism as the liberation we deserve. I enjoyed this course so much!",
    "A broad understanding of power, exercised through the lenses of race, gender, sexuality, class, and nation. Compared to other courses under History, American Studies, African Studies, or ER&M, this course's scope is far broader and grapples with the study of the human condition rather a specific period or social context.",
    "The class covers several seminal texts key to Third World Studies, such as Freire, Fanon, Butler, etc. The class does a great job at accessing \"alternate\" ways of thinking often left out of mainstream academia.",
    "This class's main takeaway is to challenge the way we view power. We typically view power as a superior exerting power onto a subordinate. This course teaches you to understand power as ubiquitous and able to be located. With this understanding, you understand the different mechanisms through which power moves.",
    "This is the perfect class to engage with Third World thinkers on a survey level.",
    "I learned how to locate my subject self in the social formation and how to write about these topics in a way that is personally and historically grounded.",
    "I learned so much about the social formation and the way oppressive forces work within our society.",
    "Learned about the history of third world studies, ethnic studies, feminist and queer theory.",
    "was a really good survey course in terms of learning a little bit of everything regarding ethnic studies, gender and sexuality, class, nation etc etc",
    "I learned about the ways colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism work to create subjects and form power hierarchies. It also taught me about the ways that institutions have worked in my life to control and shape the person I am and the ways in which identities are constructed.",
    "Deeper understanding of imperialism and colonialism, the formations of race, gender and sexuality, and theorists who have written about these subjects.",
    "third world studies should be a necessary course for everyone to learn about histories of capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism throughout the world past and present.",
    "This is a solid introduction course to Third World Studies, i.e. Third World scholarship and theoryexactly what the title of the course promises.",
    "the historical background of the Third World Liberation movement",
    "it was a great introduction to third world studies.",
    "an extensive knowledge of social formation, postcolonial, and queer theory, as well as the origins and developments of Third World Studies as a field; through the final paper, students practice applying this theory to their own lives",
    "So much knowledge and insights on the history behind almost every aspect of my day-to-day life. Really great intro class to critical race theories in ER&M",
    "I developed critical thinking skills and since it's my first time taking this kind of class, I was exposed to fascinating readings and different perspectives on systems of oppression and the way that the world works.",
    "Prior to taking this class, I had limited exposure to theory or literature produced during the Third World movement, and limited knowledge of the context around this formation of study. This class was a wonderful introduction.",
    "Frameworks of imperialism and colonialism, history of third world studies, etc.",
    "AFAM 192: Third World Studies is a course that focuses on the theories and history of Third World Studies. During my time in the course, I learned how to dissect and locate myself within systems of power as influenced by capitalism and social relations.",
    "I learned about Okhiro's theory of social formation in extreme depth. I also learned various keywords used in discourse discussing the nature of society given that this was one of my first Yale courses that references discourse on the nature of society.",
    "This course focuses on critical theory and other topics common within ER&M. It includes history, marxist theory, social formation theory, feminist theory, queer theory, and others that I can't remember. While it was hard at first, the class taught me how to read and think about theory.",
    "This course taught me a lot about the many structures and systems that I benefit from, often at the expense of others, but do not notice on a daily basis. It also gave me insight into the centuries of oppression and struggle that many people faced around the world.",
    "I learned about the origins of the Third World Movement at San Francisco State College and how to apply the lens of third world studies to interpreting my own life.",
    "This course provides students with an overview of decolonial thought and theory, as well as a wide range of ideas produced by writers of the Global South.",
    "I learned how to think about the world differently and to constantly question what we sometimes accept as truths",
    "This course basically taught me to rethink my entire existence and recognize how I'm a cog in the capitalist machine, how I am interpolated as a subject through the categories of race, gender, sexuality, nation, etc.",
    "I learned a great deal about critical theory, critical ethnic studies, and systems of power. This class definitely was my first introduction to heavy critical theory readings and I got better at understanding them over the course of the class (sometimes by brute force).",
    "I gained language not just to describe phenomena I already recognized but didn't have a name for, but for phenomena I never recognized that exist all around me and phenomena I can now imagine that may not have been named before. I gained insight into many works and authors whose voices and ideas I've never heard but whose effects I see in society. I gained important questions, if not always answers.",
    "I learned how to read and speak in philosophical language. I learned a huge amount about the foundations of racial formation theory.",
    "fast and close reading skills necessary for this class! a lot of dense readings per week.",
    "We learned a lot about the history of world economics and the instruments of oppression established by these economic systems (specifically, capitalism). We also spent much of the class talking about how identities are constructed by subordination and dominance power struggles, which I think was very valuable.",
    "I was exposed to a lot of important readings and authors I would probably not otherwise have known much about. I also learned about different frameworks of analysis and different movements throughout history regarding Third World Studies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Okihiro's insights and anecdotal aspects of the lectures provided additional context that definitely contributed to my depth of understanding and engagement with the course. His mapping out of the social formation theory and the history of the discipline of Third World Studies were both incredibly interesting. That being said, I wish we could have spent more time hearing from him and his background as a theorists as we ended up doing Q&A in class for what felt like a little too long.",
    "This course did a good job introducing the broader concepts, but I wish it had gone more in-depth on any one of them. At times, I felt like we learned so much so as to provide a very broad structure about how to think of the world that when any particulars came up  whether historical or theoretical  they could quite easily deconstruct our surface understandings. The readings were very helpful, although quite dense as well. Lecture was always interesting, but I felt sometimes that lecture time was wasted, either based on student questions or on the professor's tangents (some of which were very interesting, although not relevant to the course making it, again, scattered).",
    "could receive more feedback from TFs throughout the semester, the absence of this kept me unaware of how I was performing the entire semester",
    "This course's primary strength was its values. As the name implies, we only read Third World scholars, lots of whom spoke out about oppression, so we had to face a ton of uncomfortable truths about the world's injustices. This course was unafraid to be honest and unafraid to care. We didn't avoid topics for fear of alienating people in the room who benefit from these power dynamics, which prevented this course from censoring itself. The one weakness I'll flag is that in giving most of his lectures extemporaneously and irregularly welcoming student participation during lecture, Prof. Okihiro sometimes made class hard to follow because it was hard to know what his main points were. I totally respect his resistance to pedagogical structure and norms, and I'm not suggesting he come in every day with a perfectly rehearsed slide deck, but when the information feels so urgent and important, I just wish he had a slightly more clear thesis or takeaway for each lecture.",
    "The course material, especially the readings, was really fantastic and educational. It changed the way I think about my place in the world and my own identity. I thought that the lectures were hit or miss - some were very well-thought out and clearly communicated, and others less so and confusing. I didn't enjoy having class participation during a lecture, I thought that that was not an effective way to communicate material to a large group of people.",
    "Some of the readings could have made more sense if they were connected to the lectures in lecture. Perhaps even mentioning their connection, but overall the lectures were great. I especially liked when Gary brought in a few speakers to the class for specific topics and always enjoyed how curious Gary was towards us.",
    "The course does a pretty good job of covering a lot of content extremely relevant to ER&M as well as other disciplines. While readings are very dense, the assignments themselves do not take up too much time. The final paper is also a great way for students to end the course on their own terms. However, the class is very theory dense and more time could be spent breaking down that theory. The class specifically relies on Marxist theory, knowledge of which is often presumed.",
    "The readings are the strongest part of this course. Lectures were eye-opening sometimes and a bit confusing other times. We had a guest lecture from Professor Chandan Reddy which was extremely well organized. It made me wonder if this class could benefit from inviting a few guest lecturers. Professor Okihiro is an extremely knowledgeable and articulate lecturer but at times he can go off on tangents.",
    "This class would be great if it were offered as a seminar. Multiple seminars at once. Discussion was hard in such a big lecture hall. The TAs were wonderful.",
    "The course was very loose. We were assigned weekly reading responses, and beyond that, there was not a lot to motivate students to engage with the texts (there are a lot).",
    "Strength--> the course material and the professor\r\nWeakness--> the organization of the material",
    "The lectures were delivered in a confusing\/hard to follow and preachy kind of way, and it was always a little unclear what I was supposed to know. As a STEM student, I often felt unwelcome in this course, as if my background was insufficient and I didn't know enough of the jargon or theory.",
    "lecture would work better as an hour and fifteen instead of an hour and fifty. it was just too long",
    "This course was very interesting and I loved the lectures! However, often at times very theoretical and abstract with concepts that were hard to grasp and the examples given did not always best illustrate the theoretical concepts. Very lengthy and dense reading material.",
    "The readings we were assigned were great, but there were A LOT of them, to the point where it was difficult to actually do all the readings each week. I wish there had been fewer of them so we could have really discussed each one. Professor Okihiro's lecturing style was not that conducive to taking notes (for me), and his lectures felt pretty disorganized. But the material was really interesting and made me think a lot about what's wrong with the world, internal prejudices, and how to build communities of resistance.",
    "the readings and discussions that this class generates are incredible, but the lectures are subpar. I love gary, but his lecture style did not work for me.",
    "I think the course should include more modern scholarship at some points. Specifically critical Black studies.",
    "Readings could cover a higher geographic area, more feminist and queer perspectives could be provided.",
    "the lectures could have been more compelling.",
    "strengths: Gary Okihiro is an incredibly charismatic and foundational scholar in the fields of Third World and ethnic studies. Teaching this class is truly one of his greatest passions. He does a wonderful job of pushing students to relate the theories we read to our everyday lives.\r\nweaknesses: I think that this class should have Intro ER&M or some other related class as recommended prerequisites or at least spend some time teaching students how to understand and interpret theory.",
    "Strengths: really enjoyable and thoughtful lectures, TFs are amazing, weekly assignments allowed us to keep up to date with the readings, the final paper serves well in terms of reflecting upon all of the things we learned about in class, content that we learned about touched upon a lot of different elements in our day to day language, from education to language, to eugenics, to tracing the origins of race and ethnicity\r\n\r\nRoom for improvement: guiding questions for the weekly readings would've been more helpful.. sometimes readings could get extremely dense and difficult to figure out what to get out of the readings.",
    "The readings in this course are brilliant, and essential for anyone who wants to gain awareness of the way social formation is structured to confer privilege and oppression. However, Professor Okihiro's treatment of the course material left much to be desired. As someone who wanted to gain a more nuanced understanding of the complicated societies we belong to, I was deeply disappointed by the minimal amount of thought that Professor Okihiro put into his lectures. Instead of discussing the complexities of the topics covered by the readings, he instead chose to ramble about tangentially related historical figures and movements, providing no more insight than what could be obtained through a ten-minute Google search. On multiple occasions, he ran out of things to say (which is a shame given that Third World Studies is a field that he founded himself) and dismissed the class half an hour early. The actual critical theory itself was grossly oversimplified, to the point where we felt forced to accept his ideas without learning enough about them to discuss or challenge them in a meaningful way. Considering how much of our time we spent discussing the hegemonic nature of society, it's ironic that this was the most intellectually hegemonic class I've taken so far at Yale. \r\n\r\nI should also mention that I found Professor Okihiro's behavior during class incredibly off-putting. Even though he proclaimed that he wanted to treat his students as his equals, his actual behavior was deeply antithetical to these ideals. When students asked him to apologize for quoting a racial slur in class, he spent the better half of his \"apology\" theorizing about the nature of words. When students mentioned that they felt like they had too much reading, he told them to deal with it instead of working with them to arrive at a solution. When students asked questions in class, he would cut them off and talk over them. Instead of wondering out loud why people weren't asking more questions, maybe he could have taken two seconds to think about how his own actions were preventing any meaningful dialogue from taking place. \r\n\r\nFor students who are not forced to take this course for their major, I would recommend looking over the syllabus and downloading the readings during shopping week to read on your own time. Please do not waste your time or your course credits on Professor Okihiro's lectures.",
    "I think that it was an amazing course. I thought that all the readings were really informative and though they were sometimes dense, they all contributed to my learning and allowed me to compare and contrast different perspectives. Professor Okihiro is a great lecturer and a really kind, thoughtful person.",
    "I think some of the lectures pertained less to the readings than I would have expected, but I found them to be valuable nonetheless.",
    "strengths- amazing material\r\nweaknesses- sometimes material was presented confusingly",
    "Fewer readings would have significantly impacted my actually absorbing the material and being able to draw my own conclusions.",
    "This course did well to introduce students to the topics and theories of Third World Studies while also challenging them to think critically through the lenses of various related studies, both through readings and written responses. However, this course was very fast-paced and was often confusing as it seemed to skim over very complex topics without further explanation or review.",
    "The lecture style was not that interesting to me. Listening to any professor speak for an hour and fifteen minutes was boring most days even if the content was relevant and interesting. Students were bond to zone out",
    "The class was a fantastic introduction to the ER&M department. It taught me how to think and learn through a critical lens in a way that also allowed me to rethink my own experience. That said, I think the structure of the class is antithetical to what the class teaches; however, I do not think this is because of how the instructor structures the curriculum but because of Yale's bureaucracy. I also wish that we could have spent more time on the later subjects such as queer and feminist theory.",
    "The course was organized well and provided a great overview of Third World Studies.",
    "Prof. Okihiro's lectures were very insightful and engaging. One weakness of the course would be a strong structure of assignments and communication\/organization between the Professor and TA's.",
    "While Professor Okihiro is well-intentioned, his lectures typically don't connect directly to the readings, and the readings are only discussed in section. Since sections are only 50 minutes a week, there was never enough time for us to get through the readings, which were often dense. Additionally, the different TAs taught and graded very differently, and so I feel like people had varied understandings of what they were supposed to get out of the class. Essentially, I think the course could be better organized but the material itself is incredibly interesting.",
    "This course had very great readings, amazing lectures, and the content was very helpful to understand decolonial theory to a greater extent than I had before. I loved the lecture on gender and the lecture on sexuality, and part of me wishes that this content had been more evenly distributed and integrated into the rest of the semester's lectures if I had to recommend an improvement.",
    "Professor Okihiro is great, and all of the TFs were very engaged. His style of teaching is more engaging than any other lecturer I've had",
    "Some of the readings were difficult to digest or were replaced by the TFs because they weren't as useful for understanding the material. I'd appreciate if maybe that was reflected through the actual structure of the course! TFs were amazing!!!!",
    "I thought that the readings were quite valuable but oftentimes difficult to read, being critical theory texts, so I wish there was more guidance on how to get through that kind of material. I also wish there was a greater focus on global liberation movements rather than just the US, but given the immense amount of content already present on the US alone, it makes sense that Okihiro focused in on just the United States for this course.",
    "Strengths- kind and passionate instructors at the forefront of their fields. Small sections and relatively small lecture foster an intimate environment. Interesting and broad-ranging readings as well as interesting and inclusive weekly themes. Guidance before the midterm. Lots of statements made at the beginning of the course are slowly elucidated as the course goes on. Weekly reflections and worksheets in section keep you involved and processing what you're learning; begin to make connections between themes in discussions in sections. The Professor does his good work, but the TF's deserve a lot of credit for the success of the course. They all truly believe and live what they are teaching.\r\nWeaknesses- the lecture often feels like a stream of consciousness; it can be hard to figure out what is significant to take notes on and what is not, and the infrequent opportunity for feedback makes for a steep learning curve. The readings can be very dense and difficult to understand, and they're not always clarified, because they're spoken about in the language that made them confusing to begin with. That being said, the professor is always looking for students to ask questions and would happily answer them. Also- the prompt for the final is wildly confusing; we really had to push a lot to understand what our papers should look like.",
    "I think this course could be seriously improved as a seminar, or a series of seminars like English 120. This way there'd be more direct engagement with lecture materials.",
    "I think this course would overwhelmingly benefit from a prerequisite in philosophy. Without a philosophical background I found it very challenging to understand the intervention that the course was making and the references on which the reading were based. Either that or this course needs to include some of the foundational writers like Marx and Locke in the early readings.",
    "strengths: professor is so kind and down to earth! \r\nweaknesses: i think this class assumes some sort of background information\/context about Third World Studies from each student. which the professor says is not the case in the beginning of the semester, but a lot of the times i felt like the lectures, readings, and discussions were a bit jargon-y.",
    "Strengths: GARY!! The content!! The way it makes you think about the world!! Weaknesses: The readings for each week can be very dense and it was sometimes challenging to get through all of them."

   "comments": [
    "If a student wanted to learn more about social formation theory or about the histories of Third World Liberation and Third World Studies, I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Okihiro is a legend in the field, and I think that learning from him is an incredible opportunity that students should take advantage of. That being said, at times the. course wasn't very well organized, and was thus hard to follow.",
    "It depends on the student. If the student is looking for concrete knowledge  specifically of the history of oppressed people  of Third World Studies, probably not. It is, of course, an introductory course, though, so if a student were looking to delve more into these philosophical topics, I would say this course is a good starting part.",
    "yes! if you are willing to do readings and devote enough time to understanding them!",
    "Yes! If you don't really care about social justice issues, this course is especially for you. If you are figuring out how to care and where you fit into this picture, this course is a great way to start to find answers to those questions. Even if you think you have the vocabulary and general understanding of the world to predict what this course will be about, I think it's still important to sit and engage with these concepts and their scholars.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for sure, especially for underclassmen who are just beginning their time at Yale. I would have liked to have taken this course earlier - it might have changed the kinds of classes I chose or assignments I thought out. It's also a good class to practice how to think critically and deconstruct. It's definitely a lot of reading, and I think the readings are worth doing. The midterm and final are both very manageable, and grading is very fair.",
    "YES!!!! It has taught me so much about the world and the power structures we live in. I did not understand capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, etc. until taking this course and understanding it from its origins. Everyone should have to take a course like this that explains the systems of oppression that hold marginalized communities hostage.",
    "Yes, for sure. It is a little intimidating and the vocabulary difficult, but in my view this points more so to the fact that the subject matter of the course is needed and yet unintegrated into our everyday life and not that it is inaccessible to the average undergrad. The course is a fantastic introduction to many related fields and grounds the student in a study of power that must always be critical of its subject and the scholar, and I feel any student who takes this course will come away consciously aligning themselves with the oppressed.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. This course allows you to encounter seminal texts within ethnic studies, Marxist theory, queer theory without the expectation that you have read these texts before. This course provides students with the opportunity to not only read this theory, but understand the historical context within which it is situated as well as applications to everyday society.",
    "I would recommend this course to every student, especially the ones that don't typically engage with this \"sort of thing.\" Think about race. Think about class. Think about gender. Think about sexuality. Think about nationality. These are all things we talk about all time, especially with an election coming up. Why not learn more about these things?\r\n\r\nThere is a quite a lot of challenging reading for this class. I would not recommend this class as a \"5th class\" or a Cr\/D\/F class. The strength of this course is in the readings you do and in the discussion of it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to others to gain an understanding of the history of discourse surrounding colonialism and imperialism as it is essential to everything. The class content is too good for Yale.",
    "YES! This course is so important for understanding yourself and the world around you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in learning about the histories of colonization and imperialism and their discursive foundations. If you are very dependent on a traditional class structure, this course may not be right for you.",
    "This was one of the most transformative courses in my life! Definitely worth taking despite all the readings!",
    "I had really high hopes for this class, but in retrospect I kind of regret taking it. The readings can be super dense and lengthy, and the lectures are often super hard to follow (a lot of theory lingo thrown around that I don't really understand, no powerpoint slides to reference). I never really felt like I knew what was going on - which definitely has something to do with this class being entirely outside of my (math) major, but I've taken other humanities classes and felt better about them. Also, the final paper asked you to write about yourself, which was weird and not really something I enjoyed.",
    "yes. lectures can be a bit hard to keep up with but okihiro is amazing and the readings are a bit much but ultimately all of them are must reads. the workload is fair, just two big assignments and weekly reading responses.",
    "Yes! The course was very engaging and thought-provoking.",
    "Yes, you should take this, even if it's just for the readings (which are really interesting) and to hear Professor Okihiro talk. Be aware that it's a lot of reading and that lecture can be dense and convoluted a times.",
    "i would recommend doing the readings, and taking the course is a great way to ensure that you do the readings, but the actual class is...only alright imo. i think you have to engage with the class a lot in order to get the most out of the class.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this class. There's a reason why it's viewed as a classic intro course for ER&M \/ American Studies students. Almost all the texts on the syllabus are foundational in their areas of study. And much of the syllabus is a must-read anyway if you want to understand the world as it truly operates. Third World Studies is a great introduction to thinking critically about topics like global capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, decolonization, so on. It also forces you to examine your own positionality within the structure. Theory matters!!! The TFs for the course are also brilliant and kindthey will enhance your learning experience with their own takes on the material.",
    "Yes, Professor Okihiro is very knowledgable and passionate about this course.",
    "yes, it is intriguing.",
    "Yes, definitely. Taking this class undoubtedly changed my understanding of my subject self in relation to the world around me. I gained a foundational understanding of radical and subversive texts I normally wouldn't from other courses at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would for anyone who's interested in exploring their positionality. But I think that this course doesn't meet expectations for some students because it's a lot more theory-based",
    "I think it's a really great course for someone who wants to learn about systems of oppression and has an open mind about having discussions about difficult topics. I learned so much from Professor Okihiro and also from my TF and other students. I thought it was the most mind opening course I've taken so far.",
    "Yes! Professor Okihiro is a wonderful professor and the course is well-structured and well-taught.",
    "Yes, because it decolonizes...everything.",
    "Yes, you will learn so much about the world and social formations and think about how they apply to your life. The readings are sometimes a lot but its so worth it.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, however, they must be committed to a large amount of weekly readings, written responses, and deep engagement with the course topics beyond the classroom setting. The work required by this course is well worth it, and promotes a tremendous amount of personal and intellectual growth.",
    "Third World Studies is a fantastic introduction to critical theory and other topics in ER&M. I would certainly recommend TWS, especially to those considering the ER&M major. One thing to consider is that the course content focuses heavily on theory, which was very unfamiliar to me.",
    "Yes, its necessary and it will change the way you view the world completely.",
    "I would. It provides a much needed basis for understanding one's current subject self that can be beneficial to a wide range of majors.",
    "Everyone should take this course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Okihiro's lectures are very different from other professors' lecturing styles and oftentimes he switched between personal narrative, Third World theory, and engaging\/expanding on students' ideas. I loved the reading materials for this course and would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "Please take this class! Its probably the most important class Ive taken at Yale and Professor Okihiro is amazing. The readings are super dense and every question\/conversation about this course only makes you more confused but its great.",
    "Definitely. I'm very glad I decided to take it",
    "100%! This course makes you rethink everything from your life to Yale as a corporation to international affairs! Super dedicated professor and TFs!!",
    "If you want to stretch your brain and be able to participate in and really understand important and wide-spread issues today, definitely take this. The sense I get is that whether or not you've taken other ER&M courses (I haven't), you will find the information and perspectives new and interesting. If you feel allegiance to a particular identity group, prepare to question the premises of your activism--the class begins and ends by deconstructing social formations.",
    "I think I would recommend this course, understanding that this much theory isn't as much my cup of tea, but that Professor Okihiro is a lovely human being and that the readings are very good!",
    "I would absolutely recommend the readings but probably not the course itself.",
    "I would!! The content is SO important and really changes how you think about the world and the history behind inequality, and identity construction. It is an inspiring class!! and Gary is awesome! Not many professors like him, and he is retiring soon, so you should take the opportunity of this class while you can!",
    "Yes, I would. It was an amazing course, and if I could take it again I would."
