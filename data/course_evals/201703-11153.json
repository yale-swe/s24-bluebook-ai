   "comments": [
    "I feel much more confident in my ability to engage in debate\/discours in French. My rhetorical vocabulary has grown immensely, and I am much more knowledgable on contemporary French issues.",
    "I developed a better spoken and written expression of french language",
    "I feel like I was able to greatly improve my speaking, reading and writing abilities in French as well as gain great insights into French society and culture",
    "Honed speaking and listening comprehension abilities while enriching my vocabulary pertaining to French life, politics, and culture",
    "Great course for improving written and oral French. Moreover, it provides fascinating insight into a culture that is more foreign to a typical American mind than one might think.",
    "This course was a really great way to learn more about contemporary France, with topics ranging from politics to the environment to education. It also really helps you practice your speaking skills!",
    "I learned how to analyze French culture articles in the context of current events and politics in France, and how to conversationally discuss in the French language with other students."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting readings, dynamic discussion topics, well-rounded curriculum, great professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We don't always discuss the readings in class; we often go on tangents.",
    "This course explored many topics of french culture and allowed me to develop a deeper understanding. It could be improved by going further in depth into the topics rather than just skimming the surface. Otherwise, more specific courses on elements of french culture would be appreciated.",
    "Three areas in which the course could be improved are:\r\n1) Reduce the number of students in each class so that there's more opportunity to practice one's spoken French \r\n2) Reduce the number of written tasks and put more homework emphasis on actually speaking the language. Perhaps by requiring students to go to French Tables as a form of homework\r\n3) Reduce the number of readings assigned for each class and make sure to touch on what's been assigned. Oftentimes we'd be assigned lots of reading that we'd end up just skimming, and we wouldn't even address most of it during class because there isn't enough time. I think it'd be more efficient if there were fewer readings and could really be focused on and explored during class",
    "Eases you out of using subtitles for movies - great method, stimulates listening comprehension by gradually removing the training wheels.  Interesting topics pertaining to modern real-world problems, making the course more than just a run-of-the-mill, \"learn for the sake of language\" course.  \r\n\r\nI do wish the timed essays were not a part of the testing structure, as it is more about memorization of vocabulary and speed of the creative process than actual usage and content of thought.  Oral testing, however, was much improved from my experiences in L3 and L4 style.",
    "It does a good job of forcing you to practice written and oral French. One weakness is that it sometimes feels like the readings are just busywork.",
    "This class was very good in terms of the culture and context it provided into current events in France and the language itself. I feel that it could have been improved by matching class discussions with readings more, as sometimes it did not feel like the two were aligned enough."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is such a useful and enriching French course. I recommend this to any French student who feels relatively confident in their French grammar and vocabulary who wants to now apply it in a classroom\/discussion environment. I truly enjoyed this course.",
    "If you want to improve your french, take this class.",
    "I'd recommend the course. However, if your only aim is to improve your spoken French you might be a bit disappointed because that's not the whole focus of the class.",
    "If you want to improve speaking and listening comprehension skills - and are willing to put in the effort to do so - then absolutely.  It is my experience that those who hated the style of L3 and L4 ( *cough* me) love this course, while others who I know that liked L3 and L4 were not as fond of this one.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course to anybody who wants to improve French skills and is willing to put in the work.",
    "Yes! This class improved my French fluency and my understanding of modern French culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was fun to sit in class and learn about so many different things and the workload was definitely manageable.",
    "Yes, especially if you want to learn more about French culture. It's great.",
    "Definitely! It's a great class to get a better grasp of the French language, and I'd recommend it to anyone trying to improve their conversational French ability."
