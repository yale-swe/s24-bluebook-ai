                "Strengths: interesting content, some lecturers were very clear and concise. Definitely learned a lot. Workload was manageable, psets were enjoyable, and exams were fair. Cool concepts and I liked how the lecturers alternated. TA's were very responsive and had great contributions!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Wish there was more emphasis on the coding part & learning the packages vs just splitting class into coding and noncoding. It would have been fun & useful to learn these methods. Deep learning concepts were explained very clearly, but I wish there was more application to biology vs straight deep learning techniques. I didn't enjoy protein folding lectures -- they were very scattered and hard to understand; I wanted to learn more genomic methods. Lastly, a project/exam/pset were assigned all in the same 2 weeks basically and that was very stressful organization wise so I wish the assignment was earlier instead.",
                "It was a good course but it would probably be a lot better/more engaging in person.",
                "The course is a good general survey introduction. It needs to spread out its assignments more: there were a final project, a final homework and a final exam in the same week.",
                "I liked the flexibility of this course - there were some assignments to be done, but it was not overbearing/excessive and allowed me to actually appreciate and be interested in learning the content in the course.",
                "I did not learn any software or other genomics techniques like I expected when entering the class, as the course is much more conceptual than practical. MG is not the best at explaining concepts, otherwise most other professors were good, especially Matt Simon.",
                "Strengths: tests were very fair, instructors were all clearly talented/pioneers in their fields \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of the lectures were absolutely incomprehensible. It often felt like some of the instructors would take the path of most resistance to explain the most basic things. Going into the tests, I had no idea what I had to know/what to expect. In general, this class assumed WAY too much prior knowledge from its students. For example, we spent like 5 min talking about what neural networks actually did and then >90 min on the nitty-gritty details of activation functions. The class needs to explain the basics and understand that since compsci isn't a listed pre-requisite a lot of students won't be well-versed in ML."

                "Yes! Basically the only bioinformatics course that covers core concepts at Yale. A good survey course and introduction to a lot of these concepts without being overwhelming.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. Right now, it seems like just a mish-mash of ideas from biochemistry, biophysics, statistics, applied math, and machine learning, so while you're introduced to these concepts, you walk away from the class not really understanding anything in any great detail. There are very few assignments which is nice, but as a result there is very little incentive to keep up with the material. Even if you are, there is no way for you to be sure that you are understanding the material properly unless you go to office hours or something because there are hardly any assignments for you to test yourself and receive feedback. Considering the class has been running for over 20 years and still has these fundamental problems, I would not recommend anyone to take this class.",
                "Yeah I think it's a good 5th or 6th course for people interested in going into some sort of computational biology field. You only have 2 assignments, grading is relaxed and you only have 2 tests during the semester that generally people do really well on so if you want a low stress course, this one is great.",
                "Yes if interested in MB&B",
                "Absolutely not. I read a lot of the negative reviews for this class and was interested enough in the material to overlook them. This was a mistake. I really don't think I took anything away from this class. I have a very cursory idea of many ML techniques but no idea how to implement them in code or why they're significant. This class lists minimal required prerequisites and then assumes a TON of background knowledge. As someone with a relatively strong probability theory background, a lot of the derivations confused me and I can't imagine following along if you've never been exposed to the statistical theory before. On the bright side, the tests are very fair and the homework assignments minimal work. If you are looking for a relatively easy A while not actually understanding anything you write/do, then this class might be for you."
