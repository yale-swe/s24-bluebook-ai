                "I became a better actor through multiple in-depth scene studies, and also had the chance to learn about classical (Shakespeare) acting and screen acting/self-tapes.",
                "I learned the fundamentals of theater and film performance, different techniques from Professor McKenzie and guest instructors, how to rehearse (we had practice with the material in each class), and how to prepare oneself for a performance/rehearsal (mentally and physically). Apart from this, I also gained more confidence in my acting abilities and empathy as a person. Through the weekly reflections, I was able to tie class material into my life happenings, which helped me better understand and apply the concepts as well. This course will positively change your life :)"

                "I think the course was a great survey into acting. I didn't realize how deep acting was on the personal level or at least whats required to act as another character. Particularly because the subject matter and characters portrayed were difficult with challenging backstories. To dive in and embody these characters took a lot of work but was fun.",
                "Strengths: Professor McKenzie is an amazing instructor and gives great feedback, the material is very interesting, curriculum is adjusted based on class interests and relevancy, you learn a great deal about the craft and techniques (regardless of your level and experience) and have sufficient practice with it, the small class setting is very conducive to learning and encourages an open, interactive environment. Weaknesses: None really, maybe just that it is a very long class (because it meets once weekly). Bring lunch and water with you, so you can keep your energy up. I wouldn't change the length or once-weekly times, since it works well with the curriculum. As a student, be sure to leave enough time before the class and your previous one (it might be too much to have two in a row with the length of this one / you need to eat before the class)."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in acting at Yale. It was a great introduction to what acting can look like in a collegiate learning environment.",
                "I would. I had never acted before and can now say that acting is quite intense to be honest or at least the way it is introduced at Yale. You will definitely be pushed artistically and leave the class with a lot of skills. Not only did we do the intellectual work or studying the subject of acting and its origin itself, we also did practical work of learning about how to memorize lines, the process of developing a character and also professional work like how to record a self tape or how to approach real auditions.",
                "Yes! I think this is a great creative course to take, even if you aren't a theater major.",
                "YES, whether you are a theater major, interested in performing, or have always wanted to learn about acting. This class was brilliant, and it is one of my favorites at Yale (said as an upperclassman)."
