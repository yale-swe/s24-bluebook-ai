                "Strengths were that we were able to pursue any topic we wanted for our final project. The weaknesses are that lecture attendance was required and that the material could be very dry.",
                "Strengths: good survey course with an interesting end-of-term project to apply lessons learnt",
                "Psets helped affirm what we learned in class",
                "No consistency with how it was offered with Coifman. Attendance was graded this semester, and project final presentations were also mandated whereas in the past they were offered as a way to boost peoples grades and here they could hurt us.",
                "My only advice would be that Abi should ban laptops. There would be so much more engagement if kids werent scrolling on Twitter or whatever all class",
                "It could be more interesting, but everyone in the class knew why they were there.",
                "There is a lot of room for creativity in this course especially for the final project as a way to reflect on what you have learned throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: clear expectations, homework is submit until correct for full credit, exams are straightforward\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not super engaging, can feel a bit all over the place at times, sometimes difficult to parse through what information/material is important",
                "it was interesting to learn about how networks connect and how to analyze them",
                "I think more relevance if the second half of the class for the project would be good",
                "More engaging in an exciting way.",
                "Really disorganized and the syllabus was not accurate. Assignments were not posted on the syllabus, the grade breakdowns were different than what was actually weighted for our final grades, and there was little to no support for learning material if you missed class.",
                "The course didn't feel like it had a real purpose - we were learning a bunch of different topics that never really connected. I also thought that the professor's lecturing style was dry and did not facilitate good learning. He moved very slowly on a lot of topics but covered the more complicated things in a very brief time. We also got basically no guidance on the final project.",
                "The strengths of this course were its organization and workload. Professor Gopal always provided detailed instructions to our class, and the workload was very manageable throughout the semester. However, the weakness of this course was that sometimes the lectures could have been more engaging. Often, Professor Gopal would write on the chalkboard without slides prepared, which could make the lesson as a whole a little hard to follow."

I found this class very manageable throughout the semester. However, I would warn them that sometimes Professor Gopal can provide very direct feedback during class--especially when we gave our final project presentations. Moreover, while network structures do provide a new way of looking at data, I believe the course could go more in depth than it does currently."
