                "I was introduced to some of the seminal text of England's Victorian period, including works by the Bront sisters, Charles Dickens, George Elliot, and Thomas Hardy. I learned to situate these novels in their historical context, to analyze their authors' use of language and structure. Taken together, I learned so much about how the self was presented during this time, and viewing this through the lens of gender and class was extremely interesting and rewarding.",
                "Reading books such as Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, and Middlemarch with an expert like Professor Yeazell was the best part of my week. Although I have always loved reading English literature and studying Victorian society, Professor Yeazell's lectures and Q+A sections critically analyzed the manifestations of class, gender, and race within these novels in ways I had never before imagined. The course consistently surprised me, and the discussions I had with my classmates each week were fascinating. It was particularly interesting to debate the deep lessons that we can continue to learn from Victorian literature, as well as the ways in which our own society continues to reflect Victorian ideals at the same time that we claim to reject them (particularly regarding racist and gendered attitudes).\r\n\r\nBeyond our discussions, I also learned vital writing techniques from my Teaching Assistant, Sarah Guayante. She taught us how to connect interpretative and conceptual problems within our analysis, providing an extremely helpful roadmap to follow as I composed my essays for this course.",
                "My understanding of Victorian literature, the Victorian period, and the idea of the novel itself were immensely broadened. I had never dug so deeply into texts as I did in this class. My ability to think critically was hugely improved, and I felt like I built new frameworks for looking at literature.",
                "I developed a better understanding of Victorian Novels, gained a lot of context about the era and practiced close reading. I also received lots of feedback to improve my writing.",
                "This is a great course for anyone who wants a better grasp on nineteenth-century literature and the broader themes of the period. I really enjoyed getting to read novels with a micro and macro lens, as I close read motifs/symbols and connected broader themes across novels.",
                "Frankly, I am not sure I necessarily gained any considerable knowledge, skills, or insights through the course itself. The texts were helpful starting points for my own knowledge pursuits and skill-building, but the structure of the class, and its assignments, were not very fruitful in encouraging intellectual growth.",

                "Professor Yeazell is a great lecturer who is exceedingly knowledgeable about these books: not just their contents, but their historical contexts. I am so glad to have been introduced to these texts through this class. Had I not, I would have missed so much. Also, this course benefits from the richness of the texts studied. Middlemarch and Great Expectations, in particular, are fantastic, and they were taught to perfection in this class. The only weakness I can identify in this class was the content of discussion sections. I really wished we had taken more time to talk about the content of both the texts and the lecture. Often, the discussion sections felt tangential in a way that wasn't helpful to my overall understanding of the books.",
                "The strengths of this course were its fascinating curriculum and the teaching team that made it come to life. Despite the fact that we were sitting on opposite ends of the country each week, I loved the critical conversations and debates that my class continued to have even over the medium of Zoom. The connections we were able to establish over the screen were incredible, and I feel as if I really had the opportunity to speak with classmates throughout this course--which is such a rare phenomenon in Zoom learning.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course were precisely that we were not able to meet in-person! It was a wonderful topic to explore with an equally wonderful group of people, and I am excited for future students of this class to be able to have those experiences face-to-face.",
                "Although this course was challenging, it was very strong. The discussion section was so well-run and engaged that it felt like a seminar in its own right. I also didn't expect to enjoy asynchronous lectures as much as I did, and I felt that both halves of the class worked together well. At times the reading felt overwhelming, specifically towards the end of Middlemarch, but it did turn out to be do-able and it was incredibly rewarding to feel on top of a demanding class.",
                "This course is great at connecting and condensing the entire timespan of the Victorian period into just one semester. The fast-paced timeline however does present some issues, as it has to jump over some important themes, names race and imperialism. Because the course met online this semester and the lectures were pre-recorded, it often felt like there just wasn't enough time to get through all of the material presented by the novels and I wished this class were a seminar-style course. Honestly, I wish we could have just read more books together!",
                "The strengths of this course are that Professor Yeazell is wonderful and brilliant, and the texts included in the syllabus are some of the most well-renowned ones ever produced. The weaknesses of the course derive perhaps from its position as an introductory class of sorts. In this sense, I think the course is really only a good fit for students who have little previous experience with literary analysis. For others, the course's odd focus on teaching students to conform to traditional essay structures is limiting and confining, stymying intellectual engagement and growth rather than encouraging it. The asynchronous set-up for lectures was also rather ineffective, especially given that lectures were only online for one week, a rather silly decision that likely discouraged student engagement rather than encouraging it."

I found it to be a very generative lecture course in the context of the pandemic, and I deeply appreciated Professor Yeazell and Spencer's efforts to make our learning feel accessible, fruitful, and manageable in these times.",
                "Although the class was a lecture course, I thought the addition of a weekly Q+A with Professor Yeazell in addition to our scheduled discussion sections was a fantastic solution to the isolation of Zoom. Because computers eliminate the spontaneous interactions that emerge in a classroom setting, the Q+A helped to fill that void by allowing us to have conversations without the constraints of a set agenda or schedule. I had an equally rewarding experience with our discussion sections, which, albeit more planned, nevertheless allowed my classmates and I to chat back and forth with one another in meaningful ways despite our physical separation. And, of course, the lectures themselves transferred perfectly to Zoom!",
                "The combination of asynchronous lectures and weekly discussion section worked very well.",
                "Everything was fairly successful for this course, however the class time slot was supposed to be Tuesdays and Thursdays, and section happened on Wednesdays. The prof started expecting us to have the week's worth of lectures and reading complete by Wednesday rather than Thursday which was chaotic and made the work load harder to manage.",
                "The synchronous sections and optional Q&A were fantastic as they allowed time for all of us to get to know Prof. Yeazell, our TA and each other in a relatively free-flowing environment. I think the best way this class operated virtually was by uploading both of the week's lectures on Sunday mornings to allows everyone some freedom with their schedules.",
                "The asynchronous structure for lectures and the decision to remove lectures after the week they were posted both decreased my (and others I spoke to's) engagement with the class. The lectures should have been synchronous, recorded, and available online throughout the semester."

I would, however, advise that if you plan to take this course, that you give it the time it requires. There is a lot of reading, and so falling behind is brutal. Be sure you aren't stacking this course on top of an already difficult schedule.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Although I am biased toward Victorian literature, the books that we read are classics that everyone should read at least once in their lives. Moreover, Professor Yeazell's analysis moves beyond praising these novels solely for their position in the canon; rather, her lectures and commentary engage with them as living, breathing texts, critically analyzing the class, gendered, and racial implications of their stories in order to piece together a picture of Victorian society, learn more about narrative form, and, most importantly, debate and otherwise critique their ideas as we perceive them today. These are big books in the truest sense, and I had such a wonderful time reading and writing about them throughout the semester. For any English enthusiast, this course is the ultimate guilty pleasure!",
                "This is the best course I've taken at Yale so far. As long as you're willing to put in the time towards reading several really long books, its immensely rewarding. Professor Yeazell is brilliant, and I feel like she's given me tools to be a better student and reader going forward. This is such a good class.",
                "If you have the time to read the novels then you'll probably enjoy the course!",

This course is phenomenal and can really lean in any direction you are interested! Even if you just want more classic literature under your belt, this class is a super interesting and rewarding place to start!",

                "No, not unless the student has very little experience with writing about literature. For those drawn to the class by the reading list, I would recommend just reading the books rather than taking the course, as I'm not sure there's much to be gained from it.",
