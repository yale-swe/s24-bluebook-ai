   "comments": [
    "Integral Calculus",
    "I learned the theory behind integral calculus and the applications of integration, convergence tests of sequences and series, parametric and polar curves, and exponential and logistic growth curves.",
    "Developed my understanding of calculus quite a bit.",
    "I leaned integration and series.",
    "I took Calc AB in high school. This course allowed me to deepen my understanding of those calculus concepts and taught me many new applications of derivatives and integrals.",
    "I learned to think quickly and critically in short periods of time",
    "My understanding of calculus concepts, such as integrals and convergence of series, increased.",
    "I learned different math techniques involving calculus.",
    "My overall knowledge of Calculus improved, although the topics seemed relatively unrelated. I had a background in AB Calculus and had seen most of the topics related to integrals, volumes of revolutions, and some differential equations, but the sequences and series unit and the polar and parametric curves were completely new. Because of the Flipped Classroom setup, students who did not have a BC Calculus background seemed to be at a fairly significant disadvantage.",
    "I was able to develop a more thorough understanding of the concepts I learned in high school like more complex integration methods.",
    "This course helped me develop much more fluency in the field of calculus specifically topics from integration techniques to working with areas and volumes of manipulated curves to understanding sequences and series and concepts like error as it relates to taylor series."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Flipped style doesn't work well. Concepts are not explained well enough in videos to not need more lecturing",
    "The course is meant to be flipped class room, but the instructor still spent most of class lecturing. As a result, I was extremely bored and disengaged in class, as I had already learned the content by watching the assigned video the night before. The course needs to abandon the flipped classroom or follow the system properly.",
    "The reverse teaching style is hit or miss. You watch short videos online about the material your going to learn and have to take a mini quiz on it (not worth that big a grade so its no biggie), and then the teacher is supposed to just give you examples to practice with. \r\n\r\nWhat really works best is doing the videos and quizzes and then your teaching re-explaining it to you to cement it. Thats what we ended up doing, and it helped loads more than the other method. Another weakness is the frustration you feel when your taking the quiz and have absolutely no idea how to do it, but you have to do it anyway for the points, so you end up guessing and waiting until later to learn it. Also, some videos are very helpful, some aren't. generally they are okay though.",
    "Exam 1 was far too difficult but the course was very well organized.",
    "Flipped courses suck. Prof. Adelstein was a good lecturer and math should be taught more traditionally. Just pushing in technology where it isn't needed can sometimes detract from the experience.",
    "I all but despise the flipped class setup. The videos we watch barely help you actually learn the required material, so you're basically forced to read the whole textbook to learn it. I don't have a problem with reading the textbook, something I try to do for all of my classes anyway, but if I'm taking a class at Yale University, I expect to be taught by a professor\/instructor like I'm paying to do. Luckily, my instructor was great about this and often had \"lecture-style\" classes to teach us material. I hope that other instructors do this too, because it was SO much more helpful than the usual class setup.",
    "I thought this course was well organized. Sometimes, I thought that the videos we watched for homework were not that helpful and often had to watch additional videos and read the textbook in order to understand the concepts.",
    "There is a disconnect between the videos that the students watch and the concepts that are tested. The videos tend to be nice introductions to a new concept, but the tests ask highly conceptual questions that require deeper conceptual understading than is offered by the videos or in class.",
    "I think that the videos did not encourage students to absorb information. I think that if concepts were taught in class, more content would be internalized.",
    "The Flipped Classroom setup was not effective because the videos were not sufficient in teaching the information to those who had never seen it before. Often, the professor ended up lecturing for most of class and my class specifically never got many practice problems, thus making the tests far more difficult then they otherwise would have been.",
    "There could be more practice problems in class.",
    "I thought all the videos with Professor Rolfe were very well made and informative. I don't think the flipped classroom style worked well with having the Tuesday\/Thursday 75 minute session because classes sometimes dragged on for a long time, but it probably would have been better with a M\/W\/F section.",
    "I did not feel particularly prepared for exams. Even after reading the text book in addition to watching the videos, doing the practice quizzes, and completing problem sets, I did not feel like I'd seen many questions like those that came up on exams. I think doing more practice questions in class at the level of the exam questions could help improve the course."

    "It's necessary if dry and frustrating",

    "I would recommend this course to students that are interested in mathematics in some degree or looking to fulfill a requirement for their degree.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but I would warn them of some difficulties that often arise from it.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to students who have already taken BC Calculus, but would not recommend to students with an AB Calc background who do not feel extremely confident in their math skills and ability to learn quickly.",
    "I would only recommend this course if a student needs it for their major",
    "I would *not* recommend this class to a student who had taken BC Calculus before and done reasonably well. This was the position I was in, and the class was basically entirely review, and I should have been placed directly into math 120. For everyone else I would recommend this class.",
    "For solidifying concepts of foundational calculus, absolutely  this course is perfect."
