                "I did not like this class. I'm sure you know that the half credit stuff is not real. It was a lot of work and labs were graded harshly. Lots of students had trouble with the equipment, and there were multiple labs where I had to observe two or three times in order to get the data. And the observing is usually for two hours some time after 9pm. Also, Professor Faison does not care if you have other things going on which make you unavailable for observing. This class basically requires you to be free every night of the week in case you are required to observe then. And it really meets about twice per week because you have lecture once a week and then two hour observing about every other week, and then extra observing if you need it. I missed one lab observing session by mistake once, and Professor Faison did not let me make it up or complete the lab, so I got a 0. Also the observatory is far, helps if you have a car or know someone in the class with a car.",
                "It was very hands on but there could have been a little variance in the lectures",
                "strengths: you get to use the telescopes in the observatory and try out different techniques\r\nweaknesses: lecture component is quite boring and lab reports need quite a bit work (though it isn't that hard)"

                "This course replaces one physics lab as a prereq for the astrophysics major, so it is sort of requires. It is probably easier than a physics lab... but it still isn't great. It was definitely cool to use the telescopes and get some hands on experience with the data, but I found it really frustrating and the TA's and Prof were not very helpful.",
                "yes if you want hands on experience on telescopes, but note that the lectures and observing sessions are at night and if you are a busy person, it might mess with your schedule (observing sessions could be postponed due to weather conditions and also take longer than expected)"
