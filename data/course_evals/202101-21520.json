Content-wise, we spent most of the time doing linear algebra, and also a bit more real analysis (multivariate for the most part) that we didn't cover in 230.

However, while this is a criticism, I can't think of many other ways with which this sort of teaching is possible. The course requires much practice on the part of the student, so a high workload is logical.",
                "Pat is a great lecturer, although I think I liked his teaching in 230 better. This semester some things felt a little more hand-wavy/'you do this and then obviously get that'. Also, the speed of grading was terrible... everything was graded around two months after it was originally due. OH were usually helpful and gathertown was a pretty good way to do it/preserve the spirit of small group collaboration of normal/in-person OH. I thought this class was slightly harder/less intuitive than 230.",
                "Great lectures, great instructor, but towards the end the proofs of complex ideas related to the Implicit and Inverse Function Theorem were breezed over and were very hard to understand. Felt like I wasn't sure exactly what was going on and kind of applied the theorems without a full grasp of what was going on. Other than that small issue, the first 9/10ths of the course were amazing.",
                "I think the homework was very difficult, but the teaching was excellent and Pat is an incredible instructor.",
                "Well, this class isn't being taught next year, but... Strenghts: Pat is extremely kind and makes math fun. Also, I feel as though Pat is better at teaching linear algebra than analysis, so the \"bonus material\" was better suited to the class // Weaknesses: Can feel a little disorganized. I don't really know why we did integrals so late.",
                "Strength: I think we have covered a decent amount of material and shown the connections between calculus and lin-alg\r\nWeakness: sometimes the organization feels a bit chaotic, and we do not get in-depth on any of the topics",
                "Strengths: The lectures are straightforward, and build upon the lectures we previously looked at, so you are always moving forward. All lectures are recorded, so you can revise information later if you did not fully understand the material in one class. The problem sets are challenging and push your mathematical thinking (as they should),  but there are plenty of office hour sessions for the students to make use of if you need support. The whole environment of the class is really positive, because the teacher is always upbeat and encouraging to the students (not to mention is flexible in his due dates if you have conflicting deadlines or something important came up/happened). The TA's are really nice and helpful too. On top of this, I found that the student body of the class was really nice and a lot of fun, and we helped each other better understand the material. Overall, it was an amazing course.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of a weakness for this course. (Only one preference: the lecture notes are usually in a file format that is really small when you download it. If it is possible to make it bigger that would be great!)",
                "Strengths: 1. Pat is a gem of a person - he's helpful, accomodating and just generally a great guy. His lectures are always engaging because of his enthusiasm and his laidback style of teaching (which often features cameos of his three cats). 2. Many might deem this one a weakness, but the problem sets really cemented concepts taught in class, while honing the all-important proof-writing skillset. 3. The grading is pretty generous, and if you're working on problem sets with others, getting an A is not hard at all. Weaknesses: 1. This sequence is called Vector Calculus & Linear Algebra, but content is majorly lacking on the vector calculus side of things - we didn't get to any of the vector calculus theorems, which is unexcusable given the title of the course. 2. It's a lot of work every week, but imo it's worth it.",
                "Strengths: Pat's enthusiasm and great explanations as always, problem sets were reasonable yet challenging enough for me to synthesize the material, and the material itself was interesting. Weaknesses: some theorems in class were proved somewhat less rigorously, and some lectures felt rushed because there were a lot of topics to cover.",
                "A strength of the course was the wide range of interesting and difficult problems on the problem sets each week which helped me to solidify my understanding of the material we covered in class.",
                "Teaching staff was enthusiastic and supportive. I liked Ed Discussion for asking questions and getting answers in a pretty timely manner, but I would've liked it more if posts were anonymous to instructors, not just other students. I often felt paranoid about the optics of showing that I didn't understand a certain topic or question and some anonymity would have helped that.",
                "Strengths: Pat's lectures are mostly pretty good, the TA's office hours are a life-saver. Weaknesses: the problem sets are almost unnecessarily long, sometimes the explanations on problems are not very clear and I would finish the problem not knowing what I had proved and how it connects to other stuff we're doing (you'll eventually find out that it does connect when Pat mentions it a few months later--but at that point it's not very useful). The class is overall a bit unorganized.",
                "The biggest strength is pat. Also homework assignmentsthese were always challenging and at least as educational (in terms of learning new theorems and proof techniques) as lectures. I cant think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: the topic is very interesting and learning about proof based math has been extremely helpful for me even though I dont plan on majoring in STEM. Pat is great in explaining difficult concepts and he genuinely cares about his students. Weaknesses: assignments and exams can be graded and returned faster. It can also be helpful to have a detailed syllabus listing topics, assignments/exams dates, etc.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- challenging problem sets\r\n- good presentation of info in lecture\r\n\r\nPotential improvements:\r\n- motivate proofs in lecture with important examples\r\n- have supplemental office hours for specific topics\r\n- ordering of topics could be more smooth I think",
                "It is a challenging but fun course, the Psets are pretty challenging but it should be fine if you attend office hours for help, which are available in multiple time periods across the week. We did not use a textbook this semester, so it may feel less organized if you are used to having a textbook, but the lectures are pretty well laid out and I didn't think it was a problem.",
                "The level at which content is presented is a clear advantage of the course. You simply learn so much! The focus on proof writing is excellent for an introductory course to the math major, picking up some cool math along the way. There is a good mixture of proofs and examples provided (although I would like to see some of these proofs in more detail; the supplemental videos were helpful here). Pat is super caring, helpful, and a little chaotic; the class is less structured as a result (I personally like to have some reference text but the flexibility of the class did allow us to see many cool topics). There is a lot of work! It is quite the time commitment. Do not underestimate how long it takes to write out PSETs!! Collaboration and friendship are key to get through the year.\r\n\r\nGrading feedback could be substantially improved. The quality of the feedback I received was very helpful, but it was significantly delayed.",
                "Great course! Only frustration is that it takes a long time to get grades back, so you have to complete assignments without having received feedback on your previous assignments.",
                "Strength - the encouragement of collaboration, course materials, organization \r\nWeakness - I didn't really find any weakness.",
                "The course was very well organized, with lots of office hours and extracurricular opportunities to enhance your understanding. I think one thing that could be improved would be a \"checkup\" every so often about proof writing style, since I felt like we didn't talk about this much after the beginning of the course, but it would have been good to work on being more succinct (in a way that's still clear).",
                "This course had many strengths. The community had the most inclusive culture I have encountered in a STEM environment. The material was fascinating and engaging. I believe this course could be improved by centralizing the material into an easier-to-review format in addition to the available lecture notes. Since this course built upon previous theories that we had proven in class to address increasingly difficult mathematical concepts, there were specific theorems that we were allowed to use on exams and in problem sets. I think it would be helpful to have a list of the theorems that were proven in class, because I often found myself combing through the lecture notes to find the theorem statement.",
                "Strengths - the professor was great, lots of office hours for help\r\nWeaknesses - the problem sets were very long",
                "The course contained a lot of information. Most classes were spent reviewing multiple proofs and/or examples that challenged  students to think deeply about the topic at hand. However, the subject material felt all over at times, jumping from one topic to another. The homework, while relating to the material covered in class, often asked students to learn concepts on their own.",
                "Overall, this is a very strong class. I think it could benefit from a slightly faster pace at times. Otherwise, I dont have any other suggestions.",
                "Doesn't quite teach multivariable calculus. If I hadn't already had experience with calc 3, this course wouldn't give me the knowledge to apply and solve problems.",
                "Strengths are amazing professor who makes things make feel intuitive and covers what feels like are just the right things.\r\nOnly notable weakness is slow grading, but grading is also nice so its not a big worry.",
                "Pat is a great teacher; everyone loves him and it's so easy to get to know him -- there are LOTS of office hours, GO! Pat makes the class very welcoming and encourages students to collaborate, and he being the professor of MATH 231 (the second portion of the sequence) was a great part of why I continued. A weakness would be getting feedback for your work--like homeworks and portions of tests, however, justing knowing Pat and the other AWESOME TAs, they would be more than willing to talk to you about it. Also, if you go to office hours, you already know if you are on the right track or not.",
                "Strengths: Pat is a legend, huge support system, content is interesting and classes were a joy to attend :)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't really think of much besides the workload feeling higher than necessary, but that's MATH 231 and everyone knows what they're getting in to.",
                "Very good broad overview of mathematical material, and how mathematical material should be interacted with and functions. Introduction to proof based writing.",
                "Problems sets were not graded fast enough so I didnt feel I was getting feedback quickly. Other than that, no complaints because Pat was an amazing instructor all year.",
                "Fosters a lot of community within the class, makes sure everyone understands and is always open for questions",
                "The class is well structured for beginner mathematicians. This class really teaches you how to write proofs.",
                "Strengths: Material is fairly interesting and not too difficult, professor is awesome. Weaknesses: homework can have a tendency to feel like busywork/tedious. There were a lot of students who took this course in my year, so a weakness was also that the problem sets were not returned very quickly, which it difficult to measure my own progress in the course.",
                "I didn't think this course had any weaknesses. It is very tough, but it is also incredibly satisfying. Working in this course gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Oh, actually, there was one weakness. Our work didn't get graded for a long, long time. If we could get more graders that would be great.",
                "This course provides a very solid basis in multivariable calculus and linear algebra. The proofs did in class and homework greatly facilitate the understanding of new concepts. The course materials are illustrated well by Pat.",
                "Pat is incredible, and refining our proof writing skills is really important in helping us improve the quality of our work. Two small weaknesses were (1) there aren't many applications/we don't get too much of a chance to do \"plug and chug\" problems which may be helpful to practice for \"real life\" (by the nature of the proof-based course) and (2) the ending of the course felt a bit rushed, and I personally don't feel like we really got full closure on the topic of manifolds. Literally everything else about this class is amazing--the community, the quality of the course material, Pat's emerald hair, etc.",
                "The weekly problem sets, while pretty draining and occasionally stressful, create a necessary rhythm and keep the intensity of the course pretty constant. Pat is an engaging, human, fun, smart lecturer. The one complaint would be the grading of assignments, which often came late, unpredictably, or not at all.",
                "Strengths: great sense of community, extensive opportunities for office hours and extra support, approachability of professor",
                "This course had a huge task set for it: math 230-231 is supposed to be all about community, on top of introducing people unfamiliar with formal mathematics to it, all over a zoom lecture, with no meaningful breaks. I think that the class was a good class, but it was fighting an uphill battle, especially as everyone got tired, both the students and the instructors. I have immense respect for Pat's ability to run an engaging class, and I think when classes resume in person most of these problems will be solved.",
                "Course organization is great, content builds on itself in a very logical way. Course format, in terms of how lectures relate to problem sets as well as the large availability of TAs and peer tutors, works great! Content is also very interesting, covering the basics of multivariable calculus and linear algebra sufficiently for mathematics and the natural sciences, as well as introducing students enthusiastic about pure math to interesting areas to explore further.",
                "Strengths: Awesome instructor & great course. Please dont get rid of it! Weaknesses: Grading was slow",
                "great professor, grading should have been faster",
                "the course content of the class doesnt directly relate to the problem sets",
                "I felt like the course was done quite well, the only thing I would've enjoyed more was if we got more prompt and quick feedback for our psets",
                "The problem sets were sometimes too long, but very helpful in learning the material better.",
                "A strength was the heavy workload because it forced us to practice the content we learned in class consistently. The professor was also amazing and made the class a lot more interesting. A weakness would be the lack of feedback, as a lot of the assignments were graded very late.",
                "Weakness - this course doesn't exist anymore.  Strength - Pat Devlin!! Pat is the best teacher at Yale. He is kind, supportive even beyond class, and super smart yet approachable. He is amazingly clear and really by the end of the course he feels more like a friend than anything else.",
                "Strengths: Consistent, and although the workload is pretty heavy for every pset, you know what you're getting. Even if it took a long time, it's clear what the work required is in order to do well, and it's doable. You have several directions to ask for help from the many people that are willingpeers, pset groups, the office hours, online!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Even though I learned a lot from 230, I still was often not prepared for the amount of time I needed to spend to finish and type up some assignments. Unless you're already pretty good at proof-based math, be prepared to spend at least the time required in 230, if not more for longer psets. Feedback on psets and midterms was sometimes delayed, which definitely could have helped me catch a mistake that I later repeated on the final...",
                "The course was very well-organized and overall a great experience! I can't think of any major weaknesses (and I know this course won't be offered in the future anymore)"

All the problem sets were done independently anyway, and the teacher always made each online lecture helpful and meaningful. Not to mention, all materials from class (and from outside the class that the teacher thought would be helpful) were provided at all times. There were lots of office hour sessions too. On top of this, in the era of COVID-19 learning, deadlines did become more shaky for everything (and in some other classes apparently, the workload increased). The professor took this into consideration by having a reasonably flexible deadline schedule for all assignments that allowed the students to submit their assignments at times that did not put them behind in other classes.",

I also found that the online office hours via Gathertown were convenient and helped me find friends to work on PSETs together. The friendships I made here go beyond the class. Breakout rooms during class for discussions increased immersion although they sometimes ran quiet (keeping the same group over each day was better for this purpose).",

I was able to come back to them anytime I was confused with the pset. \r\nWe were also able to collaborate with friends on zoom, which was nice. \r\n\r\nHowever, I wish that we were able to take classes in person just so that we learn about each other a little more.",

                "The office hours held using gather.town and an online whiteboard were very sucessful. The YUMS speakers and Pat's weekly 'Pat's cats' power hour' were also very engaging, and an important part of the creation of the rich undergraduate math culture at Yale. Of all of my classes, this one was the most successful in the transition to the online format.",
                "The office hours were great!",
                "I think Gather Town was a very creative way of doing office hours. Overall, the main problem was finding a group to do psets with as an off-campus student.",

                "There was quite a bit of engagement in the class; Pat does a warm-up in every lecture and will frequently ask students to answer the problems. He also broke us out into breakout rooms; I personally didn't like that part as much, but I'm sure many others liked it. \r\n\r\nFor office hours, we just gather.town and that was GREAT--I love the platform, it's super engaging and fitting for those us working in groups without going through the hassle of Zoom breakout rooms (not to mention aesthetics)!",
                "Pat's live handwritten lectures were great for the Zoom setting because it takes more time to convey information when there's such a disconnect between us and him. He frequently asked in polls how well we were understanding the material and adjusted accordingly, which was also extremely helpful. The office hours website (gather.town) I found to be a bit glitchy at times - there were certainly ways that made it better than Zoom rooms but I guess I just never acclimated to it so it always felt weird for me.",

                "I think that the online format worked well in supporting everything that should've been happening in the course. One drawback is that I didn't feel like I was able to engage with the community and find solid study/PSET groups, but that's mostly because I took the class asynchronously. Hopefully we'll return to in-person things soon and the online format of things will subside.",

                "Definitely! 231 is a great continuation of 230. Personally, I found the class to be a little easier than 230 in content and workload. If you took 230, I'd highly recommend continuing the course track and finishing up with 231.",
                "If you are willing to spend the time to master the content, this is a great course! It may be a bit superfluous for non-math-related majors, however, so be aware of the time commitment and your personal workload comfort level.",
                "Personally, the content of 230/231 helped me figure out that I'm not a fan of analysis at all (and I'm probably not going to take any more analysis courses in the future.. though we'll see). However, 230/231 did really help me improve my rigorous proof-writing skills, and I enjoyed having Pat as a teacher. I guess I would say take this course if you want to have a (kind of intense) introduction to college math, analysis, and proofs, but I would note that I thought (and I think others thought too) that 231 was harder than 230. Also definitely work on the psets with people and ask for help at OH if you don't understand things",
                "Absolutely, any course with Pat is a course to enjoy. He teaches math in a wonderful way so you feel comfortable as you're introduced to new topics.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in pursuing a math major or who wants to explore proofs, but not just to anyone.",
                "Math 230-231 is being replaced by 225/226 and 255/256, so I will offer my thoughts on those classes. I want to applaud the math department for making the switch. It was completely necessary. I can't believe Yale didn't really offer a concrete real analysis class before. Furthermore, in my opinion, the blending of real analysis, linear algebra, and bonus material from Pat was a little ridiculous. I understand that people enjoyed the bonus material, but I was here to learn analysis and linear algebra, not learn about modulo arithmetic and other things. It was annoying when I was challenged by bonus material, not analysis or linear algebra. Also, separating the subjects and introducing levels will make things much better. I came in with a fair amount of analysis and linear algebra already, but I wanted a rigorous summary of everything again. Instead, for me, class felt not completely rigorous and problem sets were challenging because of the bonus material, not the actual analysis and linear algebra content, which could be infuriating. It kind of felt like the class was hard just for the sake of being hard, which could be fixed by simply providing actual analysis and linear algebra problems on the pset. In this vein, I hope the new classes can teach more related material rather than the bonus stuff, such as least squares in linear algebra, and compactness, series, uniform continuity, and uniform convergence of functions and stuff in analysis. I have high hopes for the new sequence, especially since Professor Minsky will be teaching 256. He is an incredible lecturer, blending the perfect amount of rigorous proofs and intuition along the way. His greatest strength is writing problems that seem impossible, but with sufficient thought are conquerable. The only thing is, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT USE BEALS. USE A  DIFFERENT TEXTBOOK. USE RUDIN. Beals is structured weird and contains so many errors. Rudin is the most rigorous you can find (since 256 is for people who know proofs already, the rigor won't be an issue), and its problems are all gold.",
                "Yes, but the department has decided to change its structure anyway, and I think it's a good decision.",
                "YES! If you want to be a mathematician, this class is fantastic! Not only do you cover everything you need to, it is a lot of fun and the material you cover is very interesting.\r\n\r\nEven if you are not planning on being a mathematician, I recommend this class anyway! I am not planning on being a mathematician myself, but I took the class for the intellectual challenge, and found that I really enjoyed it. I personally found that the problem sets were like sets of puzzles or riddles that clever and clear thinking could overcome (there were some very beautiful problems we did that had beautiful solutions too). Not to mention the professor is really nice :) .\r\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this class to everybody. (If the level of the material is too great for you, that is fine. I recommend just trying it a bit anyway in the shopping period because it is fun!)",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, it gives a strong background in proof writing methods, as well as covering the material (vector calc and linear algebra) to an interesting level of depth (even for those who have taken similar courses in the past).",
                "If you're a potential math major looking to bolster your proof-writing abilities and learn linear algebra while you're at it, take this course. But if you're a science major seeking a more fundamental understanding of the tools of vector calculus and linear algebra, you should probably look elsewhere, because some important vector calculus theorems, and importantly, a lot of practice that's required to implement the concepts taught in class, are gravely missing in this course.",

The material is definitely interesting if you're looking for an intellectual challenge, but the unnecessarily high workload actually made me engage less with the material and more focused on finishing the problem sets. We probably proved a lot of interesting stuff, but there's no time to think about what we proved with deadlines every week. Pat's lectures are pretty helpful, but he moves really fast--I often feel ashamed that I don't get the stuff that he says is obvious. Pat's a great teacher, but the format of the course is really limiting. I suppose none of this really matters though since this will be the last year of 230/1.",
                "Yes",

                "MATH 230/231 will no longer be offered next year, but I strongly recommend students to take a class with Pat! Proof based math with Pat has changed my way of thinking and opened up my world, even though I didnt come to Yale think Im necessarily good at math.",
                "Yes \r\n- good for learning multivariable/linear algebra rigorously\r\n- acquaints with proof-based math\r\n- valuable experience even after having taken multivariable/linear algebra before college",

It is a nice introduction to proof-based mathematics, and if you took MATH 230, it is a pretty smooth transition since the professor is the same.",
                "Yes, but with the understanding that the PSETs dominate your week (not a problem when you are with math friends :)). This math sequence is highly demanding but also rewarding. I began with no formal training in proof-based math and have left confident in my ability to write detailed, thorough arguments. Although it can be intense, this class delves into the details and shows what is at the heart of mathematics. The community I have found at TA office hours was invaluable. I met some truly awesome people and I am looking forward to where our friendship will go!",
                "Yes! Although it's kind of a moot point since it won't be offered in the future. If you enjoy math and proofs I would definitely recommend this sequence, or whichever course they have to replace it.",

                "Strongly, even if not a math major, IF you have time. It is an awesome intro to understanding what math means in a way that you will never have from the other intro calc sequences. And Pat is the best. However the time required isnt trivial; although deadline flexibility makes it a bit easier to fit around.",
                "We're the last cohort of MATH 230/231 students, so none of you reading this will be able to take it. However, Pat is teaching MATH 225 (linear algebra) Fall 2021 and you should definitely take that course. I personally really liked linear algebra, and I think the workload would be much more manageable than MATH 230/231. \r\n\r\n\r\nNot to mention, Pat is a great person (all the AWESOME TAs as well); get to know them -- there are LOTS of office hours, *GO*! Pat makes the class very welcoming and encourages students to collaborate, and he being the professor of MATH 231 (the second portion of the sequence) was a great part of why I continued (in addition to the friends I made). If you like very clear feedback for your work, a weakness would be that. Homeworks and portions of tests may not be handed back,  however, justing knowing Pat and the other AWESOME TAs, they would be more than willing to talk to you about it. Also, if you've done the homeworks, you already know the material, so it's not like you're missing out on knowledge. Linear Algebra is fun, do it!",
                "Yes, 100% recommend! Before I talk about the class in particular I think it's important to point out that 231 won't be offered again (they're restructuring the intro classes) so here's my rambling attempt at explaining the changes to anyone curious: the old intensive classes (230 and 231) which each combined proof-based vector calculus (aka real analysis) and linear algebra are being split into linear algebra only (226) and real analysis only (256). Since the real analysis class is covering a stuff in a different order, 250 and 300/301 are being phased out in favor of 255/256 (single-variable analysis, 256 intensive version of 255) and 302 (multivariable analysis, manifolds and stuff) that is no longer a prerequisite for 305 (the way 301 was). Due to COVID (and perhaps also the impending change) our 230 in the fall was almost entirely analysis and 231 almost entirely linear algebra, so 230 from fall 2020 was basically a dry run for 256 and 231 this term was a dry run for 226. I hope this helps people compare course reviews while the transition is taking place. But anyway on to the class itself, Pat is AMAZING (deservedly given a teaching award this year!) and really supports everyone in the class. Linear algebra was fun, probably not my favorite course of the semester content-wise, but definitely the most fun class to go to because of how accessible and interesting Pat made the lectures. You know what you're getting into with the psets having done 230, lots of intellectually challenging proofs - the difference is with linear algebra it's more computational than theoretical (as it is with analysis) which I personally found to be more enjoyable. The workload is more or less the same as it is in 230, some people say higher and others (a majority I think) say a bit lower. But definitely use the opportunity Pat offers to really get to know your classmates, because the 231 community was really fantastic and supportive. Again you probably know all this stuff coming from 230 (or now 226 going into 256 or whatever), but it's a lot of work, intellectually challenging, but the experience is great and it's very possible to do well if you put in the time.",
                "Since this course is not going to be offered anymore, I will instead say that any course that Pat teaches is worth taking.",
                "YES!!!! Even though this is the last year of this class :( If you have the chance to take a class with Pat then please do it!! You seriously won't regret it. It is a lot of work but I have made some of my closest friends at Yale through this class by working on weekly PSETs together. All of the ULAs are amazing (especially Matt King!) and they will help you get through the course if you go to office hours consistently.",
                "Yes, but this class is a LOT of work. Assuming you dont already know proofs and linear algebra, only take this class if you are willing for this class to be one of your most time consuming classes.",
                "Yes, especially with Pat Devlin. The material is fairly cool and interesting, and Pat makes this class awesome, even if you don't really care about the class. (Ok, so I guess I'm recommending taking a class with Pat.)",
                "I would. This course is not only very interesting from a learning perspective, but it fosters a great community. The emphasis on group work let me make friends, which was especially important because of COVID.",
                "(Sadly this class will be canceled) Yet definitely if it is offered sometime later. This class suits best students interested in seeing proof-based math. The extensive appearance of proofs helps build one's proving skills and solid knowledge in vector calculus and linear algebra.",
                "Yes! It was lovely to get to connect to a community of peers in math and the professor was amazing. It had a significant workload though, which was fine during the pandemic, but make sure you're ready to commit that much time to the class.",
                "100%, but it is quite rigorous and thorough, so students should be prepared for that. Pat is a gem, and the course is very well-designed. It will be proof-based, which many students aren't necessarily used to, but the course is really dedicated to helping students learn to write proofs and think like mathematicians. Even though this class isn't being offered next semester, I would definitely recommend friends to take a class with Pat, as he really helped invigorate my interest in math through the 230/231 sequence.",
                "I've read some student reviews on Coursetable suggesting that this course is only worth taking if you plan to major in math or if you're deeply interested in pure math. I'm a humanities kid at heart, and I don't plan to major in math. But I like solving problems, and I like the process of figuring out a logical way to get from point A to point B. If that sounds like you -- in other words, if you enjoy math in any capacity and think you're okay at it -- I don't think there's any reason for you not to take the class, with the possible exception of the workload.",
                "Strongly recommend; in spite of the challenge, Pat makes this course incredibly rewarding through the myriad of extra support opportunities.",
                "Yes absolutely! This is a wonderful introduction to the math major at Yale, both academically and socially.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student considering studies in pure or applied mathematics or anyone that enjoys mathematical problem solving and wants accelerated completion of introductory real analysis, multivariable calculus and linear algebra.",
                "Yes! Learning how to prove things is awesome, and the course was an unbelievable amount of fun! Ill recommend this course to everyone as long as Im alive.",
                "I would absolutely recommend 230/231 (it's sad that it won't be offered in this form next year). It's so satisfying to learn things in a proof-based context.",
                "good course but can be a lot of work sometimes",
                "definitely a challenge",
                "I would most definitely recommend this course, as you will end up learning a lot of information at a very digestible pace, and there's a lot of leeway for if you're confused and need to catch up",
                "Yes, I feel like I understand multi variable calculus and linear algebra a lot better.",
                "Yes! Professor Devlin was amazing and made the class so interesting. There are a ton of opportunities to meet other students and to learn about math. The workload is quite challenging so be sure not to pad your schedule with other heavy workload classes.",
                "Yes! Ha sike you can't take it anymore!",
                "Yes! Even with the huge workload and time needed, sometimes spent just staring at a problem or getting stuck on a misunderstood definition for hours, in the end, the class and the assignments were very fulfilling for me. I think an in-person class would amplify these best parts and also decrease the pressure I sometimes felt when I thought I was the only one struggling to finish problems when others really felt the same. If you're looking to get some hard but fair work and to gain more appreciation for math, take the class!"
