                "What didn't I! It was so great to be able to take a class about Latin America from the perspective of not just Latin American prof and TFs but also having our readings be from Latin American scholars. Being able to engage with history from a non Eurocentric or US-focuses view was amazing",
                "During these course I dived into my own blood, my own history, music, aesthetic and forgotten dialogues. \r\nI gained knowledge of film I had never seen, talked about or heard about before, I also learned to sing with no shame and to search for music deep in the history of my country.",
                "I gained knowledge of the liberation movements in the 1960s in Latin America, and beyond. I both learned about the historical significance of these movements, such as from the unit on the Non-Aligned Movement and the Tricontinental, and about philosophy behind these movements, such as in the reading of Fanon and Freire. I improved my writing skills, both when completing the archival research paper and the critical paper on liberation assignments. Additionally, I gained additional skills communicating about readings and archival research, when completing the presentation in section and the presentation of my archival research paper.",
                "I gained knowledge about Latin American leftism, literature, and culture. I polished skills of writing an archival paper and digesting historical material.",
                "Comprehensive study of Latin American movements, political figures, arts, and social theory of the 1960s w/ connections to the modern day",

                "I learned a lot in this class",
                "Readings and histories on radical latin american movements as well as the political contexts in which they emerged.",
                "I learned about Latin American revolutions in the 1960s, yes, but also so much more. The breadth of materials that this course seeks to cover is very ambitious, and sometimes it is successful, and other times, not so much. We engage film, literature, Marxist/socialist/decolonial theory, theater, music, and art in the same course. This course is definitely breadth over depth.",
                "A lot of post colonial theory and Latin American History as it relates to the 60s.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the readings were engaging and class discussions/section was always interesting. Student input was super valued and you can tell everyone was just as invested in the discussion",
                "I wished the course could have been at an earlier time, so I would have personally been more engaged.",
                "A strength of this course was the organization of assignments. It was useful for students to be able to choose when they will have their presentation in section and archival research paper and presentation, because they were able to chose a time that works best with their schedules, and during which they could put the effort and time into their assignments that the assignments required of them. The other deadlines were clearly communicated, including the deadline for the critical paper on liberation and final project. A weakness of this course was the workload, particularly the amount of readings that was assigned. Most weeks, the amount of pages of reading that were assigned exceeded the typical reading load for a humanities course in Yale College, and made it difficult for students to truly understand and analyze what they were reading, given the large number of pages assigned. Additionally, the directions for some assignments were not very specific and lacked clarity. Although this gave flexibility for students to pick and chose what to focus on for their assignments, it did not make the expectations behind the student work clear.",
                "A couple of major strengths of the course are the classroom environment and the syllabus; the readings were always interesting and worth it. A fault is the organizational structure. It seems to me that in the past, the course agenda was crafted with the thought in mind that students would want to stay past the class time to continue discussion and learning, and so by the time class was over this past semester, we would not be near to done with the scheduled events. I think it's fair to have after-class discussion for people who want it, but I don't think it's the best model to account for students wanting to be there for that time, especially considering it's a class that ends at 8:50 at night. The course would benefit from organizational streamlining so that determining logistics doesn't take up class time, and a simplified, realistic agenda so that people don't feel they're missing out if they leave at the time the class is supposed to end, presenters don't get cut off, and there's class time reserved for the discussions that are supposed to happen.",
                "Strengths: great course material and readings, supportive TAs\r\nWeaknesses: the discussions in class were a little disorganized at times and I felt that both the students and the TFs were often burdened with having to interpret the overall takeaways. I also felt that this class went on longer than needed, which was especially tricky due to it being held from 7-9pm",
                "I thought that the texts that this course covers are very strong. Section was also always very helpful. I liked the variety of types of assignments and works that we covered. I think that class time could be more focused and I would have appreciated more lectures from Moira. I also thought that sometimes the readings were overwhelming when we were assigned an entire long book in a week, and it was helpful on weeks when the readings were more focused or we were told some places to focus.",
                "This class was perfect as is. I loved how engaged the professor and TFs were in the class. They really embodied the ideal learning experience at yale. Yale needs more classes like this.",
                "This course is definitely unlike any course. You will feel like you are in a classroom of people who are very interested in debates and passionate about having a conversation. One weakness is that the class can be a very big time commitment which is helpful but hard to maintain along with other obligations throughout the semester.",
                "Needs to have more structure. Professor and team could really do more presentations and help set up the context better, class goes way too over.",
                "We cover a large breadth of content, but it is a bit disorganised. However, I really, really appreciated the diversity of disciplines we explored music, theater, film, literature, etc.",
                "Its a lot of class time and work. Certainly not a fifth class. Very involved. If youre willing to commit to it, Moira is a wonderful teacher and theres a lot to learn.",
                "The course content was mind-blowing and Moira is an awe-inspiring professor to be around. At times, it felt a bit rushed and disorganized. I wish we spent more time on Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Class time was not effectively used at times. Small group discussions in class wouldve been helpful. Presentations every week became monotonous.",
                "I thought the choice of texts was really great, and enjoyed the way in which it brought us to consider such different mediums and regions each week. However, I wished that the main class had been slightly more organized, as sometimes it seemed to go off track and I wished that we had been able to spend more time discussing the actual readings/films.",
                "The texts we read were a strength, sometimes time management in lecture was a weakness as we would not get to elements of the agenda."

                "Yes!! Moira and the teaching team are great and I only wish I could take this course on its own so that I could spend all my attention on it because there's so much that we mentioned and thought about that there just isn't time to do it all!",
                "Absolutely, Latin American history and culture is now widely known to a US audience. I was please to encounter several US citizens in the class, with insightful perspectives and insight.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. The workload and amount of readings that were assigned during the course of the semester made it difficult to do all of the readings, considering that students frequently also took other high workload classes at the same time. Additionally, the time that the seminar was held, from 7-9pm is not the time that is most conducive for students' learning. Since the class was a seminar but had more people than the average seminar class, over twenty, it was difficult for some students to participate during the course of the seminar, and there was oftentimes not enough time to fully discuss the readings that the students did. The content of the course was very interesting, and the readings were carefully chosen and fascinating, however.",
                "Yes; Professor Fradinger and the teaching team offer to the course a knowledge base that is very hard to find anywhere else at Yale, and they create a very unique classroom environment that I think is worth experiencing. I would recommend this course to students with the grain of salt that the structure and logistics of the course aren't always the clearest and can sometimes take some patience to navigate.",
                "If they are interested in the subject matter and enjoy discussion-style format, then yes; I do think that some of these concepts would have been better discussed in a lecture style.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the material but there were a few times when I was frustrated with the level of organization and didn't feel like I was getting much out of class time.",
                "Yes. Any student with an interest in the intersection between art/language and politics or Latin America needs to take this class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the material you are exposed to and the way it is presented are unlike any other yale college course. You might have to take more initiative on the readings themselves if you want to understand them more as in class discussions were relevant but a  bit tangential to the readings themselves.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in the region.",
                "Any opportunity you have to take a course with Moira-- go for it! You are absolutely in for an adventure in this class, it is more of an experience than it is an academic course honestly, but I really, really appreciated that.",
                "Yes if youre willing to take a course that will take up a lot of time.",
                "Yes!! This course is and will be one that I remember for the rest of my life. Although it was at times disorganized, Moira will be your guide through a world that our neoliberal education complex has never shown you. Please take this course! You wont regret it!",
                "I have told multiple people that they have to take a class with Moria before they graduate, and if it weren't for the time would have told them they had to find a way to take this one. This class is unlike anything else you can take at Yale in so many ways -- most importantly, I don't think anybody else could have pulled off a 30-person seminar with discussion sections. But most importantly, I felt cared for in this class, both by the teaching team and the other students. There were some times that I felt like I was coming home when I walked (all the way up) to Watson for the seminar. I haven't talked about any of what the class was on (and we read some life-changing books), because I would recommend taking this class almost regardless of what it was on."
