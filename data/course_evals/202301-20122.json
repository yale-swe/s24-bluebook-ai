                "The most serious weakness of this course is the overambition of the workload. It expects a lot out of students, to the point that I would only expect someone whose main area of study was the French language to do that much French. Because of this, students try and find ways to tactically cut down on how much of the work they do. It would be better to have less work that students do consistently and find valuable enough to complete.",
                "I liked the variety of media we consumed (including many books and a few movies) but at some points in the course you end up doing almost the same thing everyday with grammar worksheets and discussion questions."

                "I wouldn't recommend it, but the language requirement demands this level of course from most students. I would advise most students to steer clear of the French track for the language requirement completely, due to how much trouble it is compared to other departments.",
                "Yes! This was one of my favorite courses this semester because I loved seeing my class everyday and developing a group friendship dynamic. It was great to practice my French in both a casual and academic setting which this class provided. Along with grammar practice and reading, we also discussed and talked throughout the class."
