                "The strength of this course is Prof. Qiu. She is incredibly organized and her lecture/notes are very clear. You can tell that she is always prepared for class. If you need help outside of class, there is plenty of support from ULAs and TAs, and Prof. Qiu will also help you herself during her office hours. She is also super understanding. I also really appreciated being able to have one page of any notes to bring to exams because it greatly reduced the stress during exams.  If you can, take MENG 280 with Prof. Qiu!",
                "The material was very well organized and well taught but it would have helped to have recordings of the lecture so that it would be easier to listen back to the full analysis and derivation of certain problems rather than trying to figure it out from the notes.",
                "Prof Qiu is a great lecturer, psets and exams directly reflect lecture content.",
                "A strength is the course is very tied to the textbook so easy to follow. It could be improved with the classes being recorded as just looking at the notes is tough to follow.",
                "The professor is really great - she actually explains things and hosts regular office hours to go over content. She is incredibly organized which makes the class easy to follow. \r\n\r\nOne thing to change for next year might be to have more interactive example problems for later chapters, there were a lot at the beginning of the term but as the class got more tight with content some of that was cut.",
                "This course has a very reasonable workload, and the classes are straightforward, engaging, and useful for the assignments. The exams are also fair and well written. No immediate weaknesses come to mind for this class.",
                "I think this course was very well organized. The lectures had a good balance of theory and examples, the problem sets were related to what we had learned that week and gave good practice problems to better understand the material, and there were lots of resources (i.e. office hours, review sessions, etc.) to make sure we understood what was going on.",
                "This is a great course, well planned, and builds on the knowledge of each prior unit.",

                "Yes. 280 is a solid class, one of the foundations for MENG students. You receive clear feedback on all the psets and midterms, and the course is well designed with more than enough office hours. The textbook is also useful as a reference and provides very clear background if you're ever confused on a concept. The material/lectures can be a little dry, but it is well taught - only complaint is Diana's chalk drawings can be slightly unclear sometimes. Overall, a very solid engineering class; I did enjoy it.",
                "Yes. I think that this is a genuinely helpful course to think logically about structures and mechanisms in the world all around us. It might be hard to justify putting this amount of effort into a course that isn't for your major, but if they were interested in the subject, it would be a great choice.",
                "This course is necessary to take for mechanical engineers.",

                "Not the easiest class, but well organized and well taught",
                "If it is required for the meche major it is a solid foundational course. If it is not for a major then it isnt necessary to take at all.",
                "YES- especially with Professor Qiu. It is by far one of my favorite engineering classes I have taken so far. The content is interesting and it is well taught.",
                "If you are taking this course, it is almost certainly because you are studying engineering and it is required. That being said, I thought this was a very enjoyable class, particularly with Professor Qiu.",
