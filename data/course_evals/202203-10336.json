Professor Gehlker did a wonderful job of providing different assignments for these areas.\r\n- I had freedom in choosing topics for assignments and researching what I was truly interested in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sometimes, there was too much content to watch or read prior to classes. Sometimes watching movies or videos can be done while doing other tasks, but doing so in another language requires a lot of focus. Sometimes we had to watch 2+ hours of a movie per course.",
