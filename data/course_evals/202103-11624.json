                "Learning another language really means stepping out of my comfort zones for me, and I am deeply grateful for the kind feedback and support coming from both the professor and my classmates. I have more confidence when tackling the unknowns, witness ardent improvement in my speaking, listening, and writing skills, and can have fairly natural conversations with others in Japanese. I also gain more profound insights into the cultural heritages of Japan and get to derive the linguistic connectivity between Japanese and other Asian languages which truly broaden my perspectives.",

                "I gained a solid understanding of introductory Japanese material, including grammar, the hiragana and katakana alphabets, some kanji, and basic cultural information which could be explored within the scope of such introductory language skills. I can describe basics of appearance, personal description, location, position, number, color, activity in tenses of past, present\/general, and the resultant state.",

                "By the end of this course I was able to fluently read and write hiragana and katakana, and basic kanji. I was also able to hold simple conversations in Japanese."

                "Strengths: exceptional professor (Yamaguchi-sensei); highly organized for efficient, but not overwhelming, learning; seminar-size classes & daily group practice allow for bonding with classmates; built-in clinic to answer any extra questions one might have (and meet new friends!)\r\nWeaknesses: I only wish there was more listening practice to supplement our reading and writing worksheets.",
                "The course is excellent as is, although it does move through the content very quickly.",
                "The instructor was clear at explaining things. The fact that the class meets everyday is helpful.",
                "About the strengths, I appreciate all the resources available and the Japanese departments efforts to hold diverse events for the students. Yamaguchi-sensei is extremely supportive - her lectures are engaging with fun activities and creative assignments. Overall, the course is well-organized and truly a wonderful learning experience.\r\nAbout the weaknesses, I would love to have more practice sheets that touch up on the earlier units grammar and vocabulary, and listening practices that resemble the structure of the unit exams more. Furthermore, I want to see more cultural aspects of Japan to be incorporated into the lessons.",
                "- too fast and overwhelming. too many different assignments with a large weight due in the same period of time. no room for mistakes",
                "The Tobira textbook, to me, was fine, but I have heard gripes, especially considering that the next textbook is only available in Pilot version. Just as well, I have heard that fluent Japanese speakers find the textbook strange\/confusing, but I am sure it is quite subjective. I have not struggled due to the textbook, and so much of the learning is through in-person instruction, so I am not concerned but I am unsure how this may have impacted students less capable than I. Strengths are that while there is often homework, which is necessary for an introductory language course considering the new characters we must learn, actual large assignments are spread out quite evenly by lesson. Tests and major projects, even in the same lesson, typically have a day or two between them, which is good to allow students to focus on one, and then have time to shift gears and work on the other.",
                "The strengths of this class included the cultural immersion, the partner-based learning, the class size, and the homework assignments. The only weakness was that initially it seemed a bit stiff, a big philosophy for me when learning a language is to learn it like a child. I wish there were more games we had played in Japanese.",
                "A strength of this course is that the instructor creates an environment where students are highly engaged with the topic and other students, which allowed me to quickly be able to improve my Japanese. This course also provides a lot of support, from office hours, to office hours, to outside resources. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course would be that students are expected to learn most of the material from videos, rather than in class, so it is difficult to ask questions as they arise. I also wish we could learn hiragana and katakana at the same time, as I felt like katakana was a lot harder to learn than hiragana, yet it did not receive as much attention."

                "This class is an ideal introduction to learning Japanese, since daily practice will hone your writing and speaking abilities rapidly. It requires significant investment, but the rewards (realizing every week how much you're learning and improving rapidly every week) are beyond worthwhile. If you want to embark on learning Japanese, this course (especially if taught by Yamaguchi-sensei) is the ideal first stepping stone on your journey.",
                "Yes. For anyone who wants to learn Japanese this is the best way.",
                "The course was very interesting. Highly recommended.",
                "if they have experience learning japanese-- yes. most students in the class had already taken some japanese, and as a complete beginner i felt overwhelmed and not good enough to the rest of the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested and have a knack for language study, or will work hard to offset that. I feel like people who struggle in this course may do so because foreign language study is difficult for them, and not necessarily due to a core flaw within the lessons or instruction. That said, a student who works hard and is interested will likely succeed just as much as one who gets it more quickly. Japanese is not the language to take if you want an easy language credit with minimal work, but it is quite enjoyable to learn, in my opinion. Therefore, if the person wants to learn, they should take the course. But if they want an easy language credit and are otherwise uninterested, they may want to consider another language.",
                "Yes, Yamaguchi-sensei is a wonderful person and you will grow to like her even more throughout your course!",
                "I would recommend this course to whoever is deeply interested in learning  about Japanese language."
