                "The range of speakers was excellent. I liked the focus on connecting your next career steps with what qualities strengthen you. Although there were fewer virtual classes, when it was over zoom I found it difficult to stay engaged. It would be helpful in the future to keep all classes in person, even if that means the speaker is on zoom but the students are watching together in the classroom. Also, the idea of a final pitch presentation was nice and low stress, but I think it would have been fun to do it in person.",
                "Strengths of this course include the low stress approach, personal stories of successful speakers, and opportunities for attempting a project. I honestly cant really think of many weaknesses. This class did what it aimed to do, and Professor Tietjen taught it well.",
                "Really great course!!! Alot of self reflection, and you get to see lots of perspectives",
                "I loved having all the speakers and the relaxed nature of the course. I would say that the low-stakes environment was much appreciated by many.",
                "Many of the assignments were less structured than I would like. In addition, notifications about lecturers, assignments, and events often came the day of with little notice. The strengths was definitely the exposure and the people we were able to meet and talk to. Many doctors, CEOs, CFOs, and CMOs, a range of all titles and positions."
