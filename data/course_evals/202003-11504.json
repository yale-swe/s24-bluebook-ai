                "I learned a lot about the place of music theory in academia; we had many discussions analyzing and critiquing the role of the discipline in upholding antiquated, oppressive structures. After taking this class, I feel better prepared to serve as a music theorist for the future, understanding what progress still needs to be made in the field and how we can make positive change. Props to Professor Conlee for being able to work such important discussions into this aural skills course! I also got better at singing random chromatic note sequences, which has been helpful in learning to \"audiate\" music in my other music theory courses.",
                "I gained a knowledge of many of the labels and frameworks using for understanding harmony and the skills for hearing, analyzing, and embodying them. In addition, I gained a more thoughtful perspective on the cultural theory of how these frameworks come to be in the first place and the hidden curriculum and societal structures that shaped them. Because of this, I gained hands-on experience and a critical lens that went far above and deeply enriched the basic survey of harmonic concepts that I expected.",

                "The varied activities - dictation, sight-singing, musical arranging\/reharmonization, readings\/discussions, presentations - not only helped me practice concepts and succeed but also were consistently challenging and fun. I would have liked to delve even deeper into certain aspects as a whole class, such as Neo-Riemannian Theory and rhythm, but I wouldn't want this to detract from the cultural theory lessons and certainly the presentations provided excellent forays into advanced topics. Overall, I was thrilled with the huge amount of material and gains in confidence I experienced with not much time and the limits of Zoom. The class presentations and interactive questions were my favorite part. They were extremely clear and engaging.",

                "This was actually one of the very few classes where I felt that I really got to know the professor. We had multiple on-one-one meetings to discuss our midterm and final presentations, and Professor Conlee was always willing to chat before and after class. It was definitely a challenge to do some of the singing exercises over Zoom, but they worked better than I had thought, and Professor Conlee was very careful to make sure that everything we were doing was successful virtually.",
                "I thought singing together (slowly) over Zoom was surprisingly successful and wouldn't have minded seeing it extended to such challenging topics as diminished chords (crazy, I know, but just an idea). At the same time, the creative assignments such as sight singing and recording arrangements with a DAW were perfect and seemed valuable regardless of whether there was a pandemic during the course or not. The use of breakout rooms during class presentations to practice with classmates was fantastic."

                "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student, especially if you are taking it concurrently with MUSI 210 or 211. The topics covered in the course will complement what you are learning in your other music theory courses well. I took this course while taking some more advanced music theory classes, so everything was more or less a review for me, so it wouldn't be my top recommendation for you if you've moved on to more advanced theory (even though Professor Conlee did provide ample opportunities for more advanced students to grow). The critical humanism aspects of the course were really valuable, though, even if the theory wasn't super advanced. The workload is really low, so you could definitely take this class as an extra half-credit.",

                "Yes! Great way to learn more about music theory and hear better",
                "Yes! This is a really good and practical course that can improve your ability to hear and analyze music. Super useful for any musician. Workload is commensurate to a half-credit course but is actually helpful for learning."
