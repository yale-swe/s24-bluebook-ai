                "I came in knowing very little, if at all anything, about imaging, and it was frankly a little daunting. With the help of the professors, especially Professor Rothman, I left knowing much more about a wide range of imaging techniques (MRI, fMRI, PET, FRET, etc.) and the math behind it. Especially with the help of the psets, supportive structure of the class, and willingness of the professors to work with students, I learned about the advantages and limitations of relevant imaging techniques in medicine, as well as the concepts that are behind them.",

                "The overall course was great. The professors really love what they teach. Professor Rothman is wonderful, always providing problem solving sessions for PSETs and exams. The only improvement would be to have the assignments revised before being given to students, though that's not the end of the world. The problem solving sessions provide a great time to catch any typos and missing information.",
                "Strengths: rothman is the BEST professor - he is always available, providing office hours each week to help with both problem sets and take home assignments. He makes the class worth taking because the actual material can feel very difficult and dry at times. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the actual material is very difficult and sometimes lectures were a bit dull since the presentations were filled with lots of words. A lot of concepts flew over my head, but luckily the professors (specifically Dr. Rothman) are so helpful, so you can succeed!",
                "I think the course is organized well and the homework and exams are very fair. The take-home format was great as it allowed me to really engage with the material I didn't always understand the first time around and rewarded me for trying to learn it again rather than punishing me for not grasping important new concepts right away.",
                "A good about of work load, and good material but some aspects felt redundant.",
                "The biggest strengths for this course was the engagement with it and developing the knowledge about imaging. The homework helped us to use the knowledge and better understand the subjects.\r\nThe weakness of this course is that it is a requirement even for the students with no interest or related research in imaging."
