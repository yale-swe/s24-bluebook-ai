A lot of guidance. The schedule of this course was also constantly adjusted based on what we were able to get through in class; everything felt very structured without being inflexible.\r\nWeaknesses: none",

                "really passionate instructors, i just feel like the grading/assignment assigning timeline and schedule was a bit disorganized and i didnt always leave class knowing what i needed to work on next and where to start, maybe this content is good to teach in more of a 1.5 credit, lab oriented setting as opposed to just 2x a week meeting",

                "Yes. It really does give you a good overview of the research process and you actually get to practice conducting research and designing studies which is pretty cool.",
