Although I anticipated the history part of the course to be unexciting, professor Mattingly presented the concepts in such a way that made them applicable to modern day China. This allowed for those concepts to be carried through the whole semester, which allowed for greater retention of the material. We also developed decision making, quick thinking, and public speaking skills (especially from the final simulations, in which each student was assigned a political figure in a mock Politburo meeting in response to a crisis involving China).",
                "This is a crash course on Chinese history, from early ancient Chinese history and philosophy to modern history. It makes you look at Chinese history from the lens of the Century of Humiliation, Confucianism, Dictator's dilemma\/ authoritarian & totalitarian rulers' relationship with peasants and elites, and some other basic frameworks. There are interesting town halls with former foreign diplomats, reporters, and think tank researcher that was very fascinating, and you got to submit questions for the town halls. The readings were well spaced and interesting. I think the course did a fine job of having this big framework to look at China while looking at the smaller things as well in the readings and discussions.",

            "comments": [
                "I LOVED the flipped classroom, particularly for this topic. I didn't know much coming in, but Professor Mattingly's lectures along with the readings gave me plenty to confidently engage in section.",
                "Live lecture would have been more engaging.",
                "strengths: virtual town halls with outside guests who are super knowledgable and passionate about Chinese politics, very interesting lectures and slides (really opened my eyes to everything about China), professor Mattingly is very knowledgable and passionate about China, interesting readings although a bit too much reading load, the professor and course materials were pretty unbiased \r\nweaknesses: did not find my TA to be helpful or useful whether it be writing my response papers or just help with class materials, I wish professor Mattingly held office hours, discussion sections can be boring",
                "The content of this course was very engaging. However, the fact that we were asked to watch about 1 hour's worth of recorded lectures (not including the time it takes to take notes), read the course readings well enough to answer weekly reading quizzes, attend a weekly discussion section, and show up to a town hall once a week was actually quite time-consuming and demanding. You'll learn a lot, but this class is a lot more work than it initially appeared to me.",
                "Strengths - well-organized prerecorded lectures \r\nWeaknesses - low student participation during Town Halls and sections",
                "Strengths: \r\n- town hall with interesting guest speakers \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- a lot of assignments",
                "Strengths: great professor, very helpful TAs, truly interesting content. The organization of course materials is very logical and flows well. The final crisis simulation is a lot of fun while also integrating materials from the course. Workload is very manageable (after section presentations were cancelled).\r\nNot really any weaknesses. It's a great class!",
                "Strengths: Professor Mattingly is engaging and I enjoyed the recorded lectures. We touched on all of the topics that are relevant right now regarding China. A lot of the readings were interesting too although I think a couple were overly long\/detailed and could be eliminated. The weekly quizzes were easy if you did the readings. The final simulation was relatively straightforward and fun, although everyone seemed to do well so I am unsure of how it will be graded.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At first the sections were not standardized. I found out that my section was way harder than others in that we had to do occasional powerpoint presentations that weren't on the syllabus. Later in the semester we did away with these presentations and I believe the sections became more similar to one another, but next time this should be the case from the beginning.",
                "The professor was extremely engaging and taught well. I thought the final simulation at the end was interesting.",
                "The lectures, townhalls, and sections complement each other well. The syllabus is well-structured. The readings are interesting.",
                "I loved this course. China is on the rise and this course really makes you get an overall idea of how this is happening",
                "The course was a nice mix between recorded and live material in light of Covid-19 and I liked having the recorded lectures there to refer back to when completing assignments. All announcements were sent out very promptly and questions about the course were answered clearly. The content of the course was also engaging to anyone who is interesting in comparative politics and current events in politics, which I think is more relevant than ever now.",
                "Strengths great content, very interesting and enjoyable to learn about. Recorded lectures are absolutley integral to student learning during the pandemic. The town halls were amazing too (little to worry about for us students and allowed for a time that we could sit back, relax, and learn about interesting people\/topics). Personally I thought this class was the best class for pandemic learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses none.",
                "This course was really interesting and provided a great insight into China, a growing global power. All the topics we covered were really interesting and Professor Mattingly explained the concepts really well in his mini-lectures. The town halls and guest speakers were all fascinating and gave new valuable perspectives to the things we were learning.",
                "I enjoyed it overall. Great class.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings and lectures, a wide array of topics. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Mattingly is a great lecturer. He is also young and energetic and his passion\/knowledge about China is evident. The pre-recorded lectures were always great and I appreciated that I could watch them in my own time at my own pace. The workload is pretty heavy, but very manageable. \r\nNo weaknesses.",
                "I really loved the layout of the course. It's really smart to start with some background in Chinese history before delving into the modern day. I honestly didn't get that much out of the town halls and probably would've just preferred more lecture from the professor instead of bringing in experts.",
                "Grading structure was moved around a bit a couple times to standardize things across sections (probably a good thing). Curve is fairly generous. You can drop your bottom two quizzes but the quizzes are straightforward anyway. Teaching staff is SUPER receptive to feedback. No exams, just three short response papers (they have a clear rubric and TAs are happy to advise) and a fairly fun final simulation  Im not your typical MUN\/ debate type but I just prepared in advance and still really enjoyed it!",
                "Strengths: Very relevant course material and interesting sets of readings to accompany what we cover; in many ways, the course is grounded around understanding Xi Jinping and the last 10-15 years in China (while overviewing the historical context that helps explain contemporary China) which is a fascinating subject of study; doesn't involve anything too theoretical, a pro for me; Prof. Mattingly is great professor, knowledgeable, makes engaging lecture slides that integrate great photos and multimedia, always interesting to hear him share observations on China; Professor Mattingly also did a great job taking advantage of Zoom to invite lots of guest speakers -- we heard from New York Times\/Wall Street Journal journalists, other academics, former diplomats pretty much once a week in short 25-minute talks on Zoom. Weaknesses: While I really liked my TF, I often felt that section discussion was very broad and just feel unproductive\/uninspiring; I think feedback could have been a little more direct when it came to response papers and progress in the course. I'm leaving with a lot of new knowledge but maybe not much progress on reading\/writing skills, which is fine.",
                "Strengths, Professor Mattingly is very respectful of your time, so keeps lectures at the corresponding length. The speakers give you insight into contemporary politics. Weaknesses, there weren't a lot of instructions for response papers, and the point of section wasn't clear and it was often unrelated to class.",
                "Amazing course! It was fantastically structured, the material and the readings were fascinating, and I learned a lot. It was also very well-adapted to the online format, which I really appreciated.",
                "This was honestly a really great course. I learned a lot and can't think of any major improvements. The only thing was that the readings often weren't fully covered in section so it felt like I was doing unnecessary work each week.",
                "Incredible, very engaging and well-structured to facilitate student learning",
                "Strengths: weekly town halls with a variety of guests. reasonable and clear recorded lectures\r\nWeaknesses: final crisis simulation was unnecessarily long and felt almost like busy-work while preparing for it. very vague grading rubric that leaves a lot for grading inconsistency. some of the readings were also not particularly interesting\/very long.",
                "Strengths: Syllabus followed everything that was prefaced on first day. Speakers were very relevant, prominent and diverse. Content allowed for discourse and provocation of further thought. Weaknesses: Too much grading power given to a Teaching Fellow who may greatly differ from his\/her\/their peers on what is a good Response paper. Response papers also extremely vague in terms of expectations despite information on it.",
                "Strengths was for sure the recorded lectures. They were exceptionally clear. I just think maybe a bit too many. Section wasn't particularly useful. You could get by in the course without really paying attention there. I thought the final crisis simulation didn't add to my understanding of the material at all. The quizzes at the beginning of the course were unfair and difficult, but they got much better at the end which I appreciated.",
                "Strengths: extremely relevant course material, top-notch guest speakers, highly diverse reading list, excellent professor. Final simulation was much preferable to an exam and enabled critical interaction with entire course material. \r\nWeaknesses: town hall meetings with guests were often only around 30 minutes long, too short to have meaningful and in-depth conversations. Lacking medium to interact with Prof. Mattingly except in office hours, assignments didn't really require holistic view of course materials.",
                "Weakness: long readings\r\nStrengths: interesting readings and amazing lecture material",
                "I learned a lot from this course and Prof. Mattingly is an excellent lecturer, even in a virtual format. However, some of the readings were really long and not very well-connected to the mini-lectures, especially the ones that you had to write a reflection paper on. I received a lot of mixed messages on how to write the reflection papers for this course, so that made it difficult to do well. Prof. Mattingly brought in some great guest speakers, but there was not much time to discuss their lectures, even in discussion section. Overall, I learned a lot in this course, but we barely skimmed the surface of Chinese history\/politics\/current events.",
                "This was one of few courses I've ever taken at Yale that had manageable readings.",
                "Strengths: good lectures, well-structured sections, interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: bias grading system (all grades are determined by the TF, and it varies a lot), very little guidance is offered on response papers (and they make up a large part of the grade)",
                "Response paper assignment was vague and reading quizzes were unfair",
                "I loved the weekly discussion section and the rotation of weekly speakers. Both of these elements afforded me the opportunity to really dive in and learn from professionals about the things going on in real time.\r\nSticking closer to the 60 minute mark for  the pre-recorded lectures is a potential area of improvement.",
                "The guest speakers and lectures were very well done.",
                "This course was well taught. The reading were interesting and not too long. It might have been nice to have live lectures instead of pre-recorded, but I understand why they were recorded.",
                "Very engaging lectures",
                "Strengths: content is really interesting, professor is great, and the course structure is great. Loved the town halls and the recorded mini lectures, which were well-delivered, clear, and engaging. Readings felt relevant for the most part, and the quantity of reading was very manageable, especially if you've done some humanities before (e.g., Directed Studies).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion section was slightly annoying\/boring, though it wasn't the fault of the teaching staff. The section was par for the course as far as humanities sections go. Many of the usual humanities discussion section dynamics were present, even in this virtual format. Students tripped over themselves to regurgitate some variant of the same surface-level understanding of the readings to try to impress the TA and get their participation points. Rather than listening to the unoriginal opinions of other undergraduates with a political science background that is functionally equivalent to my own, I would have appreciated hearing more from the TAs, who are serious students of political science and Chinese politics, and who intend to pursue this field as a career.\r\n\r\nThankfully there were few, if any, repetitions of the word \"interesting\" or \"just to jump off\/pirouette\/somersault off of that point\". But maybe this was just a strength of my discussion section.",
                "I think Professor Mattingly did an excellent job tailoring this class to our zoom circumstances. He deserves a lot of credit for constructing brief recorded lectures, using the fact that everything was online to get high-profile guest speakers who wouldn't be accessible in person, and using assessments other than major exams. I think the content of the course was pretty good. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I struggled with was the response papers. I felt like we were given close to zero guidance about what was expected in the response papers, beyond a brief description in the syllabus. It's possible that other TFs set clearer expectations, but mine didn't. I felt like I figured out what the papers were supposed to be like over the course of the semester based on feedback from each one but I could have used clearer guidelines from the start.",
                "This course was very strong in that it covered a ton of essential material via informative material. However, it was a bit disorganized in terms of content delivery, insofar as we had a number of modes of learning (virtual lectures, quizzes, live lectures, guest speakers, readings).",
                "One strength of this course are the brief, yet highly informative \"townhall meetings\" once a week that feature prominent people that are involved in Chinese life and politics. Another strength are the discussion sections, which encourage engagement through open ended questions and allow for debate of the topics. \r\nOne small weakness is the questions on the weekly quizzes - some quizzes had very specific questions that were difficult to answer because of their narrowness. This could be improved (and was improved in the beginning of the semester) by making the quiz questions more general.",
                "Strength: Professor Mattingly, the TAs, the structure of the course, the readings, and the final simulation. The course was well-organized and had engaging lectures, discussions, and town halls.\r\nWeakness: The course might benefit from more clarity and coherence in grading essays among TAs.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly well organized, good TFs, great content, cool guest speakers, final exam format was more interesting\/engaging and less stressful\/intense compared to traditional formats\r\nWeaknesses: generally the same covid-induced weaknesses as other courses",
                "Great overview of a class! Loved how topical it was!",
                "I really enjoyed this course. My TF was fantastic and I like how the class was structured. I would say that I wish we focused on more current events with China. Even though learning about Chinese history was very interesting, I wish there had been more time to go more into depth on topics like technology, especially with AI.",
                "Some strengths were the topics and variety of the readings, although some of them were a little too long and seemed like we could get the same info out of one page that we read in 40.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures because they were easy to refer back to.",
                "I really enjoyed the course and there were a lot of guest lecturers that were very engaging. The assignments are spread out and the final is a lot more interesting than a usual final. Weakness is that the weekly quizzes are very limited for time.",
                "Strength: good reading, interesting guest lecturers and topics, engaged professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TA-led discussions and recorded lectures were sometimes redundant (I felt like the reading was the most valuable part of the course).  I also wish that the class offered a writing credit option to improve writing skills.  Finally, I think the town halls with guest speakers had the potential to be really valuable but I often felt like it was only a few specific questions that were asked.\r\n\r\nTo improve this course, I would say it should focus on improving writing, have more direction for the town halls, and try to make the recorded lectures more interesting\/less redundant to the readings.",
                "Strengths: Professor Mattingly is hands down one of the strengths of this course. He is super energetic about the material and is a very good lecturer! The slides were very informative and helpful!\r\n\r\nWeakness: You are required to write 3 response papers for this course in response to your choice of assigned readings. There seemed to be little guidance for the first paper, which led to some personal confusion on how to format and write the paper. But after receiving feedback on the first paper, the next two were not nearly as confusing. A more detailed explanation on what is expected on the response papers would have been a bit helpful!",
                "It was a very well taught course. I think a weakness was the range in TA strictness.",
                "This was an excellent course. Not suggestions.",
                "Strength: The mini-lectures were really well done\r\nWeakness: I think the class would have benefited from some additional instructor-class discussion after interviewees logged off (i.e., more than just the optional Q&A)",
                "Overall, very solid course."

            "comments": [
                "Virtual lecture gave the oppurtunity to have great guests in this class.",
                "This course had a combination of recorded lectures, virtual discussion section, and live virtual town halls\/lectures, so there are many different forms of virtual engagement. It was all very interesting, but it was a lot of work.",
                "Succeeded - prerecorded lectures\r\nNeed improvement - facilitating meaningful discussion during Town Hall and section to generate better collective understanding of course material",
                "I thought the town hall was successful. \r\nThe recorded lectures were very well done but I dont feel like the format in general is very conducive to learning and engagement",
                "The pre-recorded lectures + live town hall format is a good adaptation to the pandemic, as it allows great flexibility for students and also encourages interaction. The guest lectures are always insightful, and I'm almost glad that the pandemic allowed for so many opportunities for speakers to come. The crisis simulation for the final is an absolute gem, and I wish more classes do this.",
                "The recorded lectures and live sections\/town halls were effective.",
                "I think the set up was good as is.",
                "Recorded lectures are helpful.",
                "discussion sections were an awesome way to discuss the readings and share ideas",
                "Again, the recorded lectures were nice to refer back to even if we could not attend the live lectures that week. I liked how guest speakers were still brought in during live classes despite everything being online, and this made these classes very engaging.",
                "Strengths Recorded lectures were amazing (much much better than having to take notes on a live zoom call). Town halls were very interesting and having only 1-2 synchronous calls a week was great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses none",
                "This course worked surprisingly well virtually. The prerecorded mini-lectures did a good job of covering the material and it was nice to be able to learn the material on my own time. And, being virtual allowed the course to have a lot of really interesting guest speakers.",
                "I didn't like online engagement with the course, but that's something not within the control of the professor.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were great. I also liked the format of the final exam which was a live simulation of the Chinese government over Zoom.",
                "It was really cool that he mixed virtual town halls with recorded lectures. However, I feel like I didn't really get as much as I should've out of the town halls because they were quite short, and sometimes I didn't know what was so special about the person being brought in.",
                "All good here. Didnt feel like I missed out on anything because of the virtual format.",
                "Taking advantage of Zoom to invite cool guest speakers almost every Monday was a huge asset of the course. Especially enjoyed hearing from China journalists like Paul Mozur, Bob Davis, Lingling Wei. I thought the recorded modules worked well, but there's also something I missed about not having more live components with the full lecture. Learning asynchronously, in my experience, works just as well (and sometimes better) but is less engaging and a little more lonely, even when live lectures simply mean more boxes on a Zoom call. One idea is to maybe host the lecture modules live on Zoom, but make them optional and record them so that students who want a live lecture and students who want a recorded lecture can get both?",
                "The recorded lectures and townhall format worked well. I would discourage breakout rooms during the large town hall but suggest having a few minutes for check-in with peers at the beginning of section. Other classes of mine did it and it was great.",
                "The recorded and live component worked very well together, and it felt engaging even though it was a very large class.",
                "Pre-recorded lectures were well-organized and matched well with the readings, I also really enjoyed the alternative assignments to typical exams - such as the response papers and crisis simulation final",
                "Successes: I like the mix of pre-recorded lectures and live, virtual town halls. Added up to be about the same as two weekly class meetings.\r\n\r\nAreas for Improvement: I didn't feel like I got much out of section. The discussion often felt forced (doing it for the participation grade) and repetitive. Since weekly topics are broad, I understand that we can't cover everything in section. That being said, the chosen sub-topics for section discussion often felt like the least relevant parts of the weekly subject. Overwhelmingly focused on political theory over PRC-specific topics.",
                "I think professor mattingly was exceptionally open to feedback and adjusting the course because of the pandemic which I appreciated greatly. I think weekly quizzes are a bit too much in the middle of a pandemic, but maybe that is just me.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures were a highly convenient format for learning and the virtual town hall meetings were great in that they enabled us to have guest speakers from further afield. \r\nVirtual sections could be smoother, but a lot of that is students' responsibility. The final simulation was great but would be even better in person. If the simulation were to be held on Zoom again, I would suggest that the course staff encourage everyone to get more in character, which would make the experience much more powerful and memorable.",
                "Prof. Mattingly's asynchronous lectures and guest town halls were very effective -- the former gives you ample time to develop your notes and process the information being presented, while the latter offers the opportunity to hear from some truly engaging people who are experts on China from a variety of perspectives. Sections, due to their virtual nature, did suffer a bit from a lack of organic and free-flowing discussion, though this seems to be a trend in classes across the board.",
                "The online mini-lectures were actually very enjoyable (more so than other classes that use the same format) and the embedded quizzes in the video helped keep you focused. It would be helpful though if the slides were uploaded separately from the lecture as well. There was little live-lecturing done by Professor Mattingly and I wish there was more, but he made good use of the ability to bring in guest speakers. I really liked the final, which was a virtual simulation. It was a great use of zoom.",
                "I thought this class adapted well to the pandemic",
                "Town halls were a waste",
                "Live town halls and zoom discussion sections were particularly effective. Having professionals come in to talk about their work is a golden opportunity and setting aside time to allow students to talk through assigned readings is vital to getting a lot out of the course. Final simulation was super fun and was actually a great non-orthodox way to learn about the inner workings of the government systems.",
                "I really liked the format of this course, especially the guest speakers.",
                "The discussion sections were helpful in having intimate discussion, which is good since this class was large.",
                "Good length of recorded lectures, reasonable amount of time spent watching lectures.  Virtual sections are tough and awkward",
                "The professor had a good balance between prerecorded lectures and synchronous guest speaker events to keep our attention. Weekly quizzes on lecture and reading content kept us on track! In all I felt that the covid-19 changes were successful.",
                "The town halls with prominent figures in Sinology were an excellent way to take advantage of Yale's current online setting. The recorded lectures, on the other hand, while informative, were too much. I found it tremendously hard to engage with them, even when the material was compelling. Furthermore, almost all my professors covered WAY more content in recorded lectures than in a normal lecture, meaning that I often had to pause and replay in order to take comprehensive notes, meaning that I spent probably more time listening to recorded lectures than the time normally allotted for in-person classtimes. This isn't a huge drawback, just something for prospective students to be mindful of",
                "The virtual discussion sections succeeded in allowing for virtual engagement because my TA encouraged open conversation and debates of the specific weekly topics. Moreover, what made this especially successful was that my TA also occasionally included his own take on the matters, which increased comfort and encouraged students to speak up. This also removed the pressure of feeling like the TA is grading a student during the whole duration of section.\r\nThe prerecorded lectures were good, but can be improved by having more clarity on the takeaways that students should have from each lecture. The beginning lectures had this, but the middle and end lectures did not. I think this would allow students to better retain a particular focus.",
                "I think Zooms and office hours were fine. The simulation was very fine.",
                "All were great. I think the class was structured very well for learning. I would say that the simulation as our final exam was quite lengthy given that each individual person spoke for nearly 5 minutes total in a 2.5 hour exam, but it was a nice wrap up to the semester.",
                "The Town Halls definitely felt a little stilted and unstructured, given that we didn't have a lot of background on the speaker beforehand and it seemed like they just answered a couple questions here and there before leaving.",
                "I liked the class format. My TA and professor were both easy to access either through virtual office hours or emails.",
                "I thought the combination of synchronous and pre-recorded material was perfect.",
                "I like that the lectures were split into mini-lectures, which made it easy to watch one or two of that week's videos without having to stop in the middle of a long lecture. I also enjoyed the guest speakers each week, and thought that the online format made it easier for us to get more speakers!",
                "This was the only course that did the change in instruction perfectly. The addition of live speakers was amazing.",
                "I really enjoyed the switch from a regular final exam to a crisis simulation - this was probably my favorite part of the course",
                "I thought it all worked pretty well.",
                "Everything worked pretty well I would say",
                "The course and the teaching team did amazingly well with the changes in format caused by the pandemic. They were beyond supportive and helpful with students ever shifting situations. Not much to be improved on, as there was plenty of engagement."

                "Yes, it covered very interesting, timely content; however, to a student who might struggle to understand foreign concepts (such as Chinese politics), it was often confusing and intimidating to ask for clarification.",
                "The course is very interesting and relevant so yes I would recommend",
                "Yes! Professor Mattingly has great insights into the US-China relations, and the materials (readings, Sinocism newsletter, etc.) are also very interesting. Good and not too much work for PLSC majors and would be enlightening for other majors too if they are interested.",
                "Yes! I think this is the perfect course to learn about China. You learn enough background about China's history as well as its more current events to understand all of the common news topics surrounding China today. You don't have to have a deep background knowledge of China to succeed in the class.",
                "Yes, great to learn about China.",
                "Yes! This is such a good course. Especially if you really don't know much about China, this is a great course to dip your toe in the water. Highly recommend if you are looking for a great, interesting lecture.",
                "Yes! Especially if you are interested in China",
                "absolutely everyone should take a course on China",
                "No, the class didn't really go too far beyond surface-level issues",
                "Yes, I think this is a good course for anyone who is interested in comparative politics and Chinese politics specifically. It seems like a course that could be managed and enjoyed by students of all ages, including first years.",
                "Absolutely. Great class and Mattingly is awesome and interesting.",
                "Yes, absolutely. The material covered is really interesting and very important considering China's growing role as a global superpower. Professor Mattingly is a great lecturer and explains the material really well. It is a decent amount of reading but you don't need to know the details to understand the material. The course covers a lot of ground, so you don't go really in-depth to anything specifically, but if you're not interesting in diving deep into a specific topic then this course is fantastic.",
                "Yes, especially those interested in learning more about China and its significance in the world today.",
                "If you are interested in learning about a general overview of China and its position in the world, I would recommend taking this course.",
                "Yes!! If you are interested in China, political science, or just want to learn about one of the most important countries in the world, take this class! There is definitely work but it never felt overwhelming. It is one of the few classes I have taken at Yale where I feel so much smarter and a better world citizen after finishing it.",
                "Yes! Grading is really fair and you learn a lot in this class. Professor Mattingly is a fantastic lecturer and cares a lot about the topic. I really enjoyed writing the response papers. Once you talk to your TA about the topic it's really not hard to churn it out within a day.",
                "Yes, good poli sci course. Grading is curved well, China is important to know about. Take it",
                "Yes, 100%, especially if you're looking to take your first course on China. With a quick overview of history, this class really prioritizes contemporary China and looks toward the future. I think a basic knowledge of China is crucial for any 21st-century college grad, and this class should be the one to take. It felt relevant, and Professor Mattingly did an awesome job contextualizing events where China enters the news and American politics while conveying the significance of what we were studying.",
                "Yes, China is increasingly relevant in international politics. It's wise to learn about it.",
                "Yes! This is an excellent course. If you want to learn more about China this is the one to take! Not too challenging at allvery interesting readings and great professor.",
                "TAKE ITTT. If you have the slightest interest in China, this is a fantastic course to take. Prof Mattingly is great, the lectures are fascinating, it is clear how the lectures and readings come together and the course is very well structured. I also genuinely had a lot of fun in the final crisis simulation. Cannot recommend enough.",
                "Yes, this is a course that I think is essential for polisci and global affairs students, especially if they hope to work in IR",
                "Yes. Course content is engaging and you learn a lot about modern-day China.",
                "Yes, only for those w\/o background on Chinese politics\/history. Definitely a broad survey course.",
                "Yes very important to u defeat d China today",
                "Yes, Professor Mattingly provides a clear introduction to a complex society with complex goals. China will inevitably be a global peer to the U.S and learning about its government and history is extremely important for any future military officer, diplomat, bureaucrat and Yalie.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you're interested in China. It was not very difficult and it was an incredibly fair class. I learned a lot about China and got to listen to some cool experts in the field.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of China's position in the world, its dynamic with the US and other countries, and its future path. This course really doesn't require any advance knowledge in any of these fields beyond awareness of current events; I was a first-year student with no previous academic experience in political science or Global Affairs and did just fine, even if most of the course participants were upperclassmen.",
                "As an introduction to understanding the modern historical, global, economic, and political influence of China, this class is an excellent primer. If you want to develop a general understanding of China's place in the current world order, this is a great way to do so. You learn a lot over the course of a single semester about a number of different aspects of Chinese influence. I would certainly recommend taking this course -- you'll be surprised how much you enjoy everything you learn in it.",
                "Yes, it was my favorite class this semester and I wish I could keep\r\ntaking it. The professor and TFs are very understanding and intelligent",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in Chinese history\/politics, but expect it to move quickly. This class barely skimmed the surface of its topic, and the first half of the course was just a lot of history. I found that the second half of the course was much more engaging as we discussed current events, but don't expect that to be the entire course. It's a good introduction course, but you definitely want to be interested in the topic.",
                "Absolutely, very insightful and useful in this day and age. Great class, truly.",
                "It depends. If you are very interested in China, take it. The course does a fantastic job of giving an overview of many different aspects of Chinese politics and its international implications. If you are concerned about getting an A, you may want to tread carefully. Your grades in this course likely very much depend on who you get as a TF.",
                "Potentially",
                "Amazing course! Hands-down one of favorites at Yale. Great professor, amazing TFs, and organized structure. Super insightful and rewarding.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course and any taught by Professor Mattingly.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student interested in China. The class went through the history of China, and then focused more on the policies of China, which I found especially interesting.",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about China",
                "I loved this class. Having taken a similar course (China in the World), I was roughly aware of China's contemporary geopolitical status, but I came into this class with comparatively little knowledge of Chinese history. This class did a great job of surveying the key politically formative developments in Chinese history, starting from the final days of the Qing dynasty and continuing to the present day.\r\n\r\nProfessor Mattingly is a great professor and an engaging lecturer. Political science is not my field, but Professor Mattingly's clear lectures do a great job of introducing the field to political science amateurs.",
                "Yeah I would recommend this to gain a better understanding of world affairs, especially as china looks to dominate the global stage in the future. I would especially recommend it over comparable lecture courses if we are still stuck in an online format, because Professor Mattingly did a great job tailoring the course to zoom.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student, but would advise them to only take it if they're comfortable with the commitments. The class provides a great overview of China itself, which for me was foundational to understanding its international position (which we began to discuss more in the latter half of the class). The work is about: 100-120 pages of reading weekly (60-80 in light weeks, 200 in heavy weeks), once weekly live meetings, recorded lectures (60-90 minutes a week with lots of content requiring you to pause often), live sections, section quizzes. These commitments were more than I anticipated from this class, but the amount of compelling information and quality lectures\/guest lectures delivered by Professor Mattingly were, for me, totally worth it. Any student with interest in current affairs or international relations would benefit greatly from this class.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend it. The professor is amazing - extremely knowledgeable, understanding, and fun. He makes the class and prerecorded lectures easy to follow, and earning good grades on essays is definitely possible because the TA gives direct guidance on how to improve next time. Also, the material we learn is very relevant to today.",
                "Yes! Chinese history and the rise of China in the 21st century is important to learn. Professor Mattingly also doesn't really speak of his opinions, for example, one of the readings in the semester had a speech from the side of a supporter and opponent. Especially if you're interested in global affairs or just knowing how history informs the economy and international politics, this is a fine course for that.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes - Professor Mattingly is such a great professor and the guest speakers are awesome! I learned so much in this class; best one I've taken at Yale so far.",
                "I would recommend the course if students are interested in gaining foundational knowledge of the history, rise, and current political climate of China.  I do, however, think that the most valuable part of this course comes from self-study\/the readings.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student if you are interested in China today, Chinese history, and\/or Chinese international relations. The course is very clearly organized. The course starts with China's history, which the Professor then uses to segue way into Chinese domestic politics and then eventually Chinese international politics. This was a really good course and to be completely honest one of the best courses I have taken at Yale so far. Professor Mattingly is also amazing!",
                "Yes, I would. I was a very interesting and engaging class.",
                "Absolutely. Everyone should take this class.",
                "Yes! This course taught me a ton about China, and it wasn't too difficult.",
                "Yes! It really is a great intro to China",
                "Would definitely recommend this course to another student. Especially if they're interested in Chinese government or relations in any way. It touched on enough subjects to keep students engaged while also keeping everything connected and not overwhelming them."
