The workload but also the instruction can be intense as we are directly asked questions during the class by the professor. This can be tiring sometimes and require a lot of effort but it also made me better and was key in improving my confidence in speaking Chinese.",

For example I felt like there was no need to have an oral presentation for every chapter, maybe one oral presentation every two lessons could work better",
                "The organization of this course is amazing, with each day's work clearly outlined. I also loved the addition of the projects this semester because it is super cool to have three final products at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: You meet everyday so the daily language immersion really forces your language skills to improve quickly! The class is mostly structured around learning new content rather than note taking which I really liked.\r\nWeaknesses: Very heavy workload and you learn new content very quickly. It can be hard to stay on top of everything, especially if you struggle with memorization"

                "Because the class is so intensive and one learns so much in it, I would. However, I would only recommend this class with an overall light workload because it is so time consuming and challenging.",
                "If a student wants to learn Chinese and reach a high level of language acquisition I would totally recommend taking Chinese at Yale and of course, L2 Chinese with Shen laoshi. I took Chinese L2 not for the language requirement but because I had done it in middle school and I liked it. I don't regret this choice, however it was more intense than I thought it would be, so if a student wants to take one semester of Chinese just for this purpose I would warn them that it is an intense course, especially in terms of workload, but would still encourage them to take it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I felt that my sentence fluency really improved this semester and it was exciting to be able to write and speak so much more. Professor Shen is amazing and I love the consistency of practicing a language every day.",
                "Yes! If you are willing to put in the work you will learn a lot of Chinese! The teachers are all so committed and really prioritize you learning Chinese to the best of your abilities"
