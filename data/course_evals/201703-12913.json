    "I had absolutely no knowledge of accounting or finance. I am happy that I understood how time is an important factor to define value. I understand how to analyze the performance of a company through its financial reports, how income and cash flows are different. And also I know now how diversification impacts the risk and return of a portfolio. Thank you, professor!",
    "The basics of accounting: T accounts, Journal Entries and the three financial statements. I learned how to use excel as well.",
    "Tough but useful skills to learn.",
    "I got a really solid understanding of accounting through this course.",
    "Lots of basic accounting.",
    "Learned the basics of accounting and valuation. Learned how to read and write financial statements.",
    "Making financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow)\r\nUnderstanding financial concenpts (WACC, etc)",
    "As the name of the course suggests, you are exposed to the fundamentals of accounting. Course is clearly equipped towards complete novices (as it should be) and Professor Antle was so respectful of that and of the sometimes-steep learning curve of the material.",
    "How accounting works -- the real nuts and bolts.",
    "I learned how to account, and a good conceptual understanding of it.",
    "Learned how to create journal entries, t accounts, income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statements.",
    "I learned so much about accounting procedures and how financial statements are generated.",
    "Valuation and basic accounting!",
    "I gained a fundamental knowledge of accounting."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: definitely the professor! He is great! He explains very well and cares about our understanding.",
    "The class could be better taught. The professor expects that we know how to use excel so it can be hard. The class could be taught slower to better understand the material. Hard to learn the way the class is taught.",
    "Strengths: made me wake up for an 8:45 class, increasing my personal resilience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: poorly organized. The professor set a slow pace by repeating half of the previous class nearly every class. Ideally, you'd hope for homework that reinforces the concepts you learned in the previous class. Antle assigns homework that forces you to teach yourself the contents of the NEXT class. This is hard, because many accounting concepts cannot be deduced logically. You have to learn the conventions. Often, Antle will go over a homework and say \"there's no way you could have known that\". Then why did you make us do it?? What was the pedagogical goal here?",
    "I wish it wasn't so early so I could've gone to class more often.",
    "Very clear powerpoints, but the class is very early in the morning.",
    "Strengths: well-organized course material; professor very willing to help; good textbook\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why class attendance is mandatory given that you have to complete homework on a topic before the class in which it is taught. If you are doing a good job on the homework -- which you should because they are not hard if you read the textbook -- you should not have to go to class. Most class time, honestly, was a waste of time. I learned a lot, but I mostly taught myself.",
    "No weaknesses at all. Rick really wanted you to succeed, and assigned the perfect amount of weekly assignments\/problem sets to make sure people were getting enough practice. It is clearly material that you will fall out of touch with if you don't practice it enough.",
    "Starting from scratch, and taking us through the nitty gritty. We don't just know what the three financial statements are, and how they interact with each other -- we also know how to make them from scratch using nothing more than transaction information.",
    "The accounting portion was great, but we spent too much time at the beginning analyzing on present value discounting. I wish we spent more time on more advanced accounting concepts such as marketable securities and accounting of accounts receivable. I wish we had more practice analyzing actual financial statements of companies.",
    "Strengths are subject matter and weakenss is the length of the class. it should only be 50 minutes",
    "This course is very good at teaching the basics of accounting and finance. I felt that the course went too slowly and didn't teach as much as it could have."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn the basics of accounting and finance.",
    "I think this is a great class to learn accounting because accounting is an important concept to know how to do especially if you are pursuing a career in finance or consulting.",
    "Objectively speaking, this class has a couple of negatives. It takes place at the school of management at 8:45 in the morning. You have to complete a homework assignment every class. Sounds reasonable, right? Except that your homework on Monday directly uses the material you will learn on WEDNESDAY, and it's due right before he mentions the relevant concepts for the first time. You have no way of completing the assignment, and no way of knowing what you're supposed to know. You spend four hours on the homework and feel that you must be mentally challenged. This approach did not help me learn. Why not teach first and let us practice afterwards? You wouldn't make someone bang on the piano before teaching them how to play!\r\n\r\nHe makes a lot of concessions for people who just want this course on their transcript. For instance, if you complete the homework and the take-home final, you can skip the in-class final and get a B+. That's great, but I hoped to learn as much as I could instead of scraping by with a B+. He seems to make the course artificially difficult by forcing us to account for never-before-mentioned concepts and transactions. \r\n\r\nAlso, do not buy the book! I spent about $20 renting a book that we never had to open.",
    "If you want to learn accounting, you will. It's tough, but accounting is a puzzle so that's expected.",
    "Take this course if you want a to get a good foundation of accounting. It's a great 5th course.",
    "Yes, if you want to know some basic accounting.",
    "I wanted to learn the basics of accounting and I did. It is not a life-changing class, but if you read the textbook and keep up with the homework you'll learn how to read and write financial statements. I'm glad I took the course and I hope it will serve me well.",
    "Yes, the information provided in this class is useful, especially for students who want to go into finance or business.",
    "Yes, a good accounting class. You will learn quite a lot.",
    "Take it for Professor Antle! 2 problem sets, weekly Canvas assignments (that you WILL receive thorough feedback on to improve your work), a take-home final and an optional sit-down final. The basics of accounting are something everyone should know, and you'll walk away understanding the 3 main financial statements (and some cool applications).",
    "If you want to understand t-accounts and want to be able to build financial statements then this is a good course for you",
    "Absolutely, no matter what your level of familiarity with finance (or interest in finance).",
    "I would, good way to learn accounting and you get out of it what you put into it.",
    "This is a good introduction to accounting, and definitely worth taking.",
    "Take this with RIck if you can!",
    "I would recommend if you have any interest in fields that require accounting knowledge.",
    "Yes, but they should be prepared to read the textbook",
    "This class is cool because it teaches you real skills that are applicable in your adult life. So if you want to learn accounting, take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to all Yale students interested in learning practical tools that they will use for the rest of their lives."
