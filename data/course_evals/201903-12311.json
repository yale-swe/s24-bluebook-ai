   "comments": [
    "This course taught me critical thinking skills specific to the study of history. I enjoyed reading texts and talking about them as a class, and Prof. Gaddis often introduced his own interpretations while providing space for us to voice ours.",
    "I became a lot better at reading a large quantity of reading in not much time.",
    "This course taught many skills, but the level of thought has tremendously deepened. This course is full of discussion, debate, and compromise, and I think the ability to hold two ideas in your head simultaneously, and still being able to function, is an excellent skill to have learned.",
    "How to write clearly and concisely, how to think deeply about history and historical trends, and why studying history is important.",
    "I learned about the different ways one can interpret the study of history.",
    "I would say I most developed my abilities to gather information from archives and extract historical significance from any type of text.",
    "learned to think about historiography and how to write better.",
    "I believe that I learned to take risks. I had to experiment with my writing and go deeper. Assignments were more vague than I was used to and I had to adapt to that and be creative! Due to Professor Gaddis being a famous professor, I was also more nervous to speak in class than I normally am. I had to get past that. I loved the variety of readings we did, and I also think I learned how to face lengthy readings quickly and without fear. I also spent a lot of time reflecting on why I enjoy history.",
    "This course changed the course of my life. It made me a better writer, challenged me to think deeply about the processes that shape the world, helped me realize what I wanted to major in (which, surprisingly, isn't history), and, most importantly, endowed me with a profound love of Tolstoy's War and Peace.",
    "The skills to critically think about a range of subjects.",
    "An exploration of historical literature, philosophy, and analysis in an attempt to come to a better understanding of why we study history. In particular, I gained a lot of insight regarding analysis of classic literature and the use of archives."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: only assignments (other than reading) are 4 papers spread out throughout semester, very stimulating discussion environment\r\nWeakness: conducive to pseudo-intellectual rambling from certain subsets of the student population",
    "Strength- great professor, great material, cover large breadth, easy \r\n\r\nWeakness- so much reading at times its hard to get much out of it",
    "Strengths-\r\n\r\nReading selection is very good (maybe a little much) . \r\nMany different topics and discussions, don't get bored. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - \r\n\r\nClassroom was too small \r\nEssay prompts are vague",
    "Time is spent very effectively, I always felt like I gained a lot from each seminar. One improvement would be to incorporate more discussion on the expectations behind each paper. Some topics are very broad and not well-defined.",
    "The discussions were mostly beneficial; however, I would suggest making the writing assignments more incorporated with the reading assignments to encourage students to actually read the books fully and to reward those who are.",
    "I think the strength of this course is its amazing professor, and this strength\/weakness of this course is its students.",
    "The course is strong because it is so unique and personal. Each day is somewhat unstructured which means you really are getting out of the class what you put into it. From the creative writing assignments to the dinner at the end of the semester, it was great to feel both like we were getting to know Professor Gaddis and he was getting to know us. I think that the amount of reading is very intense and could be cut down, and more instructions could be given with the writing assignments, although that may defy the point of them. This is overall a strong course because it challenges one in new ways.",
    "The strength of this course is the material. The menagerie of books Professor Gaddis brings together seems improbable, but it works magically. Whether we were discussing the books as across the seminar table or just listening to Professor Gaddis pontificate, every class was wonderful. The one area for improvement was the JQA at the end, which I found really boring.",
    "The reading selection could be improved (but each book did hold a purpose so the reading choices were valid)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course, but it is not to be underestimated. A student will get the most out of this course by being engaged and attentive, but without a desire to participate and learn, the course will hold little value.",
    "Yes, but be aware, you are not going to be studying actual history, instead studying why study history. Sometimes the content felt a little pointless, but nonetheless class was always interesting thanks to Professor Gaddis.",
    "Yes, it exposes you to a conversation and a question we barely bother to tackle. Reading War and Peace was amazing, and it was this class that pushed me to do it.",
    "Unequivocally.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in studying history then this is an excellent course to take - it will think you to think deeper about the subject. If you are studying a different humanities subject, it will still teach you valuable analytical skills, as well as how to write well.",
    "If you enjoy history and the intricacies of how it is told, then this course if for you. But if you just like history, and don't care much about historians and their dilemmas in telling history, it is likely too much work for what it's worth. You must be properly engaged to truly take away a lot from this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone at Yale. It is an excellent introduction to history and provides a ton of great opportunities.",
    "Yes! This is a great course for someone who 1) loves reading and 2) loves participating in seminars, or wants to get better at those two skills. I would not recommend this course to someone looking for a gut, or someone who wants a typical history class. But this class teaches so many skills that I think most anyone can benefit from. Taking a class from Professor Gaddis is also a unique opportunity. I think anyone with the vaguest interest in the discipline of history should take this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you can get into this class, you should take it. If you do the readings and come to class with an open mind, it will change your life.",
    "If you enjoy reading as I do and want to change (or challenge) your outlook on many things, this course is perfect for you.",
    "I highly recommend this course to a student with a great love for literature and writing. The class experience directly corresponds to one's level of commitment. There are a lot of readings for each class and many of the texts are dense (e.g. War and Peace, excerpts from Thucydides and Herodotus). Furthermore, although the writing assignments are fairly short, each requires a lot of time and thought. If you are willing to handle the workload, this course is worth every effort put into it."
