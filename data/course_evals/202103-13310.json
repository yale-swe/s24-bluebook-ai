                "This seminar was too big and too much of a poli sci vibe. But ti was fun",
                "The main insight I gained from this course was that history is indeed relevant to our current social and political climate. Sometimes, history classes feel a bit stale and their content unimportant, but the engagement in this seminar made the material feel incredibly *real.*",
                "I learned to think more critically about what history actually is, what it means, and how we interact with it. This class challenged my previous thoughts and opinions on what we actually mean when we say we study history, and it gave me loads of insight into how to be a better academic and scholar, but also a better member of society. I also learned how to make my way through a massive term paper that requires a lot of research/writing time, which is valuable",
                "I learned a lot from this course! The readings exposed me to a number of historical moments that I hadn't heard much about before, and I appreciated how this course put philosophy and history in conversation.",
                "blight is a legend in the field and yale. course material is a little hard to pin down but it is a nice opportunity to reflect on discipline of history more broadly",
                "Analysis, writing and research.",
                "I learned a lot about archival research and US history.",
                "Beyond learning about American history itself, this course taught me how to question the way in which we construct historical narratives. It was fascinating to analyze the history wars in which Americans have engaged in the past, particularly as we face the current decrying of \"Critical Race Theory\" in schools today. Indeed, Blight's course taught me to take nothing for granted as we determined the differences between--and manipulations of--history and memory. This class forced me to explode the topic of history itself, providing a critical foundation of inquiry as I embark on the history major throughout the rest of my college career. I also embarked on the largest research paper of my academic career in this class, which taught me how to conduct and synthesize archival research on an original topic.",
                "Learned a lot about history wars of the past as well as the origins of a lot of contemporary political realities, which I didn't quite realize before. Also gained a lot of experience in history writing from the 25-page term paper (good for the thesis), which was a reason I chose the course in the first place and panned out as expected in terms of that experience."

                "An excellent course! An interesting syllabus, meaningful assignments, and lively class discussions. I wish slightly more of the course focused on tangible history rather than philosophical debates over history, but the balance was overall great.",
                "This wasn't really a history class, and that was a bummer to me. David Blight is brilliant and warm and it was always fun to hear his thoughts and anecdotes. But I didn't do too many of the readings, and I didn't really need to - lots of the discussions were just (smart) people spitballing about politics. We did get to write major research papers though, with lots of freedom to choose a good topic",
                "The main weakness of this course is the lack of organization in each seminar meeting. I would have appreciated more discipline/focus as we discussed each reading; naturally, tangents are bound to arise, but it would have been nice to have a few guiding questions for each meeting to keep us on track.",
                "Strengths: the content is relevant and fascinating, and much of it sparks debate among the class, which is great. There is so much freedom to interpret the readings and the essays however you want and in whatever way speaks to you most, so the class is really open to what you want to make of it. The things you learn help you understand the past, but also the present, so much better. Also, Prof. Blight is DEFINITELY a strength. He is incredible, and so well-informed, he makes the class an amazing experience\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, there aren't really any",
                "The readings for this course were its greatest strengthwhile they were sometimes lengthy, they exposed the class to interesting history and thought, which helped to shape our class discussions.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this class was the size, which was on the larger side, and made it sometimes difficult to participate in class. This could likely be remedied by having a smaller class size.",
                "Strengths - really interesting topic, Professor Blight is a gem and very good at driving discussion and insights, really good reading list\r\nWeaknesses - this could be both a strength and weakness, but discussion can go off on tangents and verge from history to politics but not necessarily a bad thing! Sometimes the discussion can be a bit shallow, like ivory tower \"why can't people just understand the complexity of historyyy like we do\"",
                "shorter readings or more discussions of the readings we do. two five pagers also feels unnecessary in addition to the research paper. also think we should reign in participation a little bit",
                "no real weakness, a truly wonderful course.",
                "This course was fantastic!",
                "The people and subject material in this course were amazing, and we had fascinating conversations about the meaning of historical construction and public memory each week in class. The people of this course were its greatest strength. Indeed, I appreciated how Professor Blight encouraged us to share our personal experiences with historical memory to deepen the stakes and understanding of our analysis throughout the semester. Although our conversation could become a bit distracted and we often had to rush at the end of class, I nevertheless greatly looked forward to this course for the conversations we had in it each week.",
                "This course was AMAZING!! I was taking notes not only from the professor but also from my peers, this small seminar format was really well used to facilitate stimulating conversations every single class. The material was fantastic and thought-provoking and Professor Blights feedback was always incredibly clear and helpful!!",
                "Strengths: Classmates and Professor Blight are very insightful, and the readings and assignments are great. The course was excellent on the whole.\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the course with \"memory\" and \"history wars\" was a bit too disjointed at times, and it would have been worthwhile to see more backwards connections from the history part of the course to the more philosophical parts about historical memory. Additionally, the pace of the course was often very unstructured and fast. We went through a book a class, and it often felt like discussion with the number of people we had would become very random and it would be hard to work out any key takeaways."

                "I would! If you are interested in the role history plays in our society and how/why it has the potential to create conflict, this course is an excellent way to hone your thinking on those topics. Although the course does cover specific historical episodes, it focuses less on tangible history and more on the public reactions, tensions, and conflicts over it.",
                "I would recommend one of David Blight's classes over this one. I wish I'd been able to take Frederick Douglas or Civil War and Reconstruction. But I'm still glad I got to take Blight and would do it over again, given this was his only undergrad class I had the chance to take",
                "If you are interested in history and how it informs, influences, and directly impacts the present, this course is for you!",
                "I would recommend this class to another student in a heartbeat. If you can take any class with Prof. Blight, do it, but especially a seminar like this where you really get to engage one-on-one with him. The things you're reading and learning help you understand society better. Just be warned that the reading load is huge, and the discussions and papers REALLY force you to think, and about hard topics. There are two 5-6pg papers and a final term paper of 20-25pgs, so if you don't like writing and critical thinking, this class isn't for you.",
                "Yes! This is an excellent, well-taught course, and I learned a lot (both content- and thinking- wise).",
                "Yes 100%! I think it's super important to learn how the current political and cultural atmosphere we currently have originated. Learning about the origins of the \"culture wars\" and how topics like the Civil War still live rent free in people's heads was so interesting and I think crucial to understanding how we got to where we are now.",
                "blight is a legend and you should take any course he teaches. that said, i would take his other courses before this one. subject a little hard to pin down.",

                "Yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Any student, and particularly any history major, should take one of Professor Blight's seminars before they graduate. Not only is Professor Blight one of the foremost historians today, but his classes are filled with wonderful people who facilitate amazing discussions. The subject material and group dynamic of this class made it one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. The class became a tight-knit group of people who are all passionate about history and eager to learn more about the realities of its construction. Listening to everyone's research topics at the end of the semester was one of the highlights of my time as a student here at Yale. As a history major, I loved every second of it.",
                "YES!!",
                "Would highly recommend the course to anyone who is interested in and capable of handling a flexible schedule of work; it was sometimes difficult for me to manage the very low-key readings and long-term papers, but it was a worthwhile experience. The discussions are often very insightful, and the readings are excellent."
