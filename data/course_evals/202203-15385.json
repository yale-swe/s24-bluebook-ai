                "The first third of the course is about different theoretical approaches to informality across time and discipline. That sets you up for the arguably more interesting two-thirds of the course, where each week we focused on a different example of informality (street vendors, sex workers, informal/self-built housing, DIY urbanism, etc). I learned a lot about each of these fields, but more importantly, I spent a lot of time thinking about the experiences of people who are often ignored or denigrated by academic discourse. Prof. Hidalgo brought in speakers from these backgrounds, talked about her own personal experience with informal work, encouraged students to interact with informal workers in New Haven for our final case studies, and generally helped me think more deeply about my own limited experiences and the role of academia in studying informal work/advocating for informal workers.",
                "I learned a lot about individual/on-the-ground efforts for making a living/surviving that typically aren't included in course curriculum. This course made injustices and power dynamics in society very clear and also help students want to address these often neglected problems.",
                "I learned a great amount about the informal economy and how policies and language of anti-informality completely fail to recognize informality as a natural human expression as well as an expected response to capitalism.",
                "I learned so much about informality. I didn't even know that term existed before this classI had only ever know it as \"off the books\" or \"under the table\" work. The syllabus was crafted so well and with so much care and intent. Professor Hidalgo is the best.",
                "I learned about the theoretical framework behind informality, its various schools of thought, and the different forms of informality in an urban setting. This course began with theories and debates on informality and then honed in on informal labor and informal housing as two main themes. We read and talked about farmworkers, day laborers, gardeners, garment workers, domestic workers, street vendors, and sex workers. We discussed informal housing and the built environment. I appreciated how this course focused on many different areas of informality and never lost sight of potential policy changes that could improve existing conditions."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: It's a lot of shorter readings, most of which are very interesting. Brings up a lot of different examples and disciplines. I enjoyed the format of each class, where a student would co-facilitate for about 30 minutes before Prof. Hidalgo led a short lecture or discussion. The speakers she brought in were great. I really enjoyed the final project (a case study of some example of urban informality), which permitted a wide range of methodological approaches and engagement with communities in New Haven and in our own personal lives. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like we spent too much time talking about the final case study -- e.g. we spent most of one session talking about how to come up with a research question -- these lectures were usually not the most engaging and didn't seem necessary. Hidalgo's lectures were often just reading off of a Powerpoint. Sometimes, these were very interesting; at other times, they just felt like an unnecessary and basic summary of the readings. The discussions could get a little repetitive; it felt like everyone was equally left-leaning and agreed that current approaches to urban informality were oppressive, but didn't have much to say about the nuance and difficult decisions necessary to craft real-world solutions.",
                "It would be great if courses could be recorded/presentations shared. I don't think there was an issue with lack of enthusiasm and effort in the course, so sharing this would have enhanced the learning rather than dissuade students from coming to class.\r\n\r\nI really appreciated the guest speakers as they provided really cool insights, and the readings were also fantastic.",
                "The readings for this course were very interesting and improved in quality as the semester continued. That being said, the first few weeks felt repetitive since the literature we read talked about the same theory in the same way and didn't add anything new to our discussions. There were also times where the lectures felt unorganized and Professor Hidalgo just read off of slides that we could have looked at on our own time or built more in-depth conversations around instead of just going through the information. Most weeks, lectures were student-led, which at times facilitated good discussion but at other times was scattered and unhelpful. I think that having more guidance on expectations for the student co-facilitations and narrowing down the weekly readings would have improved the course greatly.",
                "The one weakness is not having any other options for the final than a traditional case study paper. But the class is mostly strengths. The discussion and student leadership component was highly appreciated. Professor Hidalgo is also such a raw and cool professor, so her honesty and intimacy was so refreshing. I am excited to take more of her classes in the future. Another strength is the balance between theory and actual findings, as well as the special guests which I enjoyed so much.",
                "The reading load of this course was fair and every week's seminar was structured differently based on the weekly presenters. We also had fascinating speakers join us during class. Throughout the semester, Professor Hidalgo supported students in writing final research case study papers based on the structure of published research articles. This was very helpful, especially for someone interested in producing academic work on these topics. Moreover, it was helpful that the midterm was geared toward thinking about the final paper.",
                "The course was very well organized. Professor Hidalgo made sure all students understood the historical context of certain subjects and encouraged us to ask many questions. The readings were very interesting. I really enjoyed how we would devote class time to both discussion and lectures."

                "Yes, I think it's a very important subject that rarely gets discussed in a university setting. The quality of class discussion varied, but was usually pretty high, especially when there was a guest speaker. The readings are mostly very interesting and manageable. The final project is a real opportunity to engage with the New Haven community (or communities from your hometown), if you want to take it!",
                "Highly recommend the course, as these present issues in society need more focus and study. Professor is also extremely supportive.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in labor and informal theory, and who would like the opportunity to create an independent project based on these themes.",
                "Definitely. You will learn about things I have never learned about in any class here at Yale, and Professor Hidalgo is such a great educator.  Everyone should have a deeper understanding of informality.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course, especially for ER&M and URBN majors, but also for students that are interested in this field more broadly. Informality is an important aspect of daily life for so many and this course challenged many preconceived notions I had about this topic. Unique from other courses, this course always returned to the question of potential policy changes and where academic work fits into the equation. Professor Hidalgo is incredibly knowledgeable about this field and her organizing experience and scholarship contributed to this course's success.",
