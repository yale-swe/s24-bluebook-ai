            "comments": [
                "Strengths are the prof, teaching style, and exam setup. Weaknesses would be the amount of pset and info we were sometimes not taught that showed up on psets.",
                "Strengths: The greatest strength of this course was Professor Smooke--he was awesome.  This class is inherently a bit repetitive in the sense that you spend an entire semester only solving differential equations, but Prof. Smooke made the best of it. The pre-recorded lectures were helpful and a good way of getting the material to sink in. Class was basically a repeat of the recordings, but it was completely optional and he was always willing to answer questions in class itself.  As for the material itself, it was very unsurprising--and I mean this in the best possible way. The PSETs were a bit of a stretch from lecture, and they could definitely take a while, but the book always made up for anything the lectures missed and the PSETs were really good preparation for our exams--the exams basically followed standard or on-the-easier-side PSET problems.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For me, the in-class lectures could be a bit fast--I couldn't really take complete notes unless I used the prerecorded lectures or just wrote non-stop for the class. Content wise, an annoying feature was that certain concepts weren't terribly difficult to set up, but procedures like shifting multiple series or doing many rounds of integration by parts were tedious and frustrating at times.",
                "It was not very engaging and I had a hard time learning from the lectures.",
                "The homework assignments were all well structured to help prepare for exams and the exams reflected the homework problems quite closely.\r\n\r\nI have no criticisms for this course, expect for the fact that perhaps better/more structured review sessions could be held?",
                "asynchronous videos were well-done, sometimes synchronous class felt redundant",
                "Strengths - recorded lectures\r\nWeaknesses - lectures seemed to be a regurgitation of textbook chapters and didn't add too much\r\nNeutral - some p-sets felt very \"grindy\"",
                "Mitch is a great person, but the way he does the lectures is not the best. He reads off the slides, the slides are basically exactly the same material as the textbook, and there is no writing or solving problems real-time/on-the-spot involved. The tests were okay, but some tested concepts we could not have derived simply out of observation.",
                "I think it was great to have the pre-recorded lectures. It helped me keep up with synchronous lecture. Professor Smooke and the TA's were great. I hope he posts the lecture slides in his other courses as well. I saw no weaknesses in this class. Tests were very fair, and preparation was very straight-forward.",
                "Strengths: Great professor who wanted to engage with us and was interested in the topic.  Class organized very clearly and many opportunities for peer tutor/TA office hours, which were of invaluable help to me.  I liked how the professor posted recorded lecture modules to watch before going over the same concepts in class.  This way, I could take notes off of the videos and really listen during the live lectures rather than scrambling to write down everything as fast as I could.  I really hope the professor keeps these recorded videos during in-person classes.  I loved having 4 exams rather than a cumulative final.  It really made me invested in learning the material deeply rather than trying to cram for a final.  Also, I liked the bonus questions on the exams about the mathematicians we learned about.\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I can really think of is the fact that we didn't know if we were going to cover some concepts until the end of the semester.  Also, having the final two exams only 1.5 weeks apart from each other could have been restructured.  The only other thing is that problem set lengths varied drastically.  This was fine for some weeks, but other weeks I wished there was more consistency.  There was about a 250% difference in length of problem sets between shortest and longest.",
                "Strengths: It was very helpful that the course followed the textbook so closely, and I appreciated the repetition of the concepts with the recorded lecture and the live lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: The live lectures were nearly identical to the recorded ones.  Also, just reading slides in the recorded lectures meant that there was a ton of text on the slide that I felt very rushed trying to copy down.  I would have loved to see more synthesis of the material and presenting problems through writing and working through them, rather than showing them on PowerPoint.",
                "a lot of the homework work felt menial and was very time consuming even though the time consuming parts were not the focus of the course",
                "The learning method needs more creativity and explanation. More examples of the different equations. Please shorten the PSETS",
                "The strengths of the course is that the information builds upon itself such that an understanding of earlier concepts is helpful later on in the course. Also, the combination of recorded lectures and virtual lectures gave many opportunities to better learn and comprehend the information. A weakness of this course is that the concepts learned are very difficult but this is partly mitigated by the multitude of learning opportunities.",
                "Prof. Smooke is a very straightforward professor; as long as you attend lectures/watch modules and do the PSETs, the exams are straightforward. Also, I loved that his lectures were extremely succinct and that he never really went over an hour in lectures. However, a lot of lecture material was the same as the module material, which made live lectures bland at times. I would've appreciated getting to do more practice problems as a class during lecture time, which would allow us students to be more engaged with the class and to also gain some new insights that weren't offered in the modules.",
                "I think the course was structured so that the material was manageable and easy to understand. It was really helpful to be able to review the material as it helped me understand not only the concept, but the rationale for using it.  In addition, it was interesting to see how the concepts built on each other.  I do wish that there were some practice exams or study guides for the exams as there was often a lot of material to review. In addition,  the questions in the book often explored additional concepts, so it was hard to find questions to do that were relavent to the material learned in class.",
                "There are a lot of resources to help students succeed in the class, but the material is tedious and the class could be done just as easily by reading the book and following the example problems. The toughness with the course lies within the tenacity of accurately writing many, many steps to solve a single differential equations problem. In addition, the problem sets in the class were extremely inconsistent in length: sometimes, it would take 1 hour to finish the problem sets; sometimes it would take 10.",
                "The course was strong in its ability to allow for individual practice working with differential equations.\r\nThe course was weak in that it introduced solutions without reasoning and often began from much higher levels of understanding for a class given to students who have never seen certain functions and symbols that are a part of differential equation solutions.",
                "The TAs were really helpful, and I managed to find the material quite interesting. I just wish that we would go over some of the more complex material in lecture a bit more thoroughly. The lecture slides were written quite concisely, but that also meant that there were multiple times where I felt lost and needed to go back into the textbook to clear up certain ideas.",
                "It is a class that doesnt necessarily seem like it would spark the interest of math majors, but it is good for understanding the general topics. The only major drawback was that watching the lectures live or the recorded ones didnt make a difference. It was like watching the recorded lecture twice with added facts about the people who made the methods.",
                "Not much guided problem practice. Had to learn how to do problems on my own for the most part. No test prep material. Lectures provided good background knowledge, TAs were very helpful.",
                "I thought this course was strong in the sense that the pre-lecture videos along with the live lectures themselves really allowed for an understanding of the material on a weekly basis. At times though, I felt as if the homework questions were not a good representation of the material in the sense that they required an additional level of understanding that was not provided in either forms of lectures. I think that in the future, the amount of time required to finish psets should be kept in mind as towards the end of the semester, questions took longer and longer to answer within themselves. I will also say that overall, the tests were a good representation of the material learned in class as well as the homework with the exception of the last exam."

I also like how the recorded lectures were easy to access and well organized, and it was easy to refer back to these recorded lectures.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to the presence of recorded lectures, it made the live lectures seem really redundant. Professor Smooke often went into random tangents about random things, like the Swiss Franc or golf. The lectures seemed to be redundant, and I did not find them engaging or helpful.",

I will say though that I didn't think that it made sense that our mics had to be kept on during exams. Especially during the last exam, this practice proved to be more distracting than at all helpful."

The assignments were manageable, and there were many resources to help you succeed. You can perform very well if you try hard in the class. I think it was outstanding.",
                "I would highly recommend.  I was TERRIFIED to take this class during the spring of my sophomore year after having a terrible experience with Math 120 the fall of my first year.  Math 120 made me never want to take a math course again, but I'm very glad I took this course.  The course was challenging, but a type of challenging that you could get through with careful attention to detail, time spent in office hours, and extra time taking notes from the textbook.  (With Math 120, I felt that no matter what I did I could not get a grasp on the subject, but with this course I felt confident after spending extra time studying and doing practice problems.)  The exams were very fair and I thought the class atmosphere was great.  Not being an engineering major, the only doubt I had about this course is how I would apply it in my future studies and career.",
                "If you have to take differential equations, yes.  This course was straightforward.  Homework followed the book/lectures, the exams were generally very fair, and I felt like I gained familiarity with a lot of difficult concepts.",
                "absolutely! this class is required a lot of the time and would be good for stem majors to get an idea of how to solve odes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the math topics learned are useful to other applications, specifically engineering, and the course set up to help students grasp the difficult concepts.",
                "If you have to take ENAS 194, I would recommend Prof. Smooke. He doesn't try to play any tricks on his students and assignments/exams are all extremely straightforward. If you want to take this class to get a really deep, conceptual understanding, look elsewhere. A lot of the class material was application-based and plug-and-chug.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you want to learn more about the applications of the math! It was really interesting to be able to do problems with context which definitely helped me understand the concepts more.",
                "I would recommend the course only if it is required for your major. There are more interesting math classes to take, and in addition differential equations can all be solved online through computers and calculators now.",
                "It's a nice course, but I would only really recommend taking it if you have an interest in math or need it for your major.",
                "I would not recommend this course to others unless they are a math major or going into engineering/physics. The usefulness of the material beyond that isnt existent to my knowledge. Even for some engineering majors the material feels almost loosely connected.",
                "Yes, because it is well taught and allows you to enter higher levels of mathematics.",
                "To those who need to take for major, yes. Otherwise no, as it did not teach me many skills outside of math/engineering specific areas."
