                "I learned about methods of organic synthesis. We went through many named reactions and methods of controlling stereochemistry in molecules.",
                "I learned about many different organic transformations dealing with enolates, aldol reactions, and use of asymmetric catalysts such as Evans' oxazolidinone, Myers' pseudoephedyrine, and many more. I also learned about many transition states and reactivity trends based on pKas and resonance.",
                "I learned a lot about various reactions used in syntheses of organic molecules.",
                "This course exposed me to a variety of new reactions and methods employed in modern synthetic organic chemistry. Although I had previously seen a small subset of the reactions we covered, Prof. Ellman was often able to supplant my current knowledge with practical considerations and deeper mechanistic insight, making the course incredibly valuable.",

                "Strenghts of this course are very clear notes. Weaknesses is that it is a lot of information. The course could benefit from slowing down and breaking topics into longer discussions. Additionally, a TA would be helpful.",
                "Prof. Ellman is a huge strength for this class. There is a lot of material, but he organizes it well, and has incredibly thorough and neat notes that help to put everything in context and provide many examples. The psets are interesting and help you to internalize the material. Office hours were always helpful as well. One thing this course could benefit from would be a formal discussion section with a TA. It could also benefit from a review session that puts all of the reactions in context with one another - it can be difficult to know when to use one strategy versus another.",
                "This class moved very fast.",
                "Strengths - very interesting material. My primary interest is in inorganic chemistry yet this class was very applicable to my research and was just very interesting in general. Also, the information and class notes were very organized and presented in a very understandable way.",
                "The strength of the course is in the breadth of reactions that it covers.  Its weakness, however, is its lack of depth into the chemistry of these reactions.  Oftentimes, it felt like mechanisms were sidestepped in favor of tables of results, making this class much more memorization than conceptualization."

                "Yes, absolutely. If you are doing your thesis work in organic chemistry, you should take this course. If you aren't, you should consider taking it anyway because it is well-organized and interesting (mechanisms and synthesis and tons of practical applications!). The information I learned was useful, up-to-date, detailed, and interesting. I will note that it can be a time-consuming class and is definitely intimidating on the first day, but the pieces do come together, and collaboration is encouraged on the psets.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to challenge themselves and learn more about synthetic chemistry, that which is relavent to natural product synthesis.",
                "YES! It is so interesting and I feel like I learned SO MUCH about methods in organic synthesis. It's really helpful to people who are interesting in pursuing further organic studies but also those who are not.",
                "Yes, the material covered was very useful and interesting",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course without hesitation. This course is well organized and provides a useful practical introduction to strategies commonly employed in synthetic chemistry. The material is approachable, interesting, and novel."
