                "All of the content is a strength! Professor Davis has put together a really far-reaching but also in-depth curriculum that exposes students to so much powerful information about several movements.",
                "I think that this course could be improved if there was a bit more of a clear direction for class each day. The best classes were the ones that were grounded in the music, as we tended to get off track kind of easily. Also, more feedback throughout the semester would be great- going into the final, we only had one grade, so it was difficult to know where we could improve in order to do well in the class. But the topic was fascinating and the readings were very well curated.",
                "Strengths: week after week, the topics were always so amazingly interesting and culturally significant and politically relevant. The discussions flowed like rivers, often we'd find ourselves going over class time because there was still so much more to be said and we didn't want it to end! The instructor was an amazing facilitator and always knew just the right questions to ask or points to bring up so prompt further discussion. The podcast project was also really, really fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings could be overwhelming. They were always so interesting, but sometimes it was just way too much. From time to time, I found myself being forced to skim what I would genuinely like to be reading, but could not always find the time for."

She gave us space to cope with so many challenges and overall showed great empathy, the most important thing for getting through these difficulties. She also used the technology to her advantage since we depended so much on listening to music in class."

The course is really what you make it because it's so discussion based, so if you come to class having done the readings, then the discussions will be great!",
                "Yes. A million times yes. This course is one of the best ones I've taken at Yale so far, and I will seriously never forget it. The classroom became such a safe space of kind individuals who cared about the same issues and just shared a genuine love for music. Angharad was literally amazing, one of those professors you will never forget. And everything we learned about in class was literally so mind-blowing. This was the one class I couldn't stop talking about to my friends all semester long."
