    "This class is very important for art history majors because it gives you a theoretical background. There is a lot of writing, but it is good to help work out the complicated ideas that we learned in the course.",
    "I learned different forms of art historical theory that greatly enhanced my understanding of the field as a whole",
    "After taking this course, I feel like I know how to look at art. It also made me question everything about art; from the way it is displayed to the way it is written about. It was really interesting to read and write about some heavy scholarship in the field."

   "comments": [
    "The class was well structured, and there were a lot of writing assignments but they were helpful in understanding the material. I think the presentations were helpful and that seminar time was well-organized. \r\n\r\nSince there were so many assignments, it would have been helpful to receive feedback on some of the graded reading responses before we had to turn in more.",
    "I loved this course!! No weaknesses",
    "This isn't really a weakness, but a suggestion: instead of the fourth reading response (which felt a bit unnecessary by the end of the semester) maybe there could be a label-writing assignment. Or a more creative assignment, where we get to rethink a museum exhibition\/display.",
    "Instead of the many mini response papers, some assignments could be more creative. We discussed the opportunity of writing museum labels, curating exhibitions etc. Some hands-on investigations like that could improve the class a lot.",
    "I really appreciated the breadth and diversity of material that we read and it was a real treat to meet in the galleries each week. I think that the writing assignments could have been more structured and guided."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class for art history majors, and though we have to take it, the class is worth it for the theoretical background to pair with the visual analysis and research that other classes focus on.",
    "Absolutely! Especially junior year. Super helpful course for art history majors before undertaking a senior thesis.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students interested in art history. However, it is a writing-heavy seminar and the readings are not light. So be prepared for some intellectual challenge.",
    "Well this class is required for art history majors, but it's not a terrifically onerous requirement as it feels very intellectually edifying. I would not recommend it for non-majors unless they have quite a lot of time on their hands."
