                "Prof. Kenney's lectures are jammed packed with information. It might take at least two watches to get every topic. The prerecorded lectures are extremely long on some days in addition to the live classes. The live classes can be very confusing if you didn't understand some of the topics in the prerecorded lectures, but it is mostly discussions with other students. The homework also can vary greatly in difficulty and often would require going to office hours for follow-up. However, Professor Kenney is very helpful in answering questions in email and during office hours.",
                "The combination of 60+ minutes of recorded lecture and 75 minutes of live lecture was a bit much. This is especially because a lot of the lectures had information that was irrelevant to my performance on the problem sets or exams. That we needed a copy of the textbook to be able to do the homework was also a bit annoying. Often, there was a single student that the professor would fawn over that apparently spoke the word of God. Many of the rest of us would be told that we were incorrect in class discussion when we were actually correct or expect us to know things that he had never spoken of before or had never been covered in prior astronomy courses so that he could have his \"gotcha\" moment. The problem set questions were rarely worded well. One thing is that the professor seemed to actually care about the subject he was teaching, which was nice.",
                "The course's main strength is its discussion format and engaging class periods, which helped solidify my learning. One weakness was the use of online lectures prior to the class itself, which effectively double the class time. On top of readings, this presents quite a lot of work to do to prepare for classes.",
                "All the physics derivations in the recorded lectures were very hard to follow. Professor Kenney's logic seemed to be all over the place -- sometimes he'd be actively deriving something, sometimes he'd be stating something we'd derive later, and it was frequently impossible to tell which he was actually doing.",
                "Professor Kenney obviously cares a lot about this course. The effort that he puts in benefits students greatly. The format of this class is the best that I have experienced in the pandemic era. I quite enjoyed the results from research that he would show to motivate material from class. However, oftentimes, Professor Kenney's questions would be confusingly worded and he would allot far more or less time to discussion than we needed. It was also a bit frustrating, sometimes, to be placed in groups with certain other students.",
                "Well taught course. Live zoom classes were fun and well planned out, made us think and interact.",
                "1 and a half hour recorded lecture on top of virtual lecture is too much",
                "The strength was that this course was incredibly interactiveI found that working through live-session problems in small groups was a great way to talk through some of the material and get comfortable with participating. The weakness was definitely the time commitment; we had both asynchronous lectures and synchronous meetings totaling way over the allotted class time, on top of weekly psets."
