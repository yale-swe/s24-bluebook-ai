As someone who can struggle with science classes that deal heavily in specifics, having to fit them into more conceptual ideas helped me remember and make sense of the specifics. I also felt like I got a good overview of human evolution, as well as basic biological and evolutionary concepts that are important to understanding it.",

I really appreciated the opportunity to work with some very cool specimens, like Darwin's finches and various bones and skeletal remains, throughout our lab sections. I definitely developed the skills to take very fast-paced and stressful exams (15 questions in 20 minutes, 11 mc, 3 short answer and 1 bonus), for better or for worse.",

As a history major, it was interesting to learn how we can use biological anthropological concepts to recreate past environments and gain insight into the development of human culture.",

            "comments": [
                "Thompson was a strength. She is a good lecturer and I really enjoyed how the extra credit assignments and readings allowed us to look at biological anthropology in a context that interested me (as poli sci). I particularly enjoyed the times we talked about biases in approaches to science. I also think the exams were really fair. The biggest weakness for me was that we spent a LOT of time speaking about primates and locomotion.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are well-structured, course policies are very fair and supportive for students, Professor Thompson doesn't try to make the class harder than it needs to be (exams are open-note, work load is very reasonable), material is interesting and presented in a way that will appeal to people who are not necessarily passionate about science.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lab sections did not feel fully thought out to maximize student learning.",
                "Strengths: Super interesting material and great sections that allowed us to interact with said material, Professor Thompson was an excellent lecturer and found ways to make the material both engaging and interactive even in a large lecture, short exams (while sometimes a pain to prepare for every other week, made the midterm workload less), workload not too heavy but enough to encourage learning\/retaining material as the course progressed. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes preparing for short exams was a lot given my personal schedule.",
                "I think the course was definitely good in that it was clear exactly what you needed to know but content could be a bit dry.",
                "The course design is excellent. Personally, I liked having many short quizzes rather than a few big exams it can feel exhausting when youre constantly coming up on another quiz, but its so much better than the feeling of falling way behind between tests and having to cram at the last minute. Doctor Thompson also makes the grading rubric and scale extremely explicit from day one which for anxious types like me is extremely helpful. \r\n\r\nHaving the TFs present lectures is a great way to bring in cutting edge research and different sub fields. One minor quibble is that sometimes the TF lectures can be a little bit less clear on some stuff that then ends up at on exams relative to Dr. Thompson, but this is to be expected.",
                "The strengths of this course included the clarity with which the material was presented in lecture, the assigned readings which directly complemented what we were learning in class, and the communication between the teaching team and the students. There were no major weaknesses of this course.",
                "Strengths: exam structure was conducive to learning and didn't require cramming or memorization. Lectures were great and TFs were awesome, which made sections fun.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the material was a little confusing and not super clear-cut, the way you might expect in a science class! Not necessarily a weakness but worth knowing in advance.",
                "I think that Prof. Thompson's lectures were generally very interesting, and she did a good job covering a wide range of topics, so if you didn't like one lecture, you'd probably like the next. I also ended up being a fan of the 9 quizzes format, as opposed to a few big exams. There's just way too much information in this class for her to only give 2 midterms, for example. My one complaint is lectures are pretty fast paced, so it's hard to take sufficient notes during them and absorb most of the info. But overall, a really solid class that wasn't too strenuous.",
                "Great course! Material can be challenging, especially in the middle, but the quiz system does force you to pull it together. Not an easy class, but also perfectly reasonable to do well in if you put in the effort.",
                "The lectures were engaging but could also get a little distracting if you didn't personally find the content interesting.",
                "Strengths: textbook and reading related directly to content and were interesting, same for section assignments and labs, content was organized very nicely and logically. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, clear deadlines and expectations, interesting and understandable lectures, hands-on labs\/sections, engaged Professor, comprehensive study guides, opportunities for extra credit, good pacing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the labs\/sections were a bit chaotic but this is likely because they were new this year \/ still being figured out",
                "I liked having short exams every week\/two weeks often rather than cumulative midterms.",
                "Material was presented well and format was organized.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Thompson is incredible. What an organized, engaging, and caring lecturer. She also gives the TFs chances to lecture on topics relevant to their own research, which is very rewarding. The arc of the class is also very clear. It goes general evolutionary principles, primate evolution and organization, and human evolution from primates.\r\nWeaknesses: Sections were not a time to ask clarifying questions; lectures were. Sections had entirely different assignments that were still pertinent. to the course, but would take up the entire time.",
                "The incessant performative criticism of Western, male hegemonic influence in the field should be left out, as it was really embarrassing and time consuming (and this is coming from someone pretty far left). Though I do understand the pressure that the professor probably feels having to lecture in front of hundreds of SJWs hungry to deliver the exact opposite criticism to mine.",
                "strengths: interesting content overall throughout the course, engaging and reflecting upon the history and different aspects of biological anthropology\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the quizzes were helpful in comprehending lecture material, but sometimes went a little too fast.",
                "STRENGTHS: Workload is fairly manageable (9 short open-note exams, 12 labs that are basically for credit, 3 extra credit opportunities, 1 open-note final exam, no midterm), topics are interesting and relevant to today's news, prof. Johnson is incredibly understanding and knowledgeable abutter subject, lowest exam and lab grade gets dropped\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: N\/A",
                "Overall the class was very interesting, covered a lot of ground, and required me to engage with the material in multiple ways (mostly lecture, labs, which often required applying the concepts from lecture, and discussion sections, which often involved more ethical discussions within the field of anthropology). I'd say the one weakness of the class was that at times the material on the tests didn't perfectly match with what had been taught in the lecture. However, this was pretty easily resolved because the content of the exams was indicated pretty clearly in advance in the study questions that Professor Thompson posted prior to each exam, and I was able to do well on most of them by asking her to clarify anything I didn't know the answer to during office hours.",
                "I think this class was very interesting and well designed. My only suggestion is that labs either be made less complicated or that we are given more information. I felt that often in sections I was guessing as labs such as in our first lab with the finches, I felt I did not have adequate information to determine finch evolution and if they started small and got larger or vice versa. Without knowing what would have been adaptations in their environment I didn't really know what to put. I felt like I was in this situation often and that with labs we could either be given more information or asked to do something less complex!",
                "I enjoyed the discussion sections and most of the lab sections, as well as the lectures, though I wish the lectures were structured a little more rigidly. The short exams were preferably to longer exams, but I wish we had just five more minutes on them.",
                "Interesting material, especially towards the end when we talk about race and health.",
                "It was a great class!! Release grades sooner so students know if they should do the extra credit assignments and can better study\/fix their study habits if necessary.",
                "I do not believe that the exam format is super conducive to actually learning the information. People seemed to be more focused on command f-ing their notes than they did actually studying and learning the information. I didn't love the textbook readings... some of the chapters were pretty long and super hard to get through.",
                "Strengths: open note quizzes. This was key since the course is a survey course that covers a LOT of information even for each individual quiz. Dr. Thompson is an AMAZING lecturer. I felt very lucky to get to experience this granted that most intro level STEM classes at Yale are very poorly taught. Weaknesses: TAs often not having answers to students' questions, especially in lab sections. It seemed like they didn't look at the lab very much beforehand or were unqualified to answer questions about the specifics of the lab or course material (even though they're clearly highly knowledgeable and qualified individuals within their fields, generally). Maybe better training on this is in order, it wasn't deleterious per se but just a bit disheartening. And lab sections. The time required for the first (finches) and last (forensics) labs was grossly underestimated, and students had to finish them at home using only pictures, not fun. Time pressure for all labs was heavy, they were very stressful, and it was difficult to gather data from the specimens since everyone had to share them and you would be looking at something and someone would just grab it away or block it. Thankfully, grading for these was generous, but maybe they could be shortened in scope a bit to better fit into a 50 minute time slot with specimen sharing (and the first and last labs should be restructured).",
                "Some of the labs were overly difficult and didn't contribute to my learning. Liked how the course was divided into smaller exams.",
                "I like the format of having many small tests instead of one big one as it helped me not fall behind in class. On the other hand, I did not like the labs of the class too much as some of them seemed a bit too complex for an intro course.",
                "Strengths: Short quiz style was very helpful. Information was engaging. Professor always found ways to incorporate current research and news into lectures (including her own papers!). Sections were genuinely helpful in understanding material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Often the professor would take too much time on the first few slides of a lecture and have to race through the final 25 slides. Also, I felt as if some of the lectures were interesting but not particularly important. Some of the basic science lectures in the beginning of the year could be omitted to spend more time discussing, say, art and material culture rather than interspersing this information throughout multiple lectures.",
                "The course felt very well rounded in its ability to address not only the general curriculum but also its careful attention to the historical issues with physical anthropology.",
                "There were way too many highly specialized parts of the course. For an intro level course it should have been more broad.",
                "This course is extremely well organized and easy to follow. At times, it felt as though some pieces of information or familiarity with human biology\/anatomy were assumed (particularly in labs), but overall the course was engaging.",
                "The course could be more engaging. I found it difficult to pay attention to the lectures.",
                "Professor Thompson is a great lecturer. The course material can be a bit dry though.",
                "Strengths: instruction; weaknesses: NA",
                "The material could get boring at times, but there were some sections that were very interesting. One weakness is that the section assignments felt more tedious and didnt really help with my understanding of the course material.",
                "Such an interesting class! Lots of opportunity to improve over the course. Honestly wouldn't change it.",
                "Generally, I think it was a strong class. I do think that at times the study guides did not reflect the questions asked on the exams, or that at times, there were questions on the study guides whose answers I struggled to find even after watching the lectures multiple times through. Other than that, I thought the class was quite well structured.",
                "Strengths: excellent professor, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: went in-depths on monkeys to an extent which I'm not sure was necessary. Also some of the slideshows had the wrong lecture number on the title slide, which is not very consequential but did mess up my notes occasionally",
                "The class spent a long time discussing the evolutionary history from early primates to the first modern humans. We covered material in chronological order with lots of detail and examined multiple historical hypothesis a long with the current theories and evidence. I wish however, that instead of moving chronologically, the course started with a broad and simplified abstraction and progressively added more detail. I often found myself lacking the proper context to remember everything we covered because I was missing the higher level view, the big-picture. I think this would have helped me and others in the class like have a better grasp on the order of evolutionary events and what the most important pieces are.",
                "Everything we learnt throughout the semester was super interesting but there was just a lot of material overall. I think the amount of info\/topics covered should stay the same (it would be a shame to skip any of what we discussed) but focusing on fewer topics in more detail for quizzes\/exams would have helped me feel more in control of the material.",
                "This course was incredibly well organized and had great faculty behind it. Professor Thompson is a great lecturer, and the TFs in particular were so helpful in answering my questions about the subject matter and course assignments. Something which was less a weakness than something to know going into the class is that, between the nine quizzes, weekly discussion section work, and extra credit assignments, this course has lots of deadlines each week. Sometimes the work could be hard to keep up with, but the class always tried to give us advanced notice to make the work more manageable.",
                "The questions on the exams are so specific that they don't lend to learning or understanding concepts, but more to memorizing\/being able to locate information in your notes quickly. The way that many of the questions are phrased is also rather confusing, with double negatives etc, which made it feel more like i was learning how to test in this class than leaening for content.",
                "StrengthsDr. Thompson was a great lecturer and my TF Alexa was super helpful.\r\nWeaknessesthis class was way more work than I thought it was going to be. We had quizzes every other week, and they covered so much material\/detail, and it was honestly quite stressful to study for them, even though they were open note."

It was also a great Science credit, not too difficult and interesting enough for those who are not interested in the super hard sciences (biology, chemistry, or physics).",
                "I would recommend the course as it's very clear how to do well. But, it was definitely more work than I'd anticipated.",
                "Yes. Its a great Sc credit for less science-inclined types (like myself), but also just a genuinely cool class. Also, Yale has lots of amazing natural science collections  which, if youre a non STEM person like me, youre unlikely to otherwise encounter, so that alone is a good reason.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The workload and intellectual challenge of this course were average among other Yale College courses. The material that was presented in lecture and in the readings was engaging.",
                "Yes! Great professor and well organized. Cool material to learn regardless of your academic interests.",
                "Yes! Prof. Thompson is so great, and the material can be really interesting.",
                "I would. Professor Thompson is excellent. If, like me, you are not a science person, she makes this material approachable and understandable. She is by far the strongest part of the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they enjoy biology but don't want to pursue that at Yale, otherwise it could be difficult to stay engaged in the course.",
                "Yes, definitely.",
                "I absolutely recommend this to anyone needing a science credit or just interested in exploring anthropology in a different way. This is the first science class at Yale I got really invested in, and I learned so much! The class is really well organized and the Professor provides study guides for every quiz  making everything low-stress as long as you put in some time and effort. The lecture topics were fascinating and the lectures were always engaging.",
                "Yes! I didn't have any background in anthropology, but found it to be a very interesting course. I liked working in labs and with specimens, and all of the exams and labs were straightforward. It's a very easy and simply structured class, there are no surprises in anything which is very nice.",
                "As a stem major, this course is the definition of a gut that also gives you a social science distributional requirement. I never attended lecture or read the book and was able to pass by looking at the lecture slides during open note examinations.",
                "maybe, if 1) you like (biological) anthropology or biology OR 2) you need a science credit. Other than that I think there are better classes to take",
                "I think yes. It depends on what they're interested in and how much work they're willing to put in though. This is a course that you need to put in the effort for every single week (especially because the quizzes occur every three classes). That said, it feels like a very welcoming, beginner-friendly environment because there is no midterm and the final is weighted so lightly. Dr. Thompson generally. makes it a very student-friendly experience, but if you dislike the content or aren't willing to put in the work, I would suggest looking for another class.",
                "If a student is looking for an easy science credit, this may be more work than what they are looking for. It requires a lot of engagement, spread out evenly across the semester.",
                "yes! it covers so many aspects of biological anthropology and allows for the discussion and promotion of learning in such a way that i was continuously engaged. the labs were fun and brought in more of the science part while still managing to not be too overwhelming",
                "YES! The workload is manageable if you carve out enough time to do it, the grading isn't too harsh and always comes with helpful feedback, the topics are interesting and I found myself applying it to other areas of my life, and it is pretty easy to get an A in the class as long as you complete the work. Definitely recommend for someone (like me) who is not a STEM person at all and needs a Sc credit.",
                "Yes! Interesting material presented very well",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to someone who feels less confident in science. As someone with less of a background in science, I found the course very approachable, mostly because it was largely organized around broader concepts rather than super specific details, and the more detailed-oriented elements were often well-contextualized within the broader concepts. I also really liked the format of the class where we did relatively frequent small tests rather than a few large, high-stakes tests. (Even the final was relatively low-stakes.) This required me to be more constantly accountable for the information we were learning, but this was ultimately much easier than having to remember all of it at once. I also found the class really fascinating, and it gave me a great overview of human evolution, as well as the anatomical and social factors that make our species unique.",
                "I would recommend this course! It is super interesting and informative and not very difficult to do well in!",
                "Yesit gets more interesting as time goes on. Be warned though, this is not a gut science.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the subject only, because there is a lot of new information to parse through.",
                "Yes! As long as you go to class and fill out the study guides and maybe do the readings then you will do really well in class!!",
                "This is pretty similar to any other intro-level course. It's a large lecture and the learning\/teaching done isn't very personalized. I would recommend this course as a fine introduction to biological anthropology, but it's not for someone who is looking for a super fulfilling classroom experience.",
                "Yes -- great SC gut, and you don't have to love the material (just maybe don't hate it). No homework the whole semester, unless a section ran over or if you wanted to study for quizzes. Very manageable to just show up to the lectures and weekly section and call it there, especially as a fifth class. Something to note is that sections are not there to review or reteach course material, they're something entirely different. This should be better explained in the first class.",
                "Yeah! I found it very interesting, definitely not a science gut, weekly exams give you plenty to prepare for, but I came out of the course with a ton of new knowledge about a field of science I initially knew very little about.  I don't plan on majoring in anthropology, however this course did a nice job giving me both sophisticated scientific knowledge and relevant takeaways that are applicable outside of the field itself.",
                "Yeah, it's definitely interesting to see where we came from as humans. Made me want to take another anthropology course.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting introduction to anthropology and it is quite accessible to those who are not especially scientifically inclined. The textbook and the lectures together provide a robust foundation for thinking about man's past through a biological lens.",
                "Yes, its a great class with very very little work. There are 9 in class exams that are very easy if you pay attention (and if they continue to be open book, no studying required). If the exams stay open book, you can get through the class with an A with doing *zero* work outside of class.",
                "I would not recommend it unless you are really interested in learning all there is too learn about bio-anth. It was highly detailed and overwhelming.",
                "I would definitely recommend this courseespecially to people who have never taken nor intend to continue studying anthropology. Its a great introduction to the subject.",
                "Yes, for a science credit that is not as sciencey, per se.",
                "Great course for STEM students that need a social science credit or humanities students that need a science credit.",
                "Yes. Amazing course. Good for science and not science people alike.",
                "I would  especially for non-STEM majors, I think its a class that is interesting but not out of grasp, and what I valued most was that it didnt feel like it was talking down to non-STEM majors in any way.",
                "I would. It was interesting, and the course was set up for student success. Whether or not it counts as a gut depends mostly on how good you are at taking open note tests that are very fast-paced, where the hardest thing is the time limit. Overall, though, this is a solid class, and I feel like it gives you a basic understanding of human evolution that everyone should have.",
                "No, unless they have a strong interest in biology and evolution.",
                "Yes",
                "yes, it's a great science credit for someone who is interested in the content and doesn't want to do hard science.",
                "If youre looking for a science gut, then do not take this class. This class was way more work than I anticipated. The material is super interesting, so if youre willing to put in the work to learn about bio anth, then take this course. But if youre looking for a gut, maybe dont take it.",
