   "comments": [
    "Read a lot of current and interesting texts on hot button issues",
    "I learned how to write for public audiences. This was the first ER&M course where a professor actually took me seriously as a writer. It was an amazing experience to actually be pushed to improve my writing to do something beyond a regular analytical paper.",
    "This class is about thinking critically about texts, but also about thinking about the world around us and how we want to change it. So in essence my skills are related to those things and how to better express them in my own writing. But I feel like it's more accurate to say this class was to develop my character more than my skills",
    "A great course on current topics and writing for the public.",
    "I learned a lot about the nuances of common terms like \"audience\" and \"public.\" I was pushed to think not just about the craft of writing, but about why and how we write, and what writing can and cannot be. I think I left the class a better writer and a better person.",
    "I learned how to think, read, and write critically while discussing topics of race, gender and climate change. I learned how to write for public mediums, and about the intentionality required in writing that way. I was exposed to incredible books and articles by authors I had and hadn't previously read before and was challenged to learn from, question, and critique those pieces. Most importantly, I became more aware of how to speak and and write consciously with respect to other perspectives."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great reading list, manageable workload, open-ended final assignment\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the discussion was too guided and we weren't able to organically talk and very little feedback given",
    "Professor Mirakhors expansive discussion leadership makes it easy to think in community with your classmates, who are also brilliant and thoughtful. I think it wouldve been useful to truly engage in public writing by having more opportunities to write aside from 1 paper and 1 final project; sometimes it was hard to conceptualists what we could apply in our writing from this course because we werent doing as much writing as the course title suggests.",
    "I loved this course.",
    "The course always felt rewarding to go to. It is a balance between the readings as means if study for our own writing or for our own perception and sometimes this balance feels like I've aspect isn't being as explored as it should be and other times the balance feels right",
    "Incredibly awesome material and assignments. Wished there was even more opportunities to write creatively, but given the focus of the course, it made sense.",
    "Strengths: Professor Mirakhor is one of the most amazing teachers and seminar leaders I've had at Yale. The other students were also remarkable people and thinkers, and our discussions tended to be engaged and nuanced and eye-opening. We had some especially great discussions in our classes at the YCBA. We read a bunch of excellent cultural criticism. We worked on projects we were passionate about. We asked really big and uncomfortable questions. It was just a massive experience.\r\nWeaknesses: My one real critique is that I wish the syllabus had been a bit weirder and more formally diverse. We read a lot of brilliant nonfiction writing by brilliant public intellectuals, but I wish the definition of \"public writing\" had been a bit broader. What about pamphlets? Zines? Blogging? Twitter threads? Fake news? Advertisements? Television? Public art? Graffiti? Music? Obviously there isn't room for everything -- I just think the class could have done slightly more with the fascinating central question \"What is public writing?\"",
    "The readings chosen for this class were very good. The talks we were encouraged to go to were also very good. I loved Professor Mirakhor's teaching style and engagement with our ideas, and her engagement encouraged the students to engage with each other."

   "comments": [
    "Tentatively yes - for the most part, it's a great experience, but I'm not sure what the takeaways are (or if I even have any)",
    "I think what I would tell other students is to give the class a real chance. I heard OVERWHELMINGLY positive reviews from previous students of the class and I don't think that we as a group were as close as the previous class, but I do think that the class got better and better with every passing week. I was initially very hesitant to speak at all in class, feeling pretty lost with some of the more dense material and at times almost feeling like what we were talking was too theoretical and divorced from any capacity to enact real change, but I grew in confidence as the class progressed and felt supported by Professor Mirakhor. The class as a whole became much closer too as the semester progressed and I made some good friends from it!",
    "YES!!! Youll learn so much from Professor Mirakhor and other students.",
    "Definitely. Professor Mirakhor will change the way you think about writing. As an ER&M student, i could not have been happier to take this course and wish I had taken it earlier in my Yale career. Also great for anyone who wants to think more deeply about the purpose of their writing.",
    "This course asks a lot of you because it's about a lot of important things. When I say asks a lot I mean emotionally and work wise. Some days felt inspiring, others left me feeling list or confused. But I appreciated the class, always. It's up to you too decide if you're willing to go through that, but I would way I'm glad that I did. Professor Mirakhor is also wonderful.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Mirakhor is brilliant, but the other students make the course. I was able to deeply engage with my classmates on some of the most difficult topics plaquing humankind. I gained more confidence as a writer and a thinker.",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes. If you are a writer or any type of creative who has thought about wanting to make a political impact with your work, take this class.",
    "Yes - Professor Mirakhor is extremely invested in building relationships with and between students, and her classrooms are therefore excellent spaces for learning, thinking, and feeling together.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in writing that you want others to read, take the course!",
    "Yes, I absolutely recommend this class if you want to think deeply about writing and social justice. You'll have amazing discussions about a whole range of urgent topics, from racial justice to climate change. You'll think deeply about the craft and aesthetic choices of the writers you read, and how those inform the political and moral goals of those writers. You'll get to know some amazing people. You'll question things and grow as a person.\r\n\r\nMy one piece of advice: this is not a \"how to write\" class. If you want to become a better writer on a technical level, you're better off with a workshop-based creative writing class. This is more of a meta, how-do-we-think-about-how-we-write class. But that doesn't mean you have to be supremely confident in your writing abilities to thrive, either. The final project is pretty open-ended--you can do basically whatever you want, from an academic paper to a museum curation to a one-woman show.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Take the class if you can, whether or not you have experience in ER&M classes. You will not regret it."
