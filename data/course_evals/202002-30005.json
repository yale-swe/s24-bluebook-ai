   "comments": [
    "The greatest skill I acquired by taking this course was the ability to decipher good research from bad research.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. It really helped apply biological foundations of human evolution to modern day observations and problems.",
    "This class is awesome for someone who isnt looking for a hard science in the sense that the course requires you to take a biosocial and bio cultural approach to all the topics covered. Each week, I learned something new from a biological perspective about a socially relevant topic.",
    "Reading research papers.",
    "Basic evolutionary biology and research analysis",
    "I loved this course!! Learned about thinking beyond the Western paradigm as well as many theories and how they can be applied to the evolutionary framework.",
    "I learned so much about evolution, biocultural anthropology, human variation, human biology, interactions between sociocultural dynamics and health, etc. I also feel like I gained better scientific literacy skills and critical thinking on scientific research.",
    "Understanding of human biology from an evolutionary perspective! Also, understanding what kind of things are considered \"normal,\" and why we stigmatize them.",
    "so so much! how orangutans get obese by eating too much fruit, how staying up too late is correlated with depression, why women have lower morbidity rates, and why stress isn't always a bad thing. I could go on forever",
    "As someone who had absolutely no background in science, I learned everything from cell biology to reproductive systems. After the foundation, there was such a fascinating combination of topics, which covered everything from epigenetics to microbiomes. It had a great balance of readings and assignments that enhanced the learning experience. As far as insights, there was a great focus on humans and social issues that are backed by fake biology to try to justify atrocities.",
    "I learned so much about why we as humans are the way we are today. Why we made certain adaptations and not others. I feel like I understand myself more now.",
    "I gained a better understanding of evolution and how it applies to us in our lives.",
    "Evolutionary medicine, how to reevaluate biology and life through anthropological lens",
    "I developed a comprehensive understanding of human evolution theory, natural selection, and how that critical interplay between organisms and their environment informs so much of our everyday lives. I also grew much better at reading and comprehending scientific studies.",
    "How to look at human biology through an evolutionary lens.",
    "A critical understanding of how biology and ecology have shaped current human health and society. Learnt about biological anthropology as a biocultural\/biocultural field, and how combining knowledge from the sciences and social sciences can help understanding of human individuals and communities.",
    "We learned about human evolution and the pathway of evolution in regards to human variation, energetics, biological rhythms, and reproduction.",
    "A strong evolutionary perspective that can be applied to a lot of issues regarding race, medicine, and just overall health.",
    "I now think of human behavior through an evolutionary lens, which allows me to feel as if I have a greater aspect as to why things happen.",
    "I learned the basics of human evolutionary biology, and I improved my ability to read scientific journals.",
    "I got an overview of human evolution and biology.",
    "I developed an understanding of evolutionary frameworks and life history theory, and how those two perspectives inform bioculture of human beings. I also was able to engaged to think critically about my own life and how evolutionary forces have shaped who I am.",
    "This was my first anthropology class, so I learned a lot about human biological diversity from the perspective of evolutionary and life history theory. It was a pretty standard in discussing variation in growth, immune function, maturation, reproductive function, but I loved hearing about the TA's independent research and Claudia's personal experience. We talked a lot about Evolutionary Theory, Life History Theory, nutrition, growth, and evolutionary medicine.",
    "How to understand evolution from a historical and anthropological perspective, how evolution can be applied to medicine and our bodily functions in general.",
    "It was very interesting to learn about race and the fact the humans are so genetically similar that the only difference is phenotypic.",
    "intersectionality of society and biology, synthesizing skills.",
    "I learned a lot about human adaptation and the various ways humans are both evolved to maximize reproduction, but also left vulnerable to ailments; how individuals in quite mismatched to modern, industrialized environments in developed countries whereas our biology is widely built for Hunter-gatherer, feast-famine conditions. The course greatly contextualizes modern human biology especially as it relates to intersections medical racism in COVID-19 treatment as well as growth stunting due to water source pollution in formerly colonized populations.",
    "I learned about how to become a science student again as well as about the field of bio anthropology. This was a really lovely science credit. It wasn't overly challenging but also wasn't easy which I enjoyed.",
    "Information on human evolution including aspects of age, sexual reproduction, maternity, food health, and biological rhythyms.",
    "General knowledge about evolution and biology.",
    "I learned how to critically think about the connections between social science and biology in our society.",
    "I learned about the biology of human beings. For a person, who finds difficulty learning science, I really enjoyed this class and found it to be super informative.",
    "I learned about the foundational concepts of human evolutionary biology and aspects of life history. The course's focus on non-western populations highlighted the diversity of the human population. Other interesting topics in the course include research ethics, stress, energy expenditure, race and medicine, human disease, evolutionary medicine, and reproductive ecology.",
    "I learned how to summarize and expand on important data in an article",
    "I learned so much about the human body, why things are the way they are, how things came to be, and how things change over time and why. We covered so many different topics ranging from the basics of evolution to evolutionary medicine to the human reproductive system and other topics relating to the human body. There was an emphasis on the interactions between the socio-economic-political context and biology, so while we learned the science behind many things, we also learned how the environment impacts these biological processes. Learned how to read scientific papers and write succinctly and think critically.",
    "Learned a lot about evolutionary biology.",
    "Usually, science related courses are not my strongest point but this course taught its units in a very practical manner and the readings were also practical as well, all of which helped me gain a greater understanding of human evolutionary biology. Also, this course dispelled many misconceptions I had about what it meant to have an average or normal body, as well as the science behind what we consider to be biological characteristics, and that how these corporeal perceptions are foregrounded in many biases and misunderstandings of environment and genetics.",
    "I learned a conceptual framework for human evolution, but I also learned a lot about where our modern day concepts of culture, race, and ethnicity come from.",
    "good understanding of evolutionary biology concepts"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is strong at engaging students in a higher level of thinking and applying what we learned directly into the real world. The course could have been better if it was in person, but I understand the precautions taken due to COVID-19.",
    "Weekly writing assignments were helpful and really forced you to engage with the assigned readings, but I found the online format of the course really difficultyou're on zoom for 3.25 hour sessions twice a week. Hard to stay engaged for that length of time, particularly over zoom.",
    "Strength is the format of the lectures with several breaks and discussion breakout sessions.",
    "Strengths of the course: the teaching team is absolutely phenomenal. Claudia is not only an expert in her field but a fantastic, personable professor. I want to take more of her classes. Also, all the TAs contributed a lot to the material of the course as well.",
    "Weakness: Not much specialized knowledge.\r\nStrength: Professor was great.",
    "Strengths are the format was engaging and the material was great- really appreciated the non-Western focus. This is probably just due to the condensed nature, but I wish that there was more integration of the readings into class and just more time in general to sit with each area.",
    "Only strengths, no weaknesses. It was engaging, interactive, important, and thoughtfully planned curriculum. I only wish it could have been in person :(",
    "strengths: AMAZING interesting content, and Claudia is a great teacher. You can tell she is so passionate about what she's talking about. \r\nweaknesses: Honestly none! discussion was made a little difficult by the fact that we were online, but besides that it was great.",
    "literally only strengths. its perfect for a non stem person like me with zero interest or ability in science. I was super engaged the entire time and was genuinely interested in the subject material. The stuff we learn is super relevant to helping you live your best life",
    "It was a fantastic learning environment, Claudia and the teaching team really cared about the students and built the course load considering the needs of the students. The meditation at the beginning of class really helped me feel focused to begin learning. I was sad we were not able to have an in-person version of this class as I'm sure it would have been even better. The only weakness I can think of is that the classes were a bit long, though I think the breaks really helped. So if I could change one thing, I think I would prefer shorter classes over a longer period of time.",
    "Claudia is amazing. She was such a breath of fresh air every time we met, and her passion and care for the topics and her students made the course so much better. The expectations in terms of grading were clear. The workload was very manageable.\r\nWhile it could not be avoided, I do feel as though 3 hour classes online were a bit much. Other than that, though, this course is pretty well organized and taught.",
    "While this course certainly did a good job of highlighting the social aspects of evolution and science, much of the lecture felt either far too complicated or entirely trivial.  I feel that this class easily could have had less than half of the lecture time and covered the same material.",
    "This course does a great job of making evolution and biological anthropology feel personal. It could have been an abstract study of these topics but every session found a way to relate to our daily lives. I found myself sharing so much of what we discussed with my family each night because it was so fascinating. This entire course provides an evolutionary context for the way we live our lives, which I am grateful for, and which I think so many people would benefit from if they had a chance to take this course too. Modern humans are just a blip on the giant timeline of this planet (#deeptime) and we are the products of natural selection. Also, more people need to understand that variation is OK and that western, industrial, educated, rich, and democratic societies are not the pinnacle of evolution or science! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses were that we did not have enough time to discuss these topics in break out rooms. Even though the course was already split up into really big chunks of time, it would have benefited from a (optional) section.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Valeggia's lectures, and her care\/concern for students and for making the class an equitable space were great. Weaknesses: lectures felt really long, even with breaks, but I guess that was a byproduct of the class being offered online. Also, THE EXAMS WERE WAY TOO LONG! They took me +10 hours and I find that to be way too much and mentally draining. I would've much rather preferred a timed exam.",
    "Strengths: the course included a lot of opportunity for discussion, and the reading questions were open-ended and encouraged you to engage with the material. It was a great way to learn, especially in an online context where it's easy to feel isolated from the learning community. Thinking about universally relevant concepts like reproductive health and sleep was also a great way to apply the material and consider how it affects us in daily life. \r\nI really appreciated that the course started with a lecture on ethics. \r\nThe breakout rooms were great - I loved getting to know a small group of people (especially considering the online context) and actively engaging with the material.\r\nWeaknesses: the course focussed a lot on human medical\/health issues (understandably). It focussed mainly on how environments have shaped humans; I would've liked to also consider how human evolution and biology have shaped environments\/our relationship with the \"natural\" world (for example, the cyclical relationship of agriculture\/human health\/ecosystem health). \r\nThat being said, it was interesting to learn about some basic medical concepts as a non-premed student!",
    "The interactive levels of this class were really well done. We were frequently put in breakout rooms to discuss issues and all students had the ability to speak up during class to ask questions and participate. All the TAs and the professor were very knowledgeable about the issues and very comprehensive in teaching the class material.",
    "Weakness: Just very long class time. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Professor Valeggia was a sweetheart and was very passionate about the topics which made the material engaging. The flash talks were also a good way to apply learned topics!",
    "Strengths were the teaching team. Weaknesses were only having 2 classes\/week and having them be too long.",
    "The strengths of this course is Professor Valeggia! She's one of the best instructors at Yale. She's super engaging, and I enjoyed her use of breakout rooms. She was incredibly considerate of different people's circumstances at home, which made the environment comfortable and personable. I also really liked the readings. I thought they were engaging, and, even as a non-STEM major, they were digestible. \r\n\r\nI think some of the earlier readings were somewhat lost towards the end of class. I wish we discussed later topics in the context of the readings from the first two weeks. Otherwise, I think the early textbook readings were somewhat useless, since they weren't practical or applied to future concepts.",
    "The lectures weren't very engaging, but Professor Valeggia is really a gem, and she's very invested in your learning and well-being. This is an intro level class, so don't expect too much in=depth material.",
    "The professor is engaging and amazingly sweet. She very obviously cares about her students and is willing to make time to talk and lessen whatever stresses they have about the class. The subjects are just very interesting. One weakness of the course is that the grading of reading responses is really arbitrary sometimes. They have \"rubrics\" that are extremely vague and the TAs have marked many people off on points that aren't explicitly indicated on the rubric. Also, since the course was online, the breakout rooms were basically the only time people had to participate, and there weren't that many. The topics of the breakout rooms when we did have them were not really what was interesting about the lecture (i.e. not synthesizing) but were based on activities that really didn't contribute to understanding.",
    "Strength: very broad, survey class that covered a lot of material, and the readings were especially interesting. Claudia is just a very interesting person, and her passion for the material makes the 3 hours pass by pretty quickly.\r\nWeakness: I didn't like the breakout rooms very much  the conversations lack depth and dominated by a few people.",
    "Interesting topics, class itself was a little long",
    "strengths: commitment from teaching team to students, ample support and opportunity for engagement.",
    "Strengths: the course really powerfully allowed both informative lecture and student participation. Breakout sessions allowed for meaningful discussion\/interaction with topics and allowed for students to present despite the large class size",
    "The teaching team was always available to help\/support students. They were extremely considerate to workload and ensured we could learn the material without feeling too overwhelmed.",
    "A strength was the professor being so insightful and open minded as well as the TFs who were all incredibly helpful.",
    "Strengths - amazing professor that really cares about the students learning!\r\nWeakness - this was a packed course so discussions were sometimes limiting",
    "Great course, online classes were a bit tedious but alas.",
    "The lectures were definitely too long (3.5 hours), but they were very engaging and the assignments were interesting.",
    "Very good general approach to human biology and evolution",
    "There really no are no major weaknesses to the course. Perhaps the lectures were very long, but given how short summer session was its understandable. Professor Vallegia is amazing all around. I come from a high school background in which I was not prepared for science at Yale. I was completely able to take the material and learn from it.",
    "Claudia and the entire teaching team were very kind and clearly super passionate about the material, and topics were very interesting. Only weakness was that the class was too long; its pretty hard to focus for three hours, especially on Zoom. Perhaps the class could be modified to take place three times per week, two hours per session instead?",
    "The course covers so many fascinating and relevant topics. The assignments are fair and the midterm and final exams were creative.",
    "I'm good at finding the important information and finding examples",
    "Strengths: Claudia and the teaching team! They were so very helpful and supportive and wanted to make our learning experience the best possible despite the complexities of having class over zoom and with so many students. The class also covered a broad array of topics which I really enjoyed and I appreciated how Claudia wanted us to not just learn content but really be able to think critically about the things we read and heard. Very organized as well which was impressive considering how many people there were and it was over zoom. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Grading standards were a bit confusing to me but the rubrics helped a lot.",
    "I thought that the class was very strong. Maybe more discussion would be helpful.",
    "The readings and the discussions were very practical and the work was very straightforward. The teaching faculty were extremely helpful and willing to assist with both the workload and in understanding of the material. However, this is partly because of the online format, but participation was difficult since there were so many students and the breakout rooms did not last very long.",
    "I think this course was great and no changes (besides having it in person) are needed to improve it!",
    "Strength was the professor! Claudia was amazing. I also greatly appreciated biology from a curriculum based on non-western societies. \r\n\r\nWeakness was that i",
    "hard to keep focused over zoom, but claudia was as great as she could have been"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provides many interesting insights into the different aspects of Human Evolutionary Biology. Furthermore, Professor Valeggia is an expert in the subject matter who provided extra opportunities for students to learn more whenever possible.",
    "Yes, it is really interesting and you learn a lot of information that is helpful in your everyday life.",
    "Most definitely. If you are looking to fulfill a science requirement, take this one. This class will also give you a lot of useful knowledge that one should just generally know for everyday life.",
    "If you need a science credit, this is a good choice. Interesting but not too much work.",
    "Highly recommend! Especially if you need a science credit",
    "Yes, definitely. Honestly, I think it should be required for everyone who expects to work in the medical field, so that they understand the intersection of race and biology.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. You don't need to walk in with amazing science skills, you will learn a lot and think more deeply about human biology and populations. The instructors give a lot of helpful guidance, so you will never be overwhelmed.  Also, Claudia is such a joy to take a class with, so 100% take it.",
    "Yes! Claudia has such a great vibe and she is so kind\/understanding towards her students. Further, she is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about her course, and is willing to customize it to what that class of students is particularly interested in. As for the actual content of the course, it is all very interesting, no matter if your background is in the biological sciences or not. It is also applicable to our every day lives, and we were also given the opportunity to do some of our own research on the subject we covered that interested us the most.",
    "100 percent yes. everyone and anyone should take this class. evolution rocks",
    "Absolutely, and I have! This course is inviting to everyone, regardless of background knowledge. And Claudia does a great job of keeping everyone engaged.",
    "Yes! The material is highly applicable to your daily life, and it is relatively simple to understand. One of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to humanities students who want a better background in life history and evolution.  I would strongly recommend that students with an existing background in biology do not take this course as they would likely be extremely bored.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Valeggia is passionate about the topic and it clearly shows through how she conducts this course!",
    "Yes! An evolutionary context for our lives is so essential if we really want to get to the bottom of how stress, sleep, and physical activity affects us and how we can optimize these seemingly mundane things to live healthier, clearer lives.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if you're interested at all in evolution or learning more about human biology! As a CogSci major with relatively little biology experience, this course was great at diving deep enough into the biology without necessitating too much prior knowledge of things like DNA or epigenetics. If you're looking for a gut SC, this might not be the best option, especially if taking during the summer. There were readings assigned before each ~3-hour lecture (2x\/week), which in the online format was broken up using 5-10 minute breaks as well as breakout rooms (which were basically sections) throughout the ~3 hours. We had \"DQs\" which were essentially short writing assignments (~300 words)\/prompts based on the readings due the night before each class. \r\n\r\nGiven that the class covers a wide variety of topics in evolutionary theory\/human biology, at times it could feel quite fast-paced if you didn't necessarily have prior knowledge of the subject, but the midterm and final helped make sure you had a solid grasp on them and weren't too bad. Both were take-home format, answering a variety of essay questions\/prompts designed to integrate the material and knowledge from the course. The last week was more intense with the Flash Talk presentations, final DQ, and final exam so beware if you're taking it with another class that the final week may definitely be more intensive. \r\n\r\nAll in all, though, Claudia is a WONDERFUL professor and I would absolutely recommend taking this or another class with her if you can! She started each class with a 5-minute meditation, incorporated breaks, had meaningful and socially-aware discussions with us, and generally cared so much about both the content and her students.",
    "Yes, I think the evolutionary perspective this course provides and unique and sheds a light on a lot of human biology and how our bodies and physiology came to be.",
    "Definitely recommend, for almost anyone. The course content is highly relatable and applicable, and the entire teaching team was amazing. The structure of the course allows you to really engage with the material and think critically, which is rare in science courses.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in human evolution and want a science credit without needing prior knowledge, then this class is fantastic. Very insightful.",
    "Yes its a good introduction to a lot of evolutionary and other general science topics.",
    "Yes, the class was very interesting and kept me entertained the entire 3.5 hours.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. I learned a lot about human health and human evolution and I think its a really eye-opening subject for anyone looking into health and medicine.",
    "Yes. I feel more confident in my role as a human being in society because of this class.",
    "Definitely. Professor Valeggia is wonderful. As a non-STEM major, I felt like I learned more in this class than I ever expected to. I feel significantly more comfortable reading scientific papers, and I have a much better understanding of the biology surrounding me. The workload is completely reasonable, and the teaching staff will do everything in their power to help you succeed.",
    "Yes! Great, easy class for a science credit!",
    "This is an absolutely great science class for non-STEM majors. It is intuitive, interesting, and the professor obviously cares about the course very much. The workload is manageable.",
    "Would recommend for anyone who's looking for a SCI credit  much less painful than your traditional bio\/chem\/physics.",
    "Yes, its a good option for non-science majors especially to explore biology and evolution",
    "Yes, people have to know that all races are the same and that racism is not founded in science.",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course regardless of major. As a humanities\/social science person, I appreciated that this class contextualized human biology in histories of the race myth, socioeconomic inequality and oppression.",
    "Yes I would. Taking the course summer session as a social science major was a bit of a transition at first but it ended up being  a fairly easy class (as long as you do the work) and I enjoyed it!",
    "Yes! The course was very welcoming and straight-forward.",
    "Yes, Prof Valeggia is the best.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the intersection between social and natural science, especially if you're looking for an engaging class to fulfill your science requirement.",
    "Yes I really enjoyed this course.",
    "Yes. Best science credit possible.",
    "Yes! Great science credit, pretty painless as long as you put in the work.",
    "Yes. Professor Valeggia is a great professor and the class content is interesting and applicable in so many other areas of study. This is a great course for STEM and non-STEM majors and surpassed my expectations.",
    "Yes. This is a great class to take for non science majors and has very interesting information.",
    "Yes! It is a wonderful class that teaches you about human evolutionary biology and life history and what biological anthropology is but also how to think and read and write as well. I loved how it was a science credit but because it was biological anthropology we learned a lot about other societal and economic and political factors that contribute to the science. Claudia is wonderful and the TA's as well!",
    "Absolutely. It is a very good course and not too difficult.",
    "This course is fantastic! Claudia is incredible.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to every student, especially premed students. The human biology topics we discussed in class dispelled many misconceptions about race, gender, and even class. I believe this class is vital for those who are more scientifically inclined and want (see: need) further education on intersections of social conditions on health and the body.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student and have already tried to encourage some of my friends to take it. If you're not interested in anthropology, but are a pre-med, this class is great for learning about other factors that might contribute to medicine. These conversations are especially important given the time that we live in and how we are finally looking back at our country's racist origins, and many of topics learned in this class are great for deconstructing racial biases, specifically topics like how race is a construct and how we may observe population differences, but these are not racial differences. Additionally, there wasn't too much reading, and what there was wasn't too hard to get through, especially if you're a fast reader or get a lot of information from skimming (I can do neither). Professor Valeggia and the TFs were all incredibly nice, accommodating, understanding, and helpful. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this class and would highly recommend it.",
    "It is an interesting perspective to have for a science credit. Yes, I'd recommend taking the class, or any other classes by Claudia Valeggia.",
    "yes, to fulfill science credit for non-stem people"
