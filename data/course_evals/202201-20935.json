                "Background on human rights theory, institutions and legal bodies, and advocacy. I truly knew nothing about human rights before taking this course, and I feel like my body of knowledge has grown a lot. I don't think I really developed any new skills, although I'll say the class does a great job of getting you to think critically about the human rights discipline. As a student in my section said, \"it's one of the only classes where we've been asked to question the class's existence.\"",
                "I was exposed to the theories and politics of human rights that I had never before learned about. I had no background in the institutional history and structure of international human rights bodies, nor the philosophical backdrop of human rights. The readings allowed me to apply those concepts to issues I do know and care about.",
                "The ins and outs of the international human rights system and the foundation of how we can consider human rights based on a variety of limitations and stipulations built within the systems and institutions surrounding rights domestically and internationally.",
                "I learned a significant amount of knowledge about human rights as a theory and international law. The material was broad enough to apply it to interests that mattered most to oneself, and I had the opportunity to think about issues pertinent to my concern with the application of human rights.",
                "The course provided key insights into the international human rights framework - with emphasis on the development of the international system for human rights and contemporary advocacy practices and networks. The course also provided students with skills to analyze contemporary human rights issues and evaluate best methods address them, either regionally or internationally. Additionally, the course facilitated an overarching debate over the role of the human rights framework with regard to cultural relativism or a universal approach.",
                "I learned about the value of human rights law and standards for different agents of change. I also leaned about what mechanisms exist to enforce and promote human rights principles.",
                "I learned a lot about different human rights mechanisms and theoretical frameworks of human rights.",
                "I learned to consider human rights multidisciplinarily, as a framework of thought applying to many contemporary issues. The course was an overview but surprisingly comprehensive in history, bodies of rights, and giving us a good foundation to apply this framework to future work.",
                "In this class, some of the skills I developed included close and speed reading skills, public speaking skills, analytical skills when completing the readings and writing the weekly discussion questions, and writing and researching skills to complete the challenging final paper."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: you get a ton of background on human rights, both the theory and the international mechanisms that promote and enforce it\r\nWeaknesses: it's probably too broad for one semester. I understand the need to cover all of theories, practices, and politics, but I would have been able to engage with the material more critically if it had focused on one of those areas. Also, sometimes it felt like the course was structured strangely. For example, we covered international legal mechanisms before bodies of rights. How am I supposed to understand the courts' work if I don't know what laws they're referencing? I also think the class would benefit from reworking the grading scheme. Right now, almost 50% of the grade is based on the final paper, and that's really our only major assignment. How am I supposed to apply feedback if the only assignment on which I receive feedback is at the end of the course? I think it would be advantageous to have a midterm paper and a shorter final paper instead.",
                "I wish this course got to the \"bodies of rights\" portion earlier in the semester, perhaps incorporating some of the theory\/history\/structure material into that study. I did enjoy the diversity of readings and felt there was always at least one I could resonate with.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, sections were very informative\r\nWeakness: none",
                "Strengths: Professor Beckerle and her experience in this area was the greatest strength for the class. The professor has vast knowledge of the course material and presented excellent, informative lectures every week. Additionally, the reading selection was generally very good, with several readings providing interesting and compelling arguments on the issues. Points for improvement: there were some moments in the semester that could have benefited from a lighter reading load in exchange for more in-depth conversations on the material.",
                "The course could be improved by having more major assignments throughout that allow for us to get a sense of what the professor and TAs are looking for in terms of style and substance of writing. It felt a little off to have one major essay worth nearly half of our grade and no other major papers throughout the semester that could accustom us\/expose us to the grading style of the instructors. \r\n\r\nI would also decrease the amount of reading for the course and instead focus on the most important parts of readings to assign to students. I was unable to complete all of the reading most of the time and wouldve appreciated some guidance on what were the most important parts instead.",
                "Its an overview so lots of breadth with less depth. I really enjoyed the mix of formats for lectures, and the sections. I wish less weight was placed on the final paper, because it felt like the course was so engaging leading up to finals but that engagement\/work was worth less.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course include: \r\n-The lecture format, which allowed participation as well as learning \r\n-Professor Beckerle's interesting lectures and well-organized presentation \r\n-The very helpful TAs \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n-The long reading that though helpful and interesting, sometimes consumed too much time and was not addressed during lectures \r\n-The 50-minute lecture format (I believe that with a longer lecture, we would have been to cover the wide variety of topics with a little more depth)"

                "Sure, but if you're not in MAPHR and you don't already have a pre-existing interest in international human rights, I think other classes would be more engaging.",
                "Yes, if you are looking to get a foundation in human rights work. I definitely found the most interesting material in the second half of the course.",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in human rights this course is extremely informative and beneficial",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in policy, on any level. I never thought I was too interested in international policy over domestic, but this was my favorite class this semester. If you are interested primarily in international policy, you can apply the topics and issues to domestic issues. So, this class is engaging.",
                "Yes, I strongly recommend this course to any student interested in the history and development of the international human rights framework. This course serves as an excellent introduction to the key developments and political underpinnings of the present system, while motivating students to come to their own conclusions about the state of the human rights system today.",
                "Yes! Good introduction to human rights.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone whos interested in human rights. It is a great entry course that gets you thinking and learning about different aspects of the topics.",
                "Yes! If you have any interest in human rights and want an introduction, its great.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student that is prepared for a high workload and is willing to dedicate a good amount of time to the weekly assignments. The lectures were all really interesting and engaging. Students must also be prepared to participate and engage in class in order to get the most out of the class. It is also important to be aware that a lot of the readings are theory-based and as such, challenging.",
                "Yes- excellent professor and gives you a really comprehensive understanding of the language and themes of human rights."
