    "Language skills: past tense, future tense, subjunctive, imperfect, present perfect",
    "I learned that Spanish is hard and miserable and I should have picked literally any other way to fulfill my foreign language requirement. Honestly, this class went so fast (and, to be fair, because I am a miserable student of the Spanish language) I probably ended up net forgetting more than I learned about this language.",
    "My spanish skills improved vastly, especially my speaking and listening skills. I learnt so much more vocabulary and grammar rules. As well as this, I learnt many cultural things about different countries which was an added benefit.",
    "My Spanish developed quickly and I learned more grammar than I thought possible.",
    "Got better at spanish!",
    "Developed my beginning spanish",
    "Spanish grammar",
    "Foreign language skills",
    "Learned lots of new Spanish skills and improved on those I knew. New skills included subjunctive, present perfect, etc. and also more about Spanish culture.",
    "I grew so much as a Spanish learner while taking this course. There is obviously a lot of grammatical and technical learning packed into a semester, but Prof. Alexandrov taught in such a way that it never felt overwhelming. It is frustrating, at points, to see your grade not reflect the growth you've done, but your ability will grow, trust me."

   "comments": [
    "Everything was helpful except for some of the readings. Don Quijote and another story about El Alcalde were both beyond our comprehension mostly, and placed right before the last exam, meaning we spent about a week and a half of review time reading stuff we couldnt understand",
    "***Strengths: Professor Alexandrov. (If you have to take this course, make sure it is with her!) Weaknesses: Too ambitious, too fast-paced. This class assumes everyone is on board every step of the way, and if that is not the case, one will be miserably dragged along for the rest of the semester unsure of what is happening, unable to understand the lessons or instructions and sad in general. This course is very well structured, which I would normally consider to be a strength, but the class is actually over structured to a point that there is no time to review or for the instructor to make well-informed decisions on how best to run his or her section. The class needs to be structured in this way to proceed at the lightning pace that it does. As a reference, in L1, one learns two tenses. I struggled with that. In this class, one learns SIX tenses plus subtleties between them, which is arguably much more difficult than learning the tenses themselves. Or at least that is the theory. I cannot speak for my classmates, but I certainly did not meet this extreme expectation, and I am unsure if anyone else actually understands nearly what we were expected to know at the end of this class.",
    "I really liked how everything was done in Spanish, as this really helps with understanding when someone is speaking. As well as this, the way in which it was taught was very helpful, with learning stuff at home the previous day and then solidifying and clarifying the next day in class. \r\nI think that one way in which this course could be improved is by having a bigger focus on colloquial speaking, as we learn specific vocabulary and structures etc. This means that most of the time sentences would start with \"creo que\", \"pienso que\" etc, which was very repetitive.",
    "Strengths: the atmosphere of the classroom was great, it was rigorous but fun, it was exciting to see my language skills developing",
    "No suggestions, class is well-structured for learning",
    "Strength instructor\r\n\r\nWeakness - inflexibility imposed by language director",
    "Some materials are very hard for L2 level",
    "The course is extremely rigorous and often includes content that is too advanced for L2. When reading some comprehensions, I would have to look up every third word, not because I wasn't a good student but because the vocabulary was extremely advances.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our instructor would often mention that some of the grammatical topics that we were covering were some of the most difficult in the Spanish language. I feel that that should reflect the grade boundaries, because requiring an overall grade of 94 for an A seems unreasonable when the content is so complex and difficult.",
    "Some of the culture videos\/readings seemed kind of unrelated and unhelpful and some of the supersite activities were tricky in the sense it was hard to tell what the program wanted.",
    "I think that there could be more practice with conversational speaking and listening, using vocabulary not just from the book, but that we are likely to use in real-life in a personal conversation.",
    "Strengths: Professor Alexandrov made the class manageable, and facilitated a comfortable, casual learning environment. I also enjoyed the 9:30 section, because it forced me to engage with challenging material and start my days with a bang.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is a LOT of learning packed in. You will be highly engaged with the class almost every day, and because of that you can't slack off."

    "TAKE THIS CALSS WITH SYBIL ALEXANDROV!!! She is fantastic, kind, caring, and explains all the concepts super well.",
    "Short version: Do not take this course, but if you do, take it with Professor Alexandrov. Professor Alexandrov is a saint and deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. If you felt like you did not completely understand L1, AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. If you have to restart your foreign language requirement at L1, that is a better alternative to taking this class. Your mental state, social life, and GPA will thank you. \r\n\r\nLong version: First, I will absolutely sing the praises of Professor Alexandrov. She cares about her students a lot. Not only does she care about how much her students are learning, she also cares about if they are happy, and she genuinely does care if one is happy. She is not one of those professors that claims she \"wants you to be happy, and you will be happy if you understand the concepts better, so you should study more\" as a means to get one to perform better in her class. From the very first day of class, Professor spent countless extra hours to meet with me to attempt to help me with the material and to try to make me feel less miserable. To be totally honest, because of this class, I was this semester (and continue to be) in a very dark head space, and I fear that had I not had Professor Alexandrov, I might have had serious issues with my mental health.\r\n\r\nThat said, Professor Alexandrov's power is finite, and she was not able to make this class a pleasant experience nor was she able to make me understand anywhere near what I was expected to know. (To be clear, though, I know that I would have understood far less than the scintilla that I do know had I had anyone else.) Much of what I am about to write should be read knowing that it is through the lens of someone who is absolutely miserable in terms of natural abilities of learning a language and had a terrible L1 experience. However, I was surprised to find out very recently via the grade distribution feature on Canvas that I am not, in fact, at the very bottom of the class and that I was near the median for many of the semester's assessments. In fact, I was within a point of the median or exceeded it for all three quizzes. For reference, I am expecting to end this class nearly ten percentage points lower than L1 (which was previously my worst class by a mile).\r\n\r\nThere are many things about this course that make it unbearable. You can read my \"Strengths\/Weaknesses\" response which begins with \"***\" for reasons why success in this class is near impossible. Something else about this class is that the directions are all given in Spanish as in L1. However, I always found the instructions understandable in L1 whereas in this class I ended up doing wrong assignments or doing assignments incorrectly not because I could not do what the assignment asked (which I struggled with anyway) but rather because I did not even understand what I was supposed to be doing.  This may seem like a small thing, but when this would happen it would heavily damage my psyche. \r\n\r\nThis class might be perfect for people who are actually competent and perhaps everything that I am writing can fully be attributed to my own inadequacies. However, after exams, I would hear my peers  - who seemed to speak in Spanish with an ease I could not comprehend - talking about how hard the exam was and how they did not understand what was happening.  \r\n\r\nThe designer of this class seems to expect perfect recall instantly in order to meet the speaking expectations, immediate and permanent absorption of grammar lessons to be able to complete activities after seeing complicated grammatical structures a grand total of three or so times and then not touch said construct for weeks because there is so much other material to be covered, and mind reading abilities to tell what new words are in limited context (both orally and in writing) and to be able to guess when irregularities occur.\r\n\r\nI heard from many people that L2 would be bad, but I could not have ever known the misery it would cause. Don't be me. Run.",
    "Yes, this course is amazing if you want to improve your Spanish, and there is not much more I can say about it really.",
    "Yes. If you are looking to learn a lot of Spanish and grow as a speaker this is for you.",
    "Gotta fulfill that language requirement babyyyy",
    "No, way too much work for L2 language class, very few people did well in the calass",
    "Yes",
    "Yes it was a good course, learned a lot and definitely feel like my language proficiency has improved.",
    "Yes!!! Of course no one adores L2 of anything, but Spanish with Professor Alexandrov is an engaging, rewarding, and enjoyable experience."
