One of the most hands-on, engaging, immersive classes I've taken at Yale (if not the most). The project is where you get to practice all of these skills in depth, and Professor Lemons does a great job at making the final presentation feel high stakes because of the effort that goes into planning it and the panelists he invites -- so there's a lot of intrinsic motivation at work in this course.
