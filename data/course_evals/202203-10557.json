Most of the workload for this class came in the form of long, dense readings in need of being done in a relatively short amount of time. All of these readings needed to be understood in a considerable level of detail, and through this, this class helped me to become a more active and generally capable reader.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths - The variable paper deadline is nice because you can take control of your own schedule. Instead of having everything pile up in one week, you can choose to write your papers whenever is more convenient for you. It also means feedback gets back very quickly; each of my grades was back to me within 24 hours. Weaknesses - There's a ton of content. This class goes through so many philosophers that there's not a lot of time to get comfortable with each of them. They're also very unequally covered. We spent three class days on Marx, for example, and only half a class on Wollstonecraft. Also, in a lecture setting, it's more difficult to actively participate, and considering participation is part of the grade this is not optimal.",
                "Over 10 philosophies taught. The lectures are very boring and not engaging. The professor speaks in the most boring voice, reading straight from jam-packed slides, and because many are in german he writes in that language too, and from then on he keeps those phrases in the slides too so it's hard to follow. Pogge also only points your problems in all your work, he never offers guidance to improve. Nobody wants to be a TF or peer tutor for him for a reason so he doesn't have any for this lecture/leminar class. Class discussion also barely exists, same as if its a big lecture. He also does not provide any prompts for the short papers, he is the most clueless guy.",
                "It's a very weird format- there's a lecture with no section and little room for participation, yet participation is 1/6th of the grade. Also, there's an in-person 3-hour final exam, but the rest of the course is essay-based. I think this course could be improved by making it all essay-based, and creating more room for legitimate discourse.",
                "A section or some form of engagement should be added to the class. There was virtually no component of interaction with the professor, and he did not actively demonstrate willingness to engage people with the materials instead of just giving his usual lectures on the topics.",
                "While the lectures are interesting, they are not very engaging. There is very little class discussion, with the layout resembling a lecture despite the class's small size. We were not well prepared to write papers and Professor Pogge's feedback does not reflect his grading well. Despite a lot of effort, I did not feel like I was given feedback that allowed me to improve (as reflected in how my papers were graded).",
                "Professor Pogge is a fantastic teacher and I loved his lectures. The reading assignments are a bit much, though. To be honest, you can just skim them and the professors explains and expands everything in a digestible manner in lecture. The feedback on writing is exceptionally prompt (we are talking hours before you get grades) and very insightful. The final exam was pretty difficult because of how much writing was expected on it. However, the curve was generous so its not too bad at the end of the day.",
                "There was no section for reasons I think we all know and it is quite shameful for Yale tbh. The PowerPoint presentation was quite dull, especially at 9:00 in the morning. It felt like every minute in that class was 10 minutes. A strength I would say is the knowledge of the professor, although he was very pretentious and kept a lot in the original German and Latin for no reason. I say change professors for moral reasons, but if you insist on keeping this professor, change the time to a time where it's not easy to fall asleep. Also, when he graded papers, he would just leave a large comment at the end of the paper and not really comment throughout it, which doesn't help with improvement.",
                "This main weaknesses of the course is that it is taught in a way that does not take advantage of the texts assigned and there is limited student engagement in class. The strengths of the course are that the professor teaches concepts well in class and is very knowledgable about the material.",
                "This course is designed as a lecture but functioned as a section. I did not find this environment conducive to free-flowing conversation, even though participation is factored into grading. I also did not find the course very interactive and felt a little loss with the schedule at times.",
                "The strengths are that we get to learn about a lot of different views and talk about a wide variety of concepts. However, because there is so much material, it is hard to keep up with the class sometimes between the readings and the lectures. I also wish that we would have gotten more feedback on participation grades and how that could improve, because for the most part the class was a lecture and it was difficult to participate.",
                "This course made me a much better reader and allowed for a lot of exposure to more complex ways of thought than I had previously encountered, some of which I hope rubbed off on me. However, the amount of reading that we had to do, in my estimation, got in the way of being able to thoroughly engage with some of the texts at times. Rather than being focused on truly engaging with the material and trying to absorb it to the best of my ability, I always had to focus on new material. In all honesty, I don't know that anything really stuck until reading week when I went back through all of my notes. I think that cutting down on the number of authors read in the class could help with this while still allowing for the beneficial skills I gained to be had.",
                "The class is genuinely just boring, and I like philosophy enough to want to major in it!",
                "Strengths: well-structured course, the lectures were helpful in making sense of the difficult reading material, the professor was very available and responded to emails promptly\r\nWeaknesses: too quickly-paced, not enough time for in class discussion,  the final exam was not well-explained and was extraordinarily difficult to study for.",
                "Terrible course, The final was put at 7pm and lasted nearly 4 hours on one of the last days. It was totally unreasonable and overly stressful for everybody. No practice questions or any kind of help or advice was given.",
                "I was really disappointed in this course overall. I was hoping for more guidance on how to write a philosophy paper, and that was not achieved. A section would improve this class drastically. For many of the weeks my papers were due, my TA was in eastern Europe, and meeting with her was very hard. The material was very clear to the professor but as he communicated it to students, it was often times confusing and hard to follow. It was called an introduction class, but I felt like I needed to have taken another philosophy class prior to this.",
                "This course could probably use more discussion to induce higher engagement, but otherwise it was a well-taught lecture course!",
                "Strengths: Professor Pogge was very insightful and knowledgeable. Was very helpful 1 on 1. \r\n\r\nWeakness: How the course was taught - the powerpoints had so many words on them and it became increasingly difficult to retain/pay attention to some information. I wish the course was more organized. Furthermore, I wish we learned how to actually write a philosophy paper.  I felt like I was thrown into it without any guidance or support (structure wise).",
                "Better organization and communication",
                "The slides are illegible. There will be like a whole paragraph that I can't read in 15 seconds.",
                "Their was little communication from the professor regarding what to expect in the final exam and in papers we had to turn in yet his grading was harsh and often times did not offer constructive feedback. Their was little in-class discussion and engagement with the students, instead the professor would monologue a lecture for an hour and fifteen minutes. I did enjoy the selection of books chosen for the class."

                "No. The lectures do not very much permit discussion, the reading-load is intense, and the grading feels somewhat arbitrary.",
                "Yes, Id for sure recommend this course. Its a great survey where the professor explains everything in an understandable manner. Everybody should learn philosophy as it helps writing and understanding the world. The readings are tedious, but the content is worth it.",

                "Despite this course being quite unenjoyable at times, it's not a class that I regret taking. The skills that I gained from this course are nothing short of invaluable. And looking at it in retrospect, it was a class that, given its difficulty and workload, made me feel as though I truly accomplished something by its end. So yes, I would recommend it to others, not because it was fun or easy, but because it was extremely constructive.",
                "Truly, no. I wish I had picked a different, more engaging course to fulfill my requirement. Political philosophy can be so interesting, and this class was so painful.",
                "This course provided a great foundation of political philosophy. It required a lot of reading and work outside of class to stay engaged and succeed.",
                "Absolutely not",
                "No (unless you must take it (and even then consider not taking it with Pogge)). I did learn very broadly about some philosophers but there are FAR better philosophy courses at Yale.",
                "I would recommend a philosophy course, but not this one with this professor and this structure. Previous introductory philosophy courses had more active TAs and sections. They got to discuss the material in a smaller setting which is crucial to understanding philosophy. I compared notes with a  student that took this course last fall and they even spent a day learning how to write a philosophy paper. This would have helped tremendously.",
                "Yes, but only if they were already interested in ethics, politics, or philosophy.",
                "I unfortunately would not. I came in with very high expectations because I was really excited about the course but as we went through the semester it was a challenge to stay engaged due to the powerpoint presentations every class (that were not conducive to student learning or engagement). I wish I would have retained more information and learned a bit more about philosophy in general given that it was an introductory course.",
                "No, unless they were well acquainted with the material",
                "No. I only took this because it was a requirement. This class is not tailored to student learning. There aren't even office hours available in-person or over Zoom. There was also supposed to be an interactive character to this class and that was never met. The silence was suffocating. And not because it was 9am. It was because we all felt lost and uncomfortable.",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student, the professor offers little resources to improve on your understanding of the readings, he is a harsh grader without having TF's you can consult for guidance, and he simply monologues all of his lectures in a quiet and monotone voice. His feedback on essays are not constructive but rather belittle the hard work you invested in writing the paper. The philosophers we read have interesting things to say but the structure of the class makes it difficult to fully understand them and appreciate them."
