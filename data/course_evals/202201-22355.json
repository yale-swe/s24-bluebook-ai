                "Strengths: great course and amazing enthusiastic teacher\r\nWeaknesses: large workload",
                "Strengths: Profesora Sab did a great job making this class actually fun, which I was surprised about. I legitimately laughed in class about once a week. Also, it always felt hard but never unmanageably hard, and very little of it felt unfair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing that I think can be changed.",
                "The strength of the course was definitely the professor. Prof Maria Lourdes was so lively, energetic and passionate about not only teaching but conveying the material properly. She is very meticulous and diligent in the way she graded along with providing detailed feedback. The biggest weakness is the workload, even though the language itself is not the hardest, there is always a lot of work. Presentations, projects, homework and other graded assignments really pile up over the course of a semester and can feel like a huge burden if you're taking other courses that demand a lot of effort.",
                "Very strong curriculum that actually teaches you Spanish. Loved the emphasis on speaking. The amount of content in the last couple months was a lot, and felt a bit lopsided towards the end, but otherwise solid.",

                "120 is much harder and much more work than 110. If you can set aside the time for the daily homework and weekly projects, along with studying for the class, you'll be fine.",
                "I have been very impressed with the Spanish department so far. Although I am taking language classes because I have to, I do feel like the program is very well organized and focused. If you are looking to learn a language, I would guess that Spanish is one of the better programs at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you want to become better at Spanish please take it !",
                "At the end of the day, it's Spanish, so you know what you're getting yourself into. I've heard the Spanish department is better than some of the other language departments in that it doesn't have finals or assign impossible projects, so maybe in that way yes. As for Profesora Sab, she made the class feel like a community even while we were all wading through the mess that is learning an L2 language, and I genuinely enjoyed coming to class most days.",
                "Only if you're really interested in Spanish and preferably have some prior experience in the language. It is a lot of work, and by a lot I mean a lot. Definitely not a chill language class, be ready to work consistently. If you're looking to fulfill the language requirement in a relaxed manner, take something like Portuguese or Indonesian. However, if you love the language that much and are willing to put in the work for this class, by all means take it. The professor is fantastic!",
                "If you genuinely want to learn Spanish, I highly recommend this course. Would recommend.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student looking to continue their Spanish education.",
