                "Class slides were good. Office hours was very useful. Class was lenient and accommodating for covid difficulties. Homework and exams were marked quickly. Sometimes content in homework wasn't being covered until the class after it was due and I ended up using prior knowledge to know how to do the question instead. Class is also very confusing, not exactly sure how this could be improved though.",
                "The strength of the course is its breadth. It provides good exposure to many complex topics and leaves room for wanting to know more.",
                "Strengths: Helpful grading curve. If you have the right lab section, you will be able to learn a lot about how to approach the labs from your peers' questions.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were very simple and didn't really cover much material. I didn't feel like I gained anything from going to lecture. The slides didn't really contain much information and only went over example problems (but only showed numbers and barely any explanations). I had to study\/learn on my own, and the textbook wasn't too helpful either. Furthermore, the examples done in lecture were very simple compared to what was required in the psets and exams. The psets often covered topics not discussed in lecture or the textbook and were very hard to accomplish. The Labs were also very poorly written so that it was extremely hard to understand what you had to do. There were many spelling errors and incomplete sentences. Also, labs were not graded concurrently, so you couldn't learn from previous mistakes in each lab. Luckily the grading curve helped.",
                "I think that overall the course was good, but something happened towards the end where we stopped learning a lot of new content and the Professor seemed a bit lost during the lectures. This, combined with often not making it through all of the slides, meaning that the homework often made little sense and even the TA's were surprised at our lack of knowledge.",
                "Strength: I personally really like it when professors use power point presentations. There are many really great problems to apply the general knowledge we learn in class in the presentation slides, which I thought was really helpful. Professor Reed, the TAs, and peer tutors were definitely the stars of this course, they helped so much to clarify confusing concepts and answering questions. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish there were more practice problems available.",
                "For people without any background knowledge of electronics, the lectures move through the material too quickly and are confusing. The lectures often skip multiple steps and make following along difficult. The virtual lab instructions were vague and difficult to understand. One strength of this course is that the peer tutors were fantastic and helped me understand the material and complete the homework assignments at their office hours. The course could be improved by revising the lab instructions to make them clearer and by revising the lecture powerpoints so that each step of a problem is clearly shown. Unfortunately, I didn't find this course very helpful for determining whether I want to continue to pursue EE, as I liked most of the material but was often frustrated by the course's format and pace and I didn't find the course engaging.",

                "Strengths: This class was generally well-organized, had clear lectures, and it was not hard to get help or feedback.  Weaknesses: Some of the Zoom lectures really lacked quality, although most were good.  There was not a lot of student engagement during class.",

                "Lectures were a little bland but this most likely was because of the online format.",
                "I wish I couldve actually messed around with real circuits, but I understand the limitations of this semester. I do feel like I learned a ton of random theory and I really wanted to have more problems about using it to do something, but I might just have to wait more on that til later. Also, the labs take a ton of time, and I dont know how useful that time spent was in terms of helping me learn the material and how much of my grade it was worth.",
                "Strengths: knowledgeable professor; interesting material; valuable, informative lectures; helpful and knowledgeable peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: homework based on Tuesday's lecture was due on Thursday so the peer tutoring could get crowded. It would be nice to have more peer tutoring or office hours between the time after class on Tuesday and before class on Thursday. \r\nThe written lab directions were sometimes unclear.",
                "Strengths: Professor Reed is really helpful. He does a good job explaining the material and is always willing to take questions during lecture or office hours. Also, the exams were graded pretty quickly, which I really appreciated.\r\nWeaknesses: The powerpoint slides sometimes made it difficult to follow along during lecture, especially for example problems.",
                "Sometimes the labs would be about topics that had not already been covered in class and would be confusing but other than a few hard-to-understand lectures, the class was taught very well.",
                "Strengths: It's fairly cohesive. Problem sets seemed to line up well with the lecture content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a bit hard to follow, especially later in the semester.",
                "The labs were very effective in reinforcing material covered in lectures by allowing the student to engage with topics covered in class. The lab sections were very helpful in supporting lab work. The course could be made better by spending less time on advanced topics the student is not expected to know for the exam, such as complex power and transient response, and more time on complicated but important topics, particularly transistors and transistor amplifier circuits. In addition, lab instructions could be made clearer as some steps were not explained clearly and expectations about analysis were sometimes ambiguous.",

There was often a lot of ambiguity in what needed to be included in our final report, as well as what procedure to follow. For certain labs, this led to a dramatic increase in the intended\/necessary time that they should have required. This was especially noticeable in lab three, the filters lab, where I spend almost 16 hours between trials and forming the lab report and got an 80 on it, losing points on a grade scale that was never given to us.",

                "The lectures were very effective and I really appreciated that they were recorded. I also think the peer tutoring was a great resource. Having even more peer tutoring options near the due dates of assignments would be valuable since it can sometimes be more difficult to get help over zoom when the rooms are crowded (this is just due to the nature of zoom and the restrictions of the virtual environment; the peer tutors were great)",

                "More office hours between classes and PSET due dates would have been nice to have especially because we would learn a topic and have a few problems due on those topics 2 days later. The online lab worked well but longer\/more frequent lab sessions would have helped a lot.",

The textbook is horrendous and can't make up for lack of clear instruction during lecture. Don't take this class",
                "If you want to be an electrical engineering major, then yes because you have to. If you are looking at taking this this because you want a STEM writing credit, bear in mind that this class is not easy. The writing part of this class (being the lab reports) is straight forward and pretty easy to do well with, however, the content of the class is very difficult and in my opinion, outways the benefit of being able to do a STEM writing credit",
                "I would recommend this course to any student curious about technology and how things that you interact with on a daily basis  work (i.e. computers, electricity, LEDs).",
                "No, only if its required of your major",
                "I would. I think that overall it is a fair assessment of my engineering knowledge, the test content was very justified, and the professor seemed to care whether we knew the content or not.",
                "Yes! Great intro class to electrical engineering, I learned a lot of new concepts that I wasn't really exposed to in high school. The professor is really great and patient when it comes to explaining confusing concepts. All of the material covered are also summarized concisely in the presentation, with step by step solutions to problems. I found that the textbook was a great supplement to the course, highly recommend purchasing a physical copy. The concepts can be a little challenging at first, but it gets SO much easier once you understand the concepts, because a lot of the analysis that is done is very logical and sequential. Once you get a grasp for the process, the analysis does get easier, for example, Professor Reed teaches you how to step by step solve for the Thevenin Equivalent first by zeroing the sources to find the Thevenin impedance, then you try to find the open circuit voltage etc. Plus you also just get a huge boost of self esteem and satisfaction when you solve a question right. \r\n\r\nMy one tip for this class is go to the professor's office hours, go to TA office hours, go to peer tutor office hours. They are so helpful with explaining a lot of the new concepts. Don't be embarrassed to ask questions! Overall I strongly recommend this course, doesn't matter if you are majoring in electrical engineering or not, very useful.",
                "If you're interested in EE or want to major in EE, you should take this course. However, if you're just looking for a science course (or a science course that carries a writing credit), I wouldn't recommend this course. The problem sets, even though they're confusing, don't take very long to do if you do them at peer tutoring. However, the five labs throughout the semester were time-consuming and each involved a >8 page lab report. The course isn't taught in an engaging way. In terms of grading, this course is fine, as the professor curves grades to students' advantage rather than on a true bell curve.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because it gives a great understanding of circuits, which is an extremely important topic today.",
                "I recommend this course if you are interested in electrical engineering. Taking this course is also a good way to figure out if you are interested in electrical engineering.",
                "Yes, it's a great class to take if you're looking to gain a working knowledge of basic circuits.  I definitely feel a lot more comfortable in circuit analysis and can see the applications of this class in the real world.",
                "Yes, if interested in EE",
                "Yes, definitely for STEM students. Helps to understand the basics of analogue and digital tech, can probably read spec sheets after this course.",
                "It's mandatory for some majors so you kinda have to take it, but no would not recommend.",
                "Yes but only if they are pursing an EE related degree.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in continuing with a lab science",
                "Yeah, Id recommend it to anyone who wanted to know more about circuits. But i would warm them about the workload, especially the labs.",
                "Yes, it was engaging and very informative. But students should be prepared to put in a good deal of work and be challenged.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. A lot of the skills you learn in this course can be helpful in many other areas. The circuits are basically puzzles, and solving them can help you practice approaching any problem in a different way. Also, the material is really interesting! It's cool to see how everything around you works.",
                "I would recommend EE 200 to anyone who wants a solid foundation in electrical engineering or who want to just learn a bit about circuit analysis without investing too much time.",
                "Yes, would recommend, although if you're a CS major like me looking for a deeper look into digital logic components you might be disappointed by the lack of digital systems content. Also, if you haven't taken a lab course with lots of writing yet, be prepared for that.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student considering applied physics, engineering or computer science as it is a very effective and thorough introduction to electronics.",
                "Yes, the course content was interesting and practical. The course was structured effectively and I enjoyed it. The professor was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.",
                "I had to take it for my degree. I probably would recommend it because there's nobody better to learn from than Professor Reed. He's a titan in the field of electrical engineering, so I think there's a lot to be learned and understood from such a knowledgeable professor."
