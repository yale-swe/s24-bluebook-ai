                "Strengths: this class is a great, relaxed way to learn about world energy. It's definitely a get-out-what-you-put-in sort of class. There are only a few readings assigned each week and it is not a high pressure environment, but if you're genuinely interested in the subject material you will enjoy class discussions.",
                "such a laidback course but still is worthwhile -- low workload but I still got a lot out of it",
                "Strengths: guest speakers, wonderful professor, engaging work, interesting topics and fun projects",
                "I really liked how this course covered a variety of energy topics from different angles, including policy, technology, and economics. I also really enjoyed the different formats of learning like the simulated energy auction, debate, and presentations. The only thing I would improve relates to readings -- some of the assigned papers were hundreds of pages long, which was just unrealistic to complete. I would have liked for us to have been assigned excerpts of reports and\/or be given more guidance in completing the reading homework generally.",
                "This course would be best advertised as a junior or senior seminar. Each class is a mixture of lecture and discussion, but in order to contribute meaningfully to the discussion, a significant background knowledge in energy is required. With that said, however, it is not difficult to do well in the course even with limited background knowledge. Professor Oristaglio is a very knowledgeable and understanding professor.",
                "Strength - the seminar format allowed discussions between students. I enjoyed the type of assessments. They were engaging and thoughtful.",
                "Strengths: content and activities\r\nWeaknesses: time the course is offered (Friday mornings aren't ideal)"

                "yes!! great fifth class",
                "Absolutely, it is a felxible and fun course to take that provides a good introduction into the energy industry.",
                "Yes! This class is basically Energy Studies 101. Everyone in the course (students and professor included) is very passionate about the subject matter, we cover many different topics, and it's a chill seminar where you still learn a lot.",
                "Yes if you are completing the energy studies certificate. As its title suggests, the topics discussed are very multidisciplinary and thus provide a valuable insight into the world of energy studies.",
                "Yes, great class to take for energy studies. Very light workload, but you get a lot out of it. It's so refreshing to work on projects, essays and presentations without the stress of grading or with time pressure. I found myself enjoying the assignments in this class a lot more because I didn't feel like I was doing them just because they're assigned. Every assignment draws from the real world (energy markets, Paris climate agreement, geoengineering etc.) and the knowledge you acquire is very practical.",
                "Yes! This course was a great course that viewed world energy. I really enjoyed the activities and assignments."
