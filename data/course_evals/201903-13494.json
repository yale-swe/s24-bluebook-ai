   "comments": [
    "Reading very deeply, analyzing word choice, writing longer papers",
    "This class taught me how to ask good questions. Paradise Lost is a complex poem that we may never be able to understand - it doesn't work to offer answers to problems in the poem, because there are no straight answers. The value is in asking the question, both to my peers, to professor Kastan, and through writing (papers and Canvas responses). After a few months, I've learned that there are dumb questions, and how to avoid them. It's a really important skill that you don't actually find in a lot of Yale English classes.",
    "I had read Paradise Lost in ENGL 126 before but Kastans class explores the text in the time, depth, and politics that it deserves! I had no information about the social politics surrounding the text and the contemporary ramifications of such a context. Kastan loves the text because of how it makes him feel and he is tremendously generous with sharing this love.",
    "This course dramatically advanced my close and creative reading skills. It also gave me much greater knowledge of and appreciation for Paradise Lost.",
    "Close reading skills improved, writing",
    "Basic working knowledge of Milton scholarship; close analysis skills of the text and how different books work together.",
    "I think it's clear that you will basically only learn about Paradise Lost, as well as anecdotes and snippets from Kastan's own life which inform his, and subsequently your, reading of the poem. You think about the world and religion, too, as well as gender and science and reason and everything else crammed into Milton's long poem.",
    "This course served as a close reading of Milton's Paradise Lost. We read the entire poem, each week covering a subsequent book in the text. This class sharpened my abilities as a reader of poetry. Professor Kastan's focus on language and, specifically, words, introduced me to a level of granular analysis I had never before thought to pursue. His infamous \"glossing\" activity indeed made me a whole lot smarter, as promised."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Could have more student participation, but professor is very knowledgeable",
    "This course was one of my favorite classes at Yale. The strengths: Professor Kastan is brilliant. My peers were brilliant. I got smarter learning how to read the poem and ask questions to professor Kastan and my peers, mostly because I was afraid they would think I was stupid and didn't want that, so I learned how to become smarter. This course is so fun, and the papers were incredible - professor Kastan's manic-glossing assignment was incredibly educational, and I loved the Canvas prompts - they really made me think, and I started looking forward to the new prompt each week.",
    "A fantastic seminar that was made particularly rich by amazing classmates. Despite not wanting to write them each week, it's actually kind of amazing to read the weekly blog posts and see what everyone else is thinking. Professor Kastan clearly loves the poemand instills this love in each of his students throughout the semester. The only downside to the class is that sometimes Professor Kastan's love for the class results in incessant rambling, or the professor spending the whole class answering his own questions.",
    "You will be able to contribute as much as you are confident to! Hes a talker and the seminar can be a lecture if no one interrupts him but I believe he is particularly wishing for students to do so. This class is one of the most wonderful academic experiences you can have at Yale. The assignment schedule was flexible and prioritised student interest and engagement first.",
    "The strengths are many. Very manageable workload. Very high quality and wide ranging class discussions. Creative assignments. Excellent opportunity for weekly writing (via reading responses). My only suggestion might be a little more guidelines on the assignments--simply for those who may need more structure. Overally, this course is excellent. 10\/10.",
    "Kastan is a tad crazy, but brilliant. The reading pace is very manageable and well structured",
    "Strengths: quality of discussion, practice writing about PL, both in weekly reading responses and larger assignments. Improvements: Could be nice to have more discussions centered on student input!",
    "By far the most obvious strength of the class is Kastan, as no one knows this poem better than he does. He is quirky and silly and very, intimidatingly smart and quippy in class, recalling line numbers and full quotes left and right, such that the seminar can often move quite quickly. Kastan cares about his students deeply and did not shy away from admitting he learned something from us. He is a literary scholar if you have ever known one, and it will be your great honor to take this course with him. He loves the poem, makes you love it and him, too, and perfectly walks the balance of light heartedness and serious intellect. The weakness of the course is the long, once-a-week meeting that is nearly entirely filled with Kastan lecturing. His lectures are wildly engaging and thorough, but there is little chance to speak up, as a student, and there is very rarely a class discussion similar to what you might be expecting.",
    "This is an excellent course. The reading is focussed and discussions provided rich new insights. Professor Kastan has been teaching Paradise Lost for a long time, and knows what he's doing. I have very little by way of criticism. The weekly posts were an excellent way to keep up with the material and the shorter and longer essay assignments were well designed to facilitate learning.\r\n\r\nThe course really picked up towards the end. Conversations became increasingly free-flowing and Professor Kastan asked increasingly challenging questions of other students. I wished that the course had opened in September with this level of engagement during weekly seminars. For the first few class meetings, Professor Kastan dominated discussion and class often felt like a long lecture. This isn't necessarily a weakness, as Professor Kastan always provided meaningful readings of the text. I do wish, though, that he had handed the reigns over to the students slightly earlier in the semester. Once he allowed for a slightly more open format of discussion, the class picked up. \r\n\r\nI had an excellent experience in this course and enjoyed the opportunity to dive so deeply into a singular author and a singular text with a singularly talented professor."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you LOVE Paradise Lost",
    "Take this class if you're familiar with Paradise Lost and it will be a complete breeze. Cannot believe this was a senior seminar!",
    "This class is great -- but be aware that Professor Kastan will talk for ~75% of the time. He has very insightful things to say, and he is very entertaining, but just prepare for that. Also, make sure you like Paradise Lost before you take the class. I love it, which made this class super enjoyable. Don't take the class if you don't like the poem. You spent a week on each book, which is a luxurious pace that will reward you with deep engagement in the poem.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Kastan is brilliant (albeit sometimes too brilliant - he gets to going on one of his verbal intellectual experiments and I think forgets, to some degree, that there are students in the classroom), and is a wonder to experience. English senior seminars are so engaging, and each person deeply cares about the content of the course. Paradise Lost is an infinitely complex poem (I don't think I'll ever stop asking questions of it). The papers are engaging and educational, and you will leave the class smarter.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course! It's a rare chance to spend an entire semester on one work and is an incredibly rewarding project. Also, Kastan is brilliant, and to be able to learn from him is excellent. Take him up on his offer to buy you a coffee\/beer. Only downside is that it often feels much more like a lecture than a seminar, but if you're into that, it's an excellent lecture,",
    "100%. If youre an English major and old white men bore you, let Kastan be the best class you can take about the text of a dead white man.",
    "Yes. This is a phenomenal course. One of the very best at teaching close reading, and an excellent opportunity to deepen understanding of one of the very best and most difficult works of English literature. If you like Milton, definitely take this course. If you don't like Milton, maybe you will like him more after taking this course.",
    "Take classes with Kastan, period",
    "Absolutely! If you are aware that this course is all on Paradise Lost--and it is; this is the name--you will love it. Be prepared to do extensive close reading.",
    "If you really are committed to reading and living in this book, take the course. You'll have a spot if you want it most likely, but the class is only taught every 3 years so this will probably be your only chance. All you do is read one long poem, which sounds glamorous for its low work load but, unsurprisingly, is not such little work after all. The poem is hard, no matter how many times you have read it or how well you read. You won't know what it means sometimes and you will have to try again.",
    "Yes -- I would highly recommend this course to another student. Don't pass up the opportunity to study Paradise Lost with Professor Kastan. The experience of reading a single text closely is a worthwhile pursuit in college and one I hadn't had the opportunity to experience in any other course. You'll have a lot of fun and learn a lot! Milton makes you smart. Kastan makes you smart."
