It is hard speaking spanish when you think you are not good at it but being in SPAN 120 where everyone is building friendships based on the language Spanish is really an amazing experience and helped me with key skills such as vocabulary, pronunciation, and proper pronouns.",

In comparison to SPAN 110, this class places a larger emphasis on culture and cultural connections, which I enjoyed because it allows us to connect what we were learning about in terms of vocabulary to concepts in the real-world.",

                "I think the amount of tedious work can be reduced. It felt like it didn't contribute to my learning. We also did not cover grammar concepts enough in class.\r\nI liked the tests formats and supersite.",
                "A couple of strengths were speaking with correct pronunciation and learning how to correctly match gender and number in vocab words and sentences. A weakness that I have that could be improved through more practice in actual spanish speaking is correctly using the correct conjugation of words n sentences.",
                "Expanding available times beyond just the morning.",
                "The repetition of grammar concepts was very helpful in my understanding of them. More writing opportunities would help because using the past and future tenses can be avoided in class so they don't get practiced as much. Perhaps some assignments could be substituted for weekly discussion posts with requirements corresponding to the grammar learned that week/the week prior. For example, a discussion post about how our week went, what we are doing this weekend, or step-by-step instructions (commands) to do something would be beneficial. More monitoring of Supersite assignments would be helpful so that professors can help point out recurring errors. OveralI think more communication with students about where they are at and perhaps optional assignments to help in areas they are struggling, possibly for additional credit, would improve the course. I also think that there should be more explicit opportunities to practice the unit vocabulary throughout the unit instead of having to study over a hundred terms before the exam.",
                "I really enjoyed the projects",
                "One strength is that we did more projects and more cultural activities in class however, one weakness is that this class is very fast paced, and sometimes we will have alot of homework and assignments at the same time.",
