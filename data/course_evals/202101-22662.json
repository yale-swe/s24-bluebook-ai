The first few weeks of thee course focused on the origins and drivers of this inequality, while the latter half addressed how modern democracies and autocracies in the region function contemporaneously. Throughout the semester, we looked at a range of analytical and empirical studies, developing a better understanding of how these tools are used in research.",

She further has first-hand experience with most of the topics we address.",
                "Strengths are definitely the material discussed and the presentation format for our seminar assessments. A small weakness I would say was the flow of the class. Sometimes I feel that we went off on tangents and this made it hard to stay engaged during the full two hours.",
                "The topics for each week, as well as the readings, were really interesting. I also appreciated the diversity in the backgrounds of students in the seminar, as we were able to take either our personal experiences or insight from other classes to contribute to seminar conversations. Prof. De La O did a great job of facilitating conversation and posing interesting questions to the group. \r\n\r\nLearning more about the Latin American countries and their histories would have been helpful. While the task force presentations helped with this, I think having more of a preliminary understanding of the region would have led to more insightful conversations about the empirical research.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a really wonderful course!",
                "Great course with super interesting material. I think the course could have maybe had a clearer structure overall, but the readings set the tone for each class very nicely."
