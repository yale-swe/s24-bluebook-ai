            "comments": [
                "it often felt like there was too much material assigned to be discussed thoroughly in class. it's fine to get exposure to more texts than we can go through in class, but it was also stressful to be quizzed on material that was rushed through. quizzes and tests in general were quite challenging and i sometimes didn't feel that being tested helped me learn. we would sometimes have to memorize very specific vocabulary that in the future we'd just use a dictionary to figure out, so memorizing it didn't seem necessary for learning. in addition to being tested less so on such specific vocabulary, i think it would have been easier and just as helpful for learning to be tested on characters with multiple meanings via multiple choice -- for example, instead of having to write the definition, maybe the question could list the multiple definitions and ask the student to circle the right one? this would lessen stress and still make the student brush up on grammar, since picking definitions mimics your actual research process (pulling up a dictionary and deciding on the usage that makes most sense)",
                "The strengths include the variety of course texts, the number of resources provided by the instructor, and the in-class group activities. I encourage the instructor to maintain the material as is. \r\n\r\nThis course can be improved by including on section on a Buddhist text. This might be doable by limiting the Tao Qian section to one day instead of two similar to the other sections; however, it is understandable if this is not possible.",
                "Some strengths of this course include Dr. P's passion for the subject, the frequent opportunities to develop translation skills, and the self-guided nature of the final project. The one main weakness was that we often ran out of time during class periods to discuss the translations for that day, which made submitting homework assignments relatively uncertain. A solution might be to begin class with the translations, then discuss the background and/or context for the remainder of class, so the focus can be on the texts themselves.",
                "Strengths: Good variety and assortment of texts, interesting material across various weeks, variety of literary and rhetorical techniques introduced, good introduction to secondary material and dictionaries \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More material assigned than could be covered during class time, too many quizzes, too much weightage in quizzes and midterms given to precise word definitions rather than comprehension and translations, introduction of precise linguistic and grammatical terminology might have been more helpful",
                "I wish we looked at texts together \"cold\" in class more often to help us develop sensitivities for reading without punctuation. I enjoyed the homework and quizzes each week.",
                "The huge amount of translation exercises definitely helped me get to know the old language and texts. The fact that we needed to translate everything word-by-world sharpened my understanding of the fundamental grammar concepts. The cohort of the class is self-selective, but because I'm interested in East Asian literature, I found the people in the class extremely interesting and rewarding to talk to. I expected a little more literary analysis to the texts, but given that this is a L5 not a HU class I also don't have much to complain. Dr. P is incredibly caring and encourages us to bring in our different academic backgrounds, skillsets, and interests into the class. The weekly quizzes are a little overwhelming, but they don't account for too big a portion of the final grade.",
                "Very well organized; students are highly engaged and are able to choose their own topic of interest for final project",
                "The strength of this course is that the readings that are chosen are good foundational pieces of literature with a decent breadth of content. Also, in class discussion opened the floor to all students to say how they interpreted or understood a certain passage, and it felt very collaborative overall. There are also many weaknesses, however, such as for one the sense of disorganization. It feels as if the course is being tossed together last second as we progressed through the semester, and while its nice to have so many varying texts, the array of PDFs and textbooks that we cycled around was disorienting at times. Also, the instructor is very narrow-minded in interpreting some passages of the text. Even when students would give sensible interpretations of the text based in some logical and rational understanding of the language, they would often get shot down. Furthermore, Professor Lin constantly referenced commentaries which we were never shown, and they were very mystified. On the topic of commentaries, we were also never shown any methods to finding commentaries on literature, yet we were expected to easily be able to find good annotated commentaries for our final projects at the end of the semester. Finally, the grading is not transparent at all, and you will be left wondering what on earth you will possibly get at the end of the semester for your final grade."

                "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in expanding their understanding of Chinese literature from beyond the modern style. That said, the class is conducted in English, so someone looking to improve their practical language skills should find a different course.",
                "Depends on their precise aims and needs  course straddles classical Chinese skills both for research and for reading, yet leans toward the former. Workload was much heavier than expected and was a source of perennial stress each week. Studied harder for this course's exams than other courses yet effort did not quite pay off. However, also gained confidence in reading and translating large chunks of text.",
                "If you are in a position to take this course, you know what it is about and why you should take it. As someone interested in the traditional mores of past Chinese societies and how they impact China today, this course was interesting and has helped me understand many parts of more elevated styles of Modern Chinese texts. I have learned so many underpinnings of the modern Chinese language, like why \"maodun\" means contradiction in the modern language (hint, it's a story about an all-powerful sword and an invincible shield). Definitely would recommend to a student with interest in unravelling more of Chinese society.",
                "Yes if you want to read Classical Chinese and learn some canonical texts without the pressure of exams/essays in a typical literary class. Also, if you have prior exposure to literary translation, the final translation project of this course would be perfect for you--you get to introduce a (previously untranslated) text to the English-language audience.",
                "Yes",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone unless you absolutely have to take it. It is not worth it to try and demystify exactly what the professor is looking for in a translation for the entire semester when the professor is often inconsistent or very narrow in translating."
