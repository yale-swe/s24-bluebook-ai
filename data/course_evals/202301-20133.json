            "comments": [
                "I think this class is very well paced, and I enjoyed the classes that consisted of us reviewing and discussing each other's work.\r\n\r\nThis class has too much grammar workbook exercises. I expected it to be much more akin to a writing workshop, but this just feels like a writing focused French language learning class.",
                "The strengths are primarily in the professor, who was kind, knowledgable, and engaging. She provided extensive feedback on all writing submissions and seemed to truly prioritize her students' learning. I also appreciated the inclusion of many writing styles--particularly the unit on formal letters/resumes, which I had never learned in a previous course. I do think the units on the various types of essays might be shortened or combined, as this kind of writing features heavily in other French course offerings at Yale. \r\n\r\nThe course quickly settled into a predictable rhythm, which centered around homework review (often from the textbook). Because we spent so much time going through questions one by one, I found I did not get to practice my speaking skills as often as I would have liked, even with our small class size. I would have preferred to review our homework in pairs or small groups, which would have made the process much faster. It also would have improved my relationships with my classmates.\r\n\r\nHowever, the textbook itself is another weakness of the course. This course relies far too heavily on a textbook that seems picked from a high school curriculum. While I realize it was a helpful framework--each chapter corresponded to a writing unit--many students were already very familiar with the grammatical exercises (very repetitive from FREN 150), and the vocabulary was often overly specific, as it was more related to the sample passages than writing in general. \r\n\r\nI would have preferred if this course had been structured like a more traditional writing workshop, since the highlight was getting to read and discuss my classmates' work. I think many of the students taking this course already have an adequate grasp of fundamental French writing, but hope improve their ability to \"sound French.\" I would have liked to read excerpts from notable French authors and tried to emulate their styles. I would also have liked to review multiple student pieces for each unit, both as a class and in pairs. Lastly, I would have liked to have more short writing exercises instead of textbook exercises.",
                "Strengths: The small size of the class meant that the class was highly engaging and had high levels of participation from everyone. Madame Pinzka is super kind and is so devoted to her students, offering timely edits and extra help throughout the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: Not a real weakness, but I wish there were more varied options for the final project, for students not as comfortable with creative writing. As of right now, the biggest component of this course is the final project, a creative writing assignment. For a noncreative assignment earlier in the semester, a creative alternative was offered to students who preferred doing that; however, everyone had to do the creative final project.",
                "I think the course relied too heavily upon the use of exercises done outside of class, which I found didn't help too much with improving french writing skills. I think exercises such as in-class creative writing would've been more useful."

                "I would recommend this course to someone who is fresh out of L5 French. If you have already taken a handful of L5 courses or even 200+ level French courses, I would suggest not taking this course. The daily homework in this class prevents it from being a true writing workshop. While it is still a good class, I think it will become less worth taking the better at French you become.",
                "In its current iteration, I would most recommend this course to students struggling with their writing or their grasp of French grammar. For those already more familiar with more academic styles, the second half is much more rewarding; I really enjoyed the opportunity to practice creative writing in French, and it was refreshing to have the easier part of the course in the second half of the semester, since many courses become more difficult at that time.",
                "Yes - this is the smallest French class I've taken at Yale and I really enjoyed the high level of engagement as a result. Madame Pinzka is wonderful, and you'll have the chance to produce some French writing you're proud of in topics that you're interested in, unlike other French classes that typically make you respond to a specific prompt.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students who would want to improve their writing competencies in French as it contains a lot of practical knowledge relating to this facet of knowledge."
