                "I learned about the development of US immigration policy over the years using various first and secondary sources. I also learned much more about the Yale archives and how to utilize Yale resources for research projects.",
                "Learning how to write for history. You will seriously learn every step of the process leading up to the final paper! From how to develop a research topic and question; find proper primary/secondary sources; how to develop your argument in response to your findings; and how to structure your essay for impact and clarity",
                "I improved my understanding of how to use secondary sources in history to help develop an original project, and how to situate their and my academic work in the context of past and later scholarship. I also learned about the tumultuous relationship between labor organizing and troubles to immigration debates and problems.",
                "I got a thorough understanding of all the major flashpoints of U.S. immigration history, across a number of difficult immigrant groups.",
                "I gained an understanding of the long history of immigration into the United States, state/federal policy responses to immigration, and the factors (nativist, economic, social) that influenced these policy developments. I also improved as a writer and a history researcher through the term paper assignment."

                "strengths: professor Shanahan is extremely knowledgable and caring and he is a great discussion facilitator and synthesizer; the course is full of well-selected readings of strong secondary scholarship; I appreciate that the course not only highlights European immigration policy but puts an equal focus on also Asian and Mexican immigration policies; the historical methodology and readings taught me how to be a better historian and writer \r\nweakness: I wish there was more focus on primary sources; we often skipped or rushed discussions on the primary source altogether",
                "This course is great at what it promises to teach. You will learn a lot about immigration policy from someone who is clearly knowledgeable. My only complaint is that the readings were sometimes dense and repetitive, and engagement was low but that could be the class time.",
                "Strengths: Interesting readings and engaging flow in class facilitated by Dr. Shanahan, especially with the time to look over your own work and that of your peers; very clear feedback from Dr. Shanahan that helps you improve throughout the course; purposeful writing assignments that help you develop historical thinking and writing skills, as well as work up towards your final paper\r\nWeaknesses: Not so much of a weaknesses so much as a recommendation but some of the readings were, at times, very academic, which is a great learning opportunity, but it would be nice to spend a bit of time maybe at the end of a discussion breaking down the reading and its main points/arguments",
                "Reading assignments were very intensive at the same time as final paper preliminary deadlines and other paper deadlines were coming up; it was very difficult to dedicate adequate amounts of work and attention to each task every week.",
                "I always enjoyed class discussions and the class provided ample amounts of student support and feedback. However, I felt some of the readings could have been cut down to have a more focused and engaged conversation.",

The course itself is well-organized to help students learn how to write a longer term-paper and to prepare for the senior thesis. If you have any interest in legal history or immigration history, take this class!!",
                "YES! The topic of U.S. immigration policy is just an important area to learn about; the course is very intellectually stimulating and challenging and therefore all the more rewarding! Since it's a history junior seminar, be prepared for a heavy reading workload and high standards of writing (but it's so worth it!)",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an in depth look at US immigration policy, especially if you are considering working in immigration. It might not be the easiest course for non-majors, but Professor Shanahan is super patient and easy to work one on one with.",
                "Yes, absolutely! You learn so much from the course readings which have been together extremely well, assignments and final research paper. Dr. Shanahan is a phenomenal professor who genuinely cares about his students. If you are at all interested in this subject area, you should definitely take this course, especially with Dr. Shanahan.",
                "I would if you want to develop your skills within the history department as a sophomore or upper level student and/or if you want to gain a very through understanding of U.S. immigration history.",
                "For anyone interested in immigration policy or history, I would recommend this class- it gave me a more holistic historical understanding of immigration as a human phenomenon and a political issue."
