    "More step by step intro to R",
    "I very much enjoyed the group project components to this course as well as the stories Professor Barbour had.",
    "This course is very low workload and the professor encourages the students to learn the material rather than stress over grades.",
    "strengths \r\n- interesting material \r\n- required to do a lot of presentations which require you to learn the material - student presentations are interesting \r\nweaknesses\r\n- sometimes hard to follow because feels like we're studying about random development projects.",
    "I really liked how we covered a wide array of topics from a variety of perspectives. In addition, I liked the incorporation of text mining into the class.",
    "The course is the most straightforward course I have ever taken at Yale. Lectures and group assignments was all there was to it, which was awesome. A weakness that I would like to point out would be the lack of a proper syllabus outlining assignments throughout the course. That's all.",
    "Strengths: High student engagement, extremely high relevance of the work (data analysis and text mining are very useful\/practical skills), enthusiastic and very approachable professor - thank you professor barbour!"
