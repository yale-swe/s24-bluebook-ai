                "I really did learn a lot about the history and science of HIV\/AIDS, much of which Is valuable and will be brought forward with me in my future studies. It was nice to be in a seminar that was an intersection between science and history because I am someone with many diverse interests, and I really loved the emphasis on the role of media because I may be interested in pursuing a career in that as well. I learned how to break down many shorter stories and narratives into larger trends and synthesize some of the significant factors in the bias and stigma associated with HIV\/AIDS.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of HIV\/AIDS, from its beginning to the present day. I also got to hear firsthand from people who are very close to it because Professor Bazell took advantage of the Zoom format and got wonderful class guests to come talk to us. I also got practice generating discussion questions after completing the readings\/videos to watch\/other assignments for class.",
                "I think this class gave me ample knowledge of the HIV crisis, and it allowed me to learn how to have effective discussions with classmates in order to converse constructively. I also came into this class not knowing how to read and evaluate medical research articles, but this class taught me how to do this effectively.",

                "Strengths: Guest speakers were GIANTS in their fields, Prof. Bazell is soooooooo amazing and he is literally an expert in HIV\/AIDs and you can tell it is something he is passionate about. His experiences truly made the class 1000000 times better. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the online formate got repetitive",
                "I liked how flexible the course was. We were able to gain a lot out of the material since our interests drove the direction of the curriculum.",
                "I think it had really strong class participation because we had to write discussion question in advance of class and ask them in class, so it was nice to hear everyones voice over zoom and absorb their thoughts and perspectives. A weakness of this class was that it was online but that wasnt really within our control. I also would have maybe provided a bit more guidance when approaching our first quizzes on their content, but overall, I dont think this class has many weaknesses.",
                "One strength of this course is that Professor Bazell is very knowledgeable, so although he leaves most of the discussion to the students he also adds very important and interesting points. I would also like to specifically compliment Professor Bazell on the fact that one of the early assignments was to read a paper on how to skim scientific articles. I never knew how before, and I probably would have gone crazy trying to read them otherwise. That was thoughtful. I would recommend definitely keeping this assignment in the future.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Bazell was extremely knowledgeable on the topic of HIV, and his connections to people directly involved in the crisis were second-to-none. I think the seminar style of this class forced students to come out of their shell and discuss\/bring forward opinions on contentious topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the weaknesses with this course came from the fact that it was a lot of self-learning and rote memorization of your lines in class. While I appreciated the development of skills relating to research, it seemed like a lot of the readings would have been better off as discussions in class instead of individual analysis. I also think the posting of topics for discussion was slightly ineffective, as we only touched upon one or two per class.",
                "I loved the guest lectures, but the assigned reading materials were largely unnecessary for the class discussions. When students were assigned large chunks of technical papers about HIV treatments, there was little incentive to actually complete that reading. Professor Bazell is very interesting and well informed, that just does not always translate to his assignments.",
                "Professor Bazell took advantage of remote learning to invite several guest speakers who took questions from us. Getting to interact with these important figures in the history of HIV\/AIDS was really rewarding. As for a weakness, there is not much science covered in this course. If you want a science heavy seminar, this is probably not for you.",
                "Homework assignments were very repetitive. However, regarding the current pandemic circumstances, online learning was conducted the best that it could have been considering that this course was a first-year seminar. I would have loved to learn a bit more about HIV\/AIDS from a scientific standpoint, however. Although we read a lot of journals and studies about the transmission of HIV\/AIDS, I feel that I did not learn as much as I could have about the functionality of the virus itself and how viruses work from a biological standpoint. This was not important in gaining an overall grasp of the societal impact that such an extensive and powerful epidemic has had on humans and is currently still having on people. We may have not had enough time to learn about the virus biologically and biochemically, and I still feel that it was more memorable and advantageous to have learned about the things that we did in the class. I absolutely loved having guests come in to the seminar and speak to us. It was engaging and fun."

The learning of the HIV\/AIDS scientific viral process was mainly through prerecorded lectures and readings, so it might be better to teach some of that content live.",
                "As far as converting a seminar to a virtual seminar, Professor Bazell did a fantastic job. The organized discussion format where groups take turns sharing works very well on zoom and is engaging without being stressful. He really made lemons out of lemonade and got us amazing class guests to ask questions to. The only suggestion I have is that I think we did not need quite as much time in zoom breakout rooms as we got (they could have been shorter).",
                "Succeeded: Hands down, the most incredible thing about this course was the fact that we were able to conference in the most amazing and interesting guests to our class. We had some of the most influential people in class come to discuss their experiences, including doctors, politicians, media people, activists, researchers, and even some deans from schools of public health. \r\n\r\nCould be improved: I think that the practice of writing down questions for class discussion was slightly ineffective, as it seemed sometimes that the course lacked direction. Additionally, I found some of the readings to be a little unnecessary to the topic at hand.",

I truly think this course was one of the best first-year seminars offered this semester, and I would highly recommend any student who is interested in both science and politics to try this course out! It was a perfect blend of the two, and I think Prof. Bazell is extremely knowledgeable, and the guests in class were amazing. Just prepare to get sub-optimal grades on quizzes (they don't really affect your overall grade though) :)",
