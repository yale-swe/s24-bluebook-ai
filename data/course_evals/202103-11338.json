I learned some of the prominent scholarship in the field of revolutionary thought (such as Arendt and Hobsbawm), as well as learning how an event such as a revolution could be analyzed using many different lenses.",
                "I learned a great deal of knowledge about major revolutions that I have never had the chance to study in depth before.",
                "I was expecting this class to be really focused on the history and development of revolutions across the world from a more chronological, event based standpoint. It ended up being much more theory heavy (which was actually much more enjoyable). Instead of picking apart the dates and events, we looked at the political, social, and economic thought/climate of the time. We worried less about what exactly led to each revolution, and focused instead on the different forms of historiography that could describe the climate at the time.",

                "This course challenged my understanding of what constitutes a revolution. I learned about revolutions across the world during this period and especially gained insight through comparing influences and factors of these different revolutions. The two papers also gave me the opportunity to practice research and writing on a topic that really interested me."

                "The readings can sometimes be boring and excessive, especially considering there is not much guidance on what specific concepts or ideas we should be focusing on within dense readings. There is not much overlap between the content of the readings and the course assignments themselves which can be both positive and negative. It means when planning and writing your papers you are not expected to pull directly from course concepts or course readings, but this can also make doing the course readings feel pointless. However, it is usually important to do the readings in order to participate in class discussions (both for your grade and because it is quite boring otherwise) since discussions generally follow readings although they can lead to more general discussions about politics, philosophy, and contemporary history.\r\n\r\nI think it could be improved by providing more direction to the readings or perhaps reducing/focusing them somewhat. Maybe even opening up class discussions to broader discussion (beyond the readings and authors themselves) might also be helpful. I enjoyed the handful of lectures that we held at beginnings of classes and I think the course could benefit from more of them.",
                "Prof. Aslanidis is a strength of this course. He makes sure to provide some background for the students (occasionally by starting each class with a Powerpoint) and made sure to give students ample time to discuss rather than just lecturing. In addition, he was very good about driving the discussion forward, asking students follow-up questions and making sure different perspectives were heard.",
                "Strength: professor Aslanidis really encourages students to share their own opinions and thoughts, and challenge eachother and him. \r\nWeakness: if you are only interested in the reading, some days you might not even talk about the reading and instead talk about a current event or thought pattern that we can observe today. I didnt think of this as a weakness necessarily, but it might bother you if you prepared to talk about the reading and then never had the chance.",
                "Weakness was other students not engaging as actively, maybe because of lack of reading",
                "Overall it was a great course. I thought the readings were interesting, well-chosen, and a do-able amount for each meeting. I liked that it wasn't overly structured and that we could lean into topics of discussion that interested us. I did however feel like the flexibility of our discussion sometimes led us away from important topics; I would have loved to talk more about the role of women in revolution."

                "Yes. Prepare for the essays. They are not difficult to write even though there is not a specific prompt considering the broad scope of topics we discuss throughout the course which you can choose from. Try to do the readings (at least one) and remember to always be thinking about how those week's readings/historical event relate to the main course-guiding reading.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they have an interest in intellectual history. I took this course expecting it to be a little more concrete in its analysis of events, etc. However, it was much more about the role of ideas and how historians have undermined popular historical narratives. Overall a very enjoyable course.",
