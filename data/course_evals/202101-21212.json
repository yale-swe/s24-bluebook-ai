                "Strengths: Prof. Deli is fantastic! If you can, take her section! Classes are so engaging and you will learn so much during each class. The readings, while they can be somewhat laborious, are generally helpful in understanding what good writing is. The essay prompts are fun, and they all build upon each other. Workshop can seem stressful, but it's incredibly helpful when writing your final draft. The feedback you receive on each draft from Prof. Deli is detailed and helpful. She is willing to work with you to make your essays the best they can be. The pacing isn't terrible either. As long as you don't procrastinate until the night before the due date, the essays are fun to write. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of.",

This class is a gem, and Prof. Deli is one of the best professors I've interacted with. This should definitely be on your course schedule!",

This does not mean your writing will not improve. It will. You will receive great feedback from Prof. Deli and your classmates, and you will draw inspiration from the amazing authors you read. The syllabus is great!",
                "Yes!! The class is really great, and Maggie is so kind and so energetic, and she brought lots of life, even to a zoom room. It's a challenging class because there are lots of papers with rough and final drafts and a meeting with the professor between each, but it's really worthwhile because the feedback and revision process is what really makes someone a better writer. Every ENGL 120 professor chooses different essays to read, but I really liked Maggie's selection (especially when comparing to friends in other sections) because she really tries to incorporate a lot of different topics and authors."
