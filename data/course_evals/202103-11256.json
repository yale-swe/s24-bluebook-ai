                "Weaknesses: None at all, honestly!\r\nStrengths: This class was such a relaxing way to improve my Italian language skills, and Anna was such an amazing professor to learn under. There was always such interesting discussion with interesting perspectives on each of the operas that we studied, and it was awesome to actually take a field trip to the Metropolitan Opera as well. The reading responses that were due before each class (definitely not overwhelming) were a great way to stay engaged with what was going to be discussed in class without giving too much busy work.",

                "Yes! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I was so nervous coming into class on my first day, but I quickly realized how kind and welcoming Anna was to all of her students. The material in this course was incredibly interesting, and it was a great way to both learn more about Italian culture and develop Italian language skills. It's such a low-stakes, encouraging environment to learn in, and I think that Anna played a huge part in creating such an environment. The feedback on all of our written assignments was always so detailed, and Anna made sure to spend time correcting both grammar, idiomatic phrases, and general content. If you're looking for a nice way to work up to near-fluency, this class is great!",
                "Yes, great L5",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Iacovella makes improving Italian language skills a highly engaging experience through group discussions and activities. The course also does a fantastic job of showcasing some of the best works of Italian opera and fostering an appreciation of Italian opera."
