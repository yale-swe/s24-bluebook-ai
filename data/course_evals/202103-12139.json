                "This class woke me up to several interesting philosophical questions. What is life  what is it to be alive? What is the relationship between being alive, being rational, and being moral? What kinds of things exist in the world? What is the difference between a purpose and a goal? This class was also engaged with the neo-Aristotelian tradition. Many are inclined to think that Aristotle was a wrong about a lot of things. And perhaps he was. But, if interpreted generously and refreshingly, a lot of insight can be gained from his metaphysics, particularly his concept of hylomorphism and his distinction between the potential and the actual."

                "The course was engaging and the readings were really interesting. However, we constantly were behind on the syllabus so MOST of the material that I took the class to cover was never actually covered, which is extremely bothersome.",
                "it was less student driven than it could have been to engage us. I love professor hagglund though, and learned a lot from debating him. I think he could start the discussions with students asking questions and let the questions guide class structure instead of explain the reading material first off.",
                "Amazing class.",
                "The strengths of this course are the subject matter and the manner in which it is presented! In the future, perhaps it might be nice to incorporate a bit more discussion into class periods. It was clear that there is quite a bit of material to cover, but maybe it would have been possible to set aside twenty or thirty minutes for class discussion some weeks.",
                "This clas had great lectures and great readings. It's billed as a seminar, but there was relatively little participation from the students. I don't think that is necessarily a weakness, as hearing from Hgglund is always a treat. The class was quite unstructured. Also not necessarily a weakness, as the flexibility allowed the course to flow organically. However, the downside of this was that we did not get to discuss everything we hoped to. Particularly, Heidegger, who we never read or mentioned after the first two weeks of the course. More feedback throughout the course would be helpful."

I think this class needs to be more structured for students to engage in discussion/learn much\r\nAt least we should have handouts to guide the seminar discussion.\r\nOften time the discussion went off-track or students focused on unimportant details and I feel like I didn't learn much from the discussion.\r\nAlso, initially the syllabus says we are going to do close readings of Heidegger, yet the syllabus keeps changing and we end up didn't really study Heidegger.",
                "Probably not unless the syllabus was actually followed in a way that made writing the final paper actually possible.",
                "yes! Hagglund is amazing and just very interesting as a person. Was a mind-expanding exxperience.",
                "Martin is a wonderful professor and would highly recommend taking any class he offers.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was incredibly enriching. I always looked forward to going to class.",
                "I would at least recommend a class with Hgglund, and this was a great option. The readings he assigned were some of the most interesting I've ever had for a PHIL class (most of them are not on the provided syllabus though!) This class gave me a much deeper appreciation of Aristotle his philosophy is far more interesting and insightful than I previously thought! Hgglund is also an amazing lecturer. I felt that this class achieved a rare feat for a philosophy seminar: what I learned from it was fairly applicable to my life. That is, the ethical insights it gave me, I hope, will have practical, positive benefits to my personal flourishing  what more could you ask from a class than that! For example, our discussion of the difference between ends-as-goals and ends-as-purposes was mind-opening (\"The only possible goal to life is death. Life is the actualization of a purpose,\" to paraphrase the professor). Two things to warn of: 1) this class is rather unstructured, and 2) there is only one assignment. In all though, I am extremely glad to have taken this course!",
