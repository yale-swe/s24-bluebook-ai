It's a great way to really understand math that's probably unlike anything you've been taught in other math classes in high school (or even MATH 120). Here, you don't just plug things into formulas or remember definitions. You really understand ~why~ linear algebra works. You understand the importance of what a matrix is, how it's relevant to everything from computers to acoustics to statistics, and you learn why linear algebra is an important field.

                "Strengths: Pat Devlin was an incredible professor and the ULAs were extremely helpful.  I really enjoyed how the class continued to build on itself, and I think my ability to write a proof really improved.  Weakness: The course had an extremely large learning curve at the beginning. The psets became much easier about halfway through the course when the professor realized how much time and effort people needed to spend to complete them.",
                "It very much built upon itself in a very logical manner which made the course easy to follow and logical. The PSETS at the beginning of the semester were really grueling and long but Pat recognized that and changed it and since then it has been managable.",
                "Pat, the class content, and the psets were all amazing, no weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Pat is amazing, good explanation of content, tons of office hours and support, reasonable exams and problem sets. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None other than the lack of prompt pset grading (we waited months and never got feedback on some of the psets). Sometimes I wish we covered more topics, but I could have taken 256 if that was my primary goal.",
                "Strength: Pat! Pat is one of the best professors at Yale, and he showed me that I could succeed in a subject where I previously lacked any confidence in my ability. He is passionate and accessible, and he fosters a really strong community among the students. The TAs and the other students in the class also brought so much to my enjoyment of the class. The content is also just fascinatingeveryone should take a linear algebra course at some point in their lives. Weaknesses: it would have been great to get feedback on our assignments and midterms sooner, but really, that's a tiny thing in the grand scope of how awesome the class was.",
                "I'm glad I took Pat's class. Lecture was always engaging and Pat always presented the material in fun ways. Although psets are difficult, you get more comfortable as the semester goes on. Office hours are all throughout the week, so if you ever need help or just want to meet more people doing math, you always got options",
                "This course was extremely difficult. Once the psets were toned down a bit, the course became much more bearable, but before that happened, I was struggling every week trying to understand and do the psets.",
                "Pat is cool. He posted all his notes and recorded lectures. His explanations are easy to understand and he's a really funny and understanding teacher. He truly cares about teaching and wants you to learn instead of worrying about your grades. Take Pat's classes.",
                "Man, only good things can be said about Pat. The course is structured in such a nice way despite the fact that it's the first year that it's offered (instead of 230/231). Every pset builds on lecture material, and Pat actually cares about engaging the students well and make sure everyone gets the help they need. Exam material is also extremely fair. I am an econ major who was not too into math before but I can say that because of this class I have enjoyed math so much more than I thought that I would a couple months ago. It's a shame that he's leaving so next year's experience will likely be pretty different, but a few lessons remain - never doubt your math ability, don't be afraid of linear algebra, and shop this class no matter what year you are! You'd be surprised how much you will learn.",
                "Pat is a great professor and the main strength of the class",
                "Class was relatively engaging. Lectures taught content and proofs in a useful way, and office hours were very very helpful for collaboration and dealing with problems. Pat was also always open to questions. I did feel, however, that the psets got easier and at times either did not connect to what we were doing in class, were way too unapproachable, or did not serve to force me to wrestle with the content enough to really understand the material. I think this is the problem with math psets, but it was a challenge to get a pset that really felt like it was the write amount of work while still helping me wrestle with the material and really understand it. However, exams felt like they were a fair assessment of my understanding.",
                "Pat is a gem of Yale, and he makes a big effort to include all of his students. I thought the lectures were fantastic, and so were the problem sets and exams. Pat is a very entertaining lecturer, and I thought that class was always really fun. \r\n\r\nI personally did not find the workshops very useful: in many cases, it felt like we were just doing problems together, which felt like something better suited for class.",
                "The lecture recordings were very high quality and the ULAs were extremely helpful. The class fostered a collaborative environment and the proofs were challenging but very doable. The beginning of the class was essentially the same as the beginning of MATH 230, which is to say that the psets and content taught were exactly the same. This resulted in some people getting discouraged, but Pat was very receptive to the students and lightened the difficulty later on in the course.",
                "The support in this class was amazing. Even at the beginning of the year when I had many moments of frustration and thought about dropping the class, office hours, the ULAs, and Pat were all so supportive and helpful that it was one of the most rewarding courses in my academic career! A potential place for improvement would be quicker feedback (but I also know why it took so long for psets and do not blame Pat or see it as a huge detriment to the course).",
                "strengths- psets helped you learn the material plus new material too, the professor and TAs were all rooting for you and wanted to help you learn\r\nweaknesses- lecture notes posted, so very low motivation to attend class",
                "Pros: Pat is perhaps one of, if not, the best professors I've had during my entire 4 years at Yale. He is an asset to the math department, to the college, and the university. Pat brings a love for math to the classroom, and he teaches students that anyone is capable of doing math, if they try hard enough and put in the hours. I thought about giving up math because I felt like it wasn't the place for me. That wasn't the case with this class. Pat deserves some of the highest accolades from the math departments, and I hope the math department (and university broadly) recognizes just how important he is to the lives of students. \r\nCons: honestly, not much",
                "I really appreciated the focus on proofs, I felt like I learned a lot and it was very helpful. The putnam-style problems on the homework were also quite fun. I appreciated the way there was a lot of support around doing the homework problems, it made the problem sets feel a lot less intimidating. I often ended up treating the theorems we proved in class as tools to do the problem sets instead of things I was supposed to learn for their own sake, I'm not sure if this is good or bad, but if the goal was for me to have a good recall of all of the theorems, I'm not sure I have that. Perhaps non-proof-based small in class quizzes could help with that if specifically learning all the theorems and definitions is something you want.",
                "Strengths: provided a good introduction to a lot of linear algebra concepts and did a good job at reinforcing knowledge throughout the course. The course had a lot of great support systems in place, mainly office hours and strongly encouraging collaboration. Weaknesses: we received little feedback about our proofs, making it extremely difficult to improve your proof-writing. Our psets were often long and difficult, and we did not receive feedback on most of them until the end of the course and we did not receive an answer key/any knowledge about a correct way to prove the concepts on the psets, making it hard to address any fundamental problems you have with proof-writing.",
                "the exams are heinous. having students sit for five hours or until they give up is not conducive to a healthy or productive learning environment. I learned a lot but the exams were the worst. Pat did his best to get us grades in a timely manner because the graders would not, and it would've been nice to get more feedback but I don't blame him for that.",
                "More prompt hw grading would be nice but overall great course",
                "The course is very well structured and the topics in class build on each other, which makes them easier to understand. Pat takes excellent lecture notes and posts them quickly, which made it easier to review topics for tests and psets. The course also provides a strong support system, with long office hours almost every day, review problems provided, an Ed thread, and many TFs. Although the course was very challenging for me, I did feel very supported in my attempts to understand the material, both by Pat and the TFs, and by other students. \r\n\r\nOne thing that was difficult for me about this course was that the psets felt very intimidating and were quite long. Of course, there is a pro to this in that it was extremely satisfying to finish a pset, but I needed to spend quite a while in office hours each week to successfully complete them. While the psets were an excellent opportunity to build off of concepts in class in a challenging way, and I learned a lot from them, it may have been better if there were one or two fewer problems on each one.",
                "Pat was an amazing teacher and provided so many resources for us. Office hours were so incredibly helpful and it was great that all the psets were collaborative so that we all worked together instead of it being a competitive environment.",
                "Strength: you are really forced to learn how to write a good proof. You really learn how to think about math in a whole different way. \r\nWeakness: class moves super quickly and often hard to follow during class, a lot of concepts are just taught through the p-sets which was really tough. Psets are graded very slowly.",
                "it was well taught, but i wish there was a textbook to follow along in",
                "The PSETS the first couple of weeks are really rough, but the amount of learning that happens outside the class is amazing. Pats lectures can be a little all over the place.",
                "The time commitment is insane",
                "Strengths: Excellent teaching.",
                "It wasnt a very good course on learning math. It was just how to write proofs",
                "The strengths were the organization of\r\nThe material and the difficulty, which made it fun. One weakness, and Pat knows this, is the lack of feedback that comes back on problem sets.",
                "The course was taught in a very engaging manner but grading was ridiculously slow and feedback was hard to get back.",
                "The class format felt kind of bot-like. We would write down definitions and memorize them and that was the entire class. Very likely thats the only way to learn linear algebra though. Problem sets were graded months after they were due which made it impossible to incorporate feedback on proofwriting into the next pset.",
                "strengths: Pat is an exceptional communicator, very approachable educator; class was fun (both the material and the professor), and incredibly rewarding even when you didn't get the best grades\r\nweaknesses: none really. best class I've taken at yale yet",
                "This class served as a great introduction to proofs but I felt like the class is extremely fast-paced. There is no opportunity to practice repetition in class or on the psets so we often go over important concepts once very briefly and then have to implement it on the test. Some important concepts are also first introduced through the psets instead of during class.",
                "This course is well-organized and covers a wide array of concepts in a short amount of time. Lectures are clear and concise, and many examples are provided. Lecture notes are uploaded, and some full lectures are as well. Problem sets are long and challenging, but certainly serve their purpose of teaching the course material. There is an abundance of office hours, which are a great place to get help on problem sets and talk through concepts. The first 4 problem sets were the most difficult by far, but they definitely eased up after that.",
                "The course is pretty fast paced, covering a new topic each lecture; however, Patric Devlin publishes all his lecture notes and his engaging way of teaching never fails to capture your attention. Office hours (and your peers!) are a great resource for working on assignments, so I always felt I had adequate resources at disposal if I needed help.",
                "Strengths: Excellent teaching, excellent support for students, and overall amazing content from Pat and the TFs: cohesive and interesting, with a lot of learning resources.\r\nWeaknesses: There was a very wide range of people with different goals in the class, which was great for meeting people but was also likely a reason for the class's focus substantially changing as the semester went on to become less proof-based. The course began by being very intensive and promoted deep thought on (much more complex) problem sets, which was part of why I took the course. I enjoyed working slowly and going to office hours and working with others to worn out the problems; these were things I sought. This changed after P set 4 to result in problem sets/tests with results and problems that were, while certainly interesting and showing interesting patterns and ideas, were relatively more tedious and less proof-heavy. I think this appealed to many students, but for me, it took away a large part of the main reason I took the course as opposed to just taking an online linear algebra course: the deep thinking, satisfaction, and collaboration that the right number of sufficiently tough proofs will provide.",
                "This course was a very conceptual look at linear algebra which gave a great overview of the theories and facts involved in the actual arithmetic. The problem sets for this class were very heavy to start but got much more manageable through the semester."

                "Yes, yes, yes! I would recommend a class with Pat, especially on linear algebra, to every Yale student. I'm a history major, and I took the course because I thought math was fun but had no idea if I could actually succeed in the class. It ended up being one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale, and I have a whole new way of approaching the world and organizing my thoughts. Of course, if it's a prerequisite for your major or you're someone who lives in STEM world, take the class. But even if you're a humanities kid looking for a chance to learn challenging but really math, I can't recommend it highly enough. To be clear, it's a very serious math course, but if you're ready for the challenge, go for it!",
                "Yes! I didn't have the strongest math background coming into the class, and despite struggling half the time and wondering what's going on, I can confidently say I'm much more comfortable now with my critical thinking abilities than before. Even if you don't think you like math, I'd personally take the class again just to get to know Pat (he's pretty cool).",
                "This is a really good course, though it is really difficult. You learn a bunch of linear algebra stuffs and is quite fun once you are done struggling.",
                "Yes. Take any classes that Pat taught, and also, proofs are really interesting.",
                "Absolutely. Man, only good things can be said about Pat. The course is structured in such a nice way despite the fact that it's the first year that it's offered (instead of 230/231). Every pset builds on lecture material, and Pat actually cares about engaging the students well and make sure everyone gets the help they need. Exam material is also extremely fair. I am an econ major who was not too into math before but I can say that because of this class I have enjoyed math so much more than I thought that I would a couple months ago. It's a shame that he's leaving so next year's experience will likely be pretty different, but a few lessons remain - never doubt your math ability, don't be afraid of linear algebra, and shop this class no matter what year you are! You'd be surprised how much you will learn.",
                "Yes definitely if Pat is teaching it. I learned so much from this class",
                "If you are curious about higher level maths and proofs, I would definitely take this. I was considering CS+Math and used this course to decide how much I liked math and to really get a feel for how to do higher level classes (I had taken 120 and this was very different). While I do not think I will do math+cs anymore, the class was still incredibly valuable for both teaching linear algebra, a essential skill, but also getting me aquatinted with math in a very approachable way",
                "If you want to learn linear algebra, and really understand how it works, take this course. If you want to learn how to write good proofs, take this course. \r\n\r\nIf you just want to know how to compute things using linear algebra, and don't care about how it works, don't take this class, just use a computer.\r\n\r\nI spent 87 hours on this course throughout the semester. This was on the high end for me, but not especially so. Breakdown:\r\n44 hours on psets (~5 hours/pset)\r\n35 hours in class\r\n6 hours studying for exams\r\n1 hour on random misc things (workshops, surveys, etc.)",
                "Yes! If they would like to learn linear algebra, this is a very good class to gain a conceptual understanding. It did however, feel like we only brushed the surface of the subject with what we covered in class. But overall, I had fun in this course!",
                "Yes! I think this class goes beyond simply teaching linear algebra and really strengthens logic based problem solving, which can be applied to any career! Moreover, Pat is simply fantastic and made the support system for the class phenomenal, so it is a great place to explore higher level mathematics.",
                "Yes.  The content is fairly interesting, I enjoyed the work (writing proofs), the teaching was good, and there was a lot of support out of class.  Some of the later problem sets had more computation-heavy questions which I didn't enjoy, but that's my only real complaint.  Take this class if you want to find out whether you like writing proofs and want to take more pure math classes.",
                "yes, it will tell you whether you like proof based math classes or not; also linear algebra as a subject is very cool and interesting",
                "If it's taught by Pat Devlin, absolutely. I don't think there's anyone that's better at teaching this than Pat. Yulan, Max, and Matt are also great ULAs, so go to them for advice and help with the problem sets.\r\nIf you're deciding between MATH 222 and 225, I've tried both (I audited 222 for a little bit). If Pat is teaching it, take 225 with Pat, even if you can fulfill your requirement with 222. This class was taught better, is structured better, and you meet a lot of cool people who become your friends! Plus, you learn how to write proofs. When I was  in other applied math classes, I feel like sometimes I feel like tearing my hair out because I just don't know how to get the formula to work (or the calculations don't add up). That's not this class. Here, the problem sets are like solving puzzles. You have all the puzzle pieces in front of you, and you just have to piece them together, and you know when you arrive at the answer. It's extremely satisfying, and I'm saying this as a non-STEM non-MATH major! Anyways, it's a lot of work, and you spend a lot of time on problem sets, but you feel like you're just doing puzzles. It's not aggravating. And with Pat, it's a wonderful class. I absolutely cannot recommend this enough!!! Take this class!!! Pat is a gem. (If it's not taught by Pat, then idk...)",
                "Take this class only if you have to; I enjoyed the challenge, but a challenge it certainly was.",
                "Definitely! Proofs are great. You should want to know how to do proofs, because they are cool. This course is a great way to learn how to do proofs: they do not seem scary like they do when they are only used to prove super important theorems in non-proof-based courses or pedantic like they sometimes seem in HS geometry courses. Also, linear algebra is cool, and proofs are a great way to learn it.",
                "Yes, this course is amazing, and it will make you feel amazing.",
                "I would only recommend this course if it is required. While the concepts are interesting and writing proofs can be extremely rewarding, it is a very time-consuming and challenging class.",
                "Yes if they like spending a lot of time on the psets. Some of them were so lengthy and if you didn't have time to go to office hours at least twice weekly, you were doomed.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in linear algebra and mathematical proofs. While the class was extremely challenging for me, it was very rewarding and I learned a lot from Pat.",
                "Take this course! it was so amazing and i learned so much. it was a great intro course for math at yale and really eased you into it even if it was difficult at times.",
                "Yes! Pat is an awesome teacher, and unpacking proofs is fun and new",
                "yes, if they are interested in proof techniques along with learning the basics of linear algebra",
                "Yes! Take it to learn proofs! Youre grade will be fine!",
                "I would not. I came into this class loving math and wanting to be a math major and I am leaving the class feeling bad at math",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in math because it is taught very well and the material is interesting.",
                "No. You dont learn much math - and proofs are only helpful for a select few people",
                "I would! Even if you're not a math major, this course is a good, concrete way of being exposed to some pure math topics which may not have previously come up. It's definitely a good way to be introduced to the major, too, and the course structure is built around supporting student learning.",
                "Yes, I think this opens your mind to think about math in much different ways than you would have before taking this course.",
                "Yes, but Pat is no longer teaching it so keep that in mind.",
                "Only if you enjoy math, and are okay with not getting perfect grades",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who are seeking an introduction to proofs and want to explore linear algebra in that way. But I also think that this linear algebra course is different from other linear algebra courses in that it isn't very heavy on calculations but instead on definitions and being able to prove those.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you have the time to dedicate to the course. If you are able to work through problem sets and put in hours trying to understand the material, then the course is rewarding. If you are not able to devote 7-10 hours per week for psets, then it is easy to fall behind in this course and not get much out of it.",
                "Yes, I would put this course up with multivariable calculus as the two courses that form a pillar to a strong mathematical education. Very applicable in the real world.",
                "Highly recommend; the teaching quality and content were amazing and Pat is absolutely wonderful.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to get into proofs as it is a great reintroduction from geometry proofs. This course is also very rewarding to anyone who enjoys math in general."
