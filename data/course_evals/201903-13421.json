   "comments": [
    "The class was fundamentally about improving my writing skills and I think it did an excellent job of doing that. I picked a topic I was interested in and as a result, was really happy with what I learned with respect to the content of the course. The readings were engaging and the class discussions were exciting.",
    "I was able to formulate my essays in a much more concise way and was able to think more critically about each specific word I choose to include in my essay. I also learned a lot about the topic at hand regarding the social construct of race and all the different ways things like education, laws, and much more interact with race.",
    "I learned how to better structure my papers, and how to use reasoning and evidence more effectively to create persuasive papers. I also learned how to be a more effective researcher and a more analytical reader.",
    "I really learned how to better bring together evidence and reasoning. I have grown so much as a writer while taking this class.",
    "How to write effectively, clearly, and concisely. How to form an argument with a clear claim, and how to use evidence and reasoning to strengthen my paper overall. Also how race plays a role in America and what institutions have been formed and established that keep the white imaginary over everyone else.",
    "I learned so much from this class. I came in already feeling like a relatively strong writer, and because of that, I did not expect to gain much from the course. But I learned so many valuable writing skills' nd developed so much as a thinker and class-contributes. I think everyone can gain something from this class.",
    "I learned how to be more clear in my writing. I also learned how to use evidence and reasoning in a manner that not only explains what the author I am quoting is saying, but why is there quote relevant to my argument. I learned a lot about essay structure and how to analyze texts conceptually.",
    "I learned how to examine long texts from the perspective of a writer and a reader.",
    "I learned a lot about reflecting on ways racism pervades through our society, in ways I previously didn't even realize or acknowledge. I learned a lot of skills in terms of research and writing essays -- the research skills in particular will be very helpful in the future. Additionally, I also learned a lot about my personal style of writing and what works for me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: diversity of articles and literature we read, frequency of writing and the amount of teacher response, frequency of feedback from peers, quality of class discussions and the topics we focused on\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many - at times I felt overwhelmed by the workload and the amount of drafts we were going through but ultimately I know it improved my final product and my writing overall",
    "The strengths were the Professor's willing to go the extra mile to help students in their writings and making sure that everyone understands where they can approve on. Also, the class discussions were very engaging and helpful for understanding the content. The readings felt very relevant especially in the beginning when our essay had something to do with the readings and the information was also new, but as we moved a long the course, the readings were still relevant, but didn't feel as relevant in comparison to earlier readings as it didn't directly relate to the topics we were discussing in our essay and seemed sometimes too similar to other readings we had done in the past.",
    "I think the main strength of this class is that you get to \"practice\" writing different types of college papers and get high-quality feedback on all of them, so you feel more prepared for other writing-intensive classes later in college. I do think the timeline for the papers was strange. The research paper both took up a lot of our time in the semester and seemed rushed.  Paper 4 seemed rushed as well, because it was assigned right after the research paper near the end of the semester.",
    "The final paper at the end is very rushed, and we all felt that there was no time to write it to the best of our ability. This is not a reflection of Professor Rubinstein, who was great, but rather a course weakness. We spent a lot of time at the beginning of the year writing a short essay and I think time could be cut out there to make room for the final paper.",
    "Strengths are that you get to choose a seminar topic that interests you, which means that you'll likely find the readings and discussions very engaging. Another strength is that the class is small, which means lots of one-one one feedback and instruction. I also got very close to everyone in my class, which is something I know people in many 114 classes experience. The only downside is that it is a lot of work, much more than I expected for an intro writing course.",
    "I appreciate how there was class time to receive feedback from other students. I also like how there are several drafts\/seedlings due before our final papers are due.",
    "I think the strengths were the subject material and syllabi. The content was incredibly interesting and I really enjoyed the group discussions as well. \r\n\r\nI think occasionally the grading felt too rigid -- I didn't feel as if there was enough room creative endeavors. I'm also not sure how this can be improved but there were often a lot of technical difficulties with canvas that were difficult to get through, and often assignments were buried in a lot of canvas notifications that were hard to find. I also think having due dates on the canvas posts would be helpful rather than having to scroll through all of them by title (b\/c if you put in the due date then they sort it based on due date)."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. For any student interested in race, this class is excellent to gain a deeper understanding of race in America. It also does a phenomenal job honing and improving your writing skills. Be prepared to work hard but know that the result will be the improvement of your writing.",
    "Yes, it is a great class to better your writing skills along with learning a lot about the topic of race and how it affects different aspects of people's lives. It does require work as you have to do the readings in order to properly engage in class and you have to write a lot, but its well worth it.",
    "Yes, I would! It was an excellent introduction to college writing and a great way to explore new topics. I really enjoyed all of the helpful feedback and I feel prepared to take on paper in other college classes.",
    "YES! Especially if you are interested in learning about the construct of race in literature",
    "Yes! If you want to know about race and racism, and also how to write like a college student, this is the class for you. I loved the final project at the end where the entire class brought in Catina Bacote, a New Haven author, to speak about how she writes and the issues of race she has faced personally in her life.",
    "I would absolutely recommend. I think everyone walks away as an improved writer and thinker, as the course requires critical thinking and reflection. I also think it's a good \"fun\" class, since you get to pick a topic that interests you.",
    "I would recommend because you are guaranteed to become a better writer (and reader) in one way or another.",
    "I think yes if they are deciding to be a non-english major and are interested in race."
