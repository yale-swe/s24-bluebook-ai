                "I was exposed to a number of theoretical texts ranging from Marx's theories of commodification and responses, to aesthetics, semiotics, iconicity and other",
                "Learned how to read dense theory and apply it to the present. Answered the questions: What is an icon? What makes an object iconic? How is iconicity weaponized? How is it impacted by race\/class\/gender?",
                "As someone inexperienced with sociology, the course went really in depth into the focus of the course without being impenetrable to a non-sociology major.",
                "Theories about how objects have on meaning, how companies use icons in marketing, how these theories apply to the real world, etc. It's a very cool course that changes the way you think about ads and material culture and I'm glad I took it.",
                "The first half of this course is mostly theory about materialism, drawing from philosophy, sociology, and anthropology. The second half of the course mainly draws from pop psychology business books and some critical sources about race and gender. There was little student engagement during class: Professor Alexander has a habit of lecturing during the entire seminar. If there were insights to be developed, they had to be developed on your own time."

                "Strengths - great intro course!! Really enjoyed the final project and the chance to read a wide survey of sociological texts. Prof Alexander is a leader in his field, so wonderful opportunity to learn from someone making strides in the field. Weaknesses - Prof Alexander won't learn your name, and the class feels a bit cold because no now has been introduced to each other.",
                "Strengths: very interesting, Professor Alexander is a giant in the field \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: material is a bit dense and hard to parse through",
                "Strengths  the reading list\r\nWeaknesses  the class is touted as a \"discussion-based seminar\" when it is mainly a lecture with the occasional call-and-response",
                "Strengths: readings were so interesting, syllabus was broad and expansive, we really engaged in discussions about iconicity in beauty\/race\/class in ways Id never thought about\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the theory on iconicity felt really dense and I wish we really took time to unpack it in class to a basic level for people unfamiliar with some of the authors; wish there was more media usage considering that its a class about culture (couldve watched ads\/brought in iconic objects to discuss)",
                "STRENGTHS: course content, Professor has a sense of humor and definitely knows what he's doing (like seriously he has his own Wikipedia page, he knows his stuff), fair grading \/\/ WEAKNESSES: the only one is that delivery of course content is dry. It's a once-a-week course, and the professor lectures in a monotone voice and then opens it up for some discussion (which is better, this part gets more fun\/engaging). If you can look past the dry delivery, everything else is great",
                "Professor Alexander made no effort to get to know students, telling us explicitly that he would not learn our names, despite the fact that this was a twenty person seminar. He often lectured for the entire two hours, making little effort to engage students. There were three 5 page papers due throughout the course, in addition to a five page \"research paper.\" The syllabus is poorly constructed, moving haphazardly between dense academic theory and nonsense business advice. It seems that Professor Alexander recently received feedback about being more inclusive in his courses, so readings about race and gender are tacked on at the end of the semester, with low enthusiasm.",

                "Yes!\r\nIts interesting but definitely a lot of work",
                "Yes, as an elective if they are looking to be exposed to a somewhat expansive, unconnected range of topics they might not have investigated before",
                "I would. If you are interested in materialism and what makes something iconic\/pop culture, its a super interesting class. Also really appreciated thinking critically about race and how iconicity impacts it\/who gets to be iconic. Also the freedom and flexibility for the essays really lets you explore whatever youre interested in and hearing everyones final presentations was super cool.Be prepared for some dense theory, and know that you only get out what you put in. Its easy to not do the readings or participate in discussion, and that can work if you just want to observe, but writing the papers is challenging without a solid base of knowledge",
                "Yes. The readings can seem dense at times, but you really only need to get the gist of the general idea to participate in class discussions and Prof A is very satisfied as long as you're trying. Professor doesn't take attendance (at least when I had him), so I recommend going to the first day even if you aren't registered to get a lay of the land and think about it from there",
                "I could not recommend this course less. I have never had a professor who was less engaged, particularly in a seminar. I felt that there was little point in doing the work or even coming to class.",
