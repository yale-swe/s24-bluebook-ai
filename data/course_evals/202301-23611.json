                "The course's greatest strength was its combination of a relatively narrow thematic focus with a broad methodological scope. This created the opportunity for engagement with critical problems from multiple angles. I question the chronological scope, however: while it is a notoriously impossible task to teach the 'Middle Ages,' this class's focus fell rather late by almost any reasonable standards, neglecting the whole period from late antiquity through the turn of the millennium. The single day spent on classical and Byzantine material might have offered some redress, but in fact the thematic discontinuities which that session exposed (and the rather inadequate literature selected for that session) served only to emphasize the major chronological disjuncture.\r\n\r\nDisjuncture was also a theme in the selection of topics for each session: by laying emphasis each week on medieval Europe's engagement with a different outside culture, it struck me that opportunities were missed for attempting comparison between cultures, to assess whether the othering of one group served different ends (political, religious, moral) than the othering of another. \r\n\r\nFinally, it was a great shame that we ran out of material to talk about in the final three weeks of term. Either a more rigorous plan for the semester might have been hatched and adhered to, or the chronological scope could have been preemptively broadened, so that the final meetings of the course could have been used productively."

                "This course does provide some exposure to the wide variety of current critical methodologies in the field, and for that it is valuable. Discussion around the seminar table, though, tended to place greater emphasis on that theory than on the interpretation of the evidence. Twin field trips to the Beinecke and the Met Cloisters at the end of term were highlights.",
