                "Doing an independent literature review not only taught me a lot about my thesis topic but about how I work and what I need to do to meet my self-imposed deadlines. Doing a PSYC 499 is a lesson in self-discipline. I wrote the first big draft over October Break and worked on several drafts with my advisor between then and Dec 3. I would recommend that folks do some introspection on how they work best and what support they need from their advisor before doing a PSYC 499 thesis.",
                "By conducting my own study, I gained a lot of insight into the research process, from experiment design through implementation. As I was able to integrate my real-world passions and academic interests, I feel the Independent Study was a culmination of my academic work in PSYC."

                "This course is largely what you make of it. I had a fantastic research adviser that I have been working with since my second year at Yale, so I received a lot of great guidance. I can imagine this course would not be very good if your research advisor wasn't willing to spend a significant amount of time working with you and providing feedback.",
                "This course is a great opportunity to conduct empirical research for the senior requirement rather than produce a literature review. I enjoyed how self-directed it is.",

                "It's super individual and dependent on your relationship with your advisor so it's hard to say. I think the fact that this is largely independent work is a strength and a weakness - you need to get it done on your own but you can get overwhelmed at times. Setting mini deadlines with your advisor is very helpful.",
                "I appreciated how flexible the department was in allowing me to design my senior essay project and to work with an advisor that is not formally affiliated with the undergraduate PSYC department. In the future, I would recommend that the PSYC department provide more support in helping students design projects aligned with their passions and in helping them locate advisors, so that students do not feel that completing the senior essay requirement through a seminar is the only viable option."

                "If you are interested in a topic that is not covered by a psych lab or senior seminar - do this! I wanted to be very passionate about my thesis topic and the PSYC 499 credit was the way to go for me because I had no restrictions or prompts.",
                "I am so grateful that I conducted an Independent Study for my senior thesis (rather than completing my thesis through a senior seminar, as I originally planned to). Whereas writing the essay in a seminar would have required me to adapt my paper to fit the themes of a course or interests of a professor, the Independent Study offers flexibility to design a project that resonates deeply with your own interests. If you have a project you would be passionate about, I would highly recommend pursuing the Independent Study, and not being deterred if you are a BA student. Be open to creative possibilities for your senior essay topic and advisor (including looking outside the PSYC department, if appropriate), and do not feel pressured to adapt your topic to fit those of an existing lab, advisor, or PSYC seminar."
