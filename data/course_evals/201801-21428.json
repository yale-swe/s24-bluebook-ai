    "Scandinavian Cinema is an interesting course in terms of the concepts that it covers. It certainly helps in developing the ability to critically watch films and TV shows. It struck me very much as a literature course with \"close readings\" of visual media instead of written works.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history, production, and style of scandinavian film."

   "comments": [
    "This course gains strength from its uniqueness. Analyzing films as if they were written works of literature is an interesting enterprise. There were some difficulties in regards to organization, so it requires students to proactively make sure they have the right meeting times\/locations\/assignment due dates\/etc. The course also demands a great deal of time for watching and reading the assigned materials.",
    "Strengths would be Professor Trumpeners often strikingly deep and broad knowledge of the field, with a weakness being a trend toward too many films being assigned with the result being not everyone watching the assigned material."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any students who had a very well-developed interest in Scandinavian cinema already. As someone who entered the course with an interest in culture and film history, it was sometimes difficult to follow the intense \"close reading\" analyses. It's like a literature course but with films instead of books.",
    "I would if you like movies."
