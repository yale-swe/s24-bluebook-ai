                "Strengths: excellent content and professor. Would not change anything about the content or structure of the course and Nilay is amazing. Everyone else in the class is super helpful and study groups are your friend.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures can be really hard to follow just due to speed. I love that Nilay pauses to tell stories about once a class (it makes the 75 minutes much more bearable) which gives us time to write down stuff from the board, but I often fail to copy down everything he's saying and writing at the same time. I understand that professors are often reluctant to make lecture notes available to prevent students from skipping class, but I do wish there were a few more things posted online -- like maybe some of the schemes for reactions that we went through mechanistically, so you'd still have to come to class to learn the mechanism, but if you copied down one of the reagents\/products\/conditions wrong, you could check online. Not understanding how a mechanism worked only to later realize that I just miswrote a structure because I was taking notes too fast was really hard and pretty common.",
                "The course is well-organized! Nothing to improve.",
                "Strengths: Nilay is a great lecturer, the class is well-organized, the topics are engaging and feel very relevant to research, and the workload was fair. Weaknesses: occasionally the pacing of the lectures was a bit uneven, with the start of lecture feeling manageable and then a lot of information right at the end without time to fully process it, but overall the structure and design of the class was great.",
                "Nilay gives a historical background of each reaction (the motivation behind its development, how scientists designed experiments to move forward), so it is great for developing scientific thinking skill.",
                "The classes were well organized and the psets for the most part aligned with the course material. The expectations of the course felt clear and the instructor was always available for extra help, to answer more questions, etc.",
                "This class is fantastic. Nilay is a great professor and the content is fascinating. I can't think of any weakness!",
                "The class is well-organized.",
                "The course is both comprehensive and relevant, and I feel that I have a heightened understanding of organometallic chemistry. This course builds logically on the skills learned in the prerequisite course. No major weaknesses to note.",
                "The course had great content about organometallic chemistry's applications and was taught in a logical manner. If anything, perhaps the timing of the term paper could have been changed\/improved."
