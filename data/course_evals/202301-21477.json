                "Girvin is a very cool instructor. Talking to him about quantum computing and his career at office hours was very enjoyable. \r\nGrading for this course was very strict, especially for a Yale physics course. Despite getting problems on the psets correct, they would nonetheless lose points for often trivial things. I would recommend taking off minimal points for trivial things, as most other physics courses do, and then leave comments so the students make changes. \r\nThe grading weight of this course should also be adjusted. Homework is only 15%, which is insane considering how much time it takes. The final paper was 35%, which is also insane considering most students probably did it in about 3 days (compared to weekly homeworks). \r\nThe final paper expectations also need to be adjusted. We had weekly homeworks, plus a 10 page paper, plus a final exam. If there is going to be a long final paper, there should be no homeworks for a couple weeks while we do the paper. If the homeworks need to remain weekly (they were shorter as the paper deadline came up), then the final paper should be shorter. I think the expectations for the final paper should be much different. It would be better if the paper was 4-5 pages and was meant to give a more conceptual overview of a topic. The current format of needing to do mathematical derivations was confusing as we were not sure how complicated the derivations were supposed to be. It would be much better to keep the weekly homeworks, as it would help us review the various quantum algorithms (Simon's, etc), which are very important and seemed a bit rushed toward the final exam as we never did extensive homeworks with them. With these weekly homeworks, the final paper should only be 4-5 pages. \r\nThe exam structure of choosing problems to do is nice. \r\nUsing the IBM hardware for homeworks was very cool, but we should do more demos of it in class. It was confusing to figure out how it works on our own.",
                "nice intro to quantum, not a lot of depth but also topic is very new",
                "This course was a great introduction and felt very understandable and relevant to practical applications. It also provided a good survey of several important topics in present day quantum computing research, including error correction, optimization, and quantum algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement I can think to suggest is to include an overview of the physical side of quantum computing---types of qubits, how to construct physical gate operations, how to quantify qubit noise and gate fidelity, etc.",
                "Strengths: Really cool subject material, and Professor Girvin is great! He does a fantastic job getting to the core, interesting part of whatever he's teaching instead of getting bogged down in nitpicky details, while still giving a completely rigorous lecture. His excitement for the material (which is his expertise) is infectious. He also loves talking with students at office hours, and makes good course notes. Weaknesses: none.",
                "The course was well structured.",
                "I believe the final project could have a bit more structure (perhaps showing us a past example project), or we could instead create a chapter in the qiskit textbook for example.",
                "The class was very well taught and the progression of ideas was natural and interesting. PSETs were challenging but helpful for getting practice with the concepts. The support structure for the class between Professor Girvin, the TAs, and the ULAs was absolutely fantastic. One area for improvement is a more complete set of course notes.",
                "Great notes and textbook. Concepts and psets could be confusing at times.",
                "I wish the course moved faster at times. We only got to the interesting algorithms in the last 3-4 classes. The classes also got shifted back about half a lecture, so it was a little awkward because we would begin by finishing an old derivation and then start a new derivation, and in doing so we lost a bunch of time reviewing material from the previous lectures.",
                "Strength: course notes are very detailed and organized, office hours are very helpful, professor's lecture is very clear \r\nWeakness: the time left for final project is too little",
                "Strengths: Professor Girvin is great and its a fantastic opportunity to learn from him. Problem sets are effective and not too time intensive. Office hours are helpful. Weaknesses: guidelines around final project are unclear and I think it would have been helpful to have some more clarity or structure around it. Final project grading also seemed somewhat arbitrary.",
                "Material was taught in a very accessible way. Psets were relevant and thought-provoking without being too much work.",
                "This class was relatively good, but having a final paper of 10 pages and a final exam is too much.",
                "This class had great lectures, great office hours, and great TAs. It was really easy to get more highly engaged in the material if you wanted to. Professor Girvin's office hours were always great. They were mainly aimed at discussing and whiteboarding general topics within the course, rather than simply helping with the homework. It was really great to have this time to talk about the more interesting sides of quantum computing, especially because the TAs were always there to help with the homework aspect during their own office hours. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I wish that the problem sets made up a larger portion of the final grade in the course. I spent a lot of time working on those assignments each weak, but they only accounted for a cumulative 15% of the grade. Meanwhile, each exam accounted for 25%. This is a difficult distribution for anybody that experiences test anxiety, or anybody who simply happens to have a rough day on the day of one of the exams. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I appreciated the content of the problem sets. I also really enjoyed the final essay. And the exam questions were extremely fair.",
                "Nicely taught and interesting material!",
                "The applications side of this course (uses of entanglement/algorithms) was very interesting.  The course notes were confusing at points but still helpful when doing the psets."

                "I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in quantum computing. Professor Girvin brings a sense of excitement and wonder to the course and its focal question of why quantum computing can be done and what makes it so special. I came in without much experience in physics, computer science, or math beyond the prerequisites and found the class challenging but rewarding.",

Professor Girvin does an amazing job of making the material accessible and slowly building up understanding from the ground up. Exams are open note, because the most important thing is the conceptual understanding. If you are remotely interested by what you see on the syllabus, TAKE THIS COURSE.",
                "Yes, absolutely! The material is quite interesting and the workload is on the lower side, so it works well as a 5th/6th class.",
                "Yes, definitely, if you are interested in quantum computation especially, Professor Girvin is great!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in quantum computing, and especially someone with an interest in information theory. The course was more mathematical than applied (there was not much implementation of quantum programs beyond some final project topics and we didn't go into how a quantum computer physically works, so I would keep that in mind.",
                "Definitely! A great introduction to quantum information science that is accessible to non-physics majors. Prof. Girvin does a great job explaining concepts and makes them easy to understand, while giving motivation to learn more and pointing out the unusual and intriguing features of quantum systems.",
                "Absolutely! It was a well taught class that gave a lot of new information. If you might be interested in quantum computing, definitely go for it.",
