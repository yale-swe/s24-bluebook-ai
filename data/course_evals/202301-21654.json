            "comments": [
                "Professor Abraham teaches very quickly and abstractly, and I struggled to follow the relevance or impact of any individual topic. After the course, I feel that I still do not know what 'mechatronics' or control systems are, and I definitely do not know how to design or make one. I do not even know, if I were to be a project manager or a mechanical designer, how I might design my system to account for common considerations of control systems. Spending some more time on the basics and the overview, as well as perhaps pointing to some useful textbook chapters might connect all the considerations of the course.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting subject, labs were generally fun, low workload and not difficult grade-wise. Weaknesses: I think we honestly could have learned more and had a more consistent teaching style throughout the semester. Labs were occasionally somewhat disorganized and psets weren't always connected to class material.",
                "It's an okay course, but the lectures go fast and the content is pretty nebulous. The first half is fine, where you work with datasheets and bits and memory. The lectures were a bit confusing and it was tough to decipher the professor's handwriting at times, but the labs really help reinforce the material. The second half kind of goes off the rails and throws a lot of math and control theory at you without much introduction or motivation. Though I understood the math itself to a degree, I often failed to understand how it connected to robots or controllers or control theory. Things also take forever to get graded. That being said, the labs are fine, the workload is very manageable, and the final project was actually pretty fun.",
                "STRENGTHS: I really liked the final project (trying to program a robot to move through a course as quickly as possible), and how it was somewhat open-ended and let us experiment.   \r\nWEAKNESSES: For the first two thirds of the semester, we would usually get a 5-10 minute break in the middle of class, and still end 10-15 minutes early. Labs rarely took more than half the 3-hour time slot, and we only had five short problem sets during the semester. As a result, I felt that the class could have been taught in a way that covered more material and forced us to engage more deeply with what we covered. I don't think I learned as much in this class as in the average Yale class.",
                "I liked the final project. The labs were fine. Professor Abraham was responsive to feedback. There were no ULAs or TAs, so with that in mind, Professor Abraham did a good job making time for office hours and moving deadlines around to make sure everyone got the help they needed.  I think my biggest critique is that the class always felt like we haven't quite started what we really need to know for the final project. I had a hard time connecting the dots of what we were doing to make things seem cohesive. At the end, it seemed like there were only two lectures that were really relevant for the final project.",
                "I liked Professor Abraham's lectures. However, they often used a lot of words that I didn't know (especially the lectures at the beginning of the semester). The lab instructions weren't clear, leading to frustration and having to ask a lot of questions (even though the labs were kind of fun). The homework assignments were good - not too long.",
                "This course could be improved with more feedback on work. The final project had no set way of doing it, but it seems there was one \"right\" way that was not stated as necessary to do.",
                "The professor is extremely knowledgeable, approachable, and friendly. The class is low-stress. However, the course seemed more geared towards the electrical engineering people rather than the mechanical engineering people. There were many times during the course where it appeared that most mechanical engineering people were very confused while the electrical engineering people understood purely because the mechanical engineering people did not have previous knowledge that would have been helpful for the course (while the EE people did know this)",
                "Good class",
                "Some of the lectures after the midterm quiz were very hard to follow. I really enjoyed the labs though and I feel like I learned a lot through them. All in all, I spent a lot of time in this course confused, but I did enjoy it. We didn't really get any grades back on homeworks or labs throughout the semester, and when they came back after finals they were much lower than students expected.",
                "Overall its a pretty good course. Prof Abraham is great and seems to genuinely care about his students. I think more time for the final project would be good, since it is quite a bit more difficult than the rest of the coursework, and we got less time to complete it than most of the easier labs.",
                "Strong in its hands on nature and direct applications to the real world of engineering robotics. Occasionally the professor skipped over mathematical concepts that the class did not understand, and occasionally spent too much time on math that the class did already understand.",
                "The subject matter is taught well and is overall very interesting. My only complaint is that the homeworks for the class were not well distributed, leading to one week halfway through the semester that had several homeworks and a lab due.",
                "Strengths: it provided a broad intro to control theory. Weaknesses: this course is incredibly disorganized. The only students who were able to follow along in the slightest with the lectures were students who clearly already had and understanding of control theory. Even when going into office hours and asking questions to the professor, he responded in a such a complex way, all the students left being more confused or had to stay for long periods of time trying to parse the meaning of what the answer to his question meant.",
                "Weaknesses: Course material was usually confusing and hard to understand until said information was applied in a lab 1-2 weeks after learning. No feedback was ever given on labs and homework. This class would benefit greatly from having a TA who would be available to help out with labs, have their own office hours, and who could grade assignments. \r\nStrengths: While the course material was difficult to understand at times, there were few homework assignments, and labs only every other week, which allowed for a good amount of time to go to office hours in order to better learn.",
                "Strengths: 5 minute breaks in lectures made the material a lot more manageable and gave me a chance to reset and catch up when I was struggling to keep up, problem sets were clear and applicable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Aside from the first 2-3 assignments, nothing was graded until after we submitted our final project reports so I had no idea how well I was doing on assignments, it felt difficult to get help during lab sessions because the professor was often busy helping other groups",
                "This course could be improved by connecting lectures to labs. Often, I found lectures to be confusing\/theory based and did not know how it connected to the hands-on lab that we were expected to do later in the week. Labs were interesting, but I wish we got up to designing and controlling robotic systems earlier in the course. It made it difficult to do the final project when we had just put all of the concepts and components we had learned about all together the week before.",
                "Should start working with robots sooner; first few labs involve reading LEDs with oscilloscopes, could've moved more quickly into actuators. More time on the final project and a harder course would've also been better. In the end, the fastest way to complete the obstacle course was dead-reckoning at full speed, not a particularly intelligent approach and not one of the advanced concepts we learned in the class.",
                "Strengths were very few besides that the professor clearly understands the subject well (although this does not translate into teaching it well). As for weakness, there were many. The largest problem was the professor's lack of care. It was clear he didn't have a lesson plan and would often say that he would have to \"double check\" what he was writing later (which we never heard back on). The lectures were very confusing, often taking a long time on easy fundamentals and then flying through high level concepts. The professor often ended 10 to even 20 minutes early; it got to the point where he would take 15 minute breaks in the middle of class to fill up the time and then he would still end early. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were not helpful to learning at all, they were far too short and barely relevant to what we were learning. In addition, he would ask students not to come to office hours and complain about how busy he was. He must have been very busy because he only submitted grades twice in the semester so there was absolutely no easy way to tell how well you are doing in the class. The labs were even worse, they were extremely confusing and difficult in the worst ways. The difficulty came from confusing instructions, buggy code, and lack of direction. The labs showed off how little we were learning in class and how different the things he chose to lecture were to the skills we needed in order to actually do what the class set out to teach."

                "As with all mechanical engineering courses, I would not recommend non-engineers take this class. Personally, I enjoyed it.",
                "Yes. I think for any students interested in robotics, this is a really cool class to take since you get to work with actual robots. In the end, it's likely going to mostly be students majoring in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, but I still think it would be an interesting class for other STEM majors, especially in CS.",
                "Depends on what you're looking for. If you already have some background in control theory, coding, and mechatronics, I think this would been a great class. If you're coming in with zero knowledge of mechatronics and only some coding background, you may find yourself confused pretty often. Having friends and knowing others in the course really helps.",
                "I was really looking forward to this class, and I was somewhat disappointed that we didnt cover as much material as I would have expected, and that I didnt feel that I learned it very deeply. Our classes routinely had a 5-10 minute break and ended 15 minutes early, and there were very few assignments. Even 10 weeks into the semester, it felt as if we were still waiting to really get started. That being said, I did really like the final project in the last week and a half, and I'm glad I took the course.",
                "Yes, if it's required or you're interested in the material. The workload isn't too bad. I'd recommend going to Professor Abraham's office hours to work on the pre-labs, so that the labs themselves aren't too time-consuming. The material can be overwhelming at first, if (like me) you have no background knowledge, but it gets better.",
                "Yes if you're interested in robotics, electronics or control systems",
                "I would recommend this as an EE elective",
                "Yes. Especially if you are EE",
                "Sure. I think it was a fine elective for me, I learned some things and was confused by some things. Pretty reasonable workload, but again we got no grade feedback until after finals which is really frustrating.",
                "Yeah. Its a solid course, although a bit gutty for ee majors.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in robotics or modeling physical systems, but be warned that most of the course is fairly abstract. This course is more focused on the mathematical and computer science side of controlling mechatronic systems, but I would definitely still recommend it if you are more interested in the practical side of robotics, as everything taught in this course is an important foundation for robotics.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. Most of the useful \"skills\" you take from the class are skills that the students who succeed already have and the student who don't have a stable understanding of control theory or programming will drown. This would be acceptable if it weren't an intro course that doesn't require requisite knowledge of system control. I didn't take anything away from this course, which is a sham because it has such potential to be a great and engaging course.",
                "Absolutely, if taught by professor Abraham.\r\n\r\nThis class is manegable, but intellectually challenging in a really fun way. It sits right at the junction between theoretical and applied engineering, and its really fun to see mathy topics picked apart in class make your robot drive where you want it to.\r\n\r\nAs an EE, my main complaint is that the class is a bit of an EE crash course for MechEs, when I was hoping it would be the opposite. The course spent little to no time on motors, construction of robots, force analysis, or anything like that- and instead focused on microcontroller programming, modeling, and control. The microcontroller part of the class was redundant with EENG 348 (which teaches it better and is required for ABET) and the Laplace analysis was redundant with ENAS 194, EENG 203, and EENG 310. It made what was a interesting and deep course quite easy, but I also felt like I was missing out on expanding to the MechE side of Mechatronics.",
                "This is probably a major requirement, but I would maybe recommend to those with a good coding background and who are interested in mechatronics.",
                "This course is very interesting and would be good to take if youre interested in robotics. It lays a good groundwork for future work in robotics, but just know that you will be very confused by some of the material.",
                "Great hands on engineering elective.",
                "No. The class is poorly taught and does not teach anything relevant or helpful. The professor was rude and clearly does not prioritize teaching. Your final grade will be a complete surprise at the end of the semester. The homeworks and labs are fairly easy but it just results in less learning. Nothing you learn will help you in the future."
