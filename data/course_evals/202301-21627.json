The class discussions were also interesting but could perhaps benefit from more pair discussions so that the class discussions arent as awkward",

It would be helpful if we could present a draft and get peer\/instructor feedback on those as we do on our final paper. It is difficult to understand and try to meet\/exceed the current expectations in the current format."

I think it is best to reevaluate one's values early on in life and make sure his\/her actions align well with those. I believe doing this in our college years is very beneficial as it helps us a clearer vision of the life we want to have for ourselves post-graduation, which is not a very easy\/clear vision to have."
