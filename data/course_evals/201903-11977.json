   "comments": [
    "I learned so much practical knowledge about how the world works (banks, vc firms, pe funds, taxes, jobs reports, etc.). My writing definitely improved, as well.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. We learned so much from experiences and conversations as opposed to readings or class discussions. We met once a week on Thursday afternoons and had a different guest visit our class every Thursday from 9\/19 onwards. Pretty incredible. We also made three Friday trips to NYC as a class and visited learned so much about journalism by getting out into the world, visiting major newsrooms, and speaking with those at the top of their fields. In three visits, we made it to the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Reuters, AP, Time Magazine, ProPublica, NBC News, the NYSE, and Bloomberg News, speaking with a variety of reporters, editors, and even CEOs. Through our trips and our class speakers, I learned how to ask better questions, spot a good story, consider ethical questions in journalism, and think strategically about careers in the industry.",
    "I developed my journalistic writing, interview, and charismatic skills.",
    "Not too much. The writing is pretty straightforward as reporters have to be direct and unbiased when reporting.",
    "Ive got to meet many prominent journalists from great news organizations. Ive gotten a look into the day in the life of journalists. Ive also learned how to write stories, although this was more self-taught.",
    "Not much in terms of writing skills. Mostly learned from the speakers.",
    "Journalism, finance, what reporting is",
    "I learned more about journalism in America, and how to improve my writing skills",
    "I learned essential knowledge for covering the economy and businesses, looked at specific case studies, and learned about different aspects of journalistic ethics.",
    "I learned how to analyze the news and think critically about how a journalist reports. Moreover, I learned a lot about the media industry.",
    "I learned about journalism practices and how to be a good journalist, scandals in the financial world, and how to do good reporting.",
    "I became a better writer and learned more about journalism and how journalism and the economy intersect."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "the class is very repetitive, but other than that, there are no weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Professor Herman cares so much about this class and his students; 3 incredible NYC trips; class visitors every week who are important figures in journalism\/business\/government with exciting stories to share, including Paul Steiger, Jim Chanos, Howard Dean, Joanne Lipman, and more; open-ended assignments that let you explore your own interests; light reading load. Weaknesses: No clear course progression\/structure because of all the visitors, but that was also a strength of the class.",
    "The strengths are definitely the guest speakers and the field trips that you get to go on in class. Many of the people you meet are insanely influential in their fields and it is a priviledge to get to have personal contact with them. A weakness is the slow pace of each class. Many of the things we cover are redundent or summarize what we did last class which could quite frankly be an email. I would love to allow more time for the speakers to talk about their field and experience than only 25 mins or so at the end.",
    "Strengths: the trips and guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Herman can be a difficult and rude from time to time. He also seems favor certain students over others.",
    "The strengths are that youll get to network with many prominent professionals and go to amazing field trips. The weakness of the class is that it doesnt actually focus on how to write. Besides from the first few weeks, there arent intense focus on how to write.",
    "It's like a series of TED talks about people's lives. Pretty surface level.",
    "No weaknesses. Truly a wonderful course that I was extremely lucky to get to take in my freshman year. One strength was the visits with many professional journalists throughout the year - getting to speak with them and learn from them was invaluable. Another strength was Professor Herman's dedication and experience - he is an expert in journalism, and being able to learn from him and his years of experience was incredible.",
    "Strengths: exposure to the real world\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lecture could be more engaging",
    "I got very extensive feedback that was extremely helpful!",
    "Strengths: Lots of very cool guests and field trips, including to Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, ProPublica, and the New York Times. The assignments (at least the last two, which held the most weight in terms of grades) were very open and Professor Herman was happy to let us explore things that interested us. The makeup of the class was diverse in terms of people with backgrounds in journalism versus backgrounds in econ\/business, so I think Prof. Herman struck a good balance between teaching material that would be novel to each set. Weaknesses: I didn't find the course to be particularly organized. We had a guest nearly every week (which was very cool), and I think each class session didn't focus on a particular topic for that reason.",
    "No weaknesses at all! The strengths are everything: class discussion, the trips to New York, Professor Hermans insight, the guests, etc.",
    "One of the strengths is the incredible field trips into NYC to places like NYT, Bloomberg, TIME, WSJ, etc. The guests that we had during class are also a highlight - we got to speak with incredible journalists and faces in reporting (Jim Chanos, Paul Steiger, Steve Adler). One weakness is that often it seemed the course lacked structure. The classes were solely based on the speaker we had that day, and sometimes it felt like we had the same class over and over again, just with a different guest. Also, the guidelines for the papers were pretty ambiguous and it was hard to know exactly what Prof. Herman wanted.",
    "This class was AMAZING!!! Barely any weaknesses. Professor Herman and the course itself are excellent. Easily one of the best courses I have taken at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "Yes Professor Herman was an absolute gem. Never have I had a teacher more passionate, connected and caring than him",
    "Yes! This class is so fun, and Professor Herman does a great job of fostering a sense of community within the class. The New York trips are great (both for networking purposes and also because they're paid for), and I really feel like I made some good friends in this class. Though lectures can sometimes drone on (depending on the guest), it's overall a very unique experience.",
    "Yes! Professor Herman is the most passionate, interesting, and fun professor Ive had at Yale. The class material is so interesting because its relevant to current events and life after graduation. I could not recommend a class more!",
    "100%. This is a class that allows you to benefit fully from all that Yale has to offer, from funding for field trips to helpful alumni working in journalism. The trips and class visitors make this a must-take, and Professor Herman cares so much about the course and each of its students.",
    "I would recommend this course to aspiring journalists only. If you are not, I would not recommend this course as the grading is too hard and expectations are not clear.",
    "It's a good class to Credit D and take for the trips",
    "If you are considering a profession in journalism, this class will shed a light on the profession and help to meet many people who are world leading journalists. If you are looking to improve your writing, however, this class isnt for you.",
    "It's a series of talks. The wannabe journalists get a lot out of this class, but otherwise it's just a relaxing, interesting course.",
    "Absolutely. I have recommended this course to several friends, and the ones I've told about the class didn't even need a recommendation - they were wanting to take it before I even directly recommended it to them, just because of how great it sounds!",
    "Yes if they want to do journalism.",
    "Definitely! Professor Herman is very kind, caring, and wants all his students to succeed.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this to anyone interested in either journalism or business, or just generally anyone who wants to take a fun class, meet cool people, and learn something new.",
    "Yes yes! One of the best of Yale. If you get to take it, definitely take it! Important for any consumer of the news.",
    "Yes, I would. The workload was very low, the speakers were interesting, and the field trips were so cool, we got special tours and insight into news organizations that otherwise wouldnt be possible.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course!!!! Professor Herman and the course itself are excellent. Probably the best course I have taken at Yale. Professor Herman cares so much about the course and his students. He is such to joy to learn from and have as a mentor and friendly figure at Yale. He consistently went the extra mile to make sure the class had fabulous field trips, thought out lessons, exciting assignments, interesting guest speakers, and that the class formed a community. Dinners after class strengthened the bond between the class and the class really made a positive impact on my semester and experience at Yale. The writing assignments were fun, enjoyable, and interesting and beyond the 4 papers, taking notes and class presentation, there were no other assignments\/exams which allowed the class to relatively stress-free."
