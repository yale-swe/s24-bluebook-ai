                "Strength: I did enjoy the shorter exams because it was a lot more manageable and the fact that it was open note allowed me to study to understand the content rather than for memorization. Discussion sections were super helpful for review. \r\nWeakness: I did not find pre-class questions helpful.",
                "Some strengths are the homework, which lets you retry until you figure out the solution (this was helpful in learning). One weakness about the course is that the assessments can feel very high-stakes.",
                "The course was very consistent and well-organized, in that psets were incredibly helpful and I always knew what to expect coming up in the course. Parr's lectures were interesting, and his love of chemistry is contagious, but they were hard to follow in the end. I would like to see a little more explanation of basic concepts in the lectures.",
                "Disorganized, hard to pay attention",
                "I think that it was really well taught given the quantity of the material covered. I wish that sometimes the professor would slow down during certain explanations because he would sometimes skip steps in his logic and assume that we were following. Also, I wish that the exams were graded with less emphasis on the multiple choice and/or had more questions worth less points; it felt like missing 1 or 2 multiple choice questions dramatically tanked your grade",
                "Strengths: TAs, exams more reflective of textbook/practice than in 161\r\nWeaknesses: disorganized lectures/structure of course",
                "Strengths: I really liked the inclusion of science history in the class. At first I was a bit confused and maybe dismayed that we were getting so much seemingly tangentially related background science history, which took away from time that Dr. Parr could have more thoroughly been explaining concepts,  but the stories were really interesting and memorable and help contextualize the science.\r\nanother strength was that Dr. Parr was super willing to stay after class to answer questions.\r\nAnother strength is that the exams were open-note.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: concepts were not explained very well very often in lecture, to the point where it was often frustrating to go and feel like I was understanding little or nothing of what was said. This was compounded by the fact that many of the TAs didn't know answers to my questions about the material.",
                "- The slides are not helpful at all since we do most of we did was on the document camera. This was a good incentive to come to class, but even in person, it was hard to read and follow what Dr. Parr was doing on the document camera. There were a lot of tech issues with zooming in and out and adjusting the brightness, and I wish Dr. Lant would've been watching to let Dr. Parr know. It felt really awkward as a student to raise your hand and say something to the whole class. \r\n- We often did not cover nearly all of the material that was covered in the homework. A lot of the homeworks were really a struggle after class. I attended every class and was fairly engaged, but especially for Chapter 16 and Chapter 22, we just did not cover a large amount of material. \r\n- It was very hard to extrapolate generalizations from the examples that were given. For instance, we learned about what an addition reaction was by looking at examples, but we were never told what the general definition was. This amounted to a lot of work brute forcing through the homework to get to hints and then memorizing things we never learned in class for the exams. This was not conducive to learning. I did very well on all three midterms, but I really don't think I understand what we did that deeply. I just got good at memorizing how to do the problems, since we were never really taught the fundamentals in class. \r\n- Some of the expectations of what we learned in Gen Chem I were wrong. We never really learned molecular orbital theory in any real depth and I think most everyone in the class is still confused about that. There wasn't a good opportunity to ask questions when we didn't understand things, and you never responded to queries on the anonymous feedback feature on Canvas that you told us to use.\r\n- The exam format is not a good way to test knowledge. The exams were very similar to the homework and most people were getting most problems right, but there were only ten problems on each midterm, so each question was very heavily weighted. Especially since one midterm is dropped, this is gonna totally nuke the grade distribution. The exams should've been longer and more thorough so that our grades in the class don't come down to one random multiple choice question (more than 10% of the grade on some exams). \r\n- I feel like Dr. Parr had a really hard time giving us the full information about grades and midterms. This made me (and other students) much more anxious than necessary. It would've been really helpful to just know how grades will be assigned at the end of the semester (are there defined cutoffs? will X% of students get As?). Also, information about the midterms should've been given much further in advance.",
                "a major strength was the live lecture recordings and the low-pressure psets. the psets provided a great place for trial and error which aided in learning.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Lant is just so amazing! She was my section leader and the way she teaches chemistry just makes sense. She won't be teaching here next year so finding someone to replace her will be really tough. The Achieves are infinite attempts and it doesn't take off points for missing them which took of so much pressure on the problem sets. I felt like I could make mistakes and still learn (which is how it should be). \r\n\r\nAlso, the exams are fair. So many students complained about the exams but everything on the exams we had seen before, either in lecture, on the problem sets, or in the textbook. It was so relieving to have them open note as well. It was a breath of fresh air to be tested on content that we were taught and studied. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I love Dr. Parr. I really do. But most of the time lecture felt like \"oh, look at this cool thing that is adjacently related to what we are learning\" rather than directly related to the content of the problem sets. I liked lecture, but I didn't feel like it prepared me for the problem sets. Most of the actual learning will be done on by yourself.",
                "The coursework was very interesting and Prof. Parr did a great job showing its importance. However, I felt as though I had to teach myself a lot of material from the textbook.",
                "This course could be improved by the organization of the lecture content. At times, it was hard to follow and it was hard to know what concepts were important. Sometimes, we talked about off-topics concepts. The achieve homework that was assigned did not always necessary relate to lecture content as well.",
                "The course covers a wide variety of concepts and even allows time for intro orgo. The course should incorporate an incentive structure to go to section.",
                "Professor Parr was awesome and taught the material very well. The exams and homework felt very fair and built for learning rather than weeding out. The one thing I would improve was how the last three chapters of the textbook were taught. We flew through and I don't know anyone who felt they were able to follow along with the lectures. Maybe going through them more slowly help.",
                "Honestly, I rarely used the lectures to learn the information presented in this course, and that was because I learned nothing from the lectures. I am not sure what is to be done about that, but other resources such as teachers on YouTube and the textbook really helped me understand the information presented in this course.",
                "Good class honestly. Don't really know how an intro chem class could be improved.",
                "strengths: accessible (recorded), engaging professor\r\nweaknesses: discussion sections were not engaging",
                "I think the course is outlined well, I think that lecture could be a bit more focused on what exactly students need to know and allowing the slides to reflect key points as well.",
                "Strengths: organized in terms of what chapters are covered/when they are tested, psets for each chapter were consistent \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the tests (especially the final) had questions that were different than those on the psets/were more advanced than what we had learned, the lectures were not at all engaging and often very tangential so it was difficult to determine what was necessary to know/to what level of depth",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures were great to rewatch after class. The PSETS were also very useful when studying for the midterms.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the topics taught were not the most interesting.",
                "The problem sets reinforced the material more than the lectures.",
                "Good instructor and good recording of lectures. Use of Achieve for psets is very helpful.",
                "Parr is clearly engaged with the material but he often goes on tangents in lecture and it can be hard to navigate what he is teaching sometimes. Also, his exams do not accurately test how well you know the material because they are so short and the conceptual multiple-choice questions are worth so much (12% each) that it is very difficult to score well on an exam even if you understood most of the material.",
                "Strengths: well organized material \r\nWeaknesses: its a STEM class at Yale",
                "The material was quite dense and I often found myself needing to go to the textbook to understand course content (which I didn't have to do in my prior chemistry class). I never really referenced the slides because I found them unhelpful, compared to last chemistry class where I only used the slides.",
                "Strengths: The material is really interesting. You apply a lot of what you learned in 161, which was empowering. Dr. Pare and Dr. Lant were both super helpful.\r\nWeakness: the discussion section was not helpful",
                "Strengths - the lectures were recorded, Dr. Lant was my discussion leader and she was great, the discussion worksheets were helpful, there were a lot of peer tutoring hours\r\nWeaknesses - I didn't feel that class was always super engaging, and I sometimes had to watch parts of the lectures several times to understand what was going on",
                "This class would benefit from providing greater resources for student engagement. Lecture content could be repackaged in a way that clearly imparts the key concepts and works through methods for solving problems. Office hours with senior members of this course were helpful but unfortunately had restricted availability. The availability to watch recorded lectures to review content was a significant strength of this course.",
                "Strengths: the course format was good and relatively easy to complete the work. The online tests were nice. Dr. Lant was the main strength of this course, as every interaction with her was helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures were unhelpful. I attended every single lecture but got more from 50 minutes of discussion section with Dr. Lant than from an entire week of lectures. Further more, there were absolutely no midterm or final review sessions. Which made it difficult to guess what sort of material would be covered and in what depth. When you are covering a huge amount of material very quickly, it makes studying difficult. It was easy to skate by in this course without really understanding material on a deeper level. I would also have liked harder p-sets in order to force myself to understand the content. The achieve p-sets were kind of annoying and did not help me really learn much. I learned the most from simply reading the textbook and attending discussion section.",
                "Strengths-use if the textbook\r\nWeakness-slides and lectures were not very helpful",
                "I feel like this was an intro course but geared toward those who already had some background in Chemistry. Coming from an area with not a strong academic background, I felt I was behind in this class all the time. Classmates who had taken AP chemistry or even high-level chemistry classes just knew things that I didn't, and I struggled to catch up. I would love for more resources to help students like me.",
                "Strengths include being a very organized class.",
                "Final exam was incredibly difficult and it could have been helpful to have a practice final exam/previous midterm on the last few chapters",
                "The strengths of the course are the beneficial problem sets on Achieve, the slide offerings, and the textbook that matched the course. A weakness was that the lectures were often hard to follow.",
                "Lecture just was not effective, too fast and unorganized. The class started late and ended late as well, and with my classes being far away and 15 minutes apart, I would often have to leave lecture early to be on time to my next class.",
                "the course lacked enough opportunities to raise your grades beyond the exams considering that every single pset and homeworks were all graded based on participation. i enjoyed the function of the midterms, however, as they were very helpful in organized learning and testing knowledge",
                "This course was structured in a way that often made the online platform for completing weekly problem sets (Achieve) much more helpful than going to lecture, since the exams were largely computational rather than conceptual. The lecture portion of the course can be improved by spending less time on complex examples beyond the scope of what is covered in the class, in favor of showing how to do more problems that are similar to what can be expected on exams. One aspect of the course that was very helpful is that the lectures are livestreamed and recorded online, making it easier for both the staff and students when emergencies arise.",
                "I found that this course was useful for understanding the concepts underlying the course material we were learning - the heavy focus was conceptual rather than computational. However, I felt that the structure of the midterms and finals could be better improved; one mistake in a multiple choice question could significantly affect your grade such that the grade received in the class was not indicative of actual understanding of course content.",
                "I enjoyed that the lectures were recorded!! It was helpful for studying and keeping engaged with the class. I was able to take better notes and understand the material better. I also appreciated Dr. Parrs teaching as he is thorough.",
                "The tests were not the best format. The multiple choice were often worth 12% of the entire midterm which really made them all or nothing. Not having the opportunity to show work and prove you understand the concepts makes these questions risky. Sometimes they were worded weird and I know the multiple choice brought people's scores down really fast.",
                "Strengths include the readily available resources such as the peer tutors, the office hours, etc. A weakness would be that the midterms and the final are basically the only thing that matter regarding your grade.",
                "The Achieve assignments and lectures did not go hand in hand with each other. Lectures felt aimless and it was really hard to keep up and pay attention. I felt like I had to teach everything to myself.",
                "I enjoyed the material a lot more than the prev gen chem, however, I thought the lectures itself weren't always the most helpful in understanding the concepts. It typically had more examples of what was happening but i didn't quite understand the actual chemistry behind it in the first place.",
                "The course was so frustrating. The lectures were entitled unhelpful. While they were entertaining it was like an hour of time virtually wasted because none of the material in class was used on tests or psets. All information was from the book. The tests given in this class were ridiculous. They were each only 11 questions long or so and one multiple choice would drop your grade 12%. They were online with very lackluster monitoring so most people were cheating. In the middle of my final someone started playing a YouTube video explaining a concept on the test that they were googling I mean come on.",
                "The exams were not reflective of the practice problems we did. This made it difficult to prepare for tests.",
                "I dont think lectures were extremely good. Most of the class time was spent doing examples without actually breaking down concepts and explaining the relevance to the unit. I also thought that it was hard to follow the lectures online because the main screen was not being switched between notepad and slides as often as he transitioned between the two in class. The other problem was discussion section. I stopped attending section because the worksheets were very bad. They included the answers to the questions and were mostly summary/bullet points for the actual TA.",
                "The strength of the course is that it gives you a fundamental knowledge of chemistry for years to come. The weaknesses are that at times, I feel lost in the lecture. Also, the tests could be better made so that one multiple choice does not drop such a heavy percentage of your grade. Although I feel that they are good indicators of your knowledge, this part of the test makes it feel as if the work you put in does not matter. Thus, by having more questions or more partial credit, it would allow the student to better express their knowledge on the material. Also, it allows for more leeway.",
                "Was decently fast paced. I struggled a lot at the end with so much new material immediately before the final.",
                "The achieve questions for homework were very helpful although I would have appreciated having the adaptive practice questions that we had in General Chemistry I. I feel like there weren't as many practice problems provided but then again you can always just use the textbook.",
                "Lectures were very concise and discussion section questions were a good length. More review for course material might be good.",
                "The slides were not as useful when studying. Oftentimes I found myself learning through the Achieve questions and making review sheets related to what was covered in the achieve questions because it usually had the same/similar structure to what was seen on the midterms and final. I skipped a few lectures, did the questions on my own and even then I still found success im the course which means that the lecture could be improved a bit by covering more material that is important rather than supplementary material. For example, we were never tested on resonance imaging of fission reactors yet it was still covered in lecture and that time could have been better spent on other topics (although I appreciate the real-world applications that were discussed).",
                "We spent too much time doing worked through problems in the class",
                "I like how the homework gives us infinite attempts. The homework really focuses on learning and correcting your mistakes. I also liked how lectures were recorded and how we were given the option to watch lectures remotely. The fact that the exams were open note made the class less focused on memorization. However, I disliked the weight of multiple-choice questions. Multiple-choice was almost equivalent in weight to free-response. The free-response questions allowed us to show our work and receive partial credit, while the multiple-choice did not. Therefore, missing a multiple-choice question or two can really tank your grade.",
                "The course was well taught but not enough support was offered for students who were struggling . Also there was often content on the homework that wasnt covered in lectures.",
                "As a student previously in the smaller section of General Chemistry I, the transition to the second semester was a bit tough. I definitely think there could have been more effort put into accommodating for these students as it was a bit jilting. I do appreciate the formatting of the class though, in that the lectures were recorded so students could return to listen to the lectures again and rewind when they had difficulty understanding a topic or concept.",
                "Strengths: content is taught well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: time in lecture could have been spent a little better and time spent on each chapter could have been distributed more evenly",
                "Weaknesses - we got 0 points for showing our work for a question we got wrong even if we did steps right",
                "I think this course is very well structured. I love the use of the achieve platform for homework assignments as well as the discussion sections and office hours as they helped me whenever I struggled with the course material. The only problem I had was time management during exams, especially during the final exam which I think brought my grade down.",
                "strengths: meet a lot of friendly first years\r\n\r\nweakness: material was questionably taught",
                "One strength of this course is the quantity of content provided online for students. Each lecture is recorded for students to view, and are live streamed for students to view in remote locations. There is also section to help review material and for students to ask questions to clarify their understanding of the course content.",
                "The lectures were not always as helpful because not enough overview of the material was provided before moving on to examples. I had to rely almost completely on the textbook to get me through the course. The tests generally seemed very fair.",
                "One strength of this course is that we were able to get through a lot of information in one semester. The connections to information from last semester were made very clear, which made learning the new information easier. Another strength is that Professor Parr and all of the TAs were always willing to answer questions which was very helpful in deeply understanding topics.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course is that lectures were sometimes a bit scattered and covered lots of information not in the textbook. This made knowing what we needed to learn for exams challenging, and I sometimes found myself overstudying things that were beyond the scope of the course.",
                "I thought that having the lectures recorded was really helpful especially when studying for midterms and the final. A weakness I thought was in the grading of the midterms. Having one multiple choice question be worth 6 points or 12% of the test did not make much sense to me. I would rather have more smaller multiple choice questions than that.",
                "Strengths: practice exams and homeworks helped us understand material.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe exams did not really test ones knowledge.\r\nIt was very easy to mess up even when you knew the content.",
                "The strengths were the online aspects of the class. I enjoyed how the problem sets were online so we could receive immediate feedback on our work. The course could be improved if an extra discussion section with more practice problems was offered.",
                "The professor is great and I enjoyed all of the experiments he showed us. homework, pre-class questions, and test structure was all very straightforward, but I felt like we had to teach a lot of the material to ourselves",
                "Lecture doesnt cover material on PSETs or exams.",
                "Strengths of this course are that it followed the textbook used for the course very closely so it wasnt difficult to know what material the class would be going over. Also the course has a lot of example experiments done in real time during class, which really helped to see what we learned in action. Weaknesses were that the course seemed to require a lot of self-studying and lectures were not always the best for those who hadnt learned the content before.",
                "The lectures themselves were not necessarily helpful. Dr. Parr spent most of class time doing demonstrations that were difficult to follow if we didnt have a basic understanding of concepts. The most important concepts, formulas, and definitions were often never covered in class.",
                "Work load is very manageable.",
                "Strengths - generally followed the textbook material which made it a straightforward class to study for. We were given clear expectations of what to expect on exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the pacing. The last few chapters were a bit rushed, especially for material that is a lot like learning a new language (organic chem).",
                "Strengths: The pace of the course is good and the material is really interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were not helpful at all to understand the course content.",
                "Having the lectures recorded was a very big plus/addition to the course structure. It could be improved by including more practice problems in class.",
                "The course is very well organized and explained. The teachers and TA's are always available for extra help as well. The end of the semester did feel very rushed and not explained very well. Additionally, the lectures are sometimes too broad compared to the in depth material that comes up on the tests.",
                "A strength is the amount of resources if you dont understand something. A weakness is that the lectures sometimes felt rushed and we covered material that was not as important for the psets and exams.",
                "Strengths: the professors and access to help. Weaknesses: unhelpful discussion section (only applicable to my particular section), a crazy amount of material covered very quickly.",
                "Strengths- Great TAs and exams\r\nWeaknesses- Lectures seemed off topic alot",
                "Strength: online option available for lectures, can rewatch lectures, achieve psets had no penalty for guessing which facilitated learning \r\n\r\nWeakness: in lecture can go over more concepts but still do practice problems",
                "This course was good in that everything was recorded so we could go back and watch the lectures. However, I wish example problems were done in class.",
                "The material and type of questions that would be seen on the midterms and the final exam were not clear or adequately reflected by the review material that was provided. I think most students would have benefitted from more examples and practice problems as review material.",
                "Strengths: overall good teaching\r\nweakness: exams not entirely reflective of material taught during class. few questions were very nuanced. Also, grading not the best - one multiple choice question is worth the same as an extended free response question.",
                "The lectures are not helpful at all and almost were unrelated to the exams. The lectures and notes need to be more related to the exams and more practice needs to be offered similar to exam content.",
                "Strengths: Quite laid back for a STEM course and premed requirement; tests arent too difficult especially compared to Gen Chem 1 and content on tests is rather reasonable; homeworks are basically graded on completion without penalty; Dr. Parr loves what he does; lectures are recorded\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Parrs lectures are very confusing at times; youre on your own a times learning the material; organic chemistry and transition metal complexes are quite confusing",
                "The midterms and final were incredibly fair; they stuck to the material presented in class, and we were given more than enough time to complete them. This course was never really stressful for me. I will say, though, that some of the material was presented quite quickly (especially during the units on organic chemistry and transition metals). I was fairly lost during class and had to put in a lot of effort on my own to understand the material.",
                "It is incredibly hard to learn anything from lectures--they are too fast and the difficult material is not focused in on, but skipped over. I found myself having to read the textbook to learn concepts and felt that lecture became more of a chore than a help.",
                "Better lecture formats where Parr would not go off-script with the pptx, please\r\nHelpful: Many office hours & sufficient practice problems",
                "The class was not engaging because it moved very quickly and they material was just not presented in a fun way.",
                "The experiments that were done in the lecture hall were very engaging and helpful in learning the material. However, they were also a bit distracting and seemed a bit unrelated to the content in the Achieve PSETs."

                "Yes, because having a foundation in chemistry is a really good thing to have for a lot of later things in life, including just general knowledge that's important to inform your day-to-day decisions you make about batteries, cars, clothing to buy, food to eat, etc.",
                "Yes, but only if needed to fulfill a major or pre-med requirement.",
                "No. Most people who take it have to, but if someone had a choice, I don't think the class is super useful or engaging.",
                "I would recommend this to another student considering any stem major as it is a prerequisite for many majors and is taught by a good professor.",
                "Honestly, I loved this class. Chem 2 was probably the best science class I've taken at Yale. That doesn't mean I would necessarily recommend it to another student, as if you don't naturally excel at math and science this class will be tough for you. I found it leaps and bounds easier than the first semester of chemistry, but it is still a chemistry class. I would only recommend it if the student was interested in chemistry or needed it for a pre req.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in chemistry or STEM. The material was fascinating and I really enjoyed learning it. However, it was a difficult course and required a lot of time outside of class.",

                "I would recommend this class as a basic prerequisite.",

                "Yes, I think the information presented in this course is vital in understanding many mechanisms of the world.",
                "Yes. It is likely a requirement, but Dr. Parr really does make it as enjoyable as it can be. Pretty painful overall though.",

                "Most students who take this class take it was a requirement- in all honesty, I would not recommend it otherwise. I think it can make a student who used to love STEM dislike chem/science. I say this mainly because the lectures were so hard to follow, and even though I absolutely killed myself doing practice problems, reading the textbook, attending lectures, taking notes, etc, it never showed through in my test scores which can be really disheartening.",

                "Definitely! I liked it more than 161, just because it felt like we covered a more diverse set of topics. At the same time, a lot of the work we did was integrative, so you actually were able to apply what you had learned as you progressed.",
                "Try to actually be interested in chemistry if you take this course. It's not the most engaging - like most big intro STEM courses. Lectures will go better if you read the textbook in advance, or at least make sure you fully understand the previous lecture -- otherwise it's easy to get lost. But there's plenty of support (peer tutors, TFs), so use it if you need it. Try to PSets early so you can take advantage of the support.",

                "No, not unless you need to take it. Which most people in a gen chem class need. The content was interesting when I understood it, but the overall class structure was not great. I didn't learn much. It wasn't difficult, but I ended up teaching myself most of the material which is unhelpful.",

                "No. I know its a requirement for a lot of stem majors but I genuinely had a miserable time. I put all my time into this class and did not get clear feedback on what I did wrong on the exams and lectures felt like a waste of time.",

I feel like it would be a good idea to have a supplement class on top of the lectures, as I would have benefitted from that.",

                "I would recommend but my opinion is skewed by the fact that I took AP Chem in high school. This course is basically the latter half of AP Chem with 5 additional chapters of content (gasses/colligative solutions, solids/crystal structure, nuclear chemistry, organic chemistry, and transition metal chemistry) but I overall thought this was a somewhat enjoyable class if you study the achieve questions and have a good TF (Hannah Lant was an awesome TF!!).",
                "I would recommend this course. The workload is not too bad and the exams are short and managable. They are also noncumulative for the most part.",
                "Yes, its usually a prerequisite",

                "Only if required",

                "I would not. The tests were very poorly designed and were poor indicators of how well someone understood the materials in the course. Each midterm only having 10 questions, half of which were multiple choice. The multiple choice questions were weighted equally to the free response, so if you got one of these questions wrong, you're screwed.",

                "Yes",
                "Yes. If you want to have any basis of chemistry for any life science path, this is a must. It is not easy and takes a lot of work, but it's stuff you need to know.",
                "Yes i would especially if they're pursuing something related to chem it will greatly benefit them",
                "No for fun. It's a prereq course for chem majors or pre-med students.",
                "Yes, only if its for your major but its also a chill class",
                "I would recommend this course to other students since it is a good foundational course to build more chemistry knowledge.",
                "Overall, not a bad class that was very pretty engaging even during lectures.",
                "Not entirely - take if you must, but not an engaging course.",
                "Im not sure if I would recommend this course, as for every pro theres a caveat; the workload is relatively low but the payoff is relatively little; its definitely nice class to have as a prerequisite and can be enjoyable, but I didnt love it; Dr. Parr is so nice but lectures can be confusing. However, if you love chemistry then youll probably enjoy this class.",
                "You're probably taking this course because you're pre-med or it's required for your major. That being said, I actually enjoyed gen chem. If you've taken chemistry in high school, a lot of this will probably be review. I'd recommend trying to place into a higher course if that's the casethere's so much repetition between AP chem and this course that is can feel a bit boring at times.",
                "Only if you must (ie chem major or premed)",
                "I mean if you have to take chemistry, sure its not that bad and could be interesting, but it is too hard for someone who doesnt love chemistry already."
