I really learned a lot. Professor Miller starts the class on the first day by asking us to think about how amazing it is that information from a website in the Middle East, for example, can reach our phone instantaneously. He proceeded to explain each of the necessary steps for that to happen and we covered every aspect of that process in this class. Electrical signals in your phone, antennas, waves, light in fiber optic cables under the sea, binary encoding. Every class I learned about a physics concept and then about how that concept is used in some kind of technology.",

We did: electric fields, magnetic fields, voltage, waves, antennas, binary, light, mirrors, lenses, color, displays, info, quantum, crypto. As a humanities major who also likes learning mathy concepts and technologies, this class made me knowledgeable in a lot of technologies, maybe at simple levels. But I feel like I can walk around now and do simple things in life like watch TV (dipole antennas! displays!), turn on bluetooth (waves!), look in the mirror (reflection!), look at fish in the pond (light waves! refraction!) and know generally what is going on scienfically/physics wise, and I find this feeling amazing.

                "Strengths: Everything was amazing! The material was not too complex that it was unattainable for non-physics majors, and we learned about technology which is very common in our lives. It was really cool to finally be able to have a basic understanding about their function as opposed to just considering it 'magic'. The problem sets were very reasonable and the exams, though a bit challenging, are seen within a greater context. Also, the 3d and refraction glasses we got are a lot of fun :)",
                "Perry the TA!! and the flexible TA hours were amazing. I felt genuinely supported. One thing I would say tho is that sometimes the TA's more extensive physics knowledge made it confusing for students because they learned it one way in class and then had it explained another way in office hours. Prof miller is also delightful to talk to. \r\n\r\nits evident prof miller really just wants you to love physics and learn physics. i think a few difficulties of the course...\r\n1) while his lectures might be more engaging than some other stem professors, i think compared to other lecture courses, they could still be more engaging. i am unsure how but i think pauses, vocal modification, deeper diving into particular phenomena could help? unsure just a minor point. \r\n2) since the course is intro and strays away from the really heavy math, i think it was difficult sometimes because we'd learn formulas without the deeper conceptual understanding, or we'd get the concepts without the deeper mathematical understanding. I think that then sometimes it felt like content was moving at break neck speed and i never fullly got my bearings. then when tests felt so much harder, it felt off. \r\n3) i love that miller is open to questions, but at the beginning of the class, people had some questions that were just very confusing and took us off track and was frustrating to those trying to understand the material at hand.",
                "Very well structured and taught!",
                "The course material is super interesting and Professor Miller's lecture style with demos, handouts, and various examples made the course engaging and comprehensible in every class.",
                "The class is good at being engaging via the poll everywhere format. Yet the class can be a little much with the weekly pset assignments. Maybe every other week would work.",
                "The strength of this course was Professor Miller's dedication to the success of his students. The weaknesses were the midterms which had questions that carried too many points. It would have been better if the questions were split up to include more ideas.",
                "The TAs and professor are always there to help you with the problem sets, prepare for exams, and clarify anything about the lectures.",
                "Strengths: very organized, difficulty was just right, Prof Miller is super super super clear in explaining the concepts/finding examples/and making the course engaging // Weaknesses: honestly I can't see any, I suppose a better way of knowing when office hours is (like an announcement? or some other application) would be cool, but this is not substantial at all",
                "The material was presented very well, and there were many resources available for help. I think the exams were quite difficult though.",
                "The class is incredibly interesting and presents you a lot of information about a lot of different topics. That is both its strength and its weakness. You get the opportunity to learn the basics of so many interesting concepts from an incredible professor, though sometimes this can be overwhelming, and especially for examinations it is a lot of content to master.",
                "This was a great course. The second exam was a bit too challenging to feel productive but otherwise the polls in class and problem sets were all very helpful for learning! More zoom office hours would have been appreciated.",
                "Strengths: very good examples",
                "This course does a great job covering lots of ground in a short period of time, especially in an engaging way. The constant reminder of the importance of concepts in daily life was wonderful\r\n\r\nThe exams were very difficult; especially as a non-STEM student, it was difficult to comprehend low exam grades despite great efforts. There are lots of opportunities to regain points, however, so this evens out somewhat [i hope!].",
                "very engaging lectures. loved the poll everywhere questions for attendance. the lectures were all recorded but sometimes there were issues with the recording, or it was hard to hear",
                "This course is very strong in terms of its coherence, and it is hard to say how it might be improved. All of the concepts build on one another such that we are iteratively building a more complete conception of the physical world in every unit. My understanding of electricity, for example, is very different at the end of the course compared to the beginning. I consider this a great strength, because it is almost like we are learning the history of physics so as to help us contextualize contemporary understandings. I think we would all be lost if Professor Miller introduced wave-particle duality in the beginning of the course rather than near the end. If I were given a free hand to change any part of the content of this course, I would maybe take out the lessons on VR/AR/MR. Theyre very cool, and show very important contemporary applications of what we learned about optics and electromagnetism, but I found them to be a bit less interesting than the rest of the course. I would have loved to instead learn a bit more about thermodynamics, and I think that would make us even better prepared to talk about photovoltaics and energy issues which Professor Miller is very passionate about.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was one of the courses that I talked the most about in my free time with friends because I found the concepts and applications so arresting and interesting.",
                "Course was very well organized. Lectures were well prepared and additional notes were posted to canvas to help review the lecture material. \r\n\r\nOnly issue- I felt there was a bit of a gap in difficulty between the psets and the exams.",
                "The content is super interesting but the exams are difficult. Having the final project is nice. I think not having the exams and just doing the PSETs would alleviate some of the stress of this course but they're not too too bad.",
                "Professor Miller was great. His teaching is clear, and the Psets can be challenging, but his presentation of material always points you in the right direction. Class is also interesting to be in on most days. I think a big improvement could be made with the TF's. I don't know what the case normally is, but it seemed that there were TF's in this course who definitely lacked the proper background to be able to teach concepts that are (at some points of the course) difficult to grasp / easy to get confused about. It got to a point where I was only really comfortable coming to Professor Miller himself. Also, maybe don't put it so far up science hill - it's mostly non-STEM people in the class anyways.",
                "Overall it was a good course through which I learned a lot. However, the subject matter was sometimes a bit overwhelming, and the tests were quite difficult; the first exam in particular caught me off guard. Since this is a course which is taken by many non-STEM students, I might be a bit clearer about preparing for the exam and might share more tips with students about how to do well, e.g. pacing their exam-taking.",
                "I wish the instructions on exams can be a little clearer. But other than that, this is a pretty great and informative class.",
                "The strengths of this class were the professor and the organization. Professor Miller was extremely organized and informative, and was always willing to help students with questions or concerns. There were no weaknesses!",
                "This class is not a gut.",
                "Strengths: Prof Miller is a good lecturer, lots of office hours, things are well explained, the final project is fun/ easy, the science concepts are made pretty accessible for someone non-STEM\r\nWeaknesses: midterms are hard to prepare for, it extrapolates a lot from concepts in class so you have to understand concepts SUPER well to do well on the midterms",
                "More weekly quizzes to retain knowledge",
                "Professor Miller is the strength of this course. He makes lectures super interesting and tries to make the course as accessible as possible for his students. The class was definitely harder for me than I thought it would be (based on other class reviewed).",
                "The exams are extremely challenging. Sometimes I felt like they didnt reflect what we covered in class.",
                "The exam questions were very similar to pset questions which was good even though they were difficult, and the final project was enjoyable as far as final projects go. Lectures were interesting and engaging. One weakness is that some of the topics were a little too complicated for me to fully grasp.",
                "Really well organized, fantastically explained",
                "Great content and lectures. Exam maybe a little too hard.",
                "The one thing that I think could be improved is telling students before the first test that it's going to be difficult. Now, I don't think the difficulty of the tests should be changed. I think the challenge was fun, but yeah, just knowing beforehand that it'll be difficult would lessen the shock for most.",
                "The instructor was very clear and helpful. The class could be improved by adding a weekly section to discuss the problems more in depth with faculty.",
                "It was a solid course. Occasionally it moved too quickly and spent too long on VR/AR/IR, but on the whole was one of the most informative and useful science classes Ive ever taken.",
                "Strengths: a lot of support from teaching staff, weaknesses: exams were very difficult and felt like they were far beyond what was covered during class",
                "Poll everywhere questions are annoying but get people to class. Other than that no weaknesses, all strengths.",
                "This is one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale. Probably the worst. You know what, let's just go for it and say it was THE WORST class I have ever taken in my life. \r\nThis class markets itself as a STEM class for non-stem majors. Although I am not a stem person, I have more than the average background in more advanced math and science courses. However, Professor Miller assumes a depth of knowledge so vast that sometimes, on midterms, people who MAJOR in stem couldn't even answer one part of a multipart question. I don't know if he just really wanted to rebel and create an official \"non-gut\" this year, but he absolutely destroyed the moral of every student in the class. \r\nFor the midterms, I went to almost every office hours slot, went through ALL the practice exams, and still I walked away with Cs. It was one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in years. I am morally opposed to courses like this.",
                "weaknesses- course moves quickly and covers too much ground for most students to have comfort with the concepts",
                "A strength would be the amount of topics you cover and applying them to modern technologies in a way that makes sense. Also taught in a very approachable way for non-STEM majors",
                "Strength is the variety of material and the professors energy!",
                "strengths: professor and the tfs! all very willing to help and listen to students' comments and needs\r\nweaknesses: the amount of content that we have to move through",
                "Strengths: The concept is great. I wish it was even more similar to the UC Berkeley course it's modeled after (Science for the Next US President).\r\nWeaknesses: The Psets are nothing like the in-class content, you will not do well on the Psets unless you go to OH every week for answers, the exams are extremely hard (thankfully curved), and I personally found the class to be very unengaging.",
                "The strength is that it is a class bout interesting about relevant topics. The lectures can be dry and somewhat repetitive.",
                "Strengths: interesting topics, practical knowledge of science useful for non-science majors\r\nWeaknesses: midterms can be more challenging than psets, not a gut",
                "The course is strong but the exams did not reflect what we learned in class.",
                "Interesting course, great professor.",
                "Professor Miller goes through a lot of material throughout the semester and I think it would be helpful to hold review sessions before exams to help students know what to focus on and ground in key concepts. Otherwise, Professor Miller and the TFs and very helpful and responsive to questions. Their support really helped me get through the class even thought I came in without a physics or STEM-focused background",
                "Strength is that the grading is quite fair, even generous, as all exams are curved, plenty of practice exams, final project instead of final exam, and exams arent even worth that much. \r\nWell organized for learning, Prof. Miller was very helpful over emails, he clearly cares about his students learning and becoming excited about physics. \r\n\r\nWeakness - due to not being sure exactly how the exams will be curved until end of semester, not sure what grade is until the end (though he provides estimates), which can be frustrating but tbh is not a real complaint.",
                "Strengths: breadth of content; something new and interesting every week which nonetheless builds on previous weeks' content; psets are the right level of challenging; exams are challenging in a good way; Prof. Miller's teaching is awesome! Low stress class, fun final project that can be a partner project. Great science credit. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class location in the physics building is kind of far from where I live, but that's alright",
                "I think this course is really well organized. It starts with the basic laws of electricity and magnetism, and then slowly builds up over the semester before culminating with more complicated technologies like MRI. The physics concepts are explained in a very simple and easy-to-understand way, although sometimes I found the explanations to be lacking in depth and complexity. I personally would prefer that we go more in-depth into the mathematics underlying some of the physics we learned about, but I get that this course is geared toward non-STEM majors and is supposed to be mostly conceptual (and there is also a LOT to cover). If I were to trim the course down, I would remove a few of the lectures about light because I found them to be less interesting than the other topics we covered.",
                "The professors and the teaching staff were extremely patient, and the way that the material was taught was clear. No weaknesses.",
                "This course is amazing. It is so accessible to someone with little science background and doesn't assume any prior knowledge. Everything builds on itself and is self-contained. Professor Miller's teaching style is clear, fun, and engaging. By the end of the course you leave with an entirely different understanding and appreciation for how the world works and have covered an amazing number of relevant topics!",
                "Simplification",
                "The exams feel way too packed given that we have such a broad coverage of topics.",
                "Slowly explaining concepts so that more people can follow. Designate specific reading or reference sources so that students can be able to grapple with the material on their own. The lecture notes are usually scattered and it's difficult to understand the transition from one topic to another.",
                "Strengths: Professor Miller is stelar. He is very organized, extremely smart, and so passionate. Could not have asked for a better lecturer. He also makes himself very available and is so wiling to help. He always asks students how the class is going to assess how he is doing as a teacher. The content is fascinating and the course is predictable ad organized. There are no surprises with assignments or grades. There is a problem set due every Thursday morning, two midterms (they're tough!), and a final video project. There is an ABUNDANCE of office hours, including practically the entire day before a problem set is due. There are review sessions and Professor Miller makes every single past test question and answer available to us. It's pretty fantastic. But, that does mean the new questions he writes are tough!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some topics were less interesting and could be excluded and sometimes it was hard to see how a basic physics concept was part of some extremely complex technology. Lectures sometimes went too fast. This is partially because the content is difficult and can't be understood in one swoop. Being in class would be the first viewing. If you really want to understand everything that's being said, you'll need to watch the recording later.",
                "Strengths - CONCEPTS/SYLLABUS: There is such a wide array of day to day life technologies that are so crucial to daily life, making them a great selection for the syllabus; PROFESSOR OWEN MILLER: Professor Miller is good at explaining things, taking questions, and being patient with explaining the content; TFs: Office hours are so helpful, I wish I'd started going earlier! the TFs are very kind and helpful. \r\n\r\nWeakness (not weaknesses but warnings) - EXAMS: not sure if this is a weakness or just something to watch out for, but I found the exams difficult even if I studied the most I could; GUT MARKETING: again, not necessarily a weakness but something to watch out for is no one markets this class as a gut, but we love to go on coursetable and see that this is a class for non majors and make ourselves think it's a gut. This is NOT a gut. It is a beyond interesting course with amazing people as professor and TA and it challenged me so much intellectually, but this takes work. The exams and psets do require quite a bit of thinking outside the box and are challenging (not challenging enough to be dissuaded from the class, but challenging enough to say this class will take quite a bit of your time)"

                "Yes. If you have taken AP Physics 1 or C in high school and did well, this is extremely doable and homeworks can very reasonably just be done the night before; make sure to review all details on his slides for the exams and you'll be fine. A solid, easy science credit if you have experience with college-level physics at all.",
                "Absolutely! It is a really fun and interesting class! It is a great class for people who are not physics majors because it focuses on more basic concepts and does not require very complicated math. The workload is very reasonable, and you won't need to stress about it very much. If you want to learn about technology and what makes them work, this is a great class for you!",
                "I took this as a QR. I think that it was challenging enough that I felt motivated to try but at times its rigor definitely felt overwhelming. I would not recommend this as a SC for ppl who are not as math-oriented or physics-oriented because I feel like there are SC that are more fun and not as challenging but also I think that APHY 110 is teaching me things that I wouldn't really learn in other parts of my life. It is not a gut but also Owen Miller is not out to get you. If you have a really heavy courseload and don't have the time to actually like engage with the material, it might be demoralizing to get like a 32 on your first exam, but also good grades in this course feel more rewarding and you can see how your knowledge has grown.",
                "Definitely! Professor Miller is smart! And the content is applicable to the real world.",
                "I loved this class. As a non-science major, I feel like the course was the perfect amount of challenge while still being engaging and do-able.",

                "Absolutely! This is an amazing class with an amazing prof. You learn a lot (and not too much! not too complicated). The last time I took physics was my sophomore year of high school, and I never thought I would find physics fun and exciting. The workload is also just right; lecture was never boring.",
                "Definitely! Content was very interesting and class is good for non science majors.",
                "I would recommend this course to any STEM student that really wants to learn more about physics or a non-STEM student that is interested in the concepts and willing to put in the work. This class is NOT a gut. You must work hard on the problem sets, study for your midterms, and come to class every day if you want to earn a good grade in this class. If you like the content and do what you are supposed to do, you very likely will get a good grade and enjoy this class a lot.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone who is interested in doing some accessible physics to better understand the tech world around them! I didnt take this for a science credit, it was just for fun, and Im glad I did it.",
                "not as a science gut if you're not a stem major!!! but great professor",
                "Yes, if you want to learn about applied physics (electricity and magnetism) at an introductory level, then this is the class for you.",
                "Yes! This class covers very manageable basic physics, but you'll come out of it with a new understanding and appreciation for the tech around us. If you have no idea how a solar panel works, this class is for you.",
                "Absolutely! I really loved this course, and I learned a lot of information that will be important to my daily life. It is very engaging, and with some effort, it is manageable for any type of student.",

                "Absolutely. I took this course for a science credit so that I could graduate and am really happy that I did. It is a challenging course if you have no physics background, but putting in a couple of days of somewhat diligent review before each of the exams really solidified my understanding of cool concepts with everyday applications. The course delivers on its title, and by the end you will be amazed at how different you will view everyday appliances and other pieces of tech that you use. Cell phones and other communication technologies are especially something which have been very demystified to me, which is very cool. As a history major with lots of friends in STEM, I am much better able to have incredible conversations about the physical world after having taken this course. 10/10 would recommend.",
                "I took this course to fulfill my science requirement. As a non-STEM major, I didn't find the material exhilarating, but I definitely feel like I learned some useful information about the science behind everyday technologies. Overall, I would recommend the course.",
                "Definitely! I learned a lot and Prof. Miller is super awesome. The content is really interesting if you are curious about how things work. It's definitely a bit tough if you don't have a strong physics background, but the class is made in a way where it is accessible to those willing to put in the time to learn it.",
                "Yes. Most people in this course are just trying to knock out their science credit, so don't be intimidated. It can be a bit challenging at times (I think the beginning of the course is the most math- / equation-oriented part), but the grading is pretty generous so you don't have to worry about preserving your GPA. Also there are just as many easier topics for each one of the more challenging ones. It's a cool way to learn genuinely useful and perspective-altering things with your science credit, rather than waste it with some mind-numbing bio class or something.",
                "Yes, though I would not expect a very easy QR course. This class definitely requires active engagement; I would recommend it to a student who is looking to learn about this subject, but if one is just looking for an easy credit there are much easier options.",
                "Yes, but THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY SCIENCE CREDIT and you need to do lots of actual work. I took it because it was the only science credit that fits into my schedule and I'm graduating and I ended up doing lots of work which paid off, but I know people who took the class thinking it's a gut science credit and had to Cr/D it because they didn't put in enough work. One pset a week, Poll Everywhere questions everyday, two midterms that are pretty hard (the uncurved average was usually a 60-70 out of 100) and a final project. I ended up learning lots of things but this is definitely not a gut (unless you know much about E&M and optics and VR and information technology and all that, way beyond the high school AP level - but then there's no point of taking this class, right?).",
                "I would recommend this course to a non-STEM major looking to fulfill their science requirement. The workload was very manageable, although the exams were difficult.",

                "Its a good class and youll get a lot out of it.  NOT A GUT. dont take it bc you think itll be an easy grade- you have to put in good work and midterms are really hard",
                "This course is a well-constructed science credit, for those seeking to understand the scientific principles which underlie everyday technologies. The weekly psets are very manageable and not time consuming. The exams, however, are somewhat difficult, but a class curve should minimize any hesitation to take this course.",
                "Yes, if youre interested in the material! Not sure I would recommend this course as a gut but the material is super interesting and helpful!",
                "Yes! Its a terrific class and you will a learn a lot. That being said, if you are trying to take a gut science, this is not that class! It requires time and effort, but is well worth it.",

                "Absolutely - great class for a basic understanding of important science in daily life. No scientific background necessary",
                "Absolutely, even if you don't need the QR credit. If you do need the credit, don't be a fool and take this course. It was one of my favorites I've taken at Yale.",

                "THIS IS NOT A GUT IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE PHYSICS IN HIGH SCHOOL. If you did, the concepts are all quite simple and the professor explains them in a very accessible way, and I would definitely recommend this class as an easy, fun science credit.\r\n\r\n If not, just be prepared to have to learn a lot of math/physics concepts if you don't have some kind of base knowledge. The class is also heavily curved so you'll still be able to get a good grade, you will just need to work harder.",
                "Yes. Its a gut if your good at math. It doesnt go past high school physics. One short pset a week and two exams and final project. Project really easy. Finals not easy but very doable. Also quite interesting.",
                "NO. Unless you are a genius and can intuit the most advanced concepts from elementary practice problems, don't take this class. The best result of this class is understanding how a speaker works. The worst is complete mental destruction and a GPA slash.",
                "Yes - Interesting learning how many modern technologies actually work where I would usually have no understanding of how these work",
                "Yes!!! Definitely not easy but a great class , youll learn a ton",
                "This is a cool intro course if youre interested in technology, its not too hard and doesnt require a ton of math, its just very broad in what it covers\r\n\r\nProf. Miller is very chill tho",
                "No. For non-stem majors, this course is not a gut. More importantly, you don't leave this course learning all that much. Since this course is designed for non-stem majors, the concepts that are taught are often not grounded in definitions and equations. You then lose a lot of theoretical understanding that is absolutely essential if you need to actually apply the course content. This explains a phenomenon many APHY 110 students faced this semester: You leave the class thinking you understood everything but when a Pset or exam comes around you don't know how to do anything.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this as an interesting science credit.",
                "If youre looking for a useful science credit as a non-science major, this is great for you! Ideas of how technology works is always useful to know",
                "I would, but only if they're interested in technology.",
                "Yes! Great science credit and the content is super interesting. Would be helpful if you like PSETS or are STEM-oriented",
                "YES! This is one of those courses I will think about every day of my life, as it truly applies to almost every-day technology, and it was an enjoyable and pretty reasonable class to boot. \r\n\r\nPretty light on math and equations, very conceptual focused but nothing too difficult to wrap your head around, while also detailed enough you actually understand how these things work.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Probably the best science credit you can take at Yale as a non-lab-science major! I learned so much, and as a CS major, the vast majority of the content was all new to me (other people have echoed this sentiment). Prof. Miller is a great lecturer; expectations for all assignments are very clear; exams are actually fun, they challenge you instead of just asking you to regurgitate facts as many other classes do. I had not taken physics since 8th grade, and I found everything in this class to be 100% accessible. My exam grades were far from the best, but my overall grade ended up being just fine! The final project (video explainer) is a fun opportunity to work with a friend, and i personally really enjoyed making it. Low stress, science credit, great prof. who seriously cares about your engagement and curiosity, and you learn a lot about things that are happening in the world right now. What's not to like!",
                "Not a shot",
                "Yes, easy science credit and you can learn a lot of cool things.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoyed reading How Things Work books as a kid, or is just generally interested in modern technology.",
                "Yes. If you are into math and science and like tech",
                "Yes! I would recommend it to any non-stem majors looking to fill their sc credit. It's not the easiest class in the world, but you will do well if you put it at least a little bit of time and effort.",
                "Yes, please take this course!! I cannot emphasize how accessible it is and how much you get out of it. I had a limited science background going into the class and thought there would be a huge barrier to understanding how complex technologies work-- Prof. Miller made the class layered so that you felt like you understood each thing by the time you talked about it and there was no prior knowledge assumed anywhere! The topics ranged from MRI machines to Bitcoin to microwaves to radios to cell phones-- all so relevant and interesting!",
                "If you are good at math, not for athletes",
                "Yes. It's a very fun and interesting course to take in the modern world!",
                "Definitely not an easy one if you are looking to take it for distributional requirement.",
                "To start, I think that science credits can be split into two groups -- reading and memorization science credits and math oriented science credits. If you like math and are looking for a math oriented science credit, I think this is a great option. Professor Miller broke down physics concepts in an understandable method even given limited physics experience. The exams are difficult in that you are asked to apply concepts we learned in class as opposed to just repeat the concepts, but there are a lot of resources there to help you study for the exams (I used old midterm exams and practice problems to study) and in the end I think it's graded very fairly and nicely. I really enjoyed the material itself and learning about physics in the real world, which helped me stay engaged throughout the course. Also, you are taught how to make those connections between physics and real life yourself too which is a very cool skill to have.",
                "Yes, I absolutley would. I took this class for a science credit, but also with a love of physics. I am not great at the numbers or calculations, but I love the theoretical pieces and thinking about how incredible physics is. It is everywhere. This class satisfied my curiosity every single day and blew my mind every single day. There was also very limited math. This does not mean it was easy; concepts were more difficult because we were not told to just use an equation. This was truly the perfect model for how a lecture class should be at Yale. Predictable assignments that really do cement the learning, a reasonable amount of assessments, fascinating content, and a wonderful professor. Do not hesitate to take this class if you are intrigued. It is not easy (the midterms are very tough, but not unfair. The averages on both was in the 60s percent), but it is a good amount of challenging and is so enjoyable.",
                "YES!!! YES YES YES YES YES YES!!! This class was AMAZING. I learned A LOT. I feel like I can walk around and see random things/technologies and just know how they work, and as a humanities major that feeling is AMAZING. I feel so knowledgeable. The class was fun to go to, with Professor Miller making a couple jokes here and there. The Psets were varied in difficulty, some were really easy and some were much more challenging, but all fair. The exams were (in my opinion) difficult regardless of how much studying I did (again, I think some peers would disagree, this is in my opinion, maybe I'm just bad at science). \r\n\r\nI will say: this is NOT a gut. Your life will be so much easier if you go to office hours and make buddies with a few people in the class even if you don't know anyone already, working with peers on the psets and studying really really really helps; don't underestimate the power psets can have for saving your grade so really try on the psets so you have some buffer when exams come.",
                "Yes. This is a great course for anyone interested in physics but who doesn't want to take the conventional physics classes here. It touches on most of the fundamental ideas in physics without going in too deep or requiring too complex computations."
