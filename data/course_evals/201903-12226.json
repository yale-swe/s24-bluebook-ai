   "comments": [
    "I learned to analyze furniture and the process of making furniture",
    "Gained knowledge on basic writing fundamentals as well as the history of furniture and furniture making.",
    "Professor Cooke has an enormous knowledge of American furniture. Coming into this course knowing absolutely nothing about the role furniture plays in my life, Im leaving this course appreciating everything that Ive learned in the class.",
    "I learned many aspects about early and modern furniture design and how they related to the culture of the times",
    "This class has changed my perspective on art history and the way that I look furniture. It gives you a new perspective into the production of things that you interact with everyday and a means to further investigate that insight.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot from this course!  I think I became a better writer and improved my analytical skills, and at the risk of sounding a bit corny, but I think this class really introduced me to a whole new world.  I didn't really know anything about art history before, and it was absolutely incredible to be able to go to the furniture study and have such a hands-on experience with the furniture.   I had a great experience.",
    "This was such an intellectually challenging and perspective enhancing experience. I've learned not only about furniture but about the subtle, translucent relationships between objects, their construction, and their place in history.",
    "Writing and analysis"

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting discussions, laid back environment, great way to meet people.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: long meeting time(1-4). Grading can be a bit odd.",
    "One strength was definitely being able to go to the furniture study every week to look and touch the famous pieces we were studying in class. I had only wished we could have gone more often.",
    "The classes some times feel a little long. Overall though, the class was the most enjoyable writing credit Ive ever taken. Its not conventional, and thats what makes it interesting.",
    "The class was great overall. I think the essay prompts would have been a bit easier to understand if more background information was included, but the essays were still manageable.",
    "I think this class really helped me work on my writing and presentation skills, and I also really enjoyed the seminar aspect of it.  I'm grateful for the opportunity to have met so many genuinely kind people in this course.  I can't really think of anything that I didn't like about it, it was my favorite class by far.",
    "Some strengths are that the class was able to cover a wide variety of topics and time periods. A suggestion would be to maybe have some class time to go over what the readings covered.",
    "Not a ton of room for interpretation."

    "Yes, take this if you can",
    "Yes! Lovely class and very interesting material. Great student teacher interaction. Take the course if it at all looks interesting!",
    "This class is a one of a kind opportunity at Yale and if you want to learn about something really unique and niche definitely take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course. Its a good way to learn how to write papers not in the conventional English class way of writing.",
    "Yes! This was probably my favorite course this semester. Professor Cooke is an incredible professor who is  very knowledgeable about furniture and is also very approachable.",
    "Absolutely!  I loved this class!\r\n\r\nThat said, I can see how it might not be for everyone.  Every class is pretty much like going to a museum and taking a two-hour tour focusing on three to five objects, which you see up-close and often have the opportunity to touch.  If that sounds like a nightmare to you (it did to a couple of my suitemates), then I would not take the class.  But if you love museums and have any interest in history or art history, it is extremely interesting and I cannot recommend it enough!",
    "Yes, this takes history, art, design, and engineering into a brand new context that will challenge you to not make assumptions and look beyond the facade of biased opinions into the objective traits that shape furniture.",
    "Yes! Very niche but interesting topic."
