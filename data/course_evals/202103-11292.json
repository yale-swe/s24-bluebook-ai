Sprinkling of humorous comments from professor keeps the class engaging. Lots of visuals to accommodate different types of learners.",
                "This course provided a thorough and comprehensive overview of the political and social trends in Britain during the \"long 19th century.\" Going into this course, I thought of Britain as the poster child for peaceful, gradual reform. While it is true that Britain didn't have any regime change during this period, unlike the rest of Europe, our discussion of mass politics and protest movements, many of which turned violent, gave me new insights that led me to question how \"peaceful\" reform in Britain really was.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths are the level of intellectual challenge. The course is thematic and Professors Semmels insights are interesting. Personally, I think there are too many readings that are dense and not always easy to read primary sources. Though, these readings are well selected to give a balanced view of the opinions. While most courses at Yale only offer a liberal viewpoint as objective truth, it was refreshing to cover readings that covered a different opinion which we analysed in an unbiased way.",
                "Strengths: Professor Semmel was a great lecturer. He was super knowledgable about the subject matter and always made lectures entertaining\/accessible. Assignments weren't too stressful (two papers, two exams, weekly readings and sections, and a small map quiz). \r\nWeaknesses: none particularly.",
                "Strengths: Very organized lectures, appropriate readings to complement class in discussion section.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes too much course material, ends up being recorded and posted online because not enough class time.",
                "I really like the format of this course. The lectures were great for efficiently disseminating a huge amount of material, while the fact that the readings were primary sources gave me a better insight into the lives and beliefs of the people of the time. I appreciate the fast pacing of this course and the breadth of different topics it covered, including those that don't directly relate to Britain's transition from \"oligarchy to democracy.\"\r\n\r\nMy only critique is that I would drop North and South from the syllabus. While I really liked the parts of the book I read and think it's a great fit for the course, reading an entire novel is a big ask and I don't think I got as much out of our class discussions of it than if a shorter work was assigned that everyone had read in its entirety.",
                "The course is well designed, with each week making sense on its own while forming a coherent larger narrative when combined with the rest of the class. Professor Semmel communicates well and makes every decision with students in mind. The virtual supplemental lectures were sometimes appropriate, like when making up for a lost class, but I think they should be avoided as appendices to full, 50-minute lectures that just needed more time.",
                "Great course. Loved that the readings were all primary to give us a deep understanding of the time period we were studying. The lectures could have been a bit more cohesive but Prof Semmels deep passion and knowledge of the subject made this class super enjoyable!"

                "Yes, if they are looking for a great history class that really gives you an overview of British political history in the 19th century. However, this class may be too niche for someone who isn't particularly into history.",
                "Yes! I loved this course so much. Professor Semmel is an engaging lecturer and cares so much about the material. I found the workload really manageable-- the whole experience was low-stress and intellectually challenging and so much fun.",
                "Would highly recommend to anyone interested in history of the United Kingdom.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who likes history because of the tremendous significance of Britain on world history, particularly during the  19th century. While the British Empire would not be at its greatest territorial extent until after the First World War, the 19th century was when it clearly established itself as the preeminent world power. An understanding of the political situation in Britain is essential to understanding the influence its values and institutions have had on systems of government across the world.",
                "Yes. The course content well packaged and presented, and it's interesting to watch so much change happen over time. The readings are manageable and comprehensible and the workload is unobtrusive.",
                "Absolutely, if you are interested in European and specifically British history!"
