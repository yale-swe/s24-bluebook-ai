Sometimes we discuss stuff like politics and cultural differences in class and that's always interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you don't come prepared, having done the reading, you probably won't get as much out of the class.",

My one suggestion for improvement might actually be to increase the amount of homework slightly: with only one comprehension quiz and one essay per lesson, there wasn't a lot of incentive to really internalize the vocabulary/grammar or practice it outside of class."

The topics discussed in class are interesting, plus the workload is less than I was expecting (no weekly tingxies, exams were pretty easy). If you're on the fence about taking Chinese because you're intimidated by the workload, this class is a good way to stay sharp with your Chinese without having to dedicate too much time to the class.",
