But also the class made me think about all sorts of topics- democracy, sovereignty, education, etc. Also, it certainly helped teach me how to write a tight focused research paper.",
                "Analyzing new frameworks, rejecting positivism.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of the concept of populism and have improved my discussion/debate skills with my peers.",

I also learned more about what political science as an academic discipline includes and how to research/write papers in the social sciences.",

Also many of the readings were really great.\r\nWeaknesses- none in particular come to mind except for the fact that it took a bit to get discussion really in depth in the early weeks but I think thats expected",
                "Professor Aslanidis is very engaging, and most of the readings are very interesting. However, he often leaves much of the guidance to the class, who, if they have not done the readings, will diverge from discussing some of the more interesting topics.",
                "Interesting course content; I wish the readings were more focused and discussed in class--oftentimes, the readings were hard to engage with and class discussions seldom really required an understanding of the readings. I also wish that we could break down the tactics of populist leaders in more depth--more discussion of text analysis and the kinds of rhetoric we see in populist leaders would be helpful.",
                "Professor Aslanidis makes this class super engaging and responsive to students.",
