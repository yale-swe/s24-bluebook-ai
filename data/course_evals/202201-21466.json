The weakness of the class is that it meets everyday, but I also think that it's necessary for a language class.",
                "is an amazing instructor, which is absolutely the biggest strength of the course! I also really appreciated the 4-1 model of the course, where we were able to use Friday as a day to catch-up and individually practice without needing to go to class  I was very stressed about the workload of an intensive language course at the beginning, but the 4-1 model definitely helped tremendously in allowing me to learn at a comfortable pace."

Chinese will come easier to students who already have a background in it, and this course went at the right pace to maximize heritage students' full potential. I really enjoyed the course and feel that I improved my language skills.",

I had doubts about taking the course at first, but after a year with  and the Chinese program, I can say with certainty that you should definitely take this course.",
