    "I took this class because I have some beyond-basic knowledge of syntax but wanted to test that knowledge base and expand upon it. I most definitely did. After this semester, I find argument structure to be one of the most scintillating fields of morphosyntax. I enjoyed the research projects that I did, enjoyed the readings, and engaged a lot in the class. I",
    "This class covers the new literature on Argument Structure in great detail. As well, basic principles of morphology are discussed.",
    "I learned about the most recent developments in the field of distributed morphology and theoretical syntax. I improved my linguistic writing and critical thinking skills.",
    "Introduction to and exploration of the syntax and morphology involved in changes in argument structure. Topics included transitivity increasing and decreasing morphology, passives, causatives, middles, and various types of nominalizations."

   "comments": [
    "This class is catered to a very high level of linguistic capabilities. It was no doubt a challenge, which I thought was its greatest strength. My personal learning curve was sharp but well-worth-it. Aside from that, the writing credit part was a bit of a weakness. We had problem sets that did not require long-form writing with professor-feedback, so my linguistics writing did not improve drastically. Additionally, I would have enjoyed a round of professor-feedback on both of my projects. We did peer-reviews for both which was helpful, but I found myself wishing I could hear my professor's thoughts on my project before turning it in.",
    "This class is structured around readings and discussion. Jim does a great job leading these discussions, and though they sometimes get sidetracked, that isn't as detrimental as it can be in other classes because the final paper has such a broad topic. There are times where the discussion can go a little too quickly, but Jim is always willing to back up and explain something again.",
    "Over the course of the semester we spent a lot of time reading papers which we usually did reading responses\/psets to, but this seemed to taper off by the end of the semester, meaning that the feedback we got for learning new material also decreased.",
    "The course was taught very well overall. The topics and the readings were always interesting and engaging, and Professor Wood gave the class excellent, thorough advice on how to write papers in linguistics. There were several interesting guest lectures from other professors and grad students as well."

    "Yes! Any syntax course in the department is incredible, and this one is the best I've taken so far. If you were at all interested in Theta Grids and the role of Voice during Syntax I, or even if you've taken bunches of syntax courses but want more, this is definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, I say this is an excellent course to test your skills in linguistics and to learn more than you knew you could in one semester.",
    "Yes. This class is a phenomenal continuation for a Syntax depth requirement. I would strongly recommend taking Syntax II or at least some other higher level syntax seminar before this course, as the papers are difficult to get through if you only have Syntax I level understanding of the field.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in syntax and\/or morphology, because this course is about the most recent developments in each field.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to any student with a background in syntax. The topic was very interesting overall, and expands on a good amount of material not discussed too in-depth in introductory syntax courses."
