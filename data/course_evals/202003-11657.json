                "Strengths: really chill, homework is NOT a pset. No final exams, professor is really really sweet.\r\nWeaknesses: class engagement was pretty low but even then professor was very understanding",

I also felt the study group\/study guide was fairly pointless.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Dr. Schilling was so understanding and supportive. Out of all my professors, she was the most responsive to our situation (pandemic, election, etc.). The Ignite talks are fun and flexible. Also, the guest speakers were amazing.",
                "Strengths - caring and inspiring instructor, can be adjusted to suit each students' interests, especially suitable for non-STEM majors\r\nWeaknesses - not very structured, students needed to be self-motivated, not very rigorous",
                "PERFECT!",
                "I think that Prof. Schilling did a great job giving us a lot of different ways to engage in this course (discussion boards, study guides, small groups, videos, readings, independent research, guest speakers), which was fun and helpful especially during this strange semester. However, at times the expectations for the course were a little unclear, and I wasn't sure what I should be prioritizing.",
                "This course engages students with the particulars of art-making and the materials required to create a wide variety of artistic works. I think this course effectively provided real-world examples of these processes, and allowed students to discuss their own experiences with art-making. I think the online course could have engaged different online labs than the Labster modules that were used, as this technology was often hard to navigate, but it still did a good job of showing students the true science behind art-making.",

                "More assignments that weren't presentations would be good, although I did like them. I liked how much freedom there was to choose topics that interest you."

Labsters were frustrating technologically (my computer freaked out several times, I had to redo some of the labs, and I didn't find them that helpful). I think the Ignite talks were a great idea. Professor Schilling was also very thoughtful and understanding regarding deadlines, which I really appreciated and needed this semester.",

                "YES!! This is such a great science class. You do have to put in SOME effort while youre learning how to do the Ignite talks but after that, you should get better at it and itll be super easy! Its nice that we can prerecord the talks rather than doing it live. The first time I repeated my talk like 20 times and by the last talk I think I only practiced like once or twice. Its also super flexible as in you learn what YOU want to learn which is great.",
                "Yes--it's a great science course for artistically minded people. The assignments are interesting and you can be quite creative with them. There's not too much work in the class, but the material is interesting, so I still felt engaged. We had some amazing opportunities to talk to conservators from the various Yale museums, which I loved.",
                "Yes, if you're a non-STEM major who needs a science credit! Best suited for more self-motivated individuals - you'll get what you put into this course!",

                "Good if you need a science credit and are interested in art making, conservation, or history. I think as a student who wasn't in any of those fields I sometimes felt disengaged\/out of the loop. I also think this is a class that really benefits from being in person, because to be able to actually visit the museums and do experiments would really change what you get out of it.",
                "I would highly recommend this course interested in learning more about the science behind art-making and who want to do more research into their own artistic passions.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in art, I think this would be a great class to take cause it teaches you the ins and outs of why and how art looks the way it does.",
                "Yes! for any non-stem majors, Professor Schilling is very open to having you work on what you're passionate about so long as it has any relevance to the course."
