                "Because I chose a strong advisor, this aspect of the course was wonderful.  Our weekly meetings greatly enhanced my final product.\r\n\r\nThe EP&E major, however, provided little to no outside support for my research.  One workshop was scheduled by the senior essay consultant, but it offered little guidance for my writing.  After this workshop, communication from the department went silent.  If not for my weekly advisor meetings, I would be totally in the dark about my essay.  This lack of engagement is unacceptable, and I hope the EP&E leadership changes its approach in future semesters.\r\n\r\nFor reference, the EP&E website notes that *three* workshops will be held over the semester, with attendance required at each.  By contrast, this semester only had one preliminary workshop."

In this respect, there is not much room for improvement, since we probably met on Zoom more than we would have in person.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the EP&E program failed to establish contact after the first workshop.  This was made more difficult by the senior essay consultant occasionally not responding to emails and a lack of DUS office hours."
