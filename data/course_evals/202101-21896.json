                "This course is taught extremely well, and you will definitely come out of it having actually learned French! It is also really fun to be in such a small class that is very tight-knit. That being said, the workload is VERY HIGH - like 2-3 hours of work per night. The professor is really supportive and willing to be flexible, but it was still impossible for me to relax this semester with deadlines every single day and no break besides 5 individual break days. Plus, in order to fit in the syllabus, we had work due after every break day, and class almost always went overtime, which was quite a big stressor for me. While this method certainly succeeds at teaching you French, it is by no means necessary to assign this volume of work to students for them to learn.",
                "The amount of work that the student does will undeniably improve their French.",
                "The strengths of the course are its intensity level, and how much it just throws you into the subject matter, with a whole lot of support (class time, office hours, your fellow classmates, etc.) along the way. There is simply no way that you will not get exponentially better at French if you do even a fraction of all of the work assigned. The weakness, I will say, is one that is is not equal to three credits, when it's the work of three credits (@Yale) and then the Telecom sessions (weekly sessions where you speak to real French people). I think they were organized as best as they could be, from my understanding of the scheduling conflicts and everything, but honestly they were pretty underwhelming. I was hoping to really get to know some French people, but through a confluence of the students, professors and setup, I left feeling quite disappointed. I think it would have been a whole lot better if there had been more consistent meetings, which could have been better planned and facilitated to enable developing real relationships.",
                "One strength of this class is that it is immensely structured. The professor sets up a detailed schedule for assignments and exams and your complete this work so often that it becomes second nature to you within a few weeks. Additionally, the engagement level is very high because the professor tries her best to make the content be applicable to us and interesting. If I were to come up with a weakness for the class, I would say that it's a little more difficult to improve your speaking than the other skills and that more assignments could possibly be geared towards that skill for substantial practice."

                "Honestly, having this course in a Zoom format was probably one of the best ways it could have been taught. Mme. Skorupa is expertly adept at showing all of the various materials we needed, and managing the chatbox, and doing anything and everything possible to make the classroom experience as best as it can be. Obviously I do not know what the in person experience could have looked like, but it is hard to imagine it being better in person. ALSO! Having ten minute breaks were a huge saving grace throughout the course."

                "Yes, but. This is really not a course you can take if you are at all hesitant about it. Like you will hear from faculty, advisors and this and other reviews, this course is incredibly challenging. It will take up a whole lot of your time, no matter what you do. If you dare take off two days in a row (e.g. Friday and Saturday) you will pay for it on Sunday, or Monday, or Tuesday, or in your final grade. It is an amazing course, and probably the best way to learn French shy of going to a French speaking country, but that does not mean that it will not sometimes feel like an immense slog. But if you are aware of and still willing to commit to it, it can be an amazing way to speed along the process of learning the language/getting the necessary requirements/becoming fluent in French!",
                "If you have an interest in francophone culture and the language, I strongly recommend this course. But the course's workload should not be taken lightly. Of course, it is manageable but you will be doing about 2-3 hours of daily work depending on the unit and 2 hours of class every day. So, there is a very big learning curve at the beginning where you are getting used to that structure and there will be a point where you feel burnt out near the end of the semester. But luckily, the professor is very understanding of this and will work with you to make sure you are successful in the course. And all that work will prove effective by the end of the semester when your linguistic skills improve drastically. You will surprise yourself with how much they've improved."
