    "Yes: especially first years looking to improve their writing and learn how to write for college",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in nostalgia (or are yourself nostalgic) the courses provides new lens to analyze that interest. Take the course especially if it is taught by Professor Hill, who generates great discussions and gives clear feedback on essays.",
