This course focuses on how to balance accuracy with these other factors in constructing methodologies to learn from large datasets."

I think the open nature of the course can also lead to ambiguity about the final deliverables, so more concrete examples would be helpful!",
                "The format of the seminar, each lasting around two hours covering a distinct topic, was surprisingly engaging. Each provided a surface-level understanding of a series of topics, allowing for the students to delve deeper into a particular topic that they found interesting for their project. The format of the research project was also quite enjoyable, including weekly check-up meetings coupled with individual work over the course of the week. I really enjoyed the topics that the class covered as well as the delivery of those topics. The only weakness that comes to mind for this course is that the primary way for students to drill down a deeper understanding about topics that they were not presenting a project in was to read scholarly articles as opposed to having \"mini-examples\" to apply the topics themselves, although I recognize this is not easy to accomplish for a machine learning class."
