It also seemed like work was created randomly just because, and in combination with a lack of clear deadlines, no one knew what was due and when. Our time in class could also be cumbersome because it was often just a lecture instead of a discussion. Overall there wasn't much communication from the instructors, and there was little feedback on our work. With all this said, the class has a really interesting topic, and I appreciated that we were allowed some freedom in how we engaged with it. It was so cool to go to west campus and get a close-up look at historical scientific instruments, and I appreciated the free range we had for final projects."

The course made me think about electromagnetism in interesting ways, but it felt like those thoughts didn't really go anywhere. I'd recommend this class if you want something chill without much reading or homework, and are organized enough to keep track of what is due and when. I'd mainly recommend to people already interested in the topic, though."
