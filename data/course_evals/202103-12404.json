            "comments": [
                "Weaknesses\r\nPoorly organized. It was frequently unclear what we needed to know and what we didn't need to know. Class was often unstructured and unclear. Psets frequently tested concepts not explained in class. The Psets were literally not graded.",
                "This course is the \"leminar\", meaning there is more interaction with the professor but no discussion section.  I found the lack of built-in supports challenging at times, and relied heavily on supplemental textbook reading to cement my understanding of concepts covered in class.  I think there was a peer tutor for this class, but they did not have office hours regularly.  This class could be improved by having more opportunities for support built into the class structure (e.g., more office hours, regular availability of peer tutors).  \r\n\r\nOtherwise, the class was structured in a clear and logical way and lectures were clear to follow.  The information we learned was really interesting, and I especially appreciated how conceptual models were applied to real-life situations throughout the course.",
                "Wonderful engaging lecturer and material applicable to the real-world problems",
                "The course is a great foundation for macroeconomics and the professor explains things very well. One minor improvement was that while the course listed the textbook as optional, the many quizzes on Canvas assigned really required the textbook for completion, or else the best you could do was a minorly-informed guess and check. Although the professor does not like everything in the book, I think it was a nicer text to have to accompany the lectures. My recommendation would just be to make it mandatory again. The other plausible option to me would be to make it optional and get rid of all the online quizzes (or make them not dependent on the book), but I prefer the former option.",
                "Because of the smaller class size, there was a lot more room for participation and discussion within the class. In general, the teaching was great and the class was very enjoyable!",
                "Strengths: prof Amand is a wonderful and engaging professor! weekly office hours, professor support\r\nWeaknesses: as all econ classes, operates on a relatively strict curve -- though this is no fault of the instructor",
                "The course was great  lectures were engaging and very clear, problem sets were reasonable, and a lot of office hours to support learning. I really loved the lectures where Professor Amand would teach us about situations from the non-U.S. perspective and about how current issues play out from the macroeconomics perspective.",
                "Overall a fine course. However, could be improved in a number of simple ways (imo).\r\nIf the professor continues to not use the book, change the answer explanations on the weekly quizzes so they don't refer to the book so much for explanations.\r\nMake sure that the quizzes aren't due before we've gone over the material on the quiz--while the quizzes are for completion only (so this inconsistency doesn't affect one's grade), it seems like one would get a lot more learning out of taking the quizzes if they were all due after the material has been covered.\r\nTry to get the graders to give somewhat more detailed feedback on the psets if possible (not too big a deal since the answer keys are posted).\r\nMake the exams more conceptually challenging instead of having the \"hard\" questions just be really niche. Seems like conceptual difficulty might be more important/a better metric for success in the course than remembering every detail of how, say, the financial crisis went down.",
                "Strengths: This course was wonderfully organized and Prof. Marnix's lectures were everything I would want from a Yale course. The class structure is basically like high school, and thats the kind of environment I thrived in so that was a plus. Also, the material was always engaging for me. \r\nWeaknesses: There are few, but I would've liked to have talked more about the financial crisis, specifically discussions/debates over TARP, ARRA, and QE. I remember it being presented in a way that left it as \"this is what paul krugman thinks, and this is what fox news would say\" (could've replaced fox news with someone like gregory mankiw, but ok). I think this was an area the students could've debated because that is something modern economists do.",
                "The problem sets were graded on completion, but we didnt get feedback on them, which made it hard to know if you really knew what was going on until exams came around.",
                "strengths: dynamic professor, seminar setting, ability to ask questions, problem set grading system\r\nweaknesses: lack of review of prior content later in the semester",
                "The strength of this course is that it engaging and super relevant. The nature of the courses encourages you to participate, and as a result, you learn a lot.",
                "Strengths: Material remained highly interesting and engaging through the whole course. Assignments being graded by effort greatly reduced stress, while midterm and exam still encouraged learning. Material also closely followed textbooks and readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture slides are unclear, was difficult to review topics covered in class that did not correspond exactly to a textbook section (for example AS/AD curves were done differently in class than in the textbook, but slides were insufficient for review)."

I think that the information covered is extremely applicable and important to understand when consuming news about debates around economic policy.  I might recommend taking the larger lecture version of the class, because there would be a discussion section, but the content covered was extremely interesting and applicable to life after the class.  I know that I will use what I learned in this class in the future, whether I pursue further Econ classes or not.",
                "Definitely, one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale",
                "I would recommend this course to someone relatively independent who is interested in macroeconomics and wants to engage with the professor during lecture. The advantage over the lecture is the ability to engage with questions, so if you have them and like that style of classroom engagement, great. If you are less likely to want to ask questions during class (as opposed to office hours), take the big lecture. You still get the material, plus you'll have discussion sections to practice more and clarify the issues. The value of the class size is really in the engagement during class. If that isn't something you see yourself wanting, the big lecture offers likely more support and structure.",
                "Yes! I learned a lot in this class, and I believe the smaller class setting really helped in facilitating learning and gave a more personal feel to the class.",
                "Yes! Professor Amand was fantastic, and his lectures plus the topics he covered were both interesting. The seminar was a great setting to learn macroeconomics in, and it's very useful for anyone who's interested in learning about how the economy works or about the economics part of current issues.",
                "A good course. I wonder if the lecture is better--I don't know since I didn't take it.",
                "Yes, Prof. Marnix is the goat. Macro is far more exciting that micro and feels a whole of a lot more relevant. Moreover, you should definitely want to take this class as a \"seminar\".",
                "Yes, if youre going to take intro macro, take this one! Marnix was an engaging professor and the class was fun.",
                "I would absolutely recommend ECON 111 to anyone seeking an understanding of macroeconomic principles. The seminar format is highly conducive to student engagement, and the course offers a great balance of theoretical and real-world material.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course because it is not super difficult, very fun, and incredibly relevant. Regardless of you discipline, you will have to engage in the economy as a consumer, and this course really sheds light on factors at play that people may otherwise be oblivious too.",
                "Absolutely, especially with Professor Amand. Highly enjoyed his teaching, and the class has definitely expanded my worldview in addition to the taught topics in macroeconomics."
