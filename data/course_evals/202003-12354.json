Most importantly, I realized the interdisciplinary nature of three seemingly very different fields of study.",
                "This class taught me how to look at the universe on the grander scale and to never stop questioning what is known versus what is not. It helped me learn parts of quantum mechanic theory at a basic level and applied this as a lens in conjunction with philosophy and novels.",

I learned that three seemingly distinct disciplines actually intersect much more than one would think and pursuing questions like \"Why does the world exist?\" can influence the way we approach everyday life. Also it's just really interesting to think about. This class is for anyone that wants to leave with more questions than answers :)",
                "With regards to knowledge, I learned primarily theories of the development of the cosmos. More importantly, this class helped develop my ability to connect similar thematic strings in different books to each other.",
                "Critical reading and thinking skills, knowledge of basic philosophical and quantum mechanical concepts, and reflections on my personal philosophy and approach to truth. I really enjoyed being able to discuss existential ideas with other likeminded peers, as well as hearing Prof. B's insights. Both the discussions and readings were key to getting the most out of the course.",

                "I think that the strength of the course is that it is very interdisciplinary in nature and is overall very engaging and interesting. I think that the writing can be a bit tough to earn decent grades on.",
                "The course is incredibly engaging in terms of material and the discussions that took place. The only difficulties I found were managing the paper-writing process of previous units while moving into the next unit's material in class and being fully awake at 9 am.",
                "This class is wonderful in the way it makes you think about the universe more than you ever might on your own. With that said, it can at times be overwhelming and a lot to try and understand, but with time it becomes easier.",
                "I could get away with saying absolutely anything in this class. People tossed around the word \"social construct\" like it makes any sentence, no matter how vapid, profound. This class, along with some experiences around campus, has discouraged me from pursuing a major in philosophy. There is so little rigor. If you prove you know big words, your idea will be entertained, regardless of how obviously absurd it is.\r\n\r\nI generally found the book selection interesting. Prof B is an extremely nice person and the feedback on the essays was unfailingly helpful.",
                "Exceedingly interesting and enjoyable text choices - examining big and exciting questions in a readable and engaging style\r\nVery effective discussion format, lots of opportunities for students to share their thoughts and react to others\r\nEssay tasks are well-spaced and class tasks are very helpful in planning for them",
                "Strengths: each member of discussion had something unique and interesting to contribute, the books were organized in a way that mixed up reading styles (it was great to read a light novel after something more philosophically heavy, and still be able to take away a lot of meaning from both of them), if the conversation ever died down, Prof. B. had questions and quotes from the text prepared that always sparked more discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there had been more opportunities to hear from the quieter members of the class. I also wish we had talked about our essays a little more or gotten to speak outside of class with people more, but that was likely just a result of the pandemic and not really meeting in person much.",
                "For strengths, I felt the books chosen were incredibly interesting and the discussions were natural and engaging. In terms of weaknesses, I would have appreciated a little more class time dedicated to writing advice, but Prof. B was always available outside of class for anyone with these kinds of questions. As for improvements, I wished we spent more time on post-structuralist theory, but Im sure there are a myriad of courses where anyone can dive deeper into the subject.",
                "The weaknesses were that we never did any peer review or looked over each other's work before or after submission. I felt that this weakened the course because it made it so that (especially since we were online) it felt as if each student was taking this course on their own when it came to assignments rather than reflecting off of each other and enhancing their ideas from the interactions that seemed so central to the rest of the course. The strengths were that the course encouraged student participation and during class time we were able to influence the direction the discussion went. Along with that, the topics this course covered were very interesting!"

                "I thought discussion actually worked surprisingly well in a zoom format. People were respectful if two people started to speak at once and had their mics on mute when they weren't speaking. I also liked how everyone had their cameras on during every class. I liked the idea of the discussion board post to increase engagement but I wish I had read other people's posts more often - they were pretty interesting.",
                "I felt that this class worked about as well in a virtual climate as I could have expected it to. I really cant give too much insight about improvements, but I can say that there are a lot of breakout rooms, and these allow for the best conversations!",
                "Since this course was a small group of students it was easy to converse online and hear each other's ideas despite being separated. We were able to utilize breakout rooms and screen sharing\/ sending documents to each other to our advantage. That said, since this class was so discussion based a lot of the organic conversations that arise when people are with each other in person were not able to take place because we were only talking to each other through a screen. This is an expected aspect of online learning, but it did make it so that there was less peer review or chances to build off of each other throughout the semester."

The course is exceedingly interesting and was my favorite class of the semester without question. In addition, the writing commentary I received from the professor will continue to benefit me throughout all of my years at Yale.",
                "Yes! This class is worth the intellectual challenge and benefits from it. It helped me begin to question what can ever really be known, allowed me to answer questions about the vast universe I never considered, and even taught me some of great foundation of quantum theory at a basic level. It is a great class, even if you do not know much about philosophy or physics to start. It also improved my argumentative writing quite a lot.",
                "No. Sometimes, there were interesting interchanges, but my perspectives on literature\/physics\/philosophy were hardly moved at all by this classa shame because my mind is certainly full of terrible ideas that would be debunked if more people were willing to disagree. I believe philosophy is important, which is not the impression I would expect one to get from this class.",

                "Yes I would recommend this course to other people because I loved the course content, the people involved, and how it improved my writing.",
                "Yes! I feel that this course is a fantastic introduction into writing, philosophical thinking, and literary criticism at Yale. Prof. B is incredibly friendly and will let you make of the course what you want. I would take it again if I could.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in any of the three disciplines(philosophy, literature, or science) this course is an amazing opportunity to expand that interests and see how it connects to the other fields through fundamental questions about the universe. There is a good range within the reading material, with some books being very easy to get through and other's being rather dense idea-wise, and class discussions are always helpful in dissecting the material. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the course, you're very free to focus on whatever idea stands out to you the most within a unit in discussions and papers, so I would recommend this course for anybody that wants to be able to create their own adventure.",
                "Yes. One thing to note about this course is that Prof B never teaches the exact same version of this course twice. I happened to be lucky enough that a course that perfectly fit my interests was offered during my first year. Even so, I would still highly recommend the next version of this course to next year's first years because it is the type of course that allows you to choose your own adventure and find something you are passionate about to focus on throughout the course."
