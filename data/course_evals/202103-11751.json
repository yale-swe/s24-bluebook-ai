We don't go into as much depth on individual authors or time periods because there is such a wide range of content.",
                "Strength of the class was the frequent office hours and feedback. Opportunity to do multiple drafts also helped.",
                "Strengths: Mr. Alaimo organized the course really well. He is passionate, which is a good thing. The course had some readings I really liked, too.\r\nWeakness: I would have liked to discuss the origin/implications of the alleged political divide between country and city. We did this a little, but ended up discussing way more the different portrayals of country and city life.",
                "I think this is a fantastic course overall. I might have liked it if we read less pieces, but went deeper in our analysis of all of them.",
                "I don't think there were weaknesses in this course besides the occasional silence in the classroom either from a lack of reading across students due to a busy week or just general shyness from starting the discussion. The selection of works throughout the semester was so interesting to read and I love that we got to even watch a film and read a couple of books. The reading was super manageable thanks to Marcus changing around the works we were reading a couple of times and the essays we wrote each had rough drafts which allowed for ample time to apply feedback from Marcus or from classmates. Overall, a really great way to get introduced to writing at college, a great way to improve your writing, and a great English class to read, discuss, and enjoy literature!",

                "Yes. Very helpful introduction to college essay writing, in an engaging seminar style.",
                "Yes, if they are in need of an introduction to higher academic writing with a really great teacher. If they had a lot of practice with this in high school, I wouldn't say a student would get very much out of this course in terms of new writing skills, though the content was interesting.",
                "Yes, it was helpful for writing papers, but make sure you're very interested in the country and the city before taking this class"
