I feel more comfortable listening to songs or watching Bollywood movies and though I don't understand much yet, after only level 1, I feel a strong foundation building in the language. I will say that this language is not the one at Yale you want to take if you want to get very good at a language very fast. You certainly learn Hindi, especially if you put in the effort instead of just scraping by, but this is a pretty chill class.",

                "Strengths: Very kind professors that make the class engaging\r\nWeaknesses: Lacked structure, felt a bit all over the place",
                "The professors are wonderful! They really care for the growth of their students. It is really such a fun and engaging class to learn a language in. The only main weakness of the course is that it can be disorganized at times.",
                "I did sometimes think this class had a bit too much busy work focusing on less helpful things when more review of concepts and in-class conversational practice would be helpful. With weekly quizzes, Thursday nights and Friday mornings often felt like cramming/catch-up time rather than the learning seeming distributed throughout the week.",
                "Strengths: Teachers are incredibly kind.\r\nWeakness: I feel their explanations of concepts could be better. Class doesn't feel clearly organized every day, so there is more need to rely on the textbook.\r\nI think we should use the vocabulary provided in the book for the weekly vocab quizzes instead of completely separate vocab lists.",
                "The strengths of the course are the kind instructors, the awesome classmates, and the fact that it meets everyday. These things really make the course.\r\n\r\nI'd say the biggest weakness of the course is the lack of structure. For the first half of the semester it was very difficult to understand what the main objectives were for class each day and each week. Both Swapna Ji and Savita Ji have a habit of just writing things on the board and teaching the class in a sort of stream of conscious manner, and that is not really helpful when you're trying to get a grasp on a new language. I t would be great if they could better place each assignment, homework, and quiz in context, that way we can really build up an effective toolkit and play a little more of an active role in the class."

Most people in class had some kind of south asian heritage, but there were a few students taking it purely out of interest unrelated to their background. The class vibes are great, it is really fun, and the Hindi department is very understanding and nurturing.",
