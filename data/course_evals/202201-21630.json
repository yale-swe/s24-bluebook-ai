I feel like I have a much richer understanding of the theory of operators and vector spaces and that will certainly help me more in more advanced courses which use a lot of techniques from linear algebra.",

However, I did not feel that the problem sets were particularly engaging or difficult. I felt I could have enhanced my understanding much more had there been more abstract theoretical problems on the problem set that required a bit more effort.",
                "The course turned out to be harder than I expected (since it is a 200-level course), sometimes I spend more hours on the weekly psets than the psets in my 300-level math courses. I also find the materials to be a bit too spread out. It seems I'm always learning new definitions. Even though the definitions and concepts are motivated, I find them overwhelming at times. However, the material is interesting. Towards the end, lots of concepts and big ideas come together and I feel quite enlightened.",

                "Lectures were well-structured and the topics moved fluidly between the main reference texts. They would be clearer if the goal of each lecture was more consistently stated at the beginning, though.\r\n\r\nProblem sets tended to be rather long, with several problems that were more mechanical than instructive on multiple problem sets. Problem sets could be reorganized; sometimes material from a class was needed/useful on a problem set due that very day.",

                "Strengths: Small class size\r\nWeaknesses: there was a deep divide between the students who knew everything already (or thought they did) and the students that were there to actually learn the material, no ULA, the homework was hell because it would sometimes be 12 questions with multiple parts adding up to 20+ parts in total (and in the proof based math world that is A LOT), no breaks for homework (we had an extra long pset over spring break) and there was homework due on the day of the first midterm and for the second midterm the homework was originally due the same day but the professor changed the due date to 3 days before the midterm (giving us less time in total for that pset)"

                "I would probably recommend this course to another student looking to study higher level math as I feel that it teaches a lot of valuable content not discussed in Math 225 or 226. The theory of multilinear forms, the spectral Theorem, the Jordan Canonical Form and the Tensor Algebra are very interesting concepts used in other advanced fields of mathematics and those are not usually discussed in other introductory Linear Algebra courses in as much depth as was discussed in this course.",

                "I would recommend it if they are interested in linear algebra. Linear algebra is not the most generalized field of math, but it is still really fascinating for those interested in it.",
                "Not unless it is taught by a different professor. This class made me feel so badly about myself that I had to reach out to a wellness specialist for help. I was very excited to take this course in the beginning of the semester, but it just continually got worse as the semester went on. The professor gave us no breaks on homework, and even gave us a longer pset over spring break because \"we had more time\". The exams were only 50 minutes long and the problems were not similar to things we had done on the psets. I felt like the lectures, psets, and tests were from three different classes. After the first midterm, multiple students in the class asked about a curve and the only thing the professor told us that he would not curve down. I also had to look up videos and read the book to even be able to start most of the homework."
