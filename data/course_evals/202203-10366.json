                "Learned a lot about the history of American politics from the New Deal coalition through the rise of the modern right. Also improved my skills of historical analysis and archival research.",
                "This course examines various themes in 20th century American history, beginning with the New Deal through the 1990s.",
                "After taking this course I have a much, much clearer understanding of the themes, trends, and key points of transitions during the 20th century. It was also a great course for developing the \"historian toolkit,\" and a good chunk of time was spent thinking about arguments, historiography, how to write history, etc.",
                "I learned an immense amount about the important factors that shaped American politics from the Great Depression to the Tea Party. Through readings and class discussions I learned about events and dynamics are often ignored or not widely known, but were vital in understanding political history.",
                "learned about the political developments that came to define what conservatism, liberalism and their policies entailed in the modern era, by studying different cities across the US in great detail",
                "This class was really a joy to take. I learned so much about the development of both political parties in the US and about how political movements fail and succeed. I also enjoyed the weekly readings and all of the class discussions.",
                "This class was a fantastic insight into American politics. I most learned how to do comprehensive research and how to properly pose historical questions.",
                "We studied 20th century US politics through the lens of place, which really helped me map different trends and ideologies across time as they developed. I also learned research skills through our final paper including navigating Yale's collections and searching other resources.",
                "I learned a lot about American history and politics from this course, and it was a really valuable learning experience. The class approaches 20th-century politics with a geographic lens, using a different region/city/area to study a different topic in politics (i.e. when we learned about the financial crisis in the 70s we looked at NYC's debt/bailout issues specifically). I loved this approach because it was a method of learning about a wider topic through the lens of a local population, so at some levels it felt like a \"double\" education (on local and national dynamics). The readings are all fantastically chosen and the final paper was really interesting to write."

                "This course is excellent, especially the unique way it travels from location to location as we study a series of political movements/developments. No weaknesses I can think of.",
                "One strength of the course is its location-based approach. Examining specific eras and themes through case studies of different locations across the country makes the material much more captivating and also allowed for connections to the present day. \r\nProf. Gage is also a really thoughtful professor who makes a point of not only introducing us to the topic of the course, but also to the process of history more generally through both research and autobiographical writing. \r\nI would have liked to discuss some aspects of the early 20th century (since the course started at the New Deal) but overall thought the variety of themes in the course was quite nice!",
                "Extremely well designed course--loved the \"roadmap\" structure where we focused on a different location every week, and I thought the readings were very well-chosen and insightful. Super coherent and the recurring themes came through very clearly.",
                "Each week having a different theme and focusing on a different part of the country was very effective. The readings were fantastic and very insightful. The course had a real focus on different aspects of the American electorate and everyday people. It could have gotten a bit more into the dynamics inside of Washington itself as those are also important, but it can be hard to find time for that with so much material to be covered.",
                "- the course had a fair bit of reading that was very interesting for the most part, but some weeks had significantly more content than the others, so I think that could be evened out a bit\r\n- the discussion posts before class forced me to do the reading so that was a plus\r\n- perhaps having some guiding questions before we did the reading (at the end of the previous class) could have been helpful instead of having those questions revealed at the beginning of the discussion",
                "The strengths of this course were its emphasis on place, the thoughtfully selected reading, the timeline of the final project, and the political autobiography.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gage is such a great professor - so smart, well-spoken, conducive to class discussion, thoughtful. She was great at ensuring that conversations stayed interesting and relevant but also that people got the chance to share the things they were thinking about the most. The class readings were chosen really well and I always enjoyed doing them. Also all the students in the class seem to really care about the course, which means people are actually paying attention and participating which made for more valuable seminar meetings. Also the political autobiography assignment is super interesting and will make you reflect on your life a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly can't really think of any. I would say there is a lot of reading and sometimes I felt like I had to skim, but that level of reading is explained/warned pretty clearly on the syllabus, which told us that it would be about/at least 4 hours of reading per week and I found that pretty true to my experience. You should be prepared to really dedicate yourself to this class -- at least in my experience and for most of the other people I talked to in the class, this was the course that I was most dedicated to during the semester and cared about the most. That's a reflection of how good/interesting/enjoyable of a class it is, but it's also a sign that it requires a lot of dedication so I wouldn't take it if you have a really difficult courseload in a semester -- you just won't be able to give the course as much as it deserves/demands."
