    "This course does a good job of ensuring youre on schedule for your thesis, especially given what a long process it is. It also gives you a lot more confidence about post-college plans because it gives you an open forum of peers to discuss and workshop any worries related to life after graduation.",
    "Very collaborative and welcoming environment, assignments and deadlines adjusted according to our group and individual needs. Some early assignments related to graduate school applications were not terribly relevant for me, but assignments of this nature were altered in later weeks which I appreciated."

    "If you're a ling major, you have to take this class to graduate, so yes I do recommend that. BUT also thank your lucky stars that this class exists ... all my friends in other majors were super jealous. You get so much guidance in your thesis that other majors don't benefit from.",
    "Of course you wouldnt be taking this course if you werent a linguistics major, but fret not: its a great class. Youll benefit from the camaraderie of the other seniors in your small major. Youll gain a support system. Youll learn how to take and give constructive criticism. Youll get to do a project on pretty much any linguistic topic you could imagine. This class is linguistics heaven."
