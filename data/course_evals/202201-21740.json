                "I learned how to dance in a classroom context for the first time. I learned so much about dance, not only techniques but also the artistic and conceptual aspects of dance.",
                "This course was amazing,  learned a lot about my own body, improved my dance\/freestyle, learned how to analyze dance. Frankly the course changed how I view my body, dance itself and the place dance has in my own life",
                "I learned how to authentically communicate my feelings through movements as well as learning simple beginner dance techniques.",
                "I have learned what it means to be a good storyteller in various forums, and was able to put that knowledge into practice and become a better storyteller myself.",
                "I learned a lot about alignment as well as a ton of incredible dance history like that of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater",
                "I was able to develop a better sense of my own body and how it moves through space. It was refreshing to have a dance course that was less focused on how I looked and more focused on how I feltit made a real difference in my quality of movement and it was wonderfully surprising to see how much better my movement looked when I actually felt comfortable."

                "The course is amazing. Just take it. No weakness. I love the professor, my classmates, the class contents, the readings, the films.",
                "Professor Robinson is wonderful. She's incredibly kind and understanding as a professor, and also incredibly inspiring as a dance teacher. Despite being unfamiliar with dancing, I've never felt like a fish out of water in the class because Professor Robinson has always taken extra care to make sure what is being taught can reach everyone.\r\nI do wish the course would be a little more accessible on Canvas. A lot of assignments were given verbally in class with no official notice on Canvas.",
                "Strengths: wonderful teacher, amazing movement exercises, lots of opportunities for engagement and personalization (i liked to freestyle so we incorporated that into class structure), you form strong bonds with classmates, and professor Robinson does a really good job of giving individual advice in movement practices\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only thing is that i wish we spent a little more time delving into other styles besides concert dance (and i think we spent a little to long on Aileys revelations)",
                "It could be improved only by eliminating the covid restrictions and allowing us to get the full experience. Hopefully that will be attainable for students in the future.",
                "This was my favorite course I have taken at Yale. Professor Robinson is the biggest strength of the course. She tailors content to be very open-ended, so students of all backgrounds can find a way to express themselves and directly connect with the material. We have dancers, visual artists, architects, all in one place, able to progress in our individual and collective journey to becoming better storytellers. There is nothing I would change about this course. The movement practice and readings are engaging, the guest lecturers are a breath of fresh air, and the course pushes students to merge intellectual thought on the arts with physical practice.",
                "Certain exercises at times could get repetitive",
                "I think that this course is best actually in the classroom. The readings and assignments are interesting but the meat of the course comes from actually being in the studio. I appreciated the in-class discussions but I honestly wish that we had spent even more of the class time on movement, perhaps spending more time with across-the-floor and combinations."

                "Yes! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Robinson is a wonderful teacher. I learned so much. Its truly a joy to take and you learn a lot while being good to your body\/mind.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a great way to start my day with movement.",
                "Absolutely. This was my favorite course at Yale. This is not a dance course, while it has dance practice in it. Embodying Story is a course for everyone to learn from. Even though Professor Robinson comes from a highly established dance background, she never expects anything from students other than being their best self. Embodying Story is truly about each students' individual journeys and progress in the forum of storytelling of their choice.",
                "Yes! Professor Robinson is wonderful and really wants to see her students feel comfortable in their bodies. It doesn't take up a lot of time outside of class to do the assignments and the class itself is such a welcome change from sitting in a classroom all day. It was really wonderful to be able to spend some time every week moving."
