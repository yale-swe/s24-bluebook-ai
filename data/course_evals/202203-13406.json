                "I could never say enough great things about Professor Schillinger and his course on Thucydides.  Professor Schillinger is a rare professor who cares so much about his students, about ideas, and about learning.  He approaches you and your ideas as an equal, reflecting on what you've said, helping you to say more, and ultimately, pushing you to think even more.  In this specific course, I've learned how to think about war's place in human society, about the philosophical issues arising from exercising democratic choice, and about the human's ability to influence events.  I've learned how to engage with an author across the whole of his work, paying attention to where he deviates from his own words.  In the end, I've reflected on how history appears to rhyme and how Thucydides--a man, a war, and a history from 2,400 years ago--still speaks to us, in modern relatable terms, today.",
                "Read thoroughly through all of Thucydides as well as a few secondary texts at the end of the semester. I think this course, more than any, has taught me how to approach a philosophical, or even literary work, and understand the author's intention. Thucydides does a lot--literature, history, philosophy--so reading him with such an excellent class and professor was very rewarding.",
                "I have improved my understanding of Thucydides and his themes, but the most powerful skill has been practice thinking about a complex text or idea, evaluating the different sides of a topic and presenting ideas.",
                "I learned SO MUCH by taking this course. Thucydides' work is such a treasure trove of political and rhetorical insight and Professor Schillinger knew exactly how to guide us through it. I learned how to glean theory from a work that presents its ideas subtly, how to write a lot on a very focused subject, and how to build off of others in a discussion section so that the whole class grows.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of the Peloponnesian War and the work of Thucydides. I improved my writing skills, particularly in close analysis of speeches, and I improved my ability to work through complex texts. This course also challenged some of my political philosophy and gave me a deeper appreciation of the value of understanding history.",
                "This course provided a deep dive into Thucydides, who I feel is one of the most perceptive and influential thinkers ever. While he's undoubtedly a historian, Thucydides is also full of political theory, from portraits of human nature to analyses of factionalism within a city. This course challenged me to interpret Thucydides for myself, and I found my views on the text constantly changing, which is the mark of a successful seminar. Much of Thucydides remains relevant today, and I feel capable of drawing connections between the Peloponnesian War and current events. Reading the entirety of the book also gave me a great overview of the course of the war itself, which I really enjoyed as a history buff."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are the professor himself--he is the greatest asset apart from the text we read.  His ability to lead discussions, inspire thought, and help facilitate his students' learning is unmatched.  Another strength of this course is the fact that we read a single work, which meant we could dive as deeply as possible into it.  There were no weaknesses in the course.",
                "Strengths:\r\nSchillinger was a very engaging teacher. The subject matter was really interesting. The other students were great.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nidk",
                "The biggest strengths of the course are the two instructors: Thucydides and professor Schillinger. With a great text and a great teacher to walk our class through it, this class really was quite great. The only weakness was that, because of the length of the text, it was sometimes challenging to stay on top of the reading.",
                "Great course. I loved having a discussion-based format that allowed everyone in the class to bounce ideas off each other.",
                "This course was very strong! The reading was manageable and engaging, discussions were always intriguing and covered what we had read, the essay prompts were stimulating, and Professor Schillinger knew the text inside and out! No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: great professor, great history and content, and very reasonable workload. Weakness: sometimes discussion moved too slowly or became too abstract/tangential to the history at hand.",
                "This was a great seminar, and there's little I would change. I would, however, replace Plato's Laches with a different text that's more directly relevant to Thucydides (honestly, I felt there were minimal connections between the two). Maybe the Symposium would've been a good option or another secondary text by a more modern scholar (I really enjoyed those)."

                "Yeah definitely. The learning to workload ratio was probably the highest of any course I've taken at Yale. Thucydides is also super interesting.",
                "There is something for everyone in Thucydides, whether you like politics, philosophy, literature, history, or just good stories and characters.",
                "Definitely would recommend to any student with an interest in political philosophy, history, or the Hellenic world",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Thucydides' work is brilliant and analyzing it as a work of political theory is a unique offering Yale's course catalog, distinct from the work of more modern thinkers. Discussions were enriching and Professor Schillinger is very knowledgeable and helpful.",
                "Yes, Thucydides' history is a key work for understanding human nature, politics, international affairs, and history itself. There is no better way to study it than with a great professor like Schillinger and with peers who will challenge your ideas.",
                "Definitely. I think anyone could get something out of this class, but especially those who are interested in classics, history, ethics, or political theory (almost any humanities major). It's also not that much reading."
