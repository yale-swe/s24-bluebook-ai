                "I've never taken a class like this before at Yaleone that directly engages with the New Haven community and that highlights the importance of public-facing projects. I loved how the class was structured: we first focused on the definition of a refugee, resettlement policies, archives, and refugee representation; the second half of the class focused on oral histories, which prepared us for the interview we would be doing with a New Haven refugee.  This class made me realize the complexity of refugee experiences and the complexity of representing refugee experiences. I also learned how to conduct an oral interview and transcription practices.",
                "learned about the refugee community in New Haven, about oral history and ethnography as methods, the ethics and process for conducting oral history interviews",
                "I developed insigts about Critical Refugee Studies. I learned interviewing skills and familiarized myself with interviewing. The most important skill I gained from this class was transcribing.",
                "I learned the history and art of oral history and transcription and also a bit about the history of refugees in New Haven. I learned how to be a sensitive interviewer and avoid common pitfalls and cliches of oral history.",
                "Oral history as a methodology, Refugee experiences and identity, Critical refugee studies and best practices when engaging in research with migrant and refugee communities.",
                "Value of qualitative methodologies (especially oral history), transcription processes, community engagement, refugee policy in the U.S., contemporary global issues, ethnographic skills, collaboration, interviewing",
                "Oral History write up, ethnographic reflectiom, transcribing oral histories, interviewing, flexibility and vulnerability with engaging in interview",
                "I learned so, so much in this course. I learned about oral history, ethnography, and participant observation as valid methods in the field of ethnic studies. I learned how to transcribe interviews and oral histories following oral history transcription guidelines. I learned how to properly and ethically conduct interviews and oral histories as well. Overall, I learned how to perform every single aspect that goes into an oral history as well as the tasks required post-interview. Genuinely, this is one of the few courses at Yale that gives you tangible skills that can equip you for a job in related fields or in this profession. Additionally, we also read about and workshopped these skills so that we were critically engaging with research on these methods.",
                "This class was so detailed and informative about the scene of refugee resettlement organizations in New Haven. We had direct engagement with these organizations and with refugees, the whole class was also geared towards learning about and working on oral histories, something that is so important with ER&M and I loved learning more about",
                "This is a great methodology course to take and provides a truly whole understanding of oral history methods -- its history, evolution, ethics, etc. -- and provides the unique opportunity of implementing it as well."

                "Strengths: readings were relevant to class themes, engaging, and to the point; class discussions were helpful in planning our oral history final projects; I appreciated the timeline for the final project - all the components of the oral history were spaced out so it felt like we had a lot of time to work on it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class could have been shorter - at times it felt like we had discussed everything we needed to, but we still dragged the conversation out for another hour or so which was less engaging",
                "strengths: just the premise, being able to produce something concrete that benefits and uplifts members of the New Haven community; structure of the course that builds towards final project",
                "The final project was the most meaningful experience I have had in a Yale class.",
                "This course was well structured and was clearly geared toward the final project. The readings were interesting and not overwhelming. We focused heavily on the oral history aspect and I wish there had been slightly more focus on the history of refugee communities in New Haven.",
                "It is rooted in praxis and effectively pushes students to interrogate dominant archives and our positionalities. I believe all Yale courses should have the same level of intentionality, praxis and reflection as this class. Highly recommend!!",
                "Strengths: Professor Tran is amazing, like sincerely an angel. The readings are so interesting; the final project is cool, and the work / class is so meaningful. 10/10.",
                "This course was fantastic. I have no improvements",
                "A strength of this course is that the midterm assignment is an oral history analysis that prepares us to start and complete our final project. During the midterm, we transcribe existing interviews, write summaries, compile tags, and answer reflection questions that will actually be archived in their respective archive or database. This then equips us to be able to transcribe our own interviews for the final project. In a similar vein, the midterm and final assignments are work that tangibly contributes to something, whether that be the Vietnamese in the Diaspora Digital Archive or even the field of ethnic studies or critical refugee studies and that is very cool. The way the class is structured every class is also a strength because we would have the opportunity to listen to our classmates, voice our concerns, workshop each other's preparations for our interviews, and to discuss readings.",
                "This class all worked towards the final project, which I know can be tricky to self-motivate, but the professor set internal deadlines that made this much easier, and the final project really was comprehensive and strong for the class"

This class taught me many valuable skills regarding oral interviews and ethnographic participant observation. The class is structured in a way that works up to the final oral history project, which I really appreciated.",

                "YEEESSS!! amazing class and prof. Tran is great!",
                "Absolutely! Yale needs more migration studies classes as well as more qual methods classes. This one is amazing. It brings you to interact with New Haven community members in such a special way, and you learn a lot about global issues and policy shortcomings through the lens of refugees. The readings are fantastic and the assignments keep you super engaged--your final project is conducting your own oral history interview.",
                "Yes! our learning is put to use in this course rather than just sitting idly in our minds; enables students to engage with NH as well",
                "Yes I would! This class really grounds a lot of ER&M work studied in a local site. Allows for people to interact with material that we read about.",
                "Absolutely! Everyone should engage more with New Haven and learn more about the great organizations doing refugee resettlement work there, but this was organized in the best way as well",
                "Absolutely. This is a wonderful and unique opportunity to learn the entirety of a methodology and practice it, learn about refugee (hi)stories in New Haven, and engage with this robust community as well. One of, if not the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale through the Oral History Project component. I genuinely made a friend for life with my interviewee and was able to gain so much knowledge that you simply cannot learn any other way than hearing about someone's entire life as you do through this project. An absolute must take class if you're interesting in this subject area at all."
