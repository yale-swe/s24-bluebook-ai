                "Overall, the course was great! However, my engagement was definitely higher for the first half than the second half. A major part of this probably has to do with the enrichment packets we received in the first half of the course. They allowed us to reflect on the content we learnt and easily identify our strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, we didn't really receive any enrichment packets for the second half, and with the content being a bit more complex and lectures having less structure in comparison to the first half of the course, I struggled with keeping up with the content. I also think having a TA for this course would be very helpful, since although we were able to collaborate together as a class, we sometimes reached dead ends.",
