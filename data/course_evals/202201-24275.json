                "I think the course was well led and the readings were interesting. The discussions were engaging and I feel that I learned a lot from the readings and the class discussions. The final paper was very open-ended so I got to explore a topic I was interested in that we hadn't gotten into. Naama was a great instructor and so eager to help. I think it was well paced and the assignments were reasonable.",
                "Strengths: the material was quite interesting! The readings were engaging, if very dense (they were all primarily legal readings, so this is unsurprising). I especially enjoyed it when the discussions intersected w/ other social sciences. Naama was also just a lovely person who did seem to care a lot about her students and always tried to find ways of improving her teaching and the course itself. \r\nWeaknesses: discussions were sometimes tough to sustain. This was especially the case at the beginning of the semester, and although it improved, the class size of 9 made sustaining them painful at times. The assignments could have also been better explained, but this was less of an issue in the latter half of the course.",
                "Strengths: the small size of the class makes you feel more comfortable and safe when speaking.\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes there were too many readings to keep up.",
                "I really appreciated that the readings were kept to a manageable length-- I was able to complete all of the readings before every class, which allowed me to be fully engaged in the discussions. Professor Omri was terrific at leading discussions; she encouraged us to think critically about everything that we read, and she was genuinely interested in our thoughts and ideas."

                "I would, but only if they were interested in the subject and willing to put in the time to do the readings. This class is one of those courses that if you skim by, discussions, papers, and overall everything will be painful, and you'll get nothing out of it. Since it's a college seminar it probably won't be offered again though",
