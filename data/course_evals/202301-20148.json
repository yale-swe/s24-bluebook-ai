I connected some of the concepts I had learned in ECON 116: Introductory Macroeconomics to economic development specifically. However, I was disappointed with the depth to which these concepts were covered: in many cases, it felt as though Approaches to international Development did not compare even to the depth reached in Introductory Macroeconomics, let alone ECON 122. Many concepts were covered only cursorily, and it feels as though the professor (who is new) should have received more support from other faculty in creating a useful course.",

                "Very little. Not much of the econ or stats material was new to me; most I had already learned in previous required global affairs classes such as JT's stats courses, the economics sequence, etc. I think the professor tried to incorporate a lot of Stata practice, but Data lab was not sufficient to actually master any Stata skills.",
                "This course taught me nothing new. All skills\/knowledge required i got from past courses (mostly AQAII & intermediate macro).",

                "I literally feel like this class was a repeat of Intro to Macroeconomics at best and a class that could've been taught in a single lecture at worst. I honestly have no idea why the class was structured the way it was. I have no idea what I learned.",

The entire course was dedicated to ways of measuring international development, rather than strategies to achieve it.",
                "Honestly, Im pretty disappointed. When I look at the topics, I dont think I really learned a lot. A lot of what we covered was review. Solow growth was covered in macro. Household surveys Ive covered in a variety of global classes. The gini coefficient I had learned about before. Migration we covered in microeconomics. The potential outcome model and Instrumental Variables we covered in econometrics. The Ricardian model was covered in Microeconomics.",

I also learned about numerous case studies and various econometrics models, such as instrumental variables and RDD. I also learned more about coding in Stata and making graphs and tables, as well as conducting independent research.",
                "This is a terrible course, I learned very little about international development, which was extremely disappointing. We seemed to focus more on quantitative economic models and random statistic theories than on actual facets of international development theory. This class also already covered a lot of material that we (global majors) have seen in AQA and intermediate macro, which made this class feel very dry and repetitive and it was also much taught worse."

            "comments": [
                "Lectures are engaging and informative",
                "It repeats certain topics from other classes.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hasanbasri is very organized and open to feedback, the organization helped me learn, the content at times was interesting, the TAs were GREAT\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We should not have had a final project and final exam (one or the other), we should have had a basic econ review at the start of this class (everyone is at different levels), Professor Hasanbasri fit too much into one lecture (it should have been spaced out more- though I am sure she did this as required by the Global department), WAY too econ\/data heavy (STATA should not play a huge role in the class)-- i wish we got to study more case studies on international development rather than focus on merging data\/coding, we did not have any psets for the second half of the semester which was a problem because aside from practice problems before the final exam we had no practice with the information we learned in lecture, homework\/attendance should be weighted heavier, data lab was useless\/we should not have had it (unless you want to learn to code more with STATA), ED discussion responses not really helpful (you don't usually get a straight answer)",
                "The course, again, features a very shallow overview of topics in development. Most topics are covered to a lesser extent than in the introductory economics sequence (particularly, Introductory Macroeconomics). All topics are covered to a much lesser extent than in Intermediate Macroeconomics. All Global Affairs majors have taken at least Introductory Macroeconomics and many were taking Intermediate Macroeconomics, ultimately making the class feel unfulfilling and disengaging. The organization of the topics, further, did not feel sequential or logical, but I imagine this follows in any course attempting to cover too wide a breadth at too shallow a depth.\r\n\r\nWhat I was looking for in this course was an intense coverage of the theory and literature in development. Certainly, the current literature was covered in class, but it felt as though the professor saw the pedagogical value as being merely methodological and not theoretical. This is the inverse of what should be: GLBL 225 fails to (and should fail to) reach the depths of methodology reached in Applied Quantitative Analysis I & II and that Global Affairs should further reach in their major-required methods course. Without having reached depths in development theory, how can methodology be expected to set in? If the course will not have weight in our methodological training, it should at least help connect what we have learned to advanced levels in our introductory and intermediate economics courses with an intense coverage of development theory. In not focusing on one of these, GLBL 225 ultimately left me without a substantive, cohesive collective of new knowledge and without a development upon prior knowledge which I might have associated solely with that course (an objective I think any course at Yale should have).\r\n\r\nThe course's ethic regarding student time, section, and workloads is also interesting. I do not mind a heavy-workload course such as AQA II, but GLBL 225 features: weekly or semi-weekly problem sets, required sections called \"Data Labs\" with associated required \"Data Labs\" that are de facto additional problem sets, a \"Data Project\" spanning the whole semester, a midterm, and final exam. I see the pedagogical value in sections as being a place to review and ask questions about lecture  not a place to teach completely new and separate material  and this is consistent with how well-established Yale courses treat sections (viz. GLBL 121-2, ECON 115-6, ECON 121-2). That should take place in a separate course.",
                "Weaknesses: I did not like that there was a final project AND a final exam back to back and both worth relatively high amounts of our grade. The final exam felt unnecessary, and the lack of problem sets after the midterm meant that we never practiced any of the material that was covered on the final. Additionally, topics that were barely covered in lecture were eligible to be tested on the final exam. Data labs were not helpful, as they usually tried to cover way too much material for the time allotted. At least two groups of students would always stay behind after discussion section because there had not been enough time to finish the data lab assignment for that day, and the TA could only help so many groups in the amount of class time.\r\n\r\nStrengths: I think that some of the topics are very interesting and I liked the short documentaries that we watched both for homework and in class.",
                "The professor needs to be changed. I have never had such a low engagement with a course during my time at Yale.",
                "Strengths - well-rounded approach to development, solid theory, good design\/curriculum. Weaknesses - pacing (almost no work for the first half of the semester and then a massive project during the second half), ineffective section\/data lab",
                "Weaknesses: I dont feel like I know the basics of development. I feel like we only focused on niche case studies that didnt rly have anything to do with the course.",
                "Weaknesses: Too much stats and econometrics",
                "Strengths: It wasn't particularly hard, Ardina and the TAs were incredibly nice and I think really tried to make the experience as ascertainable as possible\r\nWeaknesses: This class definitely needs to be reworked slightly. The general flow doesn't make a ton of sense. It's essentially macro with a couple of case studies and a lot of Stata. I wish we had talked more about the theories behind development, what's worked, and what hasn't than focusing on big thematic macro concepts",
                "The class was all structured around case studies that were only tangentially relevant to what we were learning. At times it fluctuated between incredibly simple (re-doing the Ricardian model or Solow) or way too complex for skills that we don't need. The sections were not helpful with course material and always went 30 minutes over, which is a testament to the poor structure of the class. There was also no reason to have both a final exam and a final project, and just contributed to the busy-work feeling of the entire semester.",
                "Strengths: The case studies were all very interesting. It was extremely helpful to go over the key findings and experimental design in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not feel like I learned that much from the section (they felt a bit too long). The lectures sometimes jumped topics and it would have been easier to conceptualize if they were organized more clearly. Most importantly, I think we should have spent more time on econometrics topics. Things like the Dr. Strange lecture were difficult to understand and deserved more time than the lecture where we debated international trade.",
                "I think the course did a great job of covering a lot of concepts at a very accessible level. I think that the \"data lab\" was really unnecessary -- especially for students with a ton of coding experience, it's really unreasonable to have to sit and listen to someone teach you to do something that you could've done in 2 minutes otherwise. From my experience, even the students who didn't have experience weren't paying attention because the data labs were just the TA talking for 40 minutes and then giving the exact answers, which everyone copied down and submitted in the last 5 mins.",
                "Too much stata\/coding in this class. The AQA sequence, I thought, was meant to prepare us for the stata we would need to use in the major, but the stata we learned in this course was NOT taught during AQA.",
                "The slides and lectures were concerningly badly made",
                "The course's strength lay primarily in Professor Hasanbasri. She was an incredible resource for clear and concise explanations of the material covered by the class and went to great lengths to ensure students' needs were met.",
                "The strength is that it provides interesting application of general economic concepts to the specific situation of development. The main weakness is that this course is trying to be many things at once. It is at once an econ course, a stats course, and a coding course. It is hard to study for exams, because you don't know which part of the course you should study for.",
                "Data lab sections very informative with Stata commands. Not so much practice with class material in problem sets, though.",
                "The course was really poorly organized and lectures were really hard to follow",
                "I think a final project and final exam is a little much. I honestly think it would be better to have like weekly mini psets that are a little more challenging than a final project. The psets could include a problem then ask us to code and analysis a smaller portion or something.",
                "This course is incredibly redundant. Nearly single concept has been explored in AQA and Intro Macro to some capacity, yet this class is hard because the grading is nitpicky and directions and questions are often not clear. The prof is knowledgeable but it was difficult to engage because lectures were dry.",
                "The main weakness of this class is that is structured as such a hodge-podge of topics. Theres really no sense of curriculum, and honestly I found the course to be so heavily focused on research design and methodology rather than actual development policy (this is a larger problem with the Jackson core). Also, because there was so much emphasis on Stata (data lab was always so confusing and I was consistently leaving 20 minutes after my section time ended which was not okay) we ended up not having any time to engage with the actual lecture content (which is what the exams were both based on 60% of our grade). Instead, our discussion section was data lab and our problem sets were basically all just check points for our data project.",
                "With all due respect to Professor Hasanbasri, who is a very kind and approachable professor and person for whom I have a lot of respect, this was one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. Instead of teaching us international development, this course skims some economics in a confusing and roundabout way, focuses lectures on specific papers rather than big picture ideas, dwells on hyper-specific models and coding skills, devotes sections not to critical discussion but to esoteric Stata lessons, and only in rare cases covers actual international development. We didn't discuss the history of the debt crisis, the Washington Consensus, the IMF, the pros and cons of World Bank actions, theories of dependence--none of that. This is a quantitative econ course--and a confusing one at that. I would not recommend the Global Affairs major without warning somebody about it. One plus was that they spread out the data project--I appreciated not having to cram all of it.",
                "I thought that the course was nice but as someone super interested in global development and health, I felt the course didn't really leave me feeling like I learned something. The structure of the class was more STATA-oriented which was good in the sense of having a tangible skill to implement, but I wish we discussed policies and current events more - it didn't really feel like a GLOBAL class. I thought a strength was the TAs, they were super kind and helpful, but I just didn't feel like I learned what I expected to, and I thought especially after spring break we didn't really have a direction for the course to go in  we simply just looked at recent regression analysis in the field and random results in development economics, without really understanding the thread tying it together. I kind of understood the point of the order of the papers after going over them with the professor, but otherwise, having both a final project and final exam was a lot for one course. I felt I couldn't really devote the necessary time for the final project and on something I was really interested in.",
                "Weaknesses: Lectures not engaging; slides not engaging and do not provide adequate information; distribution of work poorly planned; PSETs do not help in learning the material; The final project took way too long to complete and since it was due days before the final exam, there was not sufficient time to complete the project and properly prepare for the exam; The exams are very specific and many of it tests knowledge of econ skills and not development; Did not feel like an international development course as much of the emphasis was on econ theories",
                "Lecture attendance could get messy sometimes (wi-fi was not working sometimes) and by the end of semester there were no more checks",
                "I think this course did a good job giving us practical tools to pursue development work from an econ perspective. The first semester was very cohesive, and the psets helped us get a handle on the material. A weakness for this course was the organization of the second half of the semester (post-midterm). Our psets were related to our final project, rather than the material, so the course content did not feel as cohesive, and, until I studied the practice exams for the final, I didn't have a good grip on applying the concepts. I also would have appreciated more development theory \/ seminal papers. As global majors, we all have to have an econ background through the core, so many of the econ concepts I had seen before. However, I do not know development concepts as well and would have benefited from getting a better theoretical background.",
                "I think this course should be a pre-req for macro classes, because much of the material would have been very helpful prior to macro, but felt very repetitive after.",
                "The course is very clear and the slides are effective. In the beginning half of the course, it was a little difficult to see exactly how everything tied together. It did in the end, but I think it could be emphasized more in the beginning.",
                "Better structure, honestly just having people take other classes and skip this one",
                "I thought that the TAs couldve been a bit more hands-on in the data labs, but still, I gained a lot from them!",
                "The main strength of this course is how problem sets were designed to ensure incremental work on the final project. With regards to weaknesses, the course did not appropriately address major themes and theories related to \"approaches to international development\", but felt more like a crossover between a data course and introductory microeconomics  which all students taking this course are required to take as per the Global Affairs requirements. The course was too focused on studies and quantitative data, and did not engage with topics like the Washington Consensus or Asian approaches to development through the BRI.",
                "International development is a critical topic, and I was really disappointed that this class boiled it down to an assessment of research methods and stata syntax rather than an analysis of the issues themselves and how to solve them. \r\n\r\n-There were typos in nearly every exam, assignment, and slide deck- significant typos that changed the meaning of the question- eg. lower instead of higher, \"did impact\" vs \"did not impact\", etc.\r\n-The first exam was a very poor assessment of course knowledge, given the extensive length (most students came nowhere near to finishing, so grades were just a metric of how fast you worked\/how few questions you left blank) and odd content that did not reflect the materials. The final exam was much better- both in terms of timing and content.\r\n-Most of the class and \"data labs\" focused on stata syntax, which we all have learnt (or will learn) in AQA. Most of the economics was material we learnt in the required economics sequence. The research methods were interesting, but pointless without a broader discussion of the issues, and misplaced when we have a research methods requirement. Moreover, the vast majority of global students are not going into academia, so while being literate in research methods is important, it is not nearly as important as having a basic grasp on how we are going to pull nearly a billion people out of poverty over the next few years while simultaneously achieving a massive energy transition.\r\n-The data labs were awful- no-one in my section knew what was going on or engaged with the material even vaguely, because it felt completely irrelevent. We spent weeks learning how to merge data in one specific software tool (not even R, which most of the world uses) instead of discussing international development. I would have loved to be able to discuss the big ideas and learn from my classmates in a real discussion section.\r\n\r\nOverall, this would be a fine course on its own, but it made no sense as a core global requirement. We covered no policy (beyond brainstorming surface-level ideas on our own), which is what most students in the major are going on to study. The quantitative approaches would have been interesting if they were not repeats from the economics, statistics, and methods requirements that everyone already has to take for global. Moreover, it is not made clear in our transcripts or the course descriptions that is was a quantitative class.\r\n\r\nThis class would be greatly improved if the focus was shifted to study policy and aid interventions. Please bring in history and current events and political theory and move the course away from the minutia of coding in stata!\r\n\r\nWith all that being said, I really appreciated how kind and supportive the professor was. The problem is with the course and with the global major, not with her.",
                "Strengths: I really appreciated when we looked at Case Studies. I also thought the lessons on inequality and the Lorenz curve were successful and important. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are a lot of questions I had that I wish this course would have answered. I wish it took a more detailed look at practitioners in the development space. For the Potential Outcome Model, I would use a real world example instead of Dr. Strange. In some of my other classes, like Econometrics, all the data and examples we used were from the real world. I thought this helped us learn about the world and understand when and how certain tools are used by practitioners. In this class, students were able to get by without doing the readings. I think it would be helpful to add a book, but not a textbook, to the syllabus.\r\n\r\nI think a lot of the weaknesses of this class stem from its disconnection to the other global classes. I dont entirely blame Ardina for this, as the course is new, but I think it would help to know what students have and have not studied before taking this class. \r\n\r\nAs Global Affairs majors, all students in International Development have taken intro micro and macro economics, an additional intermediate economics class, and one or two statistical analysis classes. For this reason a lot of what we discussed had already been covered in other classes, and I think could be cut or covered much quicker. All students have studied the Solow Growth Model, the Ricardian Trade Model, and the effects of immigration on wages. Students with an econometrics background have seen the Potential Outcome Model, Regression Discontinuity Design, and Instrumental Variables before. \r\n\r\nThis is how I would reorganize the course:\r\nUnit 1 - What is Development?\r\n\tQuestions: What is Poverty? What is inequality?\r\n\tModels\/Topics: Solow Growth Model, Lorenz Curve, Convergence.\r\n\r\nUnit 2 - Who are the Development Players? Who is trying to reduce poverty and inequality?\r\n\tQuestions: What do these organizations do? What are their mandates? How do they differ? In what ways are they effective? In what ways are they controversial?\r\n\tTopics: IMF, WB, USAID, NGOs, UN\r\n\r\nUnit 3 - Measuring Success. What do Development Players do to address poverty and inequality?\r\n\tQuestions: What are the advantages to using different statistical tools in different scenarios? Disadvantages?\r\n\tTopics: Surveys, Potential Outcome Model, RDD, IV\r\n\r\nUnit 4 - Case Studies. \r\n\tExamine cases of different Development Players using different strategies. How are they performing? When are development efforts successful and when do they fail?",
                "This course covers a wide range of topics and provides numerous case studies for us to understand how the theories proposed have been tested in the past. It also taught me a lot of new Stata commands that have been really useful in other cases. One weakness of the course is that it was at times slightly unengaging or disorganized. Whereas some lectures were really interesting, others seemed to have less relatable content and were harder to follow. It did not help that it was also at 9 am. Sections also frequently ran over, so I wish they were better timed to ensure we could cover all the material we had to cover in the allotted time.",
                "Strengths: Bomi was such a wonderful TA and always willing to meet and answer questions during section\/office hours! We will miss you Bomi! At least the professor gives practice problems before the exam, although they were usually filled with mistakes and extremely confusing wording.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The professor was extremely dry and unhelpful, and very unresponsive to feedback on the course. The labs (discussion sections) are completely pointless, meant to teach us coding in STATA but are extremely ineffective because there is 1) little relevance to the class material 2) no time to actually practice what the code means because we are trying to write all of the code down as fast as we can since she plans too much to be accomplished in a 50 min. section. Also, the sections usually ran 15+ minutes over because no one could complete the labs in time. The problem sets added no no value because they were graded on completion usually, which meant that people submitted whatever they had even if it was extremely wrong. The exams as I mentioned had such confusing and terrible wording that it is hard to understand what was being tested sometimes, and also included questions about STATA code\/syntax which is ridiculous. On this note, the material was at times extremely repetitive, covering material from AQA sequence and ECON 122. The final group project was also subjectively graded on a curve, with only the top 3 groups receiving full marks, and the rest of the groups being sorted into tiers. There was no rubric, so there is no way to tell what\/how you got graded down on. Overall, this course turned me off from learning more about development and left me feeling extremely disappointed."

The Department of Global Affairs should intervene either by allowing the course requirement to be waved with Intermediate Macroeconomics (which covers the topics at a much greater depth even if not taught in terms of development) or by intensely restructuring the course to provide the depth of theoretical exploration Global Affairs students want and are left searching elsewhere to receive.",
                "yes",

                "No, the only reason I took this course was because it was a Global Affairs prerequisite course. I had heard from other students how and this course was and they were correct.",
                "No, but it's required. I don't think a single person woke up in the morning and thought \"I want to go to Approaches to International Development today\" in the entire course of the semester. The professor tried so hard to make this a good class, but personally I'm guessing she had almost no support from the Jackson school and had to make everything up as she went. How can you expect anyone with no experience to be able to create something perfect from the ground up and with no support? Also, the cold calling in this class was miserable. I've been in classes where cold calling felt pretty random and not too intimidating, and this was not one. I dreaded every day of this class because of the absolutely humiliating cold calling.",

                "It's a requirement.",
                "If this weren't a core class to the Global Major, I would really recommend against taking this class. I think students are better off listening to a podcast on Economics and they would learn more faster.",
                "Yes. I think with time and a few tweaks, this course will be really helpful for those in the GLBL major.",
                "If you're a global major, you have to take it. I think it could be helpful for people interested in macroeconomics and development.",

                "I would only take this class if you are a global affairs major. I think it suits the major.",

                "Not unless required in its current form.",
                "This is a requirement, but honestly this class made me regret majoring in global affairs at times. I didnt find the material generative or insightful, and there is a lot of work with little payoff because the exams are weighted so heavily.",
                "No, but its mandatory for Global majors. Its sad that the Global core (Security and Development) are such weak courses. I really hope that Jackson overhauls these classes in the future.",
                "Absolutely not, for reasons above.",
                "I think that the course is necessary for the major, but the GLBL department has been finding issues replacing instructors and finding someone to teach this core course that grasps what about international development we need to learn\/know. I think I learned valuable STATA for research, but that R and Python are commonly used languages instead. Finally, I just think the structure in general could be more well thought out and that we need to understand as GLBL majors what are the core courses in the major striving to teach. I feel like I haven't come away with a fundamental understanding of international development that I need. However, I do appreciate that the course taught me about research in international development, even if this research was more economics-focused, and that now I understand basic methods like RDD and calculating average treatment effect through a Potential Outcome Model.",
                "No but since its a required class for GLBL majors, please get a better professor",
                "It's required so you don't have much of a choice but this course was significantly better than International Security, so much more organized and the professor was very engaged.",
                "I recommend this course if you are looking for an econ approach to developmentthis would be a great class to supplement Intermediate Macro.",
                "Yes, you learn new econometrics methods that are important as well as big picture development ideas.",
                "- not unless they are a global affairs major\r\n- the course was very informative in how to approach econometrics, papers and various studies",
                "Youre required to take it as a Global Affairs major. I assume if you like economics\/developmental economics, this is a class that is light but valuable for you to enjoy.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone not in the Global Affairs major. Global Affairs majors  I would recommend you take AQA and intermediate macroeconomics before taking this class, as you will have a real advantage over those that have not.",
                "The vast majority of students have to take this for the global major. Anyone else who is considering it needs to know that it is a quantitative class. This course needs to be renamed to Development Economics and Research Methods- it is NOT an international development course.",
                "As currently organized, I would not recommend this course. I think it left me with many questions unanswered. I wish I learned more about (1) What development is, (2) Who is trying to do development, (3) What they are doing, and (4) how successful they are.",
                "This course is a major requirement, but I think it does a satisfactory job at introducing Global Affairs students to international development. It could certainly cover some topics more in depth, but for the first time it was taught by Ardina I think it was pretty good.",
                "I strongly strongly do not recommend this course, unless you are a global major in which case you are forced to take it. Considering that this is one of the core courses of the Global major and we had a new instructor, I was surprised that no one from the department bothered to sit in on a class. If they had, they would have found that what we were promised in terms of a new international development professor is not what we got. Coming off of international security, I was excited to learn more about development theories, but instead we focused so heavily on quantitative models and random statistic theories that I was severely disappointed. Lectures are not worth your time honestly you could probably skip or not pay attention\/just review the slides on your own and still get the same (bad) grade. The grading is on an arbitrary curve, with no insight into the grade distributions. The professor cold calls, so be prepared to answer random questions that are barely related to the material. The professor is also extremely unresponsive to class feedback, and didn't even address the midterm feedback we provided in the middle of the semester. The exams test random STATA code questions as well as questions related to like one minor slide from the lectures. Also, the wording of the exams is also horribly confusing so it is difficult to even understand what it is trying to test. If you want to really learn international development theory, your time would definitely be better suited elsewhere, perhaps in an econ seminar. Jackson completely flopped on this class, I don't understand why they can't find a good professor."
