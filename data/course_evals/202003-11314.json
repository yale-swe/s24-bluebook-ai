                "Strength: engaging section, interesting lectures (most of the time), and good assessment structure: 24hr midterm, paper, 24hr final (grades well distributed) \r\n \r\nWeakness: Might be good to mandate attendance at one lecture a week to increase engagement. It was easy to get behind by not watching the lectures on schedule.",
                "At the end of the course, you end up with a really clear picture of how we've ended up in this current medical moment. The lectures are engaging and the curriculum is well thought out. I do wish that there were more secondary source readings, the primary sources were great but I didn't really know what to do with them sometimes.",
                "The strength of the course is in Professor Warner and the teaching team. I learned so much throughout the course, which I am sure I will use later on in my life. Anyone could learn the material and really enjoy it. There was emphasis on large themes and analysis on specific events. The suggestion provided to create a timeline significantly helped. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "this was a great class all around! i learned a lot!",
                "I cannot say it more--this class is AMAZING. From the content involved, to the way Professor Warner presented material, to the interesting readings that made me WANT to read, this class is everything a humanities class should be. The one thing that could be improved could be having conference sessions with the TFs for a first draft of the final paper, since we were just asked to do a proposal and then follow a rubric.",
                "The course is a survey course that covers thousands of years in modernity, but Professor Warner is a gem at highlighting the movements in a way that is not confusing, goes into some depth, but also stays on pace.\r\n\r\nThe course started off with reasonable amounts of reading but it became a bit ridiculous around Week 7, when the reading load per week ended up being triple what it had been in any week from Week 1 through Week 6. Also, there should have been more transparency as to how the midterm (and final) exam would be graded, since stylistics were not something that I and a few other students thought would be considered, but we ended up getting docked off for this on the midterm. In addition, while it is useful to dive into texts that don't necessarily relate to the week's topics, it would be helpful if the primary literature assigned for the week actually aligned from the same time period or perhaps even themes as discussed in the lectures.",
                "strength - super interesting content, learned a lot, sharpened up my writing skills\r\n\r\nweaknesses - I think some of the readings became a little redundant which made it a bit monotonous. I also would like more section options if possible\/earlier on during the day.",
                "The strengths of this course were the lectures! A weakness was the amount of reading; it was usually too much for me to get done in a week but also too much for us to discuss in section anyway.",

                "While the lecture material was interesting, it was often read out by Professor Warner on a backdrop of painting\/photograph slides. There wasn't any notes or text to follow the lecture with, so it was hard to retain information.",
                "Strengths were the professor and the TAs -- they are all very knowledgeable and passionate about the material, which helps student learning. It was very well organized too. No weaknesses",
                "The teaching team--especially Professor Warner--cared so much about supporting students and engaging in a way that was meaningful. Course content was always well curated, thoughtful, and clear. I left each class thinking about something new.",
                "Strengths: Really interesting material, engaging lecture style, great job at condensing the many facts and figures of Western medicine into one semester while still focusing us in on the most important themes \r\n\r\nWeakness: Grades and discussion section experience felt very TA-dependent",
                "Professor Warner is an excellent lecturer, even during a period of virtual learning. The course's lectures were very easy to follow, and the incorporation of primary sources and images were a wise addition to the lectures. Another strength of the course was its use of video clips and news broadcasts from different time periods to reinforce the material being taught.",

But, the professor rarely stopped to ask if there were any questions, and no students wrote anything in the Zoom chat because they had not been addressed in Week 1\/2. Thus, there was no room for dialogue with the professor and no time to ask clarifying questions, which could have been a major asset to the course especially given the lack of interpersonal interaction during the pandemic.",

I especially loved how Professor Warner engaged the material with the social context of each historical era. Also, his during the minutes before class, his pug would make an appearance and honestly 10\/10 worth taking the class to see his dog on camera!",

Although it does only cover Western medicine, it is what is most relevant to us here in the U.S. and I found it to be super helpful in putting medicine in context. Definitely worth it to take if you are a pre-med.",
                "Take this course if you are genuinely interested in medicine and\/or public health as a future profession. But, do not take this course if you are looking for an easy A. The workload is light and the TAs seem nice, but unfortunately there isn't very much transparency with respect to exam grading and it seems fairly arbitrary where you land on the A, A-, B+, B scale.",
                "yes I would! great HSHM elective choice, useful and interesting content to contextualize other classes.",
                "Yes! Especially a pre-med student, although I think everyone could benefit from learning more about the cultures of Western Medicine, especially during a pandemic.",
                "Yes the professors and TAs are all great",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another person! This was an incredibly enjoyable course.",
                "Yes absolutely! I love Professor Warner. I actually took this class partly because I loved his other course Media and Medicine so much. I would suggest that course because I think its very engaging and the material is fascinating. It is very cool to learn how we arrived at our current medical system.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about the evolution of the medical profession over different years, places, and cultures.",
                "YES!! Such a good course that all students who wish to understand the intersection of medicine, history, and social structures should take. Professor Warner made me look forward to coming to every lecture with his level of knowledge, engagement, thoughtfulness, and guest appearances of his puppy! Workload was also super manageable.",
                "Yes, especially anyone looking to go into medicine. We learned not just historical facts, but also deeper themes and patterns that pushed us to challenge the way things are today.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I believe this course teaches critical knowledge that every college student should learn about at some point. The course covered American history topics such as the Tuskegee Experiment and the AIDS Epidemic, which provide critical lessons about public health and policy for the future.",
                "Yes! Professor Warner is amazing and you learn very important history.",
                "Yes! It was a very interesting class.",
                "Yes!!! Amazing and I came away with so much knowledge about medicine's history.",
                "If you are interested in the history of medicine and public health and the forces that shaped our modern medical knowledge and institutions, then absolutely! Great class for those interested in public health and pre-med students; gives great perspective on modern medical practices which is very useful for those who want to enter the medical profession.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course, it was very interesting and the teaching staff was very kind and always willing to help.",
                "Would highly recommend this course to those interested in history and health.",
                "Yes! This course has something for everyone. I was amazed by how many aspects of life the material in this class touched on, far beyond the reach of what I thought medicine was before.",
                "Yes, Professor Warner is lovely and the course is pretty interesting."
