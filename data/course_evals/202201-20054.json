                "I learned how to think critically about social issues such as family, power kinship etc. I also learned how to conduct ethnographies in real world settings. I increased my writing abilities and improved my ability to absorb large amounts of information via lecture environments.",
                "A very strong base in ethnographic research, the foundations of anthropology, and so many fascinating topics we covered in lectures, readings, and section meetings.",
                "During this course I gained a working knowledge of anthropology and what an anthropologist would typically study. This course gave me a lot of insight surrounding my perception of everyday rituals, symbols or tasks that I take for granted. It has taught me to be a lot more open about what I consider to be \"normal\" particularly when observing other cultures or societies.",
                "A solid survey of cultural anthropology as a discipline, and an understanding of how ethnographic research is carried out. I learned about fieldwork fellowships, sociology to some degree, and how to think about human interpersonal interactions with an analytical lens.",
                "I really liked learning about the cultural aspect of anthropology. I learned how to employ different research techniques like participant observation.",

                "I think this class was a great intro to anthropology. It is taught at the beginner level, but our reedings also get very in-depth and interesting.",
                "studying the unique complexities within communities is interesting and useful",
                "I learned all of the building blocks of Anthropology. I learned how to write an anthropological proposal and the rules surrounding ethical anthropological research.",

                "I learned about the aspects of cultural anthropology. It was an intro course about different types of cultural anthropology, and examples surrounding them.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Super interesting material! Everything we learned about felt very relevant. Also, the no-laptop policy was frustrating at the beginning of the term, but I actually didn't end up minding it (although I'm still a believer that in college, students should be allowed to choose the best note-taking method for them)\r\nWeaknesses: It felt like there were a lot of ethnographic assignments given that we also had two exams, especially since the assignments would sometimes be due the same week that there was a test. There was also too much reading assigned and I usually couldn't do all of it.",
                "The readings for this course were very interesting to complete, however the majority were not actually necessary and could be boiled down to a single sentence takeaway for exams. This was especially the case for the three books assigned as required reading; While they were very interesting reads they were discussed for less than 20 minutes in lecture and briefly in section. I think it would have been more valuable to reduce the number of required readings and look at key authors and concepts more deeply, however as an introductory course, I did feel I got a general understanding of the field of sociocultural anthropology.",
                "the in class lecture was nice but the readings were long and usually bland.",
                "Strengths: Not very stressful. Very interesting lectures. Professor was very engaged with students and loved to speak with students and discuss ideas while learning about new topics. Highly detailed slides and always provided additional resources to enrich student understanding with material. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness: Not a large variety of  project types. It was kind of like lecture ethnography then midterm. Perhaps a longer term project incorporating or at least allowing room for different mediums of documentation: film, spoken, live interviews etc could provide another dimension to anthropological work.",
                "I think the course curriculum flowed very well in terms of introducing the field of anthropology and then moving into more specific areas of cultural anthropology work.",
                "A lot of times, the readings were a bit too long for me to get through all of them while balancing other classes, and I know other students felt similarly. Especially when it came to the couple readings that included a whole book over a weekend.",
                "For strengths, I enjoyed that this class had a discussion section where I felt that I could express any comments or concerns with the material. I enjoyed closely working with my peers in this setting and going over what we learned in lecture. I also appreciate that the course focused more on small projects rather than assessments. I feel like this was a more efficient way for me to demonstrate what I had learned and gave me the opportunity to apply it in a more meaningful way.\r\n\r\nFor weaknesses, I wish the lectures connected to the readings a little more. I often felt that I would complete the readings and have questions, but the lecture would be on a different topic or would not reinforce what we had read the days before.",
                "The lecture for this course left a lot to be desired. Specifically, the lecture slides were often barely tangentially related to the unit at hand, and I felt like there was a lack of tying readings into what was covered in class. Some (often, lengthy) readings felt very unrelated to learning concepts relevant to the course. I don't think this course gives students enough to decide whether or not they would want to go into anthropology. For those really interested in taking anthropology or other social sciences seriously, this is not the course to take.",
                "I think that the lecture could relate a bit more directly to some of the reading.",
                "The class was well structured but having a 1:15 class at 9am is a weakness because inherently attendance will be low which makes the class experience worse.",
                "All around was a great course! However, the readings were sometime a bit too intensive. And, being that the 5 ethnographic assignments were 2-3 pages \"single spaced\" and not double spaced, those too were a bit arduous when combined with the readings and exams.",
                "I think this class is just a little too big. Professor Lombards teaching style would really shine though better if this class was two or three sections of 20-30 students. Classroom engagement is harder in such a big group.",
                "Strengths: some topics are pretty interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: I think it will be better if the professor could give more examples or share more of her personal experiences in the lecture. And it will be better if discussion sections can be made to be more interactive.",
                "One strength that I benefitted from what the style in which the professor structured class. She spent most of the class either speaking or asking about questions we might have. I feel like I retained more through this method over just copying what was on the slide behind her.",
                "I enjoyed the assignments where we were able to practice the methods we learned in class. It helped solidify the class material",
                "I enjoyed the videos shown in class. I would have liked more of a solid course outline on the subjects.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- organized\r\n- the material varied\r\n- clear\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- not very engaging\r\n- readings too long",
                "Strengths:\r\n - Teaching style: Professor Lombard is an incredibly clear, engaging, and understanding professor. Her lectures follow a clear outline, often balancing examples and exposition to capture my attention. Though this class is a lecture, Prof. Lombard proactively involves students into discussion. I always looked forward to attending her lectures. \r\n - Assessment timeline: Also, I found the assessment timeline5 ethnographic essays and two examsvery manageable. I felt that the grading was mostly fair; unlike many classes at Yale, you earn what you put in. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - Reading load: reading assignments are long and at times impossible to finish. When Prof. Lombard doesn't mention the paper in the lecture, I relied on my TFs to synthesize the reading and deduce the most salient points.\r\n - Exams: because exams covered a lot of content, you have to cover everything in order to perform well.\r\n - Examples / case studies: sometimes, the connection between an example and the class content was unclear.",
                "Strengths: The material is interesting because we can see examples of it in our own lives. The assignments are also cool because you get to observe people around you and ask them how they feel about certain topics or questions. Weaknesses: The readings are kind of long sometimes. I usually took a couple hours before section to skim and highlight because I didn't have the time to read everything. I was also much less engaged in class than I thought I would be. For tests and for class, we needed to memorize people and theories, but I don't think I got too excited about most of the topics.",
                "Strength: the scope was broad, so many different ideas, anthropologists, and methods were covered over the course of the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it was up to the students to determine what to do with the information presented. What makes one anthropological method more effective than another was not discussed."

                "I highly recommend this course to ANYONEthe budding anthropology major, the STEM major trying to fulfill a social science credit, or someone who enjoys writing. With fair assessments, fun essay prompts, and highly engaging readings, this class has incredibly low barriers to entry.",
                "I took this course because I needed a relatively low workload social science credit (in a STEM-heavy semester). After reading the very positive reviews online, I was expecting to really like this class, especially since I'd taken one other anthropology course previously. However, I was underwhelmed, and others I talked to felt the same way. I would still recommend this class to someone who needs a social science credit urgently, because the assignments were cool and the workload isn't too high, but I didn't really enjoy this class.",
                "I would recommend this course because the five ethnographic assignments were a fun change of pace, while other classes assigned essays or problem sets. The spacing of assignments was also good. The last assignment is also very helpful for anyone applying for a fellowship and was not just an assignment to be completed and never looked at again."
