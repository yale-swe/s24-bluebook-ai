Additionally, I learned about policies such as the Belt and Road Initiative, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and entrepreneurship in China. I gained a better understanding of how certain businesses found success in China historically and what the economic situation looks like now.",
                "Learned a lot about business in China and refined vocabulary. Helped me give quality presentations in Chinese.",
                "Chinese 168 significantly improved my Chinese reading, writing, oral, and comprehension skills, and taught me the approaches necessary to researching and understanding international economic and political issues on a deeper level. Through the specific case studies we learned, I now have a much more informed scope of knowledge on international business, specifically the strategies and jargon used in both Chinese and English.",
                "I improved my economic, business and political Chinese language ability, learnt a lot of different viewpoints and perspectives from my classmates and teacher",
                "Knowledge on the Chinese business market as well as an extensive vocabulary. Presentation and writing skills were also a key focus in the class."

                "This course is highly organized and well-paced. The grading is extremely fair and extracts equally from different course components. I was challenged a lot to grow as a speaker and was able to improve a lot of my presentation skills. Although some of the supplemental readings were challenging, we discussed them very thoroughly and efficiently in class.",
                "Strengths: Well organized with calendars so I knew exactly when things were due. Interesting material and an engaging course. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Since there were varying language skills in the class, it is hard to balance the difficulty and workload in the class. I definitely felt like I had to put in a lot more time than other students, however, this also means that I learned more.",
                "Weaknesses- not any I can think of. The non-textbook material can be a bit difficult. Strengths- very comprehensive and interesting material. Class was fantastic and well structured for students of varying advanced levels.",
                "This course was very strongly organized  each unit was centered around a company, and we learn about the tactics it used to successfully integrate into the Chinese market. With each unit came different series of vocabulary words, business jargon, and phrases, and the course was very easy to follow and engage with. I think improvements could be made by adding more time in the course for class discussion  specifically time for us to talk to classmates about our thoughts on the readings and the political/economic issues they cover. I also think the course materials we use can be updated, as they were slightly outdated and could cover more modern information.",
                "The strength of this course is the diversity of readings we do - from textbook, news articles to videos.",
                "Strengths - high level of engagement and variety in the coursework assigned \r\nWeaknesses - tight deadlines for assignments sometimes made it difficult to keep up"

                "Yes. As a non-native speaker, I truly enjoyed every bit of the course. I believe that this is the best upper-level Chinese course at Yale, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to improve their Chinese in a more formal level.",
                "Yes, this is a great course to continue learning and being exposed to mandarin. Since there is not a lot of memorization of vocabulary or grammar, I was able to learn as much as I wanted to. Additionally, the content is very interesting. Whether it be the textbook (KFC, Starbucks, Ikea, Sams Club, or P&G), or the more supplementary content (i.e. One Belt One Road, AIIB, entrepreneurship, etc.), I was surprised by how much I was constantly learning.",
                "Would strongly recommend for either heritage or non heritage. Definitely more difficult if youre not a native speaker but you learn a lot in a fun and approachable way",
                "Yes! I recommend this course to any student who is interested in economics, international business, and the Chinese language. It is very informative and helps you learn not only about business models but Chinese culture as well. It is a perfect combination of a language and business class.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to other students, the small classroom environment and quality of the classes was a key highlight!",
                "Yes! It is a very engaging class that encourages one to really try hard to improve their language ability while also learning how to discuss important current affairs."
