                "I think this is a very fun and engaging course without being much work, even considering it is a half credit. Dave Evans is awesome, and the fall break field trip was very worthwhile and enjoyable. I didn't really know anyone in the class going in, but the collaborative work and the field trip made it one of the only classes at Yale where I actually made new friends and got to know the professor. It is way more intimate than the large Dynamic Earth lecture, and I also think you learn more than in the lecture because it is so hands-on. No major weaknesses if you think geology is cool.",
                "Assignments could be more clear, especially the more complex new material. I felt that we were often taught the material as we were working on the question it pertained to, so it was sometimes hard to digest everything at once. Maybe I just felt this way because I am not great at science, but I felt like the assignments could have been better explained.",
                "This course has awesome field trips and gets you acquainted with the hands-on side of geology, which is valuable",
                "Its biggest strengths are the three field trips during the semester. You really get to see geology up close and with an amazing and informative professor that can explain everything you see.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any major weakness to this course, but there could definitely be more organization to how information is given and explained.",

                "yes! lots of fun",
