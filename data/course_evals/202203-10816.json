The one big improvement that the course could benefit from is removing the tests or at least changing them. Timed test taking in an unfamiliar location is so unrealistic to the real world, you are never going to need to apply these topics in such a setting outside of school. I think it is an unnecessary source of stress for students and a poor judge of understanding of the material.",
                "No weaknesses that come to mind. It is taught in a good way.",
                "This course could be improved by making the material taught between sections more similar. I have heard from my peers in other sections that their Teaching Assistant teaches more/less material, or even that they are teaching it completely differently. This creates a disconnect when all students end up taking the same exam. There should be a more centralized teaching curriculum to create more continuity between classes.",
                "I wish we had more problems on our problem set because I felt like we didnt engage with some topics with as much depth. Felt a bit fast paced overall.",
                "The class is not very collaborative, which I think would help with grasping topics.",
                "I think the teachers are not all equally good at teaching, which is obviously totally normal, but I could tell at the review sessions that some were really good at explaining and others werent.",
                "It was well structured although the instruction was a little light compared to professor dierhtorn",
                "Strengths: Lots of access to peer tutoring for problem sets and general questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course was taught somewhat detached, class was not very interactive",
                "The pace varies from very fast some weeks to rather slow smoke others; more streamlined process would be better. I really liked the Canvas explorations.",
                "Explorations should be due after class, rather than before. While I appreciate the idea behind having them due before class, with no prior exposure to the concepts , they became tedious and frustrating. I think they would be more effective functioning to consolidate new material after it is taught in class.\r\n\r\nThe class is well structured.",
                "More in depth teaching of individual topics would be useful. Some topics felt skimmed over.",
                "Strength: One of this course's strengths is that it is taught in smaller sections instead of one large lecture. This makes the lecture easier to engage with and makes office hours more productive. \r\nWeakness: The class moves very quickly, and problem sets do not always line up with what was taught in the lecture.",
