                "Strengths: the topic is super interesting, Hacker is a great professor, assignments are interesting and keep students engaged\r\nWeaknesses: I think varying up the way students participate may be good, the presentations did this but also perhaps structuring conversations a bit more",

                "The class discussions were always great. The readings were interesting and thorough without being prohibitively time consuming. Only weakness is I wish it was in person!",
                "The readings and course format is very well suited to student learning. The discussion papers and student lead conversations made the seminar intriguing and interesting to come to each week. The only weakness is that some of the readings seemed a bit tangential to the topic at hand, but most of them were extremely insightful and beneficial to the course, so no real problem here.",
                "Strengths: The readings which explore various aspects of the course that also allows for each of the students to find a point of interest. Very student led in terms of discussion as well\r\nWeakness: The discussion at times was a bit all over the place and sometimes difficult to find a point of entry",
                "I thought this course was very well structured! I appreciated the four discussion papers and enjoyed weekly presentations. Like all seminars, the quality of discussion depends greatly on the students. There were a few instances where it seemed like a select few people dominated conversations, but aside from that I overall thought it was a well taught class."
