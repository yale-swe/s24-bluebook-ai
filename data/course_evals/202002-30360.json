   "comments": [
    "This course allowed students to tackle issues such as colonization, food insecurity, corruption, racism, and more. All instruction and discussions were in arabic, which made allowed students to develop their speaking abilities.",
    "This course helped me to improve my reading comprehension skills in Arabic (via reading different news sources for each class), helped my writing skills (via writing reflections), and definitely helped me sharpen my speaking skills during class.",
    "My Arabic reading skills especially increased immensely. I gained a robust political & political science vocabulary, and my speaking and writing skills also definitely improved a lot. And I had fun.",
    "This was an amazing course! I found my Arabic improving so, so much as we tackled very complex themes (Racism, Food Security in the Time of the Coronavirus, Arab Uprisings, The Crisis of Elections in the Arab World, and Corruption in the Arab World). Professor Elbousty does an absolutely fantastic job of leading discussions, and he lets everyone in the class speak their mind. He is so, so supportive of our work and truly tries to push us past just summarizing articles but really tries to get us to critically analyze the points and not to be afraid of disagreeing with the author. I learned from reading articles and also from researching the country that I chose to follow for the length of the course. I also learned a lot about other countries in the Middle East from other students' presentations. While this course is listed as an Arabic course, it truly is more of a current events course about the Middle East taught and performed totally in Arabic.",
    "This is an incredible course! There was a lot of emphasis on group discussions and brining your own perspectives about different global issues we are facing right now (racism, protests, elections etc). I learnt how to ACTUALLY write an academic response in Arabic and discuss ACTUAL issues faced in the MENA region.  I encourage every student to take it (even if Arabic is your first language) because you truly know so much about each country of the MENA region from Ustath ElBousty and your peers.",
    "The course further developed speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills while exploring read-world topics.",
    "This course furthered my understanding of the Arabic language and deepened my knowledge of field-specific jargon with regards to a broad range of social and political issues. Moreover, the course was just an opportunity to learn more about the \"Arab world\" in general and explore the very definition of that construct."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course assumed a lot of background knowledge about various countries in the Arab world.",
    "I think that the course was well thought out and planned. I enjoyed having an interactive midterm and final project in which we made videos of speeches. I think that the weekly topics were interesting and I enjoyed how each topic was related to current events. I thoroughly enjoyed class discussions.",
    "Strengths: Professor who cares, students who care, fun reading, challenging but rewarding homework.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of homework (thought it helps)",
    "Nearly all strengths! We read very interesting articles, presented on a plethora of complex & delicate topics, and learned from Professor Elbousty and from the rest of the class. The workload was very fair, and I found myself really enjoying to learn more and more about what's going on in the Middle East. I will say that I do wish we could have talked a little more about things to celebrate in the Middle East, like art or music or sports. If the class were taught again, perhaps it would be a good idea to have one week devoted to discussing Middle Eastern cultural components that the region is proud of. It would especially help to show non-Arab students that there is so much good and so much beauty in the Arab world.",
    "The course was very structured. Everything you need to know was prepared and written down on Canvas in details. Also, whenever you feel lost or confused about the course, Professor Jonas will definitely be there to guide you through it. The best thing about this course was truly Professor Elbousty. He is very caring and understanding. He always pushes his students to think outside the box and think critically about important issues. He is indeed an exemplary model of what a Yale professor should be like. In short, if you are looking for an amazing and organized course to challenge yourself, think outside the box and discuss global issues in Arabic, then take this course with professor ElBousty who is a genius in his field!",
    "The course was extremely organized.",
    "The course is very strong in terms of teaching and support. As an upper-level course, there's a great deal of opportunity for students to explore topics of interest in the language with the support of Professor Elbousty. My one comment is that I would have appreciated the opportunity to discuss more about the art and culture of the Arab world, rather than social and political topics."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This class was one of the most interesting and engaging classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Elbousty was amazing at guiding class discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this L5 course with Professor Elbousty! I think that it was very engaging - how the class operates definitely depends on class dynamics\/how much you participate",
    "This is the section that students typically read on CourseTable, so I'm going to have a brief comment here. As of 2020, roughly 422 million people on planet Earth speak Arabic, out of a population of 7 billion. That's 5% of the world. For reference, roughly 1.1 billion people on planet Earth speak Mandarin Chinese, the most commonly spoken language. A language spoken by such a diverse, large, important region of the world, it may come as a surprise to many that Yale only offers one class per level, compared to other spoken languages such as: Spanish, with 10-11, and Chinese, with 7-8 (these statistics according to CourseTable for fall 2020). \r\n\r\nAnd yet. AND YET. Every Arabic class I have taken at Yale has been, how shall we say,  (wonderful; spectacular; magnificent; any adjective describing a superlative of good). This summer, I had the real opportunity to take a summer course with the fantastic Professor Jonas Elbousty. If you've never taken a class with him, you're missing out. Seriously. Take his courses, whatever he teaches. \r\n\r\nMy study abroad was cancelled due to COVID, understandably so. For the situation that we all were in, I was shocked and thrilled at how wonderful the class turned out. 3 hours went by like that, and Professor Elbousty really knows how to cater both to students who were heritage speakers and to students for whom Arabic was still relatively new, like myself. I felt incredibly supported in this class, and my Arabic improved immensely. I've got a long way to go, but I'm way more confident than I ever was before. Take this course; you will not regret it. \r\n\r\nI think Yalies need to take more risks, and one of those risks should be that you should learn something you've never been exposed to before. Most Yalies have not been exposed to the Middle East, and learning Arabic is a great way to gain exposure to the region. So, rather than taking your L5 Spanish course because your high school offered it and it's easy enough to get, consider trying something new, challenging yourself, and risking putting yourself in an environment where you will be intellectually humbled. Because the rewards are fantastic, and the faculty and students are here to support you. It's worth it.",
    "Absolutely! It is so much fun and I learned so much. Take it if you can!",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to everyone who wants to take Arabic to a new different level. You will learn so much about MENA countries and actively engage in discussions about issues that the MENA region faces everyday. I truly loved everything about this course. Even this midterm and final project were so unique which allows you to think outside the box and be creative! Take this class if you are looking for a FUN, challenging and useful class!!!",
    "Yesthe course was very organized. This was the best Arabic course I have taken at Yale, including in-person courses.",
    "I'd most definitely recommend the course to another student. In terms of options to continue an education in Arabic, this class is an absolutely solid choice."
