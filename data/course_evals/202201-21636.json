On a deeper level I felt I gained better skills in proof writing and developed stronger mathematical intuition in my ability to approach difficult problems. I especially felt I learned a great deal from the problem sets as I was forced to think very deeply about the problem at hand and was challenged to connected a lot of concepts we'd studied.",
                "For the first midterm, I learned about metric spaces, closed and open sets, compact sets, continuous functions, uniform continuity and convergence, complete metric spaces, algebras and sigma-algebras, and measures. For the second midterm, I learned much more about measures and outer measures, including measurable functions and Lebesque integrability, and learned the limit theorems for Lebesque integrals. Toward the end, we covered Fourier sequences.",

                "Spent some time going over metric space notions and a little bit of Riemann Integration. But the body of the course was on (lebesgue) measures, integration, and fourier series. Accordingly, I gained lots of knowledge on those three topics while solidifying my understanding of the earlier material. Furthermore, I think that the understanding I gained of these topics is actually fairly deep, and that this class really did help me learn this material quiet well.",

At the end we also discussed Fourier analysis (where we can write most continuous periodic functions in terms of sin\/cos), and also Weyl's equidistribution theorem (for the last class), which was really really cool. - Also practiced proof writing and problem solving skills.",

The course began with lectures about metric spaces and their salient properties, then progressed to introduce the construction of measures. The main focus of the second half of the course was the lebesgue measure: it's construction as an outer measure restricted to a certain sigma-algebra, its properties, measurable and integrable functions, and L1 and L2 spaces. However, while the focus of these sections was the Lebesgue measure, the professor also demonstrated that many of the concepts were generalizable to all measures. Finally, we finished with Fourier analysis. In this section again, Professor Oh began with general notions of the Hilbert space, and proved that in these spaces certain statements are equivalent to having an orthonormal basis. We then learned about how to apply these results more specifically to L2 space over a bounded interval. The course finished with Weyl's equidistribution theorem. \r\n\r\nIn addition to learning about numerous topics, I developed the skill of writing proofs rigorously as part of the homework problems.",

                "I felt that the course was especially engaging, that it was taught very well and that I learned a substantial amount. The one issue I did have with the course was that I felt in the beginning there was too much time spent reviewing concepts studied in Analysis 1 and that I could have gained more had we jumped right into studied measures and algebras and could have gone more deeply into abstract measure theory with the time we had.",
                "Hee Oh gave organized lectures, her psets were pretty fun and matched well with what we were learning in class, and she was very receptive to feedback throughout the semester. I don't think she provided sufficient motivation or examples for many of the proofs and theorems we covered in class, which could make the lectures a little tedious and abstract.",
                "Strengths are the smaller lectures and course content",
                "The strength of this course is the small number of students who enroll, as I personally enjoy the feeling of a smaller classroom. The course's weakness for me is that this was the hardest class I have ever taken, bar none at Yale. It was so incredibly difficult to me that it really gave me mental health issues at one point. I was unsure if I could ever pass, and how I would even be able to continue in my major. I had 2 tutors at one point for this course, and it really just did not come naturally to me until the very end, after weeks and weeks of becoming more familiar with the material.",
                "Strengths: the course is organized well and the content is interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the content on Fourier series was underrepresented ( just the last 4 lectures and we went very quickly), which is a shame because it's part of the coolest part of the payoff of Lebesgue integration",
                "Strengths: Covered interesting material (or at least I found it reasonably interesting). Challenging but not impossible HWs were a good level to be motivating and to deepend understanding without being discouraging or offputting. Hee Oh was really excellent(!) at presenting the material and answering questions. Class felt like it moved at an appropriate and quick pace in the second half of the course. Really good TFs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The beginning of the course moved too slowly, with us spending too much time reviewing supposed prerequisites regarding metric spaces, and the end of the course on fourier series moved a little bit too quickly (though was still reasonable and never truly a problem), so it felt like reallocating a few classes across these topics would be an improvement. The grading being only 10% for HW is a little bit brutal given that this is how you spend most of your time in the course.",
                "Hee Oh is definitely a strong lecturer - while she does go at a bit of a quick pace she always answers class questions in a very thorough and clear manner so that I am never left completely confused by the end of lecture. Definitely developed some intuition for analysis thanks to her explaining the ideas and big pictures of proofs before getting into the nitty gritty details which I appreciated. However, some problems on psets were unusually strange or difficult in that it was unclear how rigorous or what background knowledge we were expected to have.",
                "the biggest strength is the material--it's pretty cool. Hee Oh really cares about her students and wants them to be excited about math. She is very responsive to feedback as well, and solicited it quite often throughout the semester. the class could have just been better organized. After the first few psets, they started to get assigned on random days and due random days. the grading could have also been more transparent. the median on the first midterm was a 90, so she vowed to make the second one harder and the median was a 70, with 1\/3 of the class getting below a 60. there is nothing wrong with this; we were just given no information about how final grades would be determined (i.e. whether there were strict cutoffs or a curve, how generous was the curve) besides: \"if you have an average above a 90, I think you deserve an A.\" I had to credit\/D after the midterm and was genuinely concerned I could get a D based on how little information we had.",
                "The pace of the course was slow and the start but ramped up very quickly towards the end which was a bit of a weakness. However, the professor explained the different concepts very well and made it a great experience to take the class.",
                "This course was well paced, but it could probably start a bit farther along. Students had already covered most of the topics covered for the first 5 weeks.",
                "I liked the psets and lectures a lot. Hee Oh is a great prof. A textbook more appropriate to the difficulty of the course would have been nice.",
                "Strengths: very well taught (if Hee Oh is teaching), covers a lot of content that is relevant to upper-level math and statistics\r\nWeaknesses: Grading was often very pedantic and perhaps overly meticulous",
                "On the whole the course material was fine, though it does get a bit abstract and unintuitive in places. Most of the course is laying the foundation for real analysis (e.g. defining measures and Lebesgue integration), so I felt like a lot of it was just technical points\/providing a toolkit to solve cooler problems, which is not necessarily a strength or a weakness, but it can feel like a slog at times. I personally found this course difficult because my learning style did not match with Professor Oh's teaching style in many ways, but that's not particular to real analysis.",
                "Strengths: Professor Oh is an excellent lecturer, perhaps the best math lecturer I've had at Yale. She was very knowledgeable about the material and nearly always had a quick answer to questions. Weaknesses: The exam difficulty was pretty frustrating... when the class did well on the first exam (median 90), the professor decided that exam was \"too easy\" and that she preferred a median in the 70s. I'm not sure why the math department thinks it right that half of the class should get Ds and Fs on exams. The homework schedule was also inconsistent, as we would go two weeks without a homework and then have a homework due 4 days after it was posted. HOWEVER, Professor Oh was always accomodating and would extend homework assignments if the deadlines were unfair.",
                "I thought the course was excellent overall. I wish it had gone a little bit faster at the beginning so we could have spent more time doing Fourier analysis though. We kind of rushed through some extremely beautiful results, which is a little unfortunate.",
                "A good math class that goes over basic concepts like open\/closed sets to more advanced measure theory and spaces. The class is well-organized and not hard to follow.",
                "the teaching was at times unclear, the hwk was thoughtful and supported the teaching, the TA were excellent.",
                "Strength: interesting material, very motivated.\r\nWeakness: went super fast in the last couple of weeks, kinda confusing at times.",
                "Overall, I really enjoyed this course. One of the major strengths of this course was that it was well organized: each topic built off of the previous one in a logical manner. This also helped to motivate each of the topics. Perhaps the greatest strength of this course was Professor Oh. Her statements in class were always very precise, and she would often engage the class during lectures by asking how they thought a proof would proceed, or what the outcome of a given example would be. Furthermore, she would always highlight the connection between the various topics that we were learning (e.g., between Lebesgue and Reimann integration), and this helped to motivate the concepts. Finally, she always stayed after class to answer students' questions about the lectures. \r\n\r\nHowever, one weakness of this course was that the lectures went incredibly quickly, so much so that it could often be difficult to keep up with taking notes. I think it would have been beneficial to pace the lectures a bit more slowly, so that students would have had more time to understand\/engage with the material during class. I also think it would have helped if Professor Oh had written more of what she said on the board, as she often made important points that I just did not get the time to write down. I understand, of course, that this class moved quickly in part because there was a lot of material to cover. However, because many of the students already seemed to be familiar with the basic properties of metric spaces (i.e., the topics that we covered in the first few weeks of MATH 305), it may have been more helpful to skip these concepts (or perhaps to relegate them to review sessions outside of lecture) so that the new concepts could be taught at a more reasonable pace. \r\n\r\nAnother strength of this class was the homework assignments. These were challenging, but productively so. They required students to build off of course material, but also to think creatively about the problems. Whenever points were taken off of a problem set, the deduction was accompanied with a comment\/feedback about the problem, which was helpful. Also, solutions were provided to homework problems after the deadline, which was a useful study material. \r\n\r\nFinally, it was helpful to have two peer tutors.",
                "Strengths: Good content, Hee Oh is very approachable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Oh's lectures are really fast and hard to follow, with no examples, which she justifies by saying that 305 is a hard class and we're expected to do stuff on our own. For the record, I have taken harder classes with more content here that have had much much better lectures and actually explained things well. The graders were also absolutely horrific - I have never seen such lazy and capricious grading in two years of STEM classes at Yale.",
                "I found the material somewhat interesting, and Professor Oh did a good job of presenting it from first principles. The problem sets weren't too challenging, but the grading was unexpectedly vicious, and left the impression that the graders didn't always read your solutions fully before docking points (I several times found whole questions marked wrong even though the thing the grader said I was missing was in the proof). Gradescope makes it easy enough to request regrades, but it's unfortunate to have to be on heightened alert the whole semester for something like this.",
                "Problem sets for this class took about 8 hours which is reasonable for a math class. One weakness is the difficultly of the exams. The first one was relatively easy while the other 2 were very difficult. One strength of the course is the material is explained very well during lecture. The proofs were very clear and easy to follow. The lecture is well-organized."

But I would not recommend taking this class for fun. The lectures could get pretty tedious, because they were full of poorly motivated, nitpickety, algebraic proofs that generated very little real understanding of the content. The class did not spark a love of analysis, to say the least. However, the psets were fairly interesting and not too difficult, and a lot of the course before the first midterm was very similar to content we had covered in Analysis 1.",

Hee Oh was really good a presenting this material, and the HWs were challenging and reinforced the material. See other answers for more detail.",
                "Excellent class, especially with Hee Oh who is a strong lecturer. Reaffirmed my ambition of following through with the Math major. Attend all the lectures if possible, since I feel like you definitely get a lot more out of them when youre able to listen to her answer the in class questions in a thorough manner and explain her intuition and big picture ideas to definitions, theorems, and proofs. She may go at a bit of a quick pace but she always makes time to answer any questions in the middle. She also does a great job explaining why we need certain hypotheses and why we dont need others as she goes over many counter examples, which was very helpful for my understanding of the various results in real analysis. Definitely believe math majors should take and I certainly got a lot out of this class. The problem sets were not overly time consuming and helped me reinforce my learning of the concepts from lectures. Take it with Hee Oh.",

                "The content is good and Hee Oh is a kind-hearted professor who stays for an hour after every class to answer questions. And those are the only positive things I can say about this class. Everything else about 305 was nothing short of an absolute train wreck. From the lectures to the resources to (above all) the grading, there were uncountably many flaws with this class. Professor Oh is extremely smart and one of the nicest professors I've had at Yale, but she was a horrible, horrible lecturer. 75 minutes would pass at breakneck speed where I could barely catch up with taking notes, all the while she spent most of the time going through long proofs of theorems that we'd never have to replicate. It would've been so much better if there were examples throughout class that helped us with problem solving on the homeworks and exams. I felt woefully unprepared every time I started the week's pset (not to mention that they were sometimes posted late with the same due dates, giving us three or four days to do a very hard homework). She justified this by saying that 305 is a hard class and we are expected to do some learning on our own; however, I've taken plenty of hard classes here that actually taught all the content in class. Fourier series are literally in the course title, but she just assumed we knew them and I had to ask on the very last class, after she stated and proved multiple theorems involving them, what Fourier series were. A course can get away with this if there's sufficient support outside of lectures, but this unfortunately was not the case. While assessments of the ULAs have been overwhelmingly positive, their office hours were at the most inconvenient times. They advertised that they had six hours of OH time the day before each pset was due, but that didn't work with my schedule since I was busy on Tuesdays and had to finish them earlier. Combined with the other times usually coinciding with my dinner on weekdays, I had nowhere else to turn when I had questions about the problems. This is the problem with putting all your office hour eggs in one basket - I'm sure it was great for some people, but I was literally never able to go to them, and it seriously impeded my learning in the class. But these are both minor complaints compared to the animosity and harshness of the 305 graders. Accidentally swapped the two variables in an otherwise correct proof? 5\/10. Missing a fairly obvious observation that we had gone over in class? 7.5\/10. I could go on and on and on. This is a math class, not an olympiad - if we get most of the problem, we should get most of the points. Their responses to my regrade requests either apologized for an incorrect error (why didn't they look at my solutions the first time as seriously as I looked at the problems?) or were demeaning rebukes of my reasoning without giving any explanation as to why it was such a major error. They also kept threatening us with disciplinary action for collaborating when collaboration was specifically allowed in the syllabus; while we often legally worked together, I am not aware of anyone who submitted solutions written by someone else. It was totally unprovoked yet panic-inducing hostility. Their capricious grading style ultimately led me to take this class CR\/D\/F. I'd encourage anyone else to do that as well, because there's no way of guaranteeing that you get out what you put in. I heard through the grapevine that Professor Oh plans to make the class even harder next year (similar to how it was in spring 2021), so if you are an intensive math major who has to take this class for a letter grade, all I can say is godspeed.",
                "There's a reason it's a part of the standard math major sequence -- it's important material, and sheds a beautiful light on several other areas of math. Measure theory and understanding why fourier transforms work will also be quite useful.",
                "This is a great course on real analysis. You will learn a lot and develop the necessary skills to apply real analysis to future math classes at Yale."
