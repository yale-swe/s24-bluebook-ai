                "The strengths of this course were very few. In general, lectures felt disorganized and unprepared. No explanation was given about why we were interested in the various results. In general, the content of the course was presented in a very circular manner: A is important because it allows us to understand B, and B is important because it tells us about A. Prof. Qiu only taught \"Galois theory\" in the very narrowest sense, and never connected the language of Galois theory to any interesting questions outside of this narrow scope. Beyond the content of the lectures, the actual presentation was extremely difficult to follow. Prof. Qiu would present on a rather small screen, and was constantly scrolling up and down without giving enough time to take thorough notes. Fortunately, I suppose, the proofs in the textbook were typically easier to understand than Prof. Qiu's presentation, so I took notes on the textbook instead of on the lecture. That said, the textbook we used was *still* a pretty bad one, in my opinion (we used \"Fields and Galois Theory\" by Patrick Morandi). The material of the entire semester was crammed into the first 60 or so pages of the textbook, in an extremely dense format. In my opinion, many of the proofs in the text were also lacking in rigour--not checking things like well-definedness or uniqueness of various constructions. The problem sets were also a mess. This was the first time that I have felt like the problem sets in a math course did *nothing* to improve understanding. The problems were either (a) definition shuffling, (b) results that were already proven in the textbook or in lecture, or (c) artificially complicated scenarios that only obfuscated a rather straightforward idea. We might have had two or three useful homework problems, but they were few and far between.",
                "Strength: Some of the examples Professor Qiu gave were really interesting and facilitated my learning. Also Professor Qiu is an ethusiastic instructor, always willing to take advice from students to improve his teaching, and put efforts to best help the student's learning experience.\r\nWeakness: Sometimes it is hard to follow Professor's class note in live sessions. Might be better when switching back to in-person learning.",
                "The class is good at teaching the material, but sometimes the professor is hard to understand and the course moves pretty fast.",
                "The lectures were very haphazard and confusing and often mistakes were made (which happens, but the lecture style was just generally very confusing and this didnt make it any easier). The course could be improved with pre prepared notes perhaps? Or maybe it will simply be easier in person when the effects of scrolling a virtual screen are not important.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Qiu was so knowledgeable, clearly cared about the students, and constantly strived to improve the learning experience. Lectures were good for the most part. Weaknesses: Lectures were sometimes disorganized and pace was either too fast or too slow.",

                "I have two answers for this question. Certainly, I recommend that every math student take Galois Theory. From my own exploration, it is a beautiful subject, with fascinating connections to various classical problems in math: compass-and-straightedge constructions, solving polynomials by radicals, identifying transcendental numbers. This is some seriously cool stuff, and you'd be crazy to *not* want to learn it.\r\n\r\nThat said, I cannot recommend that anybody take this course with Prof. Qiu. I really hate to say it, because he seems to be a really nice guy, and he genuinely seems to be trying his best to teach this course well. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work. I will copy some of the problems I had from my \"Strengths and Weaknesses\" response below. TLDR: we never talked about how Galois theory relates to these classic mathematical questions, and everything we did was totally unmotivated.\r\n\r\nIn general, lectures felt disorganized and unprepared.

There are many applications of Galois theory, it turns out, in other branches of math (differential equations, topology), so Galois theory is very important for higher algebra. 370 was not as intense as 350 but you still have to be diligent because the material in 370 is already pretty advanced.",
