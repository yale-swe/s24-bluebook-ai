Adhered pretty closely to the Pomeroy textbook, so you can glance through to see if it seems interesting.\r\nFor the most part this class was about memorizing the material.

                "Strengths - Section! You have the opportunity to take a section with this course and you absolutely should. Topics covered in discussion are interesting and the TF's mediate a fun dialogue around the content in lecture every week. \r\n-Profesor Lamont's Lectures are very engaging and she does a good job at allowing student's to ask questions as she moves through the content. She is extremely knowledgable and impressive to watch explore the story of Ancient Greece. \r\n-Tests in this class are also a strength. While requiring a good understanding of the content, they are written quite fairly and will not cripple your grade so long as you go to lecture and pay attention. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The level and quantity of readings in this course are fairly high, however, if you have to sacrifice the textbook readings and focus on the primary sources (Herodotus, Thucydides, Plutarch, etc...) you will most likely be fine.",
                "I think the course is very well paced.",
                "Strengths: Greek history is endlessly fascinating, and Professor Lamont does an excellent job of telling the story of ancient Greece in a way that is organized, insightful, and engaging. She also picks really fascinating scholarly articles for the reading response assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths--fantastic course. Lectures were engaging, readings very short, exams very fair. Almost no complaints whatsoever. Prof Lamont is incredible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--not much, but this course is introductory, so I wouldn't recommend it if you already have college-level classroom experience with Ancient Greece. The multiple choice are weighted too much on exams (5 points for 1 little question). Should be more multiple choice but less weight on each",
                "This course was well organized and offered various levels of flexibility to students' academic calendars with its no section option and flexible essay dates",
                "I feel like this class is a little bit too Atheno-centric and might benefit from more sources outside the traditional canon. Incorporating Xenophon or perhaps some plays would be interesting. Otherwise this was a riveting course which I really enjoyed",
                "Great prof",
                "The course did a good job of providing a general overview of ancient Greek history, and I feel like I got a sense of all the main points and \"greatest hits.\" However, the class was more military history-focused than I initially realized when I signed up, and it would have been nice to have more of a focus on society/social history, as I really appreciated when Prof. Lamont did bring in examples of things like material culture and societal customs.",
                "The course was great.",
                "I really appreciated how thorough an understanding of the period I felt I had by the end of the semester. I think I'd be prepared for more advanced courses because I learned all the fundamental people, places, dates, and events of Ancient Greece. I also thought it was great to read from classic primary sources like Herodotus and Thucydides.\r\nSometimes, I thought the lectures were a little dry, because they were mostly a chronological journey through all the key events. I would have enjoyed hearing Professor Lamont deliver arguments about how she interprets things, which would be less objective but . In my opinion, the course would also be served by looking a little more into the non-political aspects of Ancient Greece, such as philosophy or art. Lastly, because we never really discussed them, the modern articles we we wrote essays on felt tangential and not part of a cohesive whole with lectures and discussion sections.",
                "The strength of this class lies mostly in how interesting Greek history and the great arcs in it, which Professor Lamont supplements with interesting details. This class was ultimately made for me, however, by my TA. Though sections are optional, I found it made the class much more fun! I highly recommend.",
                "It was very interesting and engaging.",
                "This class does a great job surveying Ancient Greek history and the basis of western civilization by looking at primary sources, art, architecture, and myths. Lectures do a good job covering the \"story\" of Ancient Greece and sections, although optional, are great to review material and primary sources. In terms of assignments and grading, Professor Lamont gives you a ton of flexibility and is very fair in all of her exams. In terms of weaknesses, sometimes the chronological march through the history of Ancient Greece felt a bit one-dimensional; it would have nice to stop and look at daily life of citizens, for example. Of course, the nature of the primary sources often prevent us from doing this and this is a survey course for a large amount of time in the end.",
                "I see no weaknesses. The course was excellently designed to give the student a detailed overview of Ancient Greece, and the Pomeroy textbook helped provide details regarding culture and daily life which were unsuitable to dwell on in the politically and institutionally focused lectures.",

                "Absolutely. If you are interesting in learning about Ancient Greece, Athenian democracy, ancient wars, and more, this is totally a class to take. Professor Lamont's lectures come together to tell one big story about Greece from 3400-300BCE that was a pleasure to learn from.",
                "I would recommend this course. The subject matter is fascinating, even to someone who is studying a completely different field (I'm not a classics or history major and took this course entirely for fun). The lectures are engaging and the readings are interesting.",
                "Yes! Highly, highly recommend the class to anyone interested in learning about the birth of the West. Greek history is so interesting and Professor Lamont does a fantastic job of teaching the course. I loved the flexibility granted by the class (optional sections, choosing from 2/5 reading response papers).",

                "Lamont is great, the TFs were great, great course.",
                "I'd definitely recommend it. I came in first and foremost wanting to learn all about the key people and events that shaped the Ancient Greek world, and that's exactly what I took away. The workload was not bad at all (I read the textbook and all the primary sources, but you could definitely get away with less if you're willing to lose out on some of the finer details), and I was especially glad to write two four-page essays rather than a term paper which would have brought me tons of stress for very little reward.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course. It provides an in-depth survey of Ancient Greek history and presents the information in a very digestible way.",
                "If you want to know more about greek history, take this course.",
                "If you are at all curious about Ancient Greece, then yes! Professor Lamont is a wonderful lecturer and historian - her enthusiasm and expertise during lecture are amazing. The workload is not too bad, as long as you keep up with readings and go to lecture (and section, even though it's optional). Lots of flexibility in writing assignments and exams are fair, although a decent amount of memorization. It's a challenge to go through such a huge chunk of history in a semester and as such, it can feel a bit rushed and monotonous at times. But as long as you have a curiosity for Ancient Greek history and engage in section, this class will be really good.",
