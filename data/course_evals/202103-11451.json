The research plan and final paper assignments ensure that students plan and understand their research at a detailed level. Furthermore, the flexible course design allows students to pursue a field of research intrinsically interesting to them, allowing for deeper engagement."

I found it particularly helpful to receive mentor feedback on the research plan and final paper, and these insights will prove valuable in future research settings.  For students who are already conducting research with a faculty member, it is particularly convenient to enroll in this course as it offers academic credit for work the student is already doing. At the same time, students cannot be paid for their work if they are also earning academic credit; this may be important to consider depending on one's circumstances."
