It's an impossible task to read the whole Divine Comedy in a semester, so at times it felt a little overwhelming with how fast we were covering it, but I think it speaks to this great teaching duo that they were able to present so much content to first time readers in such an inspiring way!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Cuadrado's enthusiasm for and knowledge of the content, our thought-provoking discussions in discussion sections, comparatively low reading load, the Beinecke visit, interesting topic.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot. The class is fast-paced, since we have to go through the entire Comedy in one semester, but that expectation is made clear at the start of the semester.",
                "Strengths: Very easy to follow, lack of pressure, student experimentation for analysis is encouraged, passionate professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because of a student focus there is a lack of a strict structure that might put off certain people.",

                "YES YES YES!! Go into it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed. These were some of the best professors I've had at Yale, and the content of Dante was way more accessible than I ever thought thanks to the design of this course. It's a foundational work that I believe every humanities student should study, and it was truly a delight to read it for the first time with the help of an amazing professor! Be wary, you have to be into it - show up and do the reading, and I promise you will be delighted by what you learn!",
                "Yes, if they're interested in Dante, medieval literature, or just want to read something truly epic. This class is interesting and relatively low-stakes, so you can explore a really impactful literary work with ease. You don't need to know Italian or have a background in reading epic poetry -- Prof. Cuadrado will help you navigate the afterlife, just as Virgil does for Dante.",
                "100%. In a heartbeat. This course allowed me to read a major work in the canon at a very digestible pace and at a level where I can understand even the latest findings. The environment was comfortable and encouraging, to the point where I felt comfortable making mistakes because those would lead to further understanding. The discussions were engaged and nuanced. Basically everything that literature class could be, this class was.",
