                "Critically thinking about the intersection between health, science, and religion.",
                "I learned an incredible amount about how health, religion, and science are inherently connected in the United States. I gained many insights into the intersections between health and capitalism\/white supremacy. I questioned my own definition of \"health\" and how that has been informed by the social\/cultural values around me. I similarly learned about how to define religion and how religious movements have been an integral part of shaping the institutionalization of medicine and science. I learned that \"science\" is not actually without bias.",
                "This was one of the last seminars I took at Yale, but I loved that I was still learning about different ways to write even until the end. Writing the primary source analysis and the experiential learning assignments almost every week was a wonderful way to stretch my writing skills and figure out different ways to write even at a time when I thought I had learned all I needed in order to write well.",

How science and religion\/alternative medicine have fought to gain medical authority, various health and alternative medicine movements, the Prosperity Gospel, mutual aid, diet science, self-care,  and environmental racism, among other topics.",
                "I learned about the intersecting histories of medicine, religion, and popular culture, and learned how to analyze them with an eye towards the crises of the present moment. I gained tremendous clarity about the historical roots of the strange medical-cultural-spiritual landscape we live in."

                "Great discussions and the professor was really wonderful at aiding the conversation without over inserting herself. I also thought we had great topics each week and a nice activity to go along with it.",
                "Overall, this was an extremely strong course. If it had been in person it probably would have been one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "I really liked Prof. Musselman and the environment that she created for the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Musselman crafted the syllabus for the class so well! Each week, we covered a different topic, but the themes built on each other. She also facilitated conversations well, was extremely understanding about virtual learning during Covid-19, and assigned interesting assignments. I liked the flexibility we got on our midterm and final papers to write about whatever we wanted.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Prof. Musselman\r\n- reasonable work load\r\n- compatible with virtual teaching\r\n- assignments are very interesting and immersive\r\n- class size\r\n- good pacing (we always talked until the end of class)\r\n- flexible office hours\r\n- options for how to do the final\r\n- meme assignment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the Canvas set-up made it hard to know your overall grade or test different grades in the grade book",
                "In the beginning, I thought one of the weaknesses was the reading materials since they were mostly abstract and theory-heavy, something I did not enjoy as much, but Professor Musselman did an amazing job of being adaptable with the materials. There was a lot of reading, yes, but she found ways to break up the discussion, keep us all engaged, and allow for breaks to get through and enjoy our long discussions in order to understand even the more challenging readings we had.",
                "Readings were very interesting, reading responses and essays were at times challenging but rewarding, and class discussions made attending the highlight of my week. It may have been better to devote more class time to reviewing the material rather than having discussions, but I still enjoyed and felt I got a lot out of them!",
                "This course encourages students to treat their lived experiences as a valid source to be analyzed and put in conversation with histories and theories. It covers engaging material and was a joy to participate in."

                "Zoom breakout rooms were done very well in this course -- they were used in a variety of ways, with interesting questions that facilitated conversation, and students really got to talk to everyone in the class. Check-ins with each student at the beginning of class each week kept students engaged with one another and made the classroom a space where we were comfortable sharing all our thoughts. Policies reflecting understanding and forgiveness between students and Prof. Musselman made this class very pandemic-friendly.",
                "The biggest thing was Professor Musselman's ability to adapt and change up discussion each week on Zoom. She would have us go into breakout rooms for discussions, play around on online notebooks and whiteboards to write out our thoughts on the readings. She even at one point had us go on Instagram and analyze posts and make memes to explain a reading to keep us all engaged during the online format. Despite being an early seminar, I loved showing up and stayed engaged throughout the class period as a result."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to every student.",
                "Absolutely. If the interesting course materials don't intrigue you, please take it for Professor Musselman. She was an absolute joy to have as a teacher, and so attentive to us as students not just for our contributions but also for our time, our stress, and our wellbeing throughout the semester.",
                "Yes! The intersection of science, health and religion, along with various health\/alternative medicine movements, aren't something that's covered in great depth in most history classes. Considering how major a role these forces have played in shaping the cultural, medical, and religious landscape of the US, this class is the perfect way to learn about an important topic!",
