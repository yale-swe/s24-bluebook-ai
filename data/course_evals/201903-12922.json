   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The seminars are very involved, and Professor Calabresi invites all to participate. The reading can be heavy and very legalistic, understandably.",
    "Strengths: Absolutely excellent professor, interesting material, well-written textbook, reasonable assignments, well-guided and productive discussions\r\n\r\nWeakness: None",
    "Professor Calabresi is the highlight of this course.  He is truly invested in our learning and leads riveting discussion every class meeting.  I highly recommend taking advantage of any opportunity you have to learn from him.",
    "Generally a fantastic course. I would have enjoyed some outside reading of philosophy of law as well, in order to look at the difference in norms between civil and common law countries more closely.",
    "Only change should be the midterm assessment paper -- having to read the regular amount of the casebook + Ackerman over fall break was a bit much. It's hard because there also isn't a chapter that can be cut. But be warned fall break won't be much of a break unless you start reading Ackerman far ahead of time -- but it seemed like many of us only had the opportunity to start reading it during the break itself.",
    "Strengths: You cover a lot of international legal material you wouldn't otherwise be exposed to. Neither the course nor professor Calabresi assume that the American constitution got everything right. It is a very straightforward course in terms of expectations and course material. Professor Calabresi cold calls students like a law school class, but not in a way that catches you off guard or intimidates you.  \r\n\r\nNeutral: It's a lot of reading every week, but we pretty much go step by step through that weeks chapter, so intense reading is not required. This could be good or bad depending on how in depth you would like to go with your reading and discussion. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course textbook is very big and very expensive (it is an actual law school textbook).",
    "Burdensome amount of readings, but to be expected, given that the class follows an identical syllabus to an identical class taught by the same professor in the law school. Discussion sections fostered a lot of great debate, and Professor Calabresi finds a way to get you involved in the class."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course as an interesting continuation of Constitutional Law.",
    "Absolutely would recommend 10\/10. This is one of the best courses Yale College has to offer. Professor Calabresi is incredibly kind and helpful and super knowledgeable about the topic. The readings are genuinely interesting, the classes well-structured and engaging throughout, and the assignments very reasonable. I came out having learned a lot and absolutely would recommend to anyone even if you have zero interest in law. Total workload averages less than 3 hours per week.",
    "Absolutely.  Take this course, and deeply engage the readings!  Class discussions are riveting.",
    "Yes - this course is relevant for everybody. A comparative understanding of how we run different countries is incredibly helpful. This is one of those courses that sticks with you and changes the way you approach the world around you.",
    "Absolutely! Calabresi is so accessible and also politically opens your mind. But he also deeply respects whatever positions you take on certain issues.",
    "Definitely! A true hidden gem in the PLSC department. In my opinion, the class is much, much better than Akhil Amar's lecture.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class to any student interested in constitutional law, international affairs, global history, or political theory. It's a very wide reaching class that pulls from a lot source material that could be beneficial in ones personal studies or research in any of those areas.",
    "The course is advertised as a \"Con law II.\" Can really be taking concurrently with con law, and that should be recommended. Given the dearth of \"pre-law\" classes at Yale, this is a great way to further one's interest in law. Professor Calabresi is also an amazing teacher and a really nice person. I'd recommend anything he teaches.",
    "Yes! Loved the class; it's incredibly underrated. You learn a ton about other countries and about constitutional law in general. I was a bit hesitant about taking the class at first since I'd heard some rumors about Professor Calabresi being militantly right-wing. Those rumors are absolutely false - Professor Calabresi is eminently reasonable (pretty sure he mentioned supporting impeachment and also reparations) and his personal views don't really factor into the class very much. He's really great at facilitating discussion and debate during class, and even though we met on Mondays at 9:25, Comparative Con Law was so interesting that I always dragged myself out of bed.",
    "Yes -- Calabresi is an absolutely wonderful caring instructor with brilliant insights and a keen ability to lead a discussion."
