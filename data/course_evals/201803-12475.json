    "This class covers many topics in Spanish politics, such as the new political parties, terrorism, coping with an authoritarian past, and of course, the Catalonia crisis. The course draws these topics and conversations down to several underlying themes such as identity and nationalism. The class uses various mediums (background readings, developing theory papers, research findings, documentaries, etc.) to explore these issues.",
    "A solid understanding of what the Spanish political landscape looks like today, as well as how it got to where it is. We also covered lot of interesting themes that are applicable beyond Spain -- electoral systems, nationalism, transitional justice, etc.",
    "A comprehensive overview of Spain and its historical and current political climate.",
    "I learned so much about Spanish history and politics that I had no idea before."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is very informative and provides lots of information about the situation of Spain's politics. It does a good job of offering multiple perspectives, through academic readings and other sources such as news articles, to explore both the big picture and the more specific nuances of the Spanish case. The reading responses can sometimes feel like a lot, but they do encourage you to do the readings, which is important to providing a better voice and perspective in the class discussion; one of the documentary reading assignments could also be switched out for another assignment. Overall, this class does a great job at living up to its purpose of telling the story of Spanish politics.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Hierro is actually from Spain, and that perspective is invaluable. The almost-weekly reading responses are a strength, too, since you basically have to do the readings, so you're more prepared for class. (They're only two pages, don't worry about it.)\r\nWeaknesses: maybe this was just because of the small class size (I think we had 7 or 8 students), but when people miss class or don't do the readings, discussions really suffer. Some of the readings feel a bit repetitive, but that's a smaller thing.",
    "The flow of the class made a lot of sense and the readings were interesting for the most part.",
    "Strengths are that it gives a holistic and expansive immersion into the Spanish political domain. It was definitely not just a survey course even though we covered a lot of material. Weaknesses are that it could be considered a LOT of work. I feel like we did over 40 pages of writing but didn't even receive a writing credit from the class."

   "comments": [
    "I think that anyone interested in learning more about Spain, or interested in learning about comparative politics, would really enjoy this class. The themes of the class shape the way one sees the world and politics, regardless of whether in reference to Spain or not, so I would say anyone would find something to take away from the class.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to participate a bit more than you usually do because it's so small. The final paper sneaks up on you, too -- 5000 words is no joke.",
    "Contemporary Spanish Politics was a phenomenal course, one that any student interested in Spain really should take. The seminar consisted of about ten students, which encouraged active class participation and rigorous debate. Prof. Hierro facilitated many of the conversations, but seamlessly integrated her own expertise with the thoughts of her students. The material covered in this seminar was fascinating, ranging from regional conflicts to national remembrance to contemporary corruption. Readings for the class were a unique blend of newspaper\/magazine articles and scholarly journal articles, offering various vantage point on the topics we covered. The assessments in the course were entertaining, even if a bit excessive (weekly response paper, two documentary-based response papers, and a ~5000 word final essay). In short, a great political science seminar if you're interested in Spain.",
    "If you are interested in these types of subjects then yes.",
    "Yes, I definitely would! Just make sure you're prepared to do all the writing that the course entails.",
    "Lots of work, seminar completely dependent on who takes it. If you don't like it Week 2, just drop."
