                "Although I have not enjoyed most seminars or writing classes that I've taken at Yale, I would say that Writing About the Environment was one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. My writing improved so much, and I feel like I learned a totally different way of writing and reading and just perceiving the world around me. There were some simple but powerful tools, such as avoiding indirection or thinking intentionally about the use of present tense, that had very profound impacts on my writing. I was also extremely proud of the pieces I produced for this class, but never felt overwhelmed by the work I had to do for the class. The pieces we read also aided my work for the class, while allowing me to explore different types of writing. There was a perfect balance between these readings and the focus on our pieces. Overall, this was a very special class.",
                "I learned more in this course than I have during any other class at Yale, and certainly more than any other writing class. I learned very tangible, applicable techniques that made my writing categorically better and clearer. I learned what makes or breaks long-form, magazine-style pieces of writing.",
                "Significant knowledge and insight on environmental writing, journalism, structure.",
                "Understanding of how to write engaging work, especially related to description. Reading works by famous journalists."

            "comments": [
                "As discussed in my first response, there were so many wonderful parts of this course. The only area of improvement I could suggest has to do with the readings. I wish that the weekly reading assignments had been posted sooner during the week. I often wanted to start them before the weekend, but sometimes they weren't explicitly assigned until just a day or two before class.",
                "I genuinely cannot think of a single weakness of this course. The main strength is Professor Burdick's experience and expertise. He knows what he's talking about, and his comments were incredibly helpful. It was amazing to see my writing improve right before my eyes. The other strength of our particular course was our class's engagement. Everyone \"bought in\" to the material and wanted to help each other succeed. Workshopping days were intimidating at first but became one of the most valuable aspects of the course.",
                "This course was strong, helpful, and enjoyable. The instructor was invested in his students and their projects.",
                "Great discussion, excellent feedback, engaging workshops. \r\nMaybe put some basic lessons (indirection, e timeline, etc) earlier on in the course"

                "YES! Even if you are not a writer or English major, I think everyone can benefit from this class. It gives you the opportunity to vastly improve your writing, which is a skill everyone needs, and you are able to really devote yourself to a particular subject for the majority of the semester, which turned out to be very gratifying. When I took this class, it was also with a wonderful group of students. I feel like I learned so much from each of them, and I never felt intimidated by them or Professor Burdick when I wanted to share my ideas.",
                "If you are interested in writing (yes about the environment, but truly writing nonfiction in general), you must take this course. Professor Burdick is wonderful, the articles we read are fascinating, and the people who take the class are engaged and excited to be there.",
                "Yes, it is a helpful, inviting course that fosters intellectual curiosity and growth.",
