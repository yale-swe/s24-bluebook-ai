                "Strengths: Ustaadha Sarab is amazing!  She is so kind, patient, and thoughtful.  Another strength of the course is its focus on speaking: I improved so much.\r\n\r\nI think the homework load could be adjusted.  We always had much more homework than we had time to go over in class, which meant I didn't learn as much from it as I could have.  I think a combination of reducing the homework load a little and providing answer keys to students after homework is turned in would help.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I think more frequent reading and writing assignments might be a good idea.  I'm looking ahead to ARBC 150, and there is going to be a big step up in the amount and frequency of reading and writing.  Since it takes a while to build reading and writing skills in Arabic, it might be good to do more of that than is in Al Kitaab or the storybooks.  \r\n\r\nLastly, I would have liked a greater focus on grammar (and case endings), including more explanations and activities in class.  Arabic grammar is so complicated, and it can be hard to learn on your own from a textbook.  Plus, I felt like sometimes I learned concepts for an assignment but never really had the chance to use them in my speaking and writing, and I'm thinking ahead to future classes that will teach grammar even less and assume that you know it.  That being said, I really appreciated that tests weren't just fill-in-the-blank grammar quizzes -- they were much more accurate to how you use language in real life."

                "I would, especially with Ustaadha Sarab!  I would tell students considering the course that it is a bigger time commitment than I realized at first, because you have conversation meetings with TAs for the beginning of the semester and you complete 2 hours a week of one-on-one Natakallam meetings in April.  Plus, I signed up for CLS language tutoring (would recommend!) which adds another hour a week.  I wasn't really aware of how the time commitment would increase in the last month of class, which made scheduling a little difficult, so that is one thing to know.  But it's a great class with a great professor, and Arabic is a wonderful and rewarding language."
