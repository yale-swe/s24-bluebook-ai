                "The strengths of this course is that it forces a very constant exposure to Spanish which inevitably improves ones language ability. The weaknesses are inumerable. Firstly, there is a huge disparity between what is taught in class, and what is expected to be known. Class is filled with assignments which often seem pointless. Outside of class, students are assigned homework which feels tedious and pointless. The only time that I learned Spanish grammar was on my own outside of class or in tutoring sessions which were necessary for the survival of my grade. The class was horrible at teaching Spanish, which for obvious reasons is horrible.",
                "Some more time going over course material in class instead of an activity each day. Also, the first two months covered the first two chapters. The next four weeks covered the next six, so maybe consider spreading those out a bit more.",
                "It was good with  the immersion environment, but the requirements for L2 spanish speakers are very high.",
                "The strengths of this course are its inclusion of the Pic-Nic play by Fernando and Arrabal and its in-class conversations. Talking with classmates and reading challenging texts are valuable skills for improving Spanish language skills. The weaknesses of this course are the department's relatively poor communication, repeated group-assignments, and generally facile homework assignments. During one assignment, for example, we were asked to hand-draw a \"tranquil scene\" of our memory and be prepared to present it in class. This is an inane assignment. It requires spending time sourcing colored pencils and practicing drawing, among other things, rather than focusing on practicing Spanish. This is likewise true for group-projects. Students generally do not speak in Spanish outside of the classroom setting, and especially not beginners, who have difficultly expressing even the most basic demands. The result is that a handful of students--none of whom speak Spanish particularly well, and are therefore in no position to improve their skills through conversing with classmates--meet up and waste time talking in English. This problem could be remedied by assigning fewer group projects are more individual assignments.",
                "professor is a great speaker and well organized with time",
                "You get consistent feedback and guidance. A weakness is that the asynchronous days often feature more work than days when you have class. The work is not difficult, but there is a lot of it. You will have homework every single day, and a few projects throughout the week.",
                "I think the class structure was relatively strong. The only weakness I can think of is the group projects assigned over asynchronous sections. I would just appreciate more warning about group projects and needing to coordinate with others sooner."

                "If you're taking this course, it isn't really a choice. However, this course is horribly organized as is. The class caused much more stress for me than I want to acknowledge. I felt horrifically unprepared for class, and the course content did nothing to prepare me. I had to learn basically everything outside of class on my own or through tutoring. While I could BS my way through most class assignments, I felt very unprepared for each exam. My advice if you have to take this course: start tutoring early, not after you recognize how difficult the class is, and drill grammar and vocab regularly. But fundamentally, the course needs change.",
