                "Through being immersed in works from drastically different cultures and time periods without context to make sense of what I was reading, I learned that one can still use close reading techniques (examining the texts form, the punctuation used, and even the rhyme scheme) to begin to understand it without outside information. The course highlighted that sometimes without contextualization one is able to read even deeper into a text, where approaching its content and form can help unlock its meaning  and new interpretations of its meaning  that having outside information would not contribute to (and could limit a creative reading of the text).",
                "I read so many incredible poems that I had never read before! I learned how to better read poetry and write about poetry. I drew connections between poets in different eras and places. My writing improved: I'm taking more risks in my writing than I did in high school, when I only really wrote cookie-cutter essays. I also learned how a humanities seminar is supposed to be. The readings were enjoyable and interesting, and the discussions were always civil and productive and never dominated by any one person.",

How to read (poetry and academic literary essays in particular)what questions to ask, close reading, what conventions the author leans into or breaks. And in our six units, I got exposure to a wonderful world of poems, history, philosophical texts, and more that I can't imagine encountering anywhere else. As one of my friends put it to me, it's cool when you feel like you understand one local piece in the interlocking web of literature, and that's precisely what this class imparted to us, six times over.",

                "The professors of this course and the Six Pretty Good classes, in general, are incredibly engaging and truly care about crafting a learning experience that benefits you as a student. I also loved reading and discussing new poetry from different literary traditions, and having discussions about the art of poetry itself. I got to learn how to use Yale's writing resources, libraries, and collection. I improved so much as a writer, too, and learned how to write at the college level.",
                "This course was split into two parts: the small seminar, and the larger shared class with the rest of the 'Six Pretty Good' program. In the seminar, we took a trip through 6 different cultures and a crash course on 'pretty good' poems in each. I say poems plural because often we would read philosophical texts, other works, and cultural texts in the unit in order to better understand the context of the poetry. From medieval China to Dante's Comedia to Sor Juana, we travelled all over the world. Amazingly, I can say with some confidence that I am able to now keep up with discussions about such a diverse poetic canon. I was able to learn how to relate to cultural works so different from what I had seen before and how to read into their meaning. \r\n\r\nIn the large class, we focused on hard skills: how to read better, how to write better, how to address professors in and write emails, how to think like a museum curator, how to understand exhibits like the ones in the Beinecke.",

                "I loved this course! The readings were varied and interesting. The in-class discussions were enjoyable and never felt like a waste of time. The writing assignments provided good opportunities for practice and feedback on writing. The professor was amazing. The course and assignments were impeccably organized. I always knew what to expect and what was expected of me. The only unit I didn't like was Dante, because it's impossible to provide all the context necessary to enjoy the piece in the short time that we had. Otherwise, I loved the poems and poets that we focused on in class.\r\n\r\nThe writing labs could be improved if they were half as long and gave students more flexibility. Sessions about things like writing emails are great because they provide valuable skills to students who might not have come from privileged backgrounds, but students who already know what is being taught should have the option to spend the allotted time on other things. The zoom speakers during labs were also not enjoyable. Covid precautions are necessary of course, but zoom for three hours on a Friday afternoon is a bit of a stretch for students.",
                "Strengths: Professor Bender is an amazing instructor who explains concepts in such a concise and illuminating manner that brings you into a text really quickly. The TAs have been really helpful and patient in their feedback. The poems and readings in this class are also very engaging - it offers a much more inclusive body of text as compared to DS and enables you to see the diverse forms of poetry and how people attach different concepts and norms to it, rather than being fixated in a usually euro-centric standard.  You get to practice being on your foot and engage with other peoples observations.\r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\n\r\n1 the sheer breadth of material we cover in this class means we cant engage with any of the texts deeply  - not the kind of depth where one spends an entire year just studying one text and knowing it at the tip of your tongue - but just the depth where one would feel confident explaining why reading this poem is important i.e. why should we care about this poem, knowing that you are actually convinced of its worth even though you might not personally resonate with it. I feel that level of engagement is a minimum for the meaningful approach to any text at all. If not, it would be no different from just reading sparknotes and FEELING like you know everything about it already, when in fact you only know fragmented bits where the text appears interesting.  \r\n\r\n2 a seminar needs to be driven by student input, and a group made up of only first-year students might not be the best deal where we tend to make scattered observations here and there - sometimes they are illuminating - but not conducive for developing a coherent understanding of the text as a whole. \r\n\r\n3 although it is a writing credit, I feel the writing workshops offer limited help in terms of actually improving our writing skills. Peer review is great, but not so much when everyone in the room is a first-year student who isn't entirely clear what is required in a college-level essay. The best way to learn writing is not to listen to a thousand tips and advice but to actually write something, get feedback, work on it again - but the chances to get feedback in this class are really limited, not to mention that two out of six assignments are about writing museum labels which seem relatively irrelevant. Im not sure whether there could be better ways to teach students how to cite secondary resources in an academic article. Functional writing and academic writing are very different practices - yes there are similarities and its important to learn different genres of writing, but Im not sure whether its worth this huge detour and it remains a rather inefficient, confusing approach within the scope of this class to me. \r\n\r\nIn general, I believe the entire six pretty good series could have been a wonderful opportunity for first-year students to engage with the broader humanities subjects primarily through their selected perspective (e.g. poems, journeys), but I feel the current curriculum design is slightly too ambitious, resulting in a highly condensed and thus somehow chaotic experience - think about 100 students trying to have a discussion, or having 4-5 consecutive loosely-related curator talks on a Friday afternoon. Our seminar and the entire six pretty good series would have benefited from a more focused and coherent approach, and possibly a smaller class size. I wouldnt say I regret taking this class - but I genuinely believe the six pretty good series has a lot of potentials to be a much more inspiring class.",
                "strengths: instructor, class discussion\r\nweaknesses: friday seminar felt wholly unnecessary and disjointed and unrelated (how does writing a museum label relate to poetry? and why should those skills of writing specifically be graded when that is not the focus of the class?)",
                "The strengths and weaknesses of this class were connected. The strengths were its sprawling nature. We covered six different traditions of poetry through the lens of a particular poem in each tradition. It was incredible to learn about all these poetic traditions, many of which I knew basically nothing about. I also loved how experimental it was. It felt like we were discovering, with Professor Bender, how this class should be taught. However, there were times were it definitely felt a little chaotic and unorganized. For example, I remain incredibly confused about Indian poetry -- we moved so fast and covered so much that I don't think we had enough time to go into depth about anything in particular. I think picking four great poems instead of six might allow for a little more depth.",
                "This course was much more of a sampling course than I expected. We covered six poems and six different countries and cultures, which gave us circa two weeks per unit. This worked for some texts, like Emily Dickinson and Du Fu, but with others, like Dante and Sor Juana, felt a bit rushed.",
                "This class produced some of the most interesting, engaging conversations I've ever had. Professor Bender always did an amazing the job leading the class in discussion but not dictating it too heavily to the point where we were being spoon fed. My one critique is to let go of the assumption that all students are coming into this class with the same level of base knowledge. Coming from different walks of life, our intelligence does not look the same. I felt at times that I was expected to be on the same page as my peers, and realistically, that was not going to always happen. If anything, I think the class overall would benefit from asking how both the professors and TFs can create an environment where it is okay to say \"I don't know.\"",
                "Strengths: Professor Bender and the TFs Ryan and Allen were absolutely phenomenal instructors of the course who constantly engaged us in seminar discussions and gave us individualized feedback on our writing. It was also exciting to read poetry from East and Southeast Asia, which is not commonly taught in literature classes, and to be exposed to scholarly readings of these texts. While long, the writing labs taught me how to close read literary texts, how to write a thesis and paragraphs, how to structure an essay, and more.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The two weekly readings for the course often varied greatly in page length, depending on which of the six poetry units we were learning about. Because of COVID, the in-person museum and collections visits were very few and were often limited in time since the 100 students from all of the Six Pretty Good courses had to be divided into groups. While the writing labs were beneficial to my writing, there were sometimes 5-15 minute periods of time where we sat waiting for instructions and not making use of the time.\r\n\r\n(Side note: The professors of this course were incredibly concerned about student feedback and they also implemented changes to the course in the last half of the semester to serve our needs, so I am sure that most of these weaknesses will be resolved to better the experience of future classes.)",
                "Strengths: absolutely amazing for a whirlwind introduction to a large variety of works and for developing better analytical and writing skills that will help you throughout the rest of your time at Yale. Also allows you to meet so many other well-spoken, intelligent, passionate first-years because of the format of the larger seminar. The large class does a great job of also breaking down writing into small steps, which helps level the playing field, so you definitely don't have to be great at writing going in. We went from how to build a thesis to how to integrate quotes to how to plan an essay, so you won't have any trouble keeping up. Also, we got to explore so many locations at Yale, like the Beinecke, West Campus, etc, so it really felt like taking a field trip every few weeks :D\r\nWeakness: the only thing I wish is that this class was longer! Because of the format, you feel as if you've just reached the tip of some deeper insight right before you have to move on. Also, some people may say that there was a lack of continuity between the large and small seminar  personally, this made the course even more fun for me, because it was like a 2-for-1 deal; you sign up to learn about poetry and somehow end up debating how ethical Yale's collections are!",
                "Strengths: Professor Bender and the TA's taught the class in an engaging manner\r\nWeaknesses: Too much similarity between poem",
                "Both Professor and TA assigned-reading discussions were well-organized and provided the guidance necessary in better understanding the texts.  However, due to all the curriculum content and time constraints, the readings could only be read at face value before moving on to the next unit. Though I enjoyed learning every unit, I struggled halfway into the semester in keeping up with subsequent readings, rather than focusing on in-depth analysis. Either lessening certain units readings or removing a unit or two would help with this conflict.",
                "While I really enjoyed the structure of the course, at times it felt like we weren't able to dedicate enough time to the poetry we were reading just by nature of having so much content to read.",
                "The course utilized the sections very well, although the larger class on Fridays often felt unnecessary, too long, and cumbersome.",
                "More scheduled writing sessions between teaching fellows and their assigned students during writing labs.",
                "Strengths: The discussions and background readings make otherwise very difficult works of literature fairly accessible and even enjoyable - I almost always looked forward to class, and enjoyed discussing the material afterwards with friends. Professor Bender and the TFs really know what they're talking about, and also take ideas from students seriously\/are willing to consider alternate interpretations of various works. Workload is significant but more than manageable (and professors tended to be sympathetic); essay feedback is generally good.\r\nWeaknesses: Course assignments sometimes felt scattered or not well-explained, probably because of the seminar+writing lab format (I received several due dates for our final assignment, for example). However, the professors were always very helpful and approachable, and so it was fairly easy to ask for help or clarification."

It doesn't matter if you've read any poetry before (I basically hadn't), if you're thinking of majoring in the humanities (I'm not), or if you're unfamiliar with the history and cultures that the material is drawn from (I was). You'll learn so much, from each other and the TFs and the professor. It was definitely my most memorable class, and the one where I expect I'll carry the most ideas forward from it through the rest of my life, both on individual poems and on reading poetry in general.",

The readings were all worthwhile and the discussions were highly engaging, especially with Professor Bender's leading questions and genuine interest in everything the students had to say.

I found this class valuable for my overall learning of important texts from various cultures and times as well as for improving my writing.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in poetry and who is maybe inclined to try something different and more experimental than a normal class.

                "Yes! If you like poetry or are just willing to immerse yourself within it, this is an amazing class taught by an amazing professor. I guarantee that you will walk away with deeper insights and fantastic discussions about what poetry is. You will also be able to learn so much in such a short amount of time, about cultures that you were not at all familiar with before. Sure, it was a lot of work: sometimes there's 80 pages of reading per class. However, that isn't really unique to this class, and honestly it's so, so worth it, considering what you get out of it (which is exactly what you put in). This is, without doubt, the kind of class I came to Yale for.",
                "I'd recommend this course if a student desires to explore other cultures' poets and poetry. However, if they'd rather focus on improving their writing skills, I'd look for another writing credit.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The poetry we read was very inspiring and helped me learn about a variety of different traditions. I would have loved to see poets included from Africa as well.",
                "Yes, Prof. Bender put his whole heart into this class and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in learning about poetry and history across cultures. I learned so much about major world religions and history in addition to poetry and how to analyze it. It also gave me a great appreciation for detail in art and poetry.",
                "Yes! This was a great introduction to humanities\/literature at Yale - the collections visits were helpful for becoming acquainted with various resources, the papers were good for adjusting to college-level writing, the poems were challenging but rewarding once I started to figure them out, and I generally enjoyed discussions.\r\nI especially recommend this class if you haven't yet learned how to close read a text."
