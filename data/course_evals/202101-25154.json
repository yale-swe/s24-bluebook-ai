                "The course has an excellent syllabus. The films we watched were great  I've never taken a film class at Yale with such enjoyable movies. Even the films I didn't like were interesting and sparked good discussions. Prof. Forster is also great about giving thoughtful and in-depth feedback on everything you submit. \r\nThe main weakness of the course was that sometimes class felt a little stunted. It was often hard for us to find a rhythm as a class and even though Prof. Forster always came prepared with discussion questions, sometimes those discussion questions made us veer even further off track or made people feel hesitant to speak. I think a lot of this awkwardness would go away in person, though.",
                "Strengths: the films!! Prof. Forster picked out a great set of films to watch. The blog posts and papers were also so fun to write, I hate writing in general but I really really enjoyed these assignments. Weakness: maybe the readings. It was quite a bit of work in the beginning, but once Prof. Forster made some of the readings suggested it became much more manageable.",
                "Strengths: presentations were a good way to stay engaged. I think the chat function was actually very fruitful in this class. Since Zoom school I think this is the only class I've taken where the chat function actually enriched the course. I also think the Tuesday film\/TV confessions bit was great for encouraging participation. \r\n\r\n2 films\/week was kinda a lot sometimes, especially with reading due for each class. I think that combined with the blog posts was a lot.",
                "This course is really reading heavy, and at times the workload felt a little overwhelming\/unmanageable (even though I really was trying to keep up and be an active student).",
                "The only weakness was that she of the readings were very dense and philosophical which I had trouble understanding so on those weeks it was a little difficult to keep up with multiple readings and a film. However, one of the main strengths was that Prof Forster adjusted the syllabus based off of our feedback and so that got much better by week 4. The strengths was that the readings and films were amazing. Also Prof Forster asked really great questions and was very receptive to us.",
                "I think the film selection and discussions were really really strong. Sometimes I wished the essays had fewer specific requirements, and were a little bit more open ended, so we could explore a little more broadly, but I also felt that the constraints helped strengthen my writing.",
                "The films are the greatest strength of this course. We watched a lot of films that you wouldn't find in other film classes. The readings are interesting, but could sometimes be very dense and we wouldn't always have time to get to each of them in class. Being able to watch the films together and discuss in person would have been great for this class as discussion over Zoom was sometimes difficult."

                "Student presentations were very helpful at summarizing the readings and the films and were a good addition to the start of classes on Zoom.

                "I think small Zoom discussions are pretty effective. Ive never been a fan of breakout rooms though.",
                "The individual presentations were helpful in dissecting some difficult readings and posing interesting questions to get discussion started. Rewatching clips together was another good tool to go over specific scenes and break up discussion. The couple mess we used the whiteboard and annotate functions on Zoom were fun and allowed everyone to chime in and could have been used more often."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a good film class for students interested in the topic but afraid of taking a course in the film department. The workload is very fair and the films are easy to engage with. Some of the readings are a little difficult, but Prof. Forster was aware of that and tried to walk us through them. I think the course would be much better in person where in-person class can really benefit from the seminar style.",
                "I would!!! Sometimes the workload felt like a lot but Professor Forster was incredibly accommodating, and who else can say they watch rom coms for class? It was definitely one of those classes where you got out what you put into it.",
                "For those interested in learning about desirability and romance, this is the class to take. I think the focus on old Hollywood was also really helpful as someone interested in familiarizing myself with film history.",

                "Yes, it was a great way to learn more critically about films many of us already loved.",
