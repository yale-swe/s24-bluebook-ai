                "We managed to read every line of the play in Greek very carefully. Sometimes it felt like the heavy linguistic focus meant that our discussions were secondary\/of less importance. Particularly at the end of the course, we ran out of time to discuss our English readings.",
                "The repetitiveness of class is a weakness of this course--by the 14th seminar or so, each class begins to feel similar, and we almost get lost in the thick of the play. But conversely, the strength is studying a play this closely. My favorite strength about this course is how deep we went into the Greek language, and we always connected meaning to the text itself."

                "I am glad that the class was synchronous, and it allowed for a discussion that would have been very similar to class. Perhaps an occasional screen share or blackboard could have been helpful, but this class was run about as well as an online class can be."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class. I have developed such an appreciation for Antigone (and Greek tragedy in general) and its tremendous literary, social, and political complexities. It is seriously one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and I would recommend it to anyone with the requisite skills in Greek.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Antigone, Sophocles, Greek tragedy, or Attic Greek. Antigone has had many fascinating political, philosophical and literary incarnations and reading the play so thoroughly in the original made me aware of many dynamics I hadn't seen when I read the play in English. Our occasional forays into reception and secondary literature were also interesting, though they didn't inform most of our classwork; if your main interest isn't in Greek but rather in the ideas of Antigone, you might feel frustrated because we spent more time on deictic pronouns, for example, than on Jean Anouilh. But for anyone who loves\/wants to improve their Greek and is interested in Antigone herself, Antigone the play, or Greek itself, the balance between language and ideas will not disappoint. The final paper gives you a bit of space to really think for yourself on the (a) meaning(s) of the play  I think you could consider the implications of Antigone very well on your own time, but analyzing Sophocles' language on your own is significantly more challenging.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any student who already has a firm grasp of Ancient Greek but wishes to push their understanding of the language even further. Professor Bakker will make a student who feels confident in their Greek abilities realize that they have so much farther to go, but he does so in a supportive, never condescending way. For any who either want to major in Greek or just love the language, I strongly recommend this course. I would NOT recommend this course to someone who is somewhat interested in Ancient Greek language but prefers studying its culture and reception. You will find the Greek very difficult and demanding."
