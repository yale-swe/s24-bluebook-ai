                "Id say the main strengths of the course are the instructor and TA (which this year were Professor Toseland and Natalia). I think especially early on in the thesis writing process, its expected that you struggle with some aspect of the project  not just small coding bugs, but potentially also more bigger picture structure of your theoretical economic model, empirical model to analyze data, research question, etc. Especially if you are unable to meet with your advisor regularly or have significantly constrained time to ask questions, I found Natalia and Professor Toseland as great resources  especially for questions you think may be too basic to ask your professor, or just want a sounding board to help get you unstuck, this class serves as a wonderful resource. Like many things at Yale, the resource is there, but how much you get out of it depends on how much you use it!",
                "The strength of the course is that Rebecca brings an infectious energy to the senior essay writing workshop that is needed in order to bring excitement to writing a daunting and lengthy essay. She is flexible and constantly asks for feedback. The weakness of the course was that many of the concepts covered were not broadly applicable to all essays. Further, writing groups were more difficult to connect with in practice than in theory. It may have been a good idea to set aside time during the class period to meet and catch up with writing groups.",
                "The methods lectures were interesting but I would have preferred higher in-person attendance. My level of engagement wasn't as high as I would have liked because there were barely any people in class."
