Also learned how to write visual analysis papers.",
                "I learned the history, art and culture of the Italian Renaissance and the major families and players in artistic and architectural development of cities in 1300-1600 Italy. Through the readings, I developed a better understanding of the discipline of art history and how to apply techniques for analysis of visual art, whether it be sculpture, drawings or paintings.",

                "Strengths: The course is very organized and engaging. Each lecture follows a clear theme and the lectures build on each other in a way that makes a lot of sense. The assignments are interesting and you have a lot of freedom to write about what you're interested in; the assignments also help you understand the material better. The exams are fair and push you to fully comprehend the contents. Finally, the weekly discussion sections are by far the highlight! Almost every section was held in the YUAG, and it was awesome to be able to spend 50min a week to hang out in the art gallery and talk about Renaissance art.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The penultimate lecture on Columbus \/ explorations into South America felt a bit random and not as interesting, though I can understand how it relates to the class. Other than that, I really enjoyed all the lectures and always looked forward to class.",
                "Having section once a week in the art gallery was a really great way to solidify key terms and concepts by applying them to visual analysis of works that we could see up close. The course was very well organized in terms of content and never felt like it was difficult to keep up or keep track of what was going on. I was always engaged in lecture & felt like I left each one having learned a lot. It was a great way to start my tuesdays & thursdays.",
                "The lectures are engaging and well-organized. The course is also very approachable for those without previous experience analyzing art or much previous knowledge of art history.",
                "It was a very well organised course. Very easy to follow and to know what was expected of you.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ng is a super engaging lecturer, what is expected of the exams\/papers is very clear. Weaknesses: none. This is a really great class that can be taken as a great fifth class. I would recommend to ANYONE!",
                "This course is so well organized! Professor Ngs lectures are incredible and kept me so engaged. The readings and guest lectures were also very engaging. I could not think of a better way to learn about the Italian Renaissance.",
                "Strengths: well organized course, engaging lectures and professor, great discussion section. students were clearly interested in the material in the way they would ask and answer questions in lecture and section.\r\nWeaknesses: 9:25 am lecture (the time)."

                "yes",
                "Yes, 100%! This was my favorite art history class that I've taken at Yale. It's so well organized and clear. I learned so much about the Italian Renaissance that I am excited to apply to future museum visits. What is also special about this class is that it shows you that the legacy of the Renaissance is in fact everywhere around us. Now, when I walk through Sterling, I find myself thinking \"wow all this microarchitecture.\" Overall, a fantastic course that is low workload and very accessible to non-majors. A must-take for anyone interested in art history or the Renaissance!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, HSAR major or not! This is an approachable course even if you don't have much experience with visual analysis, but do be aware they expect a fairly high level of analytical thinking with respect to the works. That said, don't let it deter you because you'll learn a lot in this course, get to go to the art gallery very frequently, and have the opportunity to hear lectures from Professor Ng which can't be beat. You'll learn a lot from the readings too, which aren't very extensive but if you're interested in primary source material written by renaissance artists that's an added bonus that really adds a lot of context to their works.",
                "Yes, it's a great course",
                "Yes. This is great to expand your social understanding of the great art works in history.",
                "Yes! I definitely recommend to anyone interested in art history - this was my first art history class and I really enjoyed it and never felt like it was too difficult to understand.",
                "Highly! As a senior, this was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Please take this course if youre remotely interested in Art or Art History. I learned so much about how to analyze and critique pieces of art and place them in a historical context.",
                "Yes, if you like art history\/european art! It might be relatively difficult for someone completely new to art history, but it was a super well-organized course that encouraged student participation and learning. Lectures were amazing by Professor Ng, he clearly had a plan of what to cover per lecture and timed them very well. It is quite memorization heavy (memorizing identifications of artworks can add up very quickly) but it was a course that is worth taking. So much of the Western world is shaped by Renaissance art and you'll have a better understanding of the world at large."
