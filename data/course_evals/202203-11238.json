It largely focuses on the macroscopic side of physical chemistry, with primary focuses on ideal and real gas behavior, thermodynamics, chemical equilibrium, and kinetics. Through the course, you also learn a lot about problem solving and equation manipulations.",

                "This class expanded on a lot of topics you learn in general chemistry. Topics included ideal and real gases, thermodynamics, solutions, equilibrium, and kinetics. It was very interesting to learn more about where you get the equations you used in gen chem from. The course helps you develop skill in how to think about chemical systems and how they work.",

                "Peer tutor hours were a great resource for this class. I wish there was 1 more peer tutor though who could have held peer tutor hours as well as the peer tutor sessions would get kind of packed with people. A strength of this course is that in the beginning, we went through concepts clearly and slowly. The professor taught really well and made sure that we were understanding the problems at hand. After thanksgiving break though, things started to move a lot faster and we covered a lot of material in a very short amount of time. This was a major weakness.",
                "Professor Zhu's lecture notes were fantastic. When the lectures themselves sometimes felt a little disconnected, the notes always put the key concepts together logically and succinctly. The lectures themselves were organized logically as well, but could feel disconnected moving from one lecture to the next.",
                "It was well-taught and organized. The psets and exams were pretty straightforward from the lectures",
                "I think the teaching was really clear, as well as the notes uploaded to canvas. I wish that office hours were more accessible and consistent; it was difficult sometimes to get ahold of the teaching team with questions. I think returning to the 3 midterm format would be helpful, so that students can engage with most, if not all, of the material in an exam format prior to the final exam. Additionally, the ability to drop the lowest exam can be helpful. I also would have been in favor of having an assignment over the summer which allows students to refresh the basics (calculus, general chemistry rules) so that we can hit the ground running when the semester starts. The end of the semester packed a lot of material in, which felt rushed. More practice would also be helpful.",
                "Honestly, I don't think this class had glaring weaknesses. It was well put together, reasonable, filled with resources, and interesting.",
                "A strength is that it was always clear what we needed to learn/what was not directly relevant but rather just an example to further our understanding. The content followed the textbook closely so it was easy to get practice problems and have another source to review from. The problem sets were a good length and was all helpful in better comprehending the course material. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: very well organized course, material was interesting and well-covered, exams were fair, problem sets supplemented lectures very well\r\nWeaknesses: 9:25am start time :(",
                "Lectures could have been more organized; some topics did not flow very logically. Equation reference sheets should have been given before the exam to aid in preparation, possibility of cheating is not a good enough reason to deprive students of an equation sheet. Problem sets were very comprehensive and helped to prepare students well for exam questions.",
                "Strength: reasonable workload, good pace, exams of reasonable length and difficulty.\r\nWeakness: exams had to be taken in the blue books. taking the exams on white paper with the questions printed on them would've been much preferable -- more space to write, no lined paper, you can skip questions without leaving space for your work later...",
                "taught well, more pracrice problems",
                "The sections were kind of slow-moving, and I didn't find them helpful. I thought the problem sets were really helpful in terms of material and difficulty -- I felt like I learned a lot by doing them. Prof. Zhu was a great lecturer, and I felt engaged in class.",
                "A strength was definitely the clear instruction, supported by the detailed class notes. This allowed me to focus on engaging in class, while also having ample resources to do a thorough review after class. Another strength was the very manageable workload in terms of problem sets, but which also still enhanced my understanding each week.",
                "One of the strengths of this course was that Professor Zhu provided us with lecture notes. One of the weaknesses was that we could have done more practice problems in class to prepare us for exams.",
                "Strengths: lectures were very clear with emphasis on derivations, excellent lecture notes were uploaded weekly, problem sets were great preparation for the exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: amazing amazing amazing professor (very knowledgable, cares a lot about the subject and his students, very generous with answering questions and office hours), very helpful peer tutors, very organized lecture notes, textbook is actually helpful for practice problems, section was actually helpful in doing practice problems, tests/final was very fair, very interesting content taught very intuitively (especially if you are good with derivations/simple calculus)\r\nWeaknesses: none to identify (just prepare significant figures before the class)",
                "Prof. Zhu is a wonderful lecturer, and the pace of the course is perfect - slow enough to follow the concept, but not so slow that the course is boring. The problem sets were pertinent to the course material and were difficult but not impossible, and the tests were fair. All of the instructors were super accessible, either through office hours or email.",
                "Overall, the course is pretty strong and taught extremely well. The course is also fairly well-organized, with all problem sets being due on the same day every week and with the beginning of most classes being dedicated to course logistics announcements. In terms of its content, while I am aware that the course largely follows along with Atkins' Physical Chemistry, I felt that there wasn't a strong emphasis on the thermodynamics of chemical reactions (which is more relevant for many students taking this class, relative to gas dynamics), and I also felt that there wasn't a strong emphasis on deviations from general principles. While we left the class with a comprehensive understanding of chemical processes generally, only a few examples of the behavior of real substances was shown in class, and none were thoroughly explained.",
                "Poorly organized instruction and office hours. Professor office hours were stable but only for 1 hour a week at an inconvenient time (not near class time at all). TAs did not send out info on their office hours, also only 1 hour a week. Peer tutors changed their office hours every week, very difficult to keep track.",
                "Strengths: Professor Zhu was a very effective, thorough, and responsive instructor. Assignments and exams were fair. Lecture notes were well done and useful for review. \r\nNo real weaknesses considering the significant pedagogical pitfalls of some other upper level science courses."

I think the best thing I can say about it was its consistency. While the pacing and proceeding of the class didn't change that much from week to week, it was consistently a solid class. The PSets weren't that time consuming, and the exams were fair and reasonable.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this class, especially if you found general chemistry interesting (or even if you didn't, it helped me gain a better appreciation for those topics even though I didn't enjoy them as much in gen chem).",

                "Sure",
                "Yes, CHEM 332 is a great introduction to physical chemistry. Follows up very lucidly from general chemistry. P-sets are pretty short. You don't have to memorize any equations so the exams are pretty breezy too.",
                "yes",
                "Anyone reading this probably has to take the course, but I would say definitely try to take it with Prof. Zhu! He made the class really engaging, and he gave us lots of resources to help make the material manageable!",
                "Yes, I would. It is a core requirement of the chemistry major and also one that is both accessible and interesting.",
                "Not unless it is a requirement or you are passionate about the subject.",
                "Yes. The topic is very interesting and the course is very well organized!",
                "VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Obviously required for the chem major but even for people in other stem majors (any bio major for example, and also physics), this content will be very helpful and it is taught beautifully. The professor is absolutely awesome and really will ensure that you learn a lot.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested in the thermodynamics of chemical processes. I would also recommend this course to any student who wants to learn about chemical processes covered in the previous chemistry classes in great mathematical rigor and detail. Any student who takes this course should have a strong understanding of differential + integral calculus, and ideally an understanding of partial derivatives (although most necessary multivariable calculus is covered within the course).",
                "The course material is interesting but there was no clear information on grading or ways to improve. Also 9:25 is very early in the morning.",
                "You're probably taking this because it's required. It's a good course for learning the content."
