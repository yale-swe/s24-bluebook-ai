The professor himself often started the conversation to lead into the discussion, which I found very effective. \r\nThe group work also didn't lag behind because private rooms and shared google documents worked out pretty well."

The variety of topics covered in the course is impressive. It perfectly balances academic rigor and a friendly environment for development. The topics of discussion weren't limited to the writings, but films also took a fair amount of time."
