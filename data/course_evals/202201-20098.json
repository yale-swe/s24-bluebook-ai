But, there's a huge amount of non-stem people taking this course usually, so it's fun to bond with them over your mutual knowledge that while you're not going to continue this you're all here for the ride. I did also learn some fun things about the universe as a whole, so I wouldn't say I regret taking this class!",

You learn about topics such as relativity, black holes, and dark matter, which are subsequently broken down in ways which make them more comprehensible to non-astro majors. I would say the pset math did not really develop my understanding as it was far too complicated to understand as a non-stem major.",

More specifically, the course focuses on three major themes: 1.) Measuring distance to various objects in the universe; 2.) Galaxy formation (discussing the various types of galaxies, exploring how they form \/ evolve, their properties, and star formation); 3.) The \"Big Bang\" model of the universe. There are some other topics which are discussed as well, some of the most interesting involving: dark matter, dark energy, black holes, time dilation, time travel, String Theory (multiverse \/ parallel universes), and simulation theory [String and Simulation Theory aren't taught, they are just discussed a couple times because many students find them interesting topics, and they really do make for fun discussion]. All of this is explained in a very easy format, and you actually do just soak up the required info when you come to class \/ discussion sections and watch the lecture videos.",

            "comments": [
                "The model of the course was a little confusing and the PSETS don't often explain themselves. It was usually up to us asking the TFs for a lot of help and needing to get clarification on a lot of little things.",
                "It is nice that the course placed an emphasis on group work and collaboration and I think that the subject matter is really interesting even to people who don't study astro-physics. However, the course is entirely inaccessible to entry-level, non-stem majors. The recorded lectures are available to review but the concepts are often not deconstructed enough for understanding. Further, the math component of the course completely went over my head and I think that made success on the exams and problem sets feel unobtainable. In the future, I think explaining the concepts in class would help as we would be able to ask questions to facilitate understanding. Most importantly, I think it would be helpful if math problems were perhaps not as wordy or longwinded- sometimes its hard to understand what it is you need to do. Additionally, teaching the methodology of solving problems would be tremendously helpful. I know it is emphasized that students should understand the concepts, not memorize equations, but for non-math people learning an equation or methodology to solving a problem can contextualize the concepts a lot better.",
                "Doctor Faison has built a brilliant curriculum within this course for Yale students. He teaches with passion and great enthusiasm. The TFs are also amazing, and they really go out of their way in helping to ensure students can easily grasp the concepts in the course. Students really enjoy this class! Doctor Faison has structured the course to support students of all types (even the math phobic ones like me). Students have all of the tools available to succeed. Meaning: come to class, watch the weekly discussion videos, do the assignments, come to a few of the optional discussion sections (or office hours) when you have questions, and you will pass with flying colors. The course is laid out so you just absorb all of the information as you move through the course. \r\n\r\nOther massive strengths: The focus is NOT on being a QR \/ STEM prodigy. The weekly assignments (problem sets) place an emphasis on comprehension of the material and understanding the methods behind the concepts relating to astronomy and the 3 major themes, not on computational perfection 100% of the time. A student who shows the methods they used and demonstrates that they grasp the concepts behind the material, even if they sometimes reach the wrong answer, will ALWAYS get a decent grade on the problem sets. In addition, for the exams you are not expected to memorize the various formulas you encounter throughout the course. Instead, on exams you will be provided a sheet with formulas relating to astronomy. From the beginning students are told that the concepts behind the course are the most important, and this is true. Come to class and discussion sections, watch the discussion videos, and you will literally absorb everything you need to know. It is likely that this may even become one of your favorite classes.\r\n\r\nAnother important strength: The problem sets are always harder than the two exams (midterm and final), to ensure that if a student understands the problem sets, then they will excel on the exams. There are not a lot of problem sets, only 11 total if I remember correctly. There are only two tests \/ exams which are the midterm and final.",
                "Not a fan of the flipped classroom format",
                "The strengths include the professor, who was very passionate about the subject material and also a very good lecturer along with the subject matter being so intrinsically interesting as well. The glaring weakness for me is definitely the flipped classroom format which included watching 2-3 20-30 min videos (very variable though) before a week of classes. Professor Faison says its not double the work but it really is because you study the same topics when watching the lecture videos and then do the same thing in class which feels like studying double definitely.",
                "Stengths - the material is interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the classroom is a flipped. This means you will spend twice as long per week in lectures in person and online. There is about 5-6 hours of lecture each week, instead of 2.5. The instructor is not lenient in grading. The nature of the course takes this interesting stuff and makes you regret wanting to learn it.",
                "I thought it was great!",
                "This class is flawless. It is a great intro class for anyone who has any interested in the \"space\" that we are living in. The video lectures are extremely clear and the discussion in class is extremely engaging and mind opening. Yet this is a pretty chill QR class.",
                "The class could be a little bit better for non-STEM majors, but it definitely doesn't assume prior knowledge",
                "A strength is you don't really have to do any extra supplementary work to do well in the course since it's set up to have the class sessions as practice sessions. I found the course lectures, class sessions, and section to be enough to be confident in doing the Psets. One thing is that the textbook seems to be much more geared towards content in the course ASTR 110 rather than cosmology, so its less helpful in this course.",
                "The flipped structure of the course makes it difficult to understand what is going on.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is that it is NOT meant for non-majors. This felt like an introductory course for the astronomy major. I dislike the exam formats as well.",
                "I believe that the difficulty of the problem sets was not coherent.",
                "Cool material, well presented, manageable work",
                "This course was well organized, and pretty easy to follow. I appreciate that there were discussion sections which helped. However, I did not like the flipped classroom. It was hard to stay engaged when the lectures were recorded.",
                "Strengths: time to ask Professor questions during office hours aka accessibility of Professor \r\nWeaknesses: how far discussion section was, how fast we did practice problems in class, not going over step by step process of practice problems during class",
                "Strengths: if you do all the work it teaches you really well, prof is super fun and engaging, class is structured in a cool way\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: doing all of the work takes way more time than prof claims it does (lectures and readings to do outside of class, and in order to do the problem sets you needed to look at all the optional resources too, and problem sets took so long), also sometimes the problem sets had things that hadnt been mentioned in lectures, readings, or classes.",
                "It was a very engaging course. All of the recorded lectures were very interesting and clear. It worked really well with the flipped classroom design. I have no criticisms of the course.",
                "The course was interesting, although the reasoning behind the math and theories were rarely explained in detail and I often found myself plugging in numbers to equations without knowing why or how the variables were related. The cours, although supposedly for non-STEM majors, was definitely geared more towards STEM inclined people.",
                "This class is taught in a flipped classroom method, which makes learning the complicated concepts extremely difficult. There is little to no help from the professor or from teaching fellows, and the class moves with the assumption that everyone is extremely proficient in the mathematical skills required to solve, even though the class is advertiser as an introductory class. Class time is wasted solving problems that the professor declines to correct or explain. Overall, this class is poorly taught and extremely difficult to follow unless one is proficient in mathematics, despite being an introductory course."

                "This course is not a gut!! Lots of information to study for the midterm and final exam. I had to go to office hours once per week to figure out the problem sets. Definitely not a walk in the park.",
                "If you're looking for a good QR credit or intro into astronomy, you should take it! It's not a gut (grand unified theory (haha astronomy joke get it proof I took the class)) but it is a normal workload and teaches you stuff while simultaneously not expecting you to really have a huge background. I didn't take any physics prior and I did fine.",
                "NO, I do not recommend this course to another student, unless they have a strong math and science background. Don't be fooled, there isn't much about this course that is introductory. Lectures are recorded, which allows for topics to be revisited, but often the concepts are not simplified enough. By far, the greatest challenge is the math. The formulas aren't extremely difficult but the problems are long, wordy, and difficult to comprehend. If you don't go to office hours multiple times a week you probably won't do well on the problem sets and the exams are similarly challenging. If you are a non-stem major just looking for a credit DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS it way too much work.",
                "This is not a gut. He says so in the syllabus, but please believe it. If you are interested in putting in the work and learning about astronomy, this is a great class. If your expectation is to breeze by, this is not the class for you. The concepts are reasonably complicated and it's essential that you go to class + office hours in order to complete the Psets. I found the exams pretty challenging as well. If you are prepared to study hard and spend a decent amount of time on each pset, then there is no reason for you not to take this class.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Doctor Faison has designed the course for students of all kinds (not just math geniuses) to be able to absorb the material through active class participation (so don't miss class! If you miss class, how will you absorb the material??!) All you have to do to succeed in this course is this: 1) Come to class. 2) Watch the pre-recorded lecture videos 3) Do the eleven (I think?) problem sets 4) Come to some of the optional discussion sections if you have questions on the problem sets.... and that's it. I guarantee you that this course will end up being one the most fun, interesting courses you take at Yale. \r\n\r\n***Also at least once during the course you will visit the astronomy observatory at night in an (optional) class field trip and look at a lot of cool interesting things. Very fun. Very cool.",
                "Yes, but only if you're looking for a QR\/SC gut",
                "If you're looking for a science credit, for sure. A word of caution, this is not a gut at all. You will have to work hard to learn and prepare for exams along with the 11 psets which are also pretty tough to complete correctly if you do not have a grasp of the concepts being taught in class. If you're fine with all that, then it is a good class with very interesting topics regarding stars, galaxies, the big bang and other cosmic phenomena.",
                "I honestly cannot recommend this course. There is way too much time expected from you, and the cool stuff that you've always wondered about space is presented in a way that will make you hate learning about it. I wish there was a different course and instructor for this material because it's actually really cool -- the instructor and the way he expects you to learn about it (e.g. flipped classroom, strict grading) just makes you want to not learn about it.",
                "Yep!",
                "Yes please take this course even just for fun!",
                "Yes if you are a non-STEM major who prefers astronomy or physics to bio, but it's definitely not a gut or easy class for non-STEM people, so as long as you go into it with that expectation",
                "I would recommend this course to another student is they were interested in astronomy specifically and have taken ASTR 110 before and enjoyed it.",
                "No, it's a lot of work and causes unnecessary stress.",
                "I guess I would, but not as an I need a science\/QR credit course. It is quite difficult.",

Even though intro classes don't count toward the major and aren't necessarily meant for actual astrophysics majors, this class is a great survey of many topics within the major. It is challenging and it gives you a good idea of what you are getting into as an astrophysics major.",
