                "A broad understanding of the backbone of embryophyte tree of life, an appreciation of angiosperm diversity, and more in-depth knowledge of particularly important and well-studied clades. More importantly, this course provided an opportunity for me to think about plants as models to understand processes of evolution that I had only previously seen investigated in metazoans.",
                "This is one of the classes I've learned the most at at Yale. You don't realize how much you don't know about plants until you start thinking about how they work, and this course covers so much material. It changes how you walk around because you are always thinking about the plants you've learned about.",
                "I learned a lot about plants and their phylogenetic relationships",
                "Phylogeny of major plant groups and some plant physiology. \r\nI would definitely recommend taking the lab!",
                "I gained insights as to the evolutions of plants throughout history. We learned about the evolution of plant traits, life cycles of plants, and detailed looks into plant systems such as photosynthesis.",
                "I learned a lot about the evolutionary history of plants, key adaptations, and important clades, plus some plant physiology and identification. We also talked about common trends in plant evolution, like parallel\/convergent evolution, and evolving around constraints. Overall, I appreciate how this class explored evolution and phylogeny through the lens of plants. I chose the class because I am really interested in evolution, and I definitely got that out of the class, but I learned so many new things about plants, and I don't think I would have realized how interesting and diverse they are without having taken this course.",
                "I learned so much about plants. This course truly opened up a new world for me and now I see so much life around me. I also improved my science communication skills with the creative assignments!",

            "comments": [
                "I think any survey 'ology' course of a large and complex clade such as plants suffers from focusing on particular sub-clades and ignoring others, but this has without a doubt been the best E&EB lecture that I've taken.",
                "I think that Professor Edwards adjusted weaknesses as they came up so I don't think there were really any drawbacks. The strengths are that you learn a ton, there isn't too much work aside from studying and memorization, and Professor Edwards is an amazing instructor.",
                "The lectures were very well organized and I feel like I learned a lot about plants. I don't feel like there were any real weaknesses of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Edwards is very passionate about the content and does everything she can to make the class fun and engaging. The quizzes before each midterm helped to clarify the types of questions that would be asked on the exams. There was some memorization, but less than I expected, and for people interested in botany the memorization is all very useful. \r\nWeaknesses: More clear feedback on exams would have been helpful. Sometimes my answers would be marked as correct even when there were some errors, so I was not always confident in my understanding of the material.",
                "There are often things that you may not understand until you are taking the exam\/tests. I believe this could be improved with more structured practice through problem set homework rather than assigned readings. The quizzes were helpful for practice, but working through homework problems would be extremely beneficial.",
                "Great class, no improvements",
                "I really enjoyed Professor Edwards' lectures because they were really clear and engaging, introduced a lot of interesting research, and she always took the time to answer questions and explore what we were interested in talking about. I think the whiteboard talks were my favorite part of lecture, but I also appreciated having the lecture slides because I liked being able to look at pictures of the plants we were talking about, and to look at figures from different papers together.",
                "This course was very strong because it combined chalk talks which were great for conceptual learning and slides which had many examples and cool things that got me excited about the content. It was super helpful to have quizzes too.",
                "Strength is the spread of knowledge which does not force someone to try to be a botanist overnight, but allows for appreciation to the width of the field.  Weakness is the amount of information given orally or written on a board which makes it slightly harder to go back and pick up details when compared to courses with all published slides and texts.",
                "The slideshows showcasing the breadth of diversity were really interesting, and the board lecture format was really useful for learning the biological processes we discussed in the class - it was a good pace, and the drawings helped to explain the material. The quizzes were definitely helpful in preparing for the midterm and final exams. For the slideshows and overall, a bit more structure would have been helpful for connecting the classes together, since there was so much information presented that it was sometimes hard to know what to focus on\/take away from a specific lecture and how it related to other concepts we discussed. For the papers, it was interesting to read them and see what types of papers are written in this field, but sometimes they felt disconnected from the topics we discussed in class since they seemed to be discussing topics at either a much more specific or much broader level than the material we covered. It was great to watch everyone's creature cast projects at the end of the class.",
                "This class is extremely heavy on memorization and testing to the extent that it detracted from the learning experience. I also felt like the expectations for what we were supposed to study were never clear in advance. There were two midterms, three quizzes, and then a take-home final exam. It felt like we were being tested relentlessly almost every week in the middle of the semester, and studying (even just for the quizzes) was a vast undertaking, given how hella confusing literally everything was. When we got tests back, they were scored without a lot of feedback, so there was no way to know the correct answers (or even trust that things that were marked correct were actually right, as the TFs were known to let accuracy slide on tough questions). So it was hard to learn from the tests\/quizzes, and there was minimal feedback provided beyond them. There was SO MUCH to memorize all the time--confusing life cycles, names and characteristics of clades, phylogenies, etc. These challenges were compounded by the fact that we were given very confusing expectations about what to study for each test. There was one test where we were explicitly told that we only needed to know stuff that we'd learned since the previous midterm, and then guess what was actually on the test--stuff from before then! So the tests were very frustrating, and they were a very significant proportion of the class.   \r\n\r\nIn the future, I would strongly recommend replacing the quizzes with problem sets. This would help students engage with the material in a constructive way and help students learn what to expect from tests in a lower-stakes way. This would make the class a significantly less stressful experience, and would be way more helpful than blindly studying everything before a quiz and then realizing that you'd studied all the wrong things, which is how I felt after every quiz."

                "Absolutely. Even if you've had no exposure to plants or even organismal biology before, Professor Edwards will welcome and support you, and eagerly introduce you to the world of plants.",
                "Yes! It's a fascinating class for anyone, though it is definitely E&EB heavy. Still, you learn so many fun things about plants!",

                "This course will definitely take a lot of time out of your week with reviewing and studying. The sheer amount of memorization is daunting, and having a study partner\/group helps tremendously. I would recommend it only if you are prepared to put in the time needed to tackle these tasks of rewriting and reviewing almost all of the content before each exam.",
                "Definitely! Professor Edwards is a wonderful instructor and person, and the course content is extremely fascinating.",
                "Yes definitely! As an EEB major, I really appreciated learning more about evolution and phylogeny, something that I was already interested and pretty familiar with going into it, but I also ended up learning a ton of new things about plants. Professor Edwards is an amazing professor - her lectures are super clear and engaging and she really makes you care about plants. I will say that if you like plants and are looking for an easy science credit this class might not be the best pick because there is a decent amount of memorization, but if you are interested in biology and are willing to put in a bit of time memorizing this class is really fun!",
                "Yes! This course is very interesting, informative, and unique and the professor is great.",
                "It is a great higher elective to diversify a bio major's view of the biosphere.  And for non-bio majors, it still gives a great insight to very familiar organisms. Would recommend to any person seriously considering learning more about plants.",
                "Yes - for those interested in plants or with an interest in evolutionary biology, this is a great and fascinating course that will teach you about the mechanics of life as a plant, the evolutionary history of plants, and the incredibly wide range of diversity within plants as a group. There is a strong emphasis on memorization with the plant phylogenies, but the final project option to make a CreatureCast video is a very cool and creative way to end the class, and you will be able to carry a lot of new plant knowledge with you going forward!",
                "I was really excited about this class because I thought it would be an immersive exposure to the world of plants around me. While parts of it were certainly interesting, it ended up being a lot more stressful than it was worth. I took this class for fun, and expected to credit-d it. I'm really glad I credit-d'd this class, because otherwise it would have been unreasonably stressful, but for a class that I was credit-d'ing, it was way more trouble than it was worth. Because of the frequency of tests and the all-encompassing nature of the final project, this class took over my brain just like Poaceae took over the world (something you will learn about if you take this class). I had to be heavily invested in it just to complete everything, even though I wasn't taking it for a grade, which was kind of annoying. While I went through the whole semester with the intention of credit-d'ing it, many of my classmates who hadn't planned to credit-d the class ended up doing so because it was so chaotic. \r\n\r\nIf you're deciding whether to take this class, be sure to check whether there are still 3 quizzes and 2 midterms. If the quizzes have been changed to psets or something, that's a good sign.",
