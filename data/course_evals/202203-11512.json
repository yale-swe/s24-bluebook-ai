Tobi is an amazing teacher who ensures that everyone is caught up on what exactly he is talking about, to the point where even if you do not truly care about what a french intellectual has to say about what's happening in America, he makes you care. Just for this I'd recommend the course, but beyond that the material is also engaging and interesting, and Tobi's feedback remains the best I've received from a teacher.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. The readings were interesting and covered a wide variety of \"rebel writing\" styles. I felt like the papers were also fun. For example, the research paper had you explore anything rebel, rebellion-centric, which lent itself to a host of topics. Also last paper was a manifesto, which was creative writing adjacent, also making it enjoyable."
