    "Arabic 150 with Professor Elbousty allows you to improve your writing, speaking, reading, and understanding. It truly is a comprehensive course that allows you to improve in all areas.",
    "developed my arabic writing, reading, speaking, and vocabulary especially pertaining to current events and politics in the arab world",
    "My arabic reading and presenting skills really improved considerably in this class. I become so much better at reading news articles and opinion pieces regarding what's going on the Middle East. I also learned a whole lot about the politics and history of various countries in the Middle East. I also learned how to respond extemporaneously to other students' comments made in class",
    "I was able to develop a new appreciation for the Arab world and middle eastern politics. This was unlike any other language class I have taken because we spent a lot of time talking about contemporary issues in the language, which was much more beneficial for me to grow as an Arabic student.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. Take it if you want to learn more Arabic but also take it to engage in a high-quality Middle East current events and affairs seminar. Professor Elbousty has designed this course such that each week students focus on a theme related to the Middle East. In this session we each chose a country to focus our studies on and spoke about: Refugees and Statelessness, Women and Society, Islam and Democracy, Climate Change in the Middle East, and Authoritarianism (especially in the time of Covid-19). Unlike any other Arabic course you will take, this one will help you learn how to speak about important issues. You will be able to debate in Arabic, present policy proposals in Arabic, do public speaking in Arabic. This is truly so much more than just a language course... it's an enlightening experience. Professor Elbousty has designed it in a way that really helps you to develop and share your own personal beliefs on these important issues. The nearly 7 hours of in-class instruction every week were never dull, by the end of each meeting you won't want to leave.",
    "Coming from Arabic 140, my language skills improved immensely. Before this class, I could not read more than half a page of Arabic in a two hour session; now, I am up to two and a half pages. My speaking skills skyrocketed, and I got better at listening, though I still need more improvement in that regard. Thanks to Professor Elbousty, I am way more confident in my Arabic than I ever have been, and I am thrilled at the progress I have made. I am excited to continue progressing in the future.",
    "Speaking, reading, and listening to comprehension. The course focused on complex and relevant topics.",
    "This course offered an opportunity to really develop a lot of Arabic skills and expand my knowledge of the Middle East (as colonial as that term is, I am not aware of a better alternative). Our readings were all from various news outlets in the Arab world, which really helped strengthen my reading abilities beyond the previous textbook readings of L1-L4. Because we did multiple written reflections a week, this course also saw a marked improvement in my writing. I think that I wrote more for this class than I did in perhaps an entire semester of L3. And, that's not a bad thing, because it really was a way to improve my writing and the feedback we received was really detailed and very timely, so it never felt like I was going at it alone. Professor Elbousty's insistence on MSA in speaking, while difficult, definitely forced me to try to formulate better sentences and communicate at a higher register. And, of course, as we progressed through the course, my lexicon expanded dramatically.",
    "I improved in my reading, speaking, and writing skills in Arabic."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course are the variety of assignments we have. For example, assignments varied between written reflections, in class presentations, news presentations, videos, and more. Another major strength is Professor Elbousty! He is so kind, willing to help, and truly there to make the course an enjoyable and effective experience.",
    "it was very well structured which was a strength and a weakness. On the one hand, it was good to have a consistent routine in terms of workload and expectations. However it could be tedious at times to do the exact same assignments and some variety of the material we studied (not just politics) might have been nice. However overall the course was very good.",
    "Really very few weaknesses if any. The type of people in the class was very self-selecting, which meant that all of us were completely committed to improving our Arabic skills. This facilitated wonderful conversations, which were led wonderfully by Dr. Elbousty and Shady. Also another strength was the length of the news articles. They were just the right length for us to read it in a timely fashion.",
    "One core strength of this class was the discussion-based atmosphere of the class. Rather than being lectured by the professor for 2 hours, Professor Elbousty moderated our discussions and allowed us to control where the conversation goes. This allowed me as a student to grow as a speaker in Arabic while also it helped improve my listening and analytical skills in Arabic. It is evident that Dr. Elbousty put a lot of effort into planning the course for us because there was never a moment where I felt uninterested or \"bored\" in the class. There was always something exciting to talk about and the professor's enthusiasm about the topics made it that much more interesting. The class was also moderated by a dedicated TA, Shady, who put his heart into making the class enjoyable for us. \r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I can confidently say there were no weaknesses given the circumstances, and this was easily one of the smoothest and favorite classes I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "The strengths are that the course focuses on relevant language skills and does not only teach you those skills but helps you put those skills to use in real time through short presentations at the beginning of each class and one bigger one at the end of the week, as well as, one-on-one conversations with peers and an open discussion that every one is encouraged to participate in during each meeting. I would not be able to come up with weaknesses if I sit in front of this computer screen for hours trying to think of them. It was truly an amazing experience and I am really sad that it is over so soon, I will miss Professor Elbousty and the amazing group of peers I was blessed with.",
    "Strengths: reading prepares you, fantastic and engaging discussion, extremely enthusiastic teacher in Professor Elbousty (and TA in Shady, though he may not be here to TA in future years as he has now graduated,) thrilled and excited students (this was my class specifically, but even still due to the small numbers of the NELC and MMES majors, my experience has been that students at Yale who take Arabic take it for the language rather than for the language credit.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think I need more opportunities for dialogue rather than monologue, and this course lends itself (as it is a seminar style, which I loved) to talking in monologue. Both skills are necessary.",
    "The course was extremely organized. Each week was organized topically, which allowed students to learn and practice new vocabulary.",
    "The strengths of this course, as I've already detailed, are in the different kinds of work in which one is required to engage. There's a lot of reading, writing, speaking, and even listening that's occurring, so as a result, one is being challenged on all fronts. Much more than a traditional in-person class, I think that the online format, while sad because of our current circumstances, was really useful in that it allowed for a lot of flexibility with the way the sessions played out. I find no weaknesses significant enough to type out, but I would appreciate a little bit of grammar review. Arabic grammar is difficult, to say the least, and without the resources of being on campus, I wouldn't mind an opportunity to review that a small bit.",
    "It is just perfect."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely! If you want to improve all aspects of your Arabic, this class is a great way to do that. It's also a really fun experience at the same time.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! It was so much fun, and I learned so much not just from Dr. Elbousty and Shady but also from the rest of my peers. I had such a great time in class since everyone was so committed to learning and improving. I also highly recommend taking this class if you are interested in Middle East current events.",
    "Absolutely. This language class is not the typical language class where you sit down and learn a list of new words and grammar rules and then get tested on them every week. Instead, this class is centered around talking about politics, culture, entertainment, and much more solely in Arabic. This allowed me as a student to develop my vocabulary and lexicon in a much more rapid manner since I was exposed to many more words and ideas from the students and professors in the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another students. if your looking for an advanced level Arabic course and are at the L5 level you would be remiss not to take this course.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Professor Elbousty is fantastic, the class is great, and if you are like me, who is not a native heritage speaker and is looking to improve my Arabic, I got so much better.\r\n\r\nI will say, if you have the chance to take this class in Morocco, or another study abroad opportunity (hopefully with a language pledge), you should do that. I couldn't because of COVID-19, but it will help your Arabic language skills much more if you study in an Arabic-speaking country.",
    "Yesthe course allowed students to practice language skills and engage with relevant topics.",
    "Naturally, this is a course I'd recommend to anyone in the Arabic program. Whereas L1-L4 are focused on \"learning\" the Arabic language, this class is the first that is focused on using it. That's not to say that the other classes don't use the language, but that in L5, the level of language proficiency is high enough such that the focus is on the discussion and not on learning new vocab words and such.",
    "Definitely, but be ready to be challenged."
