                "Without a doubt, the biggest strength of this course was Professor Lourdes. With a class that meets 5 times a week, it is extremely difficult to keep a class engaging every day. However, I feel like Prof. Lourdes created activities and assigned work that was not only worth while, but also very engaging. The activities in class were always great. In terms of weaknesses, the system of learning is based on doing the homework, and then spending some class time reinforcing what you should have learned on the homework. I think this is a little faulty, and that is would be better if we were at least introduced to the content a little bit before having to learn it to do the work."
