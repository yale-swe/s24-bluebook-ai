I really improved my nonfiction writing abilities in this class and am a much more confident writer now.  This course was very empowering.",
                "I learned a lot of different writing techniques for personal essays.",

                "I gained the confidence to write and the specific literary tools to write creative non-fiction",
                "This class allowed me to improve on all aspects of my writing skills. I learned how to better write personal essays, humor essays, place essays, cultural criticism essays and more. I was able to find my voice as an author and figure out what style of writing is most effective for myself and for the readers.",
                "This class really helped improve my writing skills. I wish I would have taken it my first semester at Yale, but I am glad I took it anyways. This class helped me in every other writing assignment of other courses. This class is a must!"

            "comments": [
                "The readings in the class were both interesting and engaging. I learned a ton both from my fellow students and well as Professor Saraceni. The only suggestion I might make is to incorporate more free-writes, sharing pieces of what we were writing, or otherwise something other than talking about the assigned texts to break things up.",
                "I love the collaborative writing community that this course creates.  Writing workshops were great exercises to become more comfortable sharing writing with peers and the feedback offered by my classmates and Prof. Saraceni was extremely helpful.  I loved the five units (personal essay, place, profile, cultural criticism, and humor).  The pace of the class felt quick at times -- there were quick turnarounds to decide topics for subsequent essays after turning in previous ones, but this class always kept me active and there was plenty of time to revise essays after writing initial drafts.",
                "I haven't enjoyed writing all that much in previous courses, but this class genuinely changed how I viewed writing essays. I liked how each unit of the course required a draft and revision. This made me a lot more comfortable with experimenting with the various techniques that were discussed during class discussions.",
                "This course was good in that we read many essays and talked about how the authors wrote them. I also liked how we have drafts and a final revision so you get feedback on almost every essay. I think that perhaps in the future, the class should get to know each other and the professor better since there was moments of awkwardness.",
                "The course was ideal for a writing course. It took seminar format and provided sufficient free time to work on writing creatively",
                "I appreciate how this course was organized and structured. It was very clear which assignments were due in what days and I felt that the readings correlated well to the writing assignments. To improve, I wish the course gave a little more space between essays because I was unable to receive feedback from my last essay before the next one was due. This sometimes hindered my ability to prevent mistakes from happening multiple times."

                "I cannot recommend English 120 enough. Professor Saraceni was an absolute joy to be in class with, and you could tell that she genuinely cares about her students and their well being. The class was interesting, well-organized, and you can tell that Prof. Saraceni spends a lot of time reading and thinking about your writing based on the quality of feedback you receive. I thought the class was a pretty manageable amount of work-the turnaround time for some of the essays felt a little bit quick, but it's never overwhelming and Professor Saraceni goes out of her way to be accommodating.",
                "Definitely -- this course was absolutely wonderful.  It's a great course to fulfill your writing credit and become a more confident writer in non-academic writing.  This class inspired me to take more nonfiction writing classes at Yale and potentially contribute to campus publications.  Take it with Prof. Saraceni if you can, she is amazing!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to improve their writing in a pretty relaxed and supportive environment. The essays covered in class are incredibly digestible for the most part, and are mostly short and sweet. This course also encourages you to emulate the techniques that many of these authors employ in their essays. The topics that we were asked to write essays about were interesting, but broad at the same time. I never really felt restricted about what I would eventually write about, and Professor Saraceni was incredibly accommodating and helpful. The workshops for each unit we covered were also a big source of my enjoyment of this class. Receiving genuine feedback from classmates who were all incredible writers helped me grow as a writer. I really enjoyed this class and as someone who doesn't write often I definitely, definitely recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. This was my first creative writing class and it really helped to open my eyes toward the field of writing.",
                "Absolutely! Great way to get started writing.",
                "Yes, I would recommend that everyone take this course. I think it provides a vital foundation for writing in college and gives the student more confidence in their abilities moving forward.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It really improved my writing and was given great feedback and writing strategies."
