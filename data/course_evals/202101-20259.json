                "I learned SO MUCH in this class! This course is full of incredibly important history that really is not taught in other classes (which, after taking this class, is absolutely infuriating and unacceptable). Every single unit was full of new and really really fascinating information that was delivered in such a thoughtful way. Rich also does an amazing job incorporating primary sources in a way that makes students comfortable using them. I really learned how to analyze these sources well in this class. This class also really challenges students to think about this history really critically, constantly connecting it to our current health systems.",
                "I learned more about the racial biases in medicine, specifically womens reproductive medicine, from the 1800s through present day.",
                "I learned about the history of reproduction in America from the 17th century until now. We examined this history from the lens of various races and ethnicities of women, physicians, midwives, activists, and men. We also focused on the changes in attitudes relating to birthgivers' positions in society, physicians' statuses in society, birth control's place in reproductive rights, and advancements in reproductive science and technology.",
                "Having never before studied history of reproductive health, this course opened my eyes to the depth of social and political history around various topics ranging from the development of birth control to the shift from home to hospital births, to the ways in which race and class deeply impact reproductive health outcomes and histories. Professor Rich offered an intersectional lens on reproductive health, connecting it to US histories around slavery, Puerto Rico, and colonization/imperialism.",
                "I learned so much in this course: multiple histories of reproductive health in the US, how to think critically about historical content and reproductive health, and how these histories affect reproductive health in the present day.",
                "This course created space for us to think critically about reproduction and the ways in which historical context frames how the process of pregnancy, birthing, and women's bodies are conceptualized and regulated. As someone studying biology, I found this course to be so incredibly important for future physicians and researchers, as well as policymakers and honestly every community member. I am so appreciative of the frameworks that this class introduced me to and illuminated how deeply issues of reproduction affect society and individuals' experiences.",
                "I learned so much in this class. I have always been interested in reproductive health care but this class provided such an in depth and nuanced perspective on the history of reproductive health. Everything I learned in this class built on past knowledge to give me a really well rounded understanding. Loved!",
                "A sense of the themes in American reproductive medicine and healthcare from the early 1800s to the present day and how legacies from the past continue to influence today's healthcare system; close-reading of primary sources; drawing connections between time periods and looking for moments of rupture/continuity.",
                "I learned so much about the history of reproductive medicine and reproductive activism and historical conceptions of motherhood and childbirth, and gained really valuable insight into the origins of the medical institutions I engage with regularly.",
                "A general history of women's reproductive health in the U.S., a plethora of resources to continue exploring this topic beyond the classroom, an abilityi to contextualize this history within U.S. history and legacies of eugenics, a new habit of ending lectures with the intent to ask myself what questions regarding this topic can I now attempt to answer.",

                "I didn't realize how little I knew about the complexities of reproductive health history in America, but I feel as if I know a lot more than I did before about the areas of history typically left out. I have a lot of new respect for the black women we learned about in this class, and the struggle that was given to get to the place we are today. I think this class was extremely enlightening (and sobering) in that regard.",

In addition, from the papers and exams, I learned how to write cohesively and develop my writing, logical organization, and analytical skills.",

                "The major strength of this course is Professor Rich. The content would have been. interesting on its own, but I. do believe that the way Rich organized it and delivered it made all the difference. I looked forward to this class every week and always walked out of lectures having learned something new. I honestly am not sure how it could be improved - I would not change anything about my experience in this class.",
                "Weakness - Lectures could go a little fast at times are were not recorded, so if you missed it, you missed it. Strengths - Prof. Rich and her teaching time are AMAZING. I have never been so engaged in a course or felt so cared for by a professor.",
                "The course was very engaging and offered different modes of learning (movies, open discussion, etc.). All of these things made it a great course.",
                "The strength of this course is Professor Miriam Rich herself and the sections led by the TA! They are so engaging, and the classes feel somewhat like seminars, where students are given the chance to participate and get instant feedback from Professor Rich if they would like to participate. Professor Rich made this class extremely organized, so the content never felt overwhelming for us to take in. The TA sections complemented what we learned in class well and facilitated further discussion about the history of reproduction. A big strength of this class was that Professor Rich and our TA encouraged us to read primary sources and think like a historian. She would often guide us through primary source reading exercises and help us formulate our own opinions about the sources as if a historian would. I think this skill is not only important for future history courses we want to take but also for any other future discipline we want to pursue as students. I cannot think of any weaknesses that this class could have improved on.",
                "Professor Rich and the TAs were really the strength of this class -- especially in such a rough pandemic semester, their kindness and level of caring for their students meant the world. I also really enjoyed Professor Rich's teaching style, both in terms of the ways she taught in an interdisciplinary manner, and in the way she wove in student participation organically during virtual lectures. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses in particular come to mind! There are other topics that I'd love to have covered, but that's mostly just a function of a short semester.",
                "This course was incredibly thoughtfully designed. I really appreciated how content was provided in such an organized, clear, meaningful way. The breadth of content covered did not prevent us from discussing each topic in depth and making meaningful connections across units.",
                "This course has a lot of strengths in terms of teaching students to read primary sources, write critical analysis pieces that contextualize an issue, all whilst providing students with a tremendous support system. I honestly can't think of a single weakness of this course and feel that it should be a course that every student takes before graduating!",
                "I thought that this was a fantastic class, and I learned a ton. I definitely came into the course with a general understanding of themes in American reproductive health and medicine, but Professor Rich laid them out and drew connections that really added to my understanding of and interest in these topics.",
                "I found both the lectures and the discussion sections to be very interesting and engaging. My only suggestion for improvement would be recording the lectures - it would be very helpful for reviewing and take some pressure off of note-taking during class.",
                "This course did not aim to cover too much material, which I have noticed many Yale lecture courses do. This class focused on just reproductive history, regarding women, in the U.S. and this framing allowed us to cover every unit in depth. I felt that I left this class with the ability to speak and write lengthy descriptions of this history and how it connects to U.S. history at large as well as the legacy of eugenics. This is the perfect lecture course for someone looking to receive an introductory course that takes a niche topic and demonstrates how it can be so interconnected with other histories. The level of work was extremely reasonable and the professor and TA's were responsive to occurrences and adjusted their expectations of students accordingly. This course was always a source of genuine intellectual curiosity for me.",
                "Professor Rich is an absoulte strength of the course! By far was the most attentive and compassionate professor I've had in the last 1.5 years of online classes. I think that her ability to engage students into the lecture material and create interesting dialogue across an array of materials was what made the class very rewarding. In terms of improvement, I think that having a bit more clarity on how to improve my analysis and contextualization of topics on the essay would be helpful otherwise this was a phenomenal class!",
                "Strengths: I think Professor Rich offered a lot of great information, and the class had a perfect interaction level.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the amount of reading was excessive at points.",
                "Miriam Rich is a great lecturer and knows how to not pack too much in each lecture, and knows when taking time to review or to ensure that people know the concepts of imperialism is most helpful. a weakness is that a rubric or examples of historical analysis would be helpful for Paper 1 and 2 especially for non-history students",
                "The lecture and course material were well compiled in such a way that the connection to previous and future lecture units was incredibly clear, establishing a depth to the course material in relation to one another that would've been difficult to convey as effectively and clear as professor Rich did. \r\n\r\nBecause of the brevity of the semester, there were a few topics acknowledged that I would've appreciated greater depth on; however, they tended to be niche topics that would require a whole other course to explore.",
                "The course was incredibly well-structured (with each unit seamlessly entering the next, and core themes connecting the units together).",
                "I learned so much from this course. All the readings and lectures were very informative.",
                "This class was full of strengths! Truly an amazing professor and TAs who were very passionate about what they were teaching. There was so much thought placed into every lecture and discussion section. As a woman of color, it was the first time I learned about histories of reproductive medicine and oppression and it was radical. Having the ability to learn about the very difficult histories of reproductive medicine of poor people of color, but also about how women of color are reshaping healthcare infrastructure was empowering and hopeful.",

                "this class had such a great learning environment so I felt like I was really able to learn and enjoy the class. I always looked forward to this class because it was so engaging and the material is presented in a digestible manner.",
                "I think it was a wonderful course, the instructor and teaching assistants were very engaging.",
                "Strengths \r\n-Great introductory overview \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I wish that there were more opportunities to discuss these issues global",
                "I liked how this course covered a wide variety of reproductive health issues, some of which I didn't even realize were relevant. I appreciated how the different units were all interconnected. The readings were well-selected (and not overwhelming!).",
                "All strengths: great lectures, great TFs",
                "The class does a great job of incorporating class readings into the larger lecture in a way that is organic. It is also structured in a way that is conducive to make connections throughout concepts.",
                "strengths: great teaching team!",
                "This course allowed for great exposure to a lot of different areas of reproductive health, the assignments and readings gave a lot of freedom to explore specific interests within the broader context of the course. Likewise the discussion sections were structured in a way that fostered critical thinking, collaborative conversations, and examination of one's own personal connection to reproduction both past and present.",
                "This was a fantastic course overall. There were absolutely no weaknesses and the lectures were always so well thought-out and delivered.",
                "The class was extremely interesting and in the beginning was very connected and engaging but towards the end I did not connect with it as much. The end of the semester got a little hectic and crazy so it would have been helpful for the lectures to be recorded.",
                "The lecture slides effectively transmitted key points. Super engaging readings. Interesting assignmentsfelt motivated to do them unlike other classes. Wonderful overall.",
                "Amazing course! TAs and Professor Rich were amazing and accommodating in the pandemic. No weaknesses",
                "Strengths topic itself, weaknesses was the way the lectures were presented in the fact that very few incorporated other types of media and most were read. readings were interesting but unfortunately were too long to be realistically manageable for an intro level course.",
                "The structure of the course is very organized and Professor Rich was very understanding.",
                "One major strength of the course is how intentional the instruction was. Reproductive health is a serious and often grim topic, and so much emotion and politics get interwoven in the discussions surrounding people's reproductive rights. Both the professors and the TAs were very patient with students' comfort levels with certain topics, and they made sure to present the readings/lecture info in a way that wasn't damaging, dismissive, or whitewashed. A weakness of this class is that some weeks had a lot of reading, which sometimes made it difficult to keep up (especially during weeks in which writing assignments were also assigned). Also, the class starts off very intensely with slavery and how the field of OBGYN was built off the nonconsensual experimentation of enslaved Black people. While this is an important starting point, I wish there was a way the professor could have eased us into the history of reproductive health instead of throwing us right into a topic as triggering as slavery."

                "My TA did an amazing job creating community in our virtual section by spending time doing icebreakers and checking in with us emotionally, while also making sure to ask questions that provoked interesting discussions.\r\n\r\nI also liked how Professor Rich utilized the chat function for class participation -- it made it less intimidating to answer questions in lecture, and prevented those awkward pauses that happen otherwise. Her use of primary sources and images for us to analyze in class together really helped keep virtual lecture interesting and engaging.",
                "This is by far the most engaging virtual lecture that I've had during the pandemic. Dr. Rich always made sure to check in with us and placed importance on our wellbeing, which created a wonderfully supportive virtual classroom environment.",
                "The only aspect of this course that I would've hoped to have improved would be recording the lectures and posting the slides in advance. Without the lectures being recorded, it was honestly a bit stressful when something would come up related to family crises, mental health issues, or vaccine side effects, or a plethora of other reasons why someone might have to leave class. I really appreciated how accommodating this course was in terms of assignments and deadlines, but I do think recording the lectures would have been super helpful for staying engaged and decreasing stress.",
                "Although I understand Professor Rich's choice to only have live lectures and not record them, that was really the one thing I would change about the class. Flexibility is so necessary right now and I really wish I could've had the recordings to look back on to review or if I really needed to skip a session. For some classes it would be okay without recordings, since the slides provide a lot of the info, but for this class, Professor Rich provided so much context and depth in her description and analysis of slides that I would've preferred to have it recorded as well.",
                "Prof. Rich was really accommodating with everything that occurred this semester, so I appreciated that. However, I do feel that it would have been nice to have the lecture slides posted since the classes were not recorded, or perhaps just a one-page summary of the lecture. I felt like sometimes I missed a concept when I was taking notes and I had no resources to find the information I was missing.",
                "Professor Rich and the TFs were all incredibly thoughtful this semester. I think they did a wonderful job of balancing a full and enriching class with fascinating readings and interesting assignments, all while being thoughtful about how students were doing and making themselves available for additional support.",
                "See above",
                "Posting lectures slides, adapting to include a mini rest week from classes at midterm, restructuring the midterms and final exams to be more considerate of the conditions students were working in were all really appreciated and made me feel as if at least one of my professors lived outside of the realm of academia and cared about students",
                "This course adapted to the COVID pandemic better than any other course that I have taken here. Professor Rich and my TF were extremely understanding and diligent in adapting the course to make learning a priority over other tedious aspects of taking other yale courses during the pandemic.",
                "I think the lectures being recorded would have been beneficial.",
                "although there were no recorded lectures, Professor Rich lectured at such a good pace that there wasn't a need to actually have access to a recording to make sure i understood everything",
                "Prof Rich and the TAs were all extremely understanding and considerate about all of us throughout the semester. They have been one of the few classes that have gone out of their way to prioritize ourselves over deadlines and academics when we needed it",
                "The flexibility with campus events and tragedies were incredibly humanizing and keeping the environment as one where effective learning could happen throughout the rest of the semester, something many other course failed to do.\r\n\r\nIf possible, it would've been appreciated if live lecture was recorded; however due to the engaging and interactive nature of the lectures that made them so effective, I respect Professors Rich's choice not to do so.",
                "Overall, the professor and the teaching team were extraordinarily accommodating and understanding of the tough virtual semester. They were very understanding with formatting the final and midterm in a way that allowed for flexibility. They were also very understanding in giving extensions.\r\n\r\nI wish the professor had recorded her lectures, so that they could be referenced later, but that was not a big issue.",
                "Flexilibyt with examinations and papers was so appreciated. One of the few classes that offered this much flexibility and care for the students. Appreciate it so much",
                "I loved section",
                "flexible because of covid which was really appreciated",
                "The courses break week was much appreciated. The professor and TF were incredibly understanding of how difficult this semester was and I honestly think I learned the most in this class (compared to other courses this semester) because of it",
                "During the pandemic and other events happening on campus/in the world, Professor Rich and the rest of the teaching team were extremely understanding and flexible with deadlines, always making sure that our mental health and well being came first.",
                "The course staff did an excellent job of combating burnout and allowing flexibility in our schedule and assignments to lessen workload with everything going on locally on campus along with going to school during a pandemic",
                "The virtual lectures and discussion sections paired with the readings worked in a way to allow for in-depth learning. Because of time zones, I would have liked if lectures were recorded.",
                "I really appreciated how accommodating the teaching team was during COVID. They seemed reasonable with deadlines and we were given periods of time to write our final exams (this helped so much with stress!). we were also given an ad hoc break week, which was greatly appreciated!",
                "It would have been really nice for lectures to be recorded but otherwise good. I think this class would be even more engaging in person.",
                "This class was my favorite class and the teaching staff organized it to facilitate students learning. They were compassionate and understanding, which ultimately made me more excited to participate in class.",
                "Success were discussion sections, although I wish the lectures were recorded for later review.",
                "The structure of Zoom helped in keeping up with the lectures. However, it also made speaking up in lectures or talking in discussion sections awkward and unnatural."

                "Absolutely. If you are a premed student, do not become a doctor without taking this course, even if you are not interested in reproductive health. Even if you are not premed, this course is absolutely amazing and I guarantee that you will learn something new. I am a social science major and was familiar with all of the major themes that this course revolves around, but it was still a course that really changed my perspective. The assignments were all very manageable and never seemed like busy work. I cannot recommend this course enough.",
                "YES!!!!! Take this class even if you know nothing / do not care about reproductive health. I would say I'm pretty interested in repro health, so I wasn't sure what I was going to get out of this class. However, the level of understanding I left the class with makes it worthwhile to any Yalie.",
                "Yes, Professor Rich is a sweetheart and also a very informative professor. Her way of teaching the course units was engaging and made students look forward to class.",
                "Yes! This is a must-take history course at Yale, especially if Professor Rich is teaching! The course material is always engaging and inspires thought and reflection, and I think the history of reproduction is very little known outside of activism circles. I have found the material we learned to be so helpful in understanding greater themes present in history, such as family life, the role of women and medical authority in society, the role of birth control,  and scientific advancements related to family planning and reproductive rights.",
                "Yes! Professor Rich was such an amazing professor who truly understood and valued the mental well being of her student during such a difficult time. The material itself was also super interesting and I really enjoyed the way in which the class was structured. It was clear that the focus of the class was to allow students to really learn and interact with the themes and material over just pure memorize and regurgitation of the information on exams.",
                "I definitely would! As someone who has never taken an HSHM course or learned about the history of reproductive health, I'm really glad I took this class. It was the perfect balance of fascinating content while not being too overwhelming in terms of courseload, and has a low barrier to entry for those who are interested in the topic or don't come from an HSHM background. Professor Rich also picks a great mix of readings and primary sources; I genuinely enjoyed doing the readings for class and never felt like I knew exactly what was coming next!",
                "Yes, this course is amazing! I think everyone should learn about the history of reproductive health regardless of their major because it is so interwoven in this country's history and politics. You will learn so much important history if you take this course.",
                "This course was one of my favorite classes that I've ever taken at Yale. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in reproductive health, justice, and generally interested in contextualizing current health inequities.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student (and I have)! An incredible class with in-depth, nuanced teaching and readings. I have learned so much and had so many interesting discussions about the course material both in and out of the class.",
                "Yes, I would. The concepts are interesting and the papers are not too difficult. I loved having a discussion section to go through the concepts we learned about in class. Also, Prof. Rich does a fantastic job of selecting interesting readings I never felt like I was doing work for the class.",
                "Yes, yes, yes! Great class, great readings, great professor, great TFs. I wouldn't say the content itself was earth-shattering, especially if you're somebody who spends a lot of time thinking about and advocating in these spaces already, but having it laid out so clearly and within its historical context was incredibly interesting even if I wasn't shocked by the overarching course themes.",
                "Yes, absolutely - I would recommend this course to any and all students, not only those interested in HSHM. I think the information I learned from this class is extremely valuable and worthwhile to all people.",
                "This course is a great introductory course that dives into the interconnected nature of any history. I recommend it for any student interested in history, history of medicine, or would like to think in terms of connections between different histories. The course will leave you with many resources and new language to describe these events.",
                "Absoultely! This class broaches important consideration of topics in reproductive health history into the present while creating space for critical analysis of sources and perspectives.",
                "Yes, especially students who are interested in medicine, healthcare, or public health.",
                "Yes! I think this is a part of history seldom talked about, and should definitely be discussed more.",
                "yes. just need to do weekly readings, review Professor Rich's slides, and review everything in discussion section. no surprises with this class.",
                "Yes!!",
                "Highly recommend, the lectures were intriguing, the readings varied, and it seemed like a very accessible class for those outside of the HSHM major such as myself.",
                "Absolutely. The course provided pertinent information to historically inform current debates on abortion / reproductive justice, and complex ideas were  distilled in an accessible manner.",
                "Absolutelythis was one of the best classes Ive taken at yale",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to everyone, not just women. I think it's so important to understand the roots of how reproduction has shaped the lived experience of everyone in America.",
                "Absolutely! I would especially recommend this course to other pre-med students because science alone is insufficient in preparation for being healthcare professionals. You get the opportunity to learn about how medical authority has shaped the lives of marginalized groups as well as how their interaction with present-day medicine has been informed by histories of being purposefully misserved.",
                "100% Take this class, take it with Prof Rich, and learn. So much to learn, contribute, and educate yourself on. You will come out of this class every day feeling enlightened and empowered",
                "Absolutely. One of my favorite classes at Yale",
                "yes !!!!! take this class! The material is so important and its such a great class. Professor and TAs are so great.",
                "I would, Professor Rich is a wonderful professor and the course material is interesting and relevant.",
                "Yes! It's a history everyone should know. Reproductive justice is health justice.",
                "Absolutely! Such an interesting course, especially for any premed students",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was so lucky to be able to take it (since it hadn't been offered in the past couple of years), and did not regret it at all. If you are a pre-med student, I think this course is very beneficial in seeing how different groups of people had (and have) different reproductive health experiences, especially how inherent racism and classism exists in the medical system.",
                "Absolutely! really a must for any student at yale that is interested in history, medicine, reproductive rights, feminism, race studies, etc!",
                "Yes! This class brought up a lot of important topics and Prof. Rich did a great job presenting the material in a way that was sensitive of how the things we were talking about impacted peoples lives experiences. Also, the readings were highly enjoyable and interesting.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in reproductive health or public health, this class is so interesting!",
                "Yes! This course is easily accessible to all students of different learning backgrounds. Overall, the class will change the way you look at reproductive healthcare systems and policies.",
                "Without a doubt. This is such a fascinating look into the history of reproductive health and if you have any interested in the field whatsoever, it's a must. It feels like a really great stepping stone into a deeper dive into this topic as there are so many directions to follow.",
                "In the future I hope that more male students take it. I know that men are generally not drawn to this type of thing but what we learned about power dynamics and society's obsession of control over fundamental female rights was so important it should be known by everybody.",
                "Highly recommend. Lovely professor and teaching staff. The content is very engaging and I have internalized many concepts. Reframed how I approach the study of history and introduced me to new lenses to contextualize history. I have a greater appreciation for the importance of context in history.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, good and relevant content.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student! It is extremely interesting information, and the class itself is not very difficult to do well in. I would especially recommend this course to a pre-med student because it's very helpful in understanding why certain groups of people feel negatively towards the health field in the present today. Essentially, it provides a holistic view of the history of the health field.",
                "100% I learned really important history that resonates to this day in a very organized way. All the assignments felt necessary and added to the material in class",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you are premed and/or considering a career in reproductive health. It's vital to learn about medical history and be able to contextualize today's problems with the past so that you can help people of all marginalized groups and not make the same mistakes as healthcare professionals before.",
                "Absolutely. Not only are the professor and TFs incredibly accommodating and accessible, the content of the class is just genuinely interesting."
