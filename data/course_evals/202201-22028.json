                "This is an absolutely amazing class! I can't think of any shortcomings. It's informative, well-structured, and the assignments are fun and not repetitive. I wish there were more chances of getting to know Prof Lenski, because he seems a very cool person too!",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lenski was a fantastic lecturer, and the course material was extremely well-organized. Weakness: almost none, except that it was a lot of memorization (which is not necessarily a weakness because committing things to memory helped me better grasp the concepts covered in class)",
                "The course is highly detailed and there were really strong sources that served as a consistent reference and complement to class material",
                "STRENGTH: Content is structured well in a way that facilitates student learning, sections are designed such that there is a lot of student engagement and they don't feel like a waste of time where you just regurgitate readings, the trips to the international law library at YLS and coin/papyri collections are really interesting and serve to bring the material to life, the workload is super manageable and feedback is clear.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS: N/A",

You really need to read the textbook and it's a very dense read. However, the lectures and case studies are very approachable, even for those without legal experience. The best part of the class is that you are really pushed into critically thinking about these legal scenarios. Prof. Lenski also keeps the case studies fun and modern, which helps make things amusing. I definitely laughed (quietly) reading one of the prompts during the final.",
                "great, great course if interested in law or classics",
                "Yes, but only if you're prepared to essentially memorize a law textbook. The readings are dense and the case studies require considerable effort to actually master and understand.",
                "Yes! Absolutely yes! It's a lot of work and a lot of reading, but it's nothing like any other history class I've taken here. As a senior history major I'd say this is the hidden gem of the history department. It's nothing like \"normal Roman history,\" although you do learn about Rome's history a lot; it's really like a rigorous law school class but as if you're living in Rome. Please don't miss out on this class!!",
                "Yes!! The stuff we leaned was super interesting and the applications to the modern world were cool",
                "Amazing course! Really recommend",
                "Yes! If you're interested in getting a very detailed overview of Roman law and if you don't mind memorizing things, then you'll get a lot out of this class! It helped me see modern legal practices in an entirely new light.",
                "Maybe. It grew very academic (I understand the irony in that statement) but at times had really interesting windows into history",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you are a History/Poli Sci/Global/EPE/Philosophy major and want to know more about ancient systems of governance. Roman law is super relevant to a lot of modern legal systems, and especially the international legal system used by the Hague. I would also recommend it  for anyone planning on law school since the case studies and exams give you practice in memorizing points of law, applying them, and defending them. Overall great class with really engaging content.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, because it really gave me a new perspective on the evolution of law.",
