    "The course and syllabus was organized very well, but there were a lot of tedious nightly homework assignments. Tests and quizzes are very difficult and cover a lot of material, but some professors are forgiving, while others are not.",
    "This is a poorly designed course where the assignments are merely grade deflators.",
    "The strength of this course is its planned out structure, which facilitates a steady stream of learning. The main weakness of this course is the harsh grading rubric.",
    "Class was amazing. Professor is an amazing and caring person. She engaged with each student and was very caring about everyone. I wish the best for her. However, she grades insanely hard, relative to other professors in the department. She needs to work on this as this can be very discouraging rather than corrective.",
    "The readings could've been better and daily homework can be a bit much for some students."
