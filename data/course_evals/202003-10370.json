                "Absolutely! Even if you have taken an advanced-level US history course in high school, this is a phenomenal course that looks much more in-depth and brings in plenty of original and unusual readings and perspectives. Highly recommend this for anyone interested in US history, politics, government, or more importantly for anyone who just wants to be a good citizen and understand how we arrived at many of the present-day dynamics within the US.",
                "Definitely. This class is a good introduction to early American history, as it covers such a vast time period that you get a good taste of everything. Professor Peterson is awesome, and a great guy to know as the DUS of the department. I'd say for History majors and other majors, this course is a great survey course where you'll have interesting lectures and learn how to analyze primary source readings with a relatively low workload and chill section environment.",
                "I would! I think it was a really interesting and new way to look at American History, one that I've never gotten anywhere else.",
                "Yes!",
                "I'm on the fence about recommending this course. I thought the material we covered (especially some of the readings) were fascinating and gave me new insights into American history. At the same time, the course had a midterm exam, midterm paper, final exam, and final paper -  a great deal of work. I think the course would benefit from a clearer idea of what it wants to be. If it's going to be a large survey course, skip the long papers, and have short two page ones with exams. If the course wants to be more about specific events in U.S. history, cut down the syllabus, lengthen the papers, and ditch the exams."
