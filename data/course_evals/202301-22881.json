                "Analyzed various Marxist texts. Many of the texts were dense or difficult to read, but learned valuable skills in understanding their message. Writing skills were thoroughly tested and built throughout the course.",
                "I learned how to critically analyze and relate texts and how to apply their themes to the way I perceive the world around me. I also learned film analysis skills so that I can better interpret the messages and intent behind the creation of cinema."

            "comments": [
                "During this course we engaged with (and successfully unpacked) many difficult theoretical readings. I feel a strength of this course was how effectively we were taught to approach these readings and the ways in which we could understand them and utilize them for our own argumentation. One weakness, however, was that despite the length of the readings, we would often spend a large amount of time on a very limited selection of a given reading. I understand that this was so we could deeply engage with the text, but it made doing the readings in their entirety feel slightly less rewarding.",
                "Weakness: readings are very difficult to understand, which makes my engagement during seminar discussions a bit difficult. Most of the time, I do not know what to say about the readings, even after the professor explains the content. \r\nStrengths: I like Marxism in general. Feedbacks are clear, though I am not entirely sure of the rubrics\/grading for the first 2 assignments.",
                "This class was incredibly fun. This class was full of really interesting topics and challenges the \"Western\"\/capitalist way of thinking, whether or not you agree with Marxism. I found it really fun to decide where I stood on the topics, how they changed my perspectives, and how to move forward. This was aided by my classmates who were great to bounce ideas off of and explore texts more deeply.\r\nSome discussions of texts ran long, which meant we did not get to discuss other topics. I would have better enjoyed if we had only kept one topic\/reading\/assignment per class (which was usually the case) as when there were two, we often did not get to discuss the second one in depth or at all (e.g. Two Days, One Night).",
                "The topic of Marxism can be very difficult to understand and the readings are often a very high academic level so they can be hard to interpret on ones own. Due to this, class discussions often felt a little too moderated and lacked a flow of conversation. It would be useful to have guiding questions as we read texts or address vocab definitions especially for individuals who dont have background in the topic. Further, more time could be spent on writing skills."

                "Yes, if you are prepared to read very difficult Marxism texts. Otherwise, it is a great course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. While not the most challenging, the instructor was friendly and gave very in depth writing feedback while facilitating interesting discussions. The final paper was on a topic of our choice and the instructor went out of his way to incorporate texts that would intersect with our chosen topics during the latter half of the semester.",
