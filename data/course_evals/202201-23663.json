                "Yes, but only if the syllabus is changed. This is not the fault of the instructor but rather the Goethe Institute, which designed the syllabus. By the end of the semester, I was still unable to form written sentences in German. This was remedied by a few hours of YouTube videos in which I learned the interactions between articles and the three gendersalong with plural and singularin the nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive cases. Without this knowledge it is simply not possible to learn to read and write. I know the course wants to take things slow and drill the basics, but these are the basics. I found the hand-holding excessive and actually counterproductive to learning: if the textbook holds our hands and gives us pre-set multiple choice responses which are already conjugated and declined, instead of making us spontaneously decide whether to say, e.g, \"zu\" vs \"nach\" or \"ins\" vs \"im,\" we are just not going to learn.",
