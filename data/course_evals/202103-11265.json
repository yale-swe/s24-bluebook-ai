                "Spotlight on Sicily is an amazing course and I highly recommend it. I had never studied film before and there's something to be said for taking a film class at some point in your Yale career. You learn to be attentive to hidden meanings, symbols, landscapes, dialogue... it really trains your mind. No wonder the FBI lists \"film\" as one of the suggested majors on their website. I think my experience watching movies will be richer from now on and I'll be able to analyze cinematic media more thoughtfully. I also learned a lot about Sicily, even though my family is from there so I already knew quite a bit. Some terms I learned: eco-criticism, rack focus, palimpsest, diegetic/non diegetic soundtrack. Some concepts I learned: Sicily's schizophrenic view of women, Sicily as a place of origin, Sicily as a place of artistic experimentation, Sicily as a place of cultural anteriority. Units and Themes: Mafia, History, Memory, Archetypes, Sexual and Social Mores, the Migrant Crisis..",
                "In terms of content, we learned about the anti-mafiazation of Sicily (how we should not view Sicily as only = mafia, and how there are many other aspects of Sicilians that are worthwhile to talk about), about what Sicily means to the diaspora of Sicilians who emigrated from the island, about the social customs in Sicily (specifically with regard to Sicilys outsized emphasis on ones honor and how that is intimately tied to how one portrays their sexual relationships to the outside world), and how the migrant crisis is affecting the Italian islands in the Mediterranean. \r\n\r\nIn terms of film techniques, we learned about how to critically analyze the use of music, setting, camera angle, and lighting, and how they add to the interpretative meaning of various scenes. We also talked about how the meaning of a movie can be enriched by viewing it through an ecocritical lens and how setting is always an intentional choice by the director to enrich the meaning of the film.",

                "A thorough background in Sicilian film, with titles ranging from the 1960's to the 2010's. I left the class with a nuanced understanding of Sicily and its place in Italy as a collective, as well as with niche interpretations of works brilliantly articulated by Professor Marcus. This class truly changes you as an analyzer of art and as a subject of empathy for human beings.",

                "I have never taken a film class and this class was incredible. I learned how to analysis film and gained a deeper appreciation for Italian cinema.",
                "This course was a great introduction to film analysis and Italian cinemawith a focus on Sicily. The course question was essentially: what can films about Sicily tell us about Sicilianit. We were introduced to writing film analysis papers. One of the larger takeaways for me personally is thinking about film ecocriticismwhich asks you to look at the background of films (the setting, place, time, composition/framing) as a core component of film analysis."

            "comments": [
                "My favorite course thus far at Yale. Strengths: discussion format of class, format with weekly screenings, Professor Marcus and Sarah Atkinsons kindness and incredible teaching, the syllabus itself. Both the prof and TF were accommodating and kind and took the time to get to know each student on a personal level through office hours and writing meetings. Clear feedback on my writing throughout the semester, really allowed me to self reflect and grow.",
                "Strengths: My classmates and I were all extremely enthusiastic about the class. We all participated a lot and agreed that time absolutely flew by during the seminar. Prof. Marcus is an absolute Yale gem and this was certainly one of my favorite Yale courses. The essay prompts were good, the books were good, the screenings were good. There were no misses with the films for me. I loved the migrant movies, Divorce Italian Style, Respiro, The Mafia Only Kills in the Summer, Godfather II, I could go on! No weaknesses except *maybe* that there is a final paper and a final project which was a bit overwhelming during finals week. But the final was a good chance to consolidate what I learned so I can't complain too much..",
                "Strengths: Professor Marcus is an amazing professor! She is extremely knowledgeable about Sicily and how Sicily is portrayed in film and literature, and she is always pushing us to see the films we watched through new lenses. I learned so much about Sicily and how various directors and authors have commented on it in this course. The class also had the right mixture of lecturing and discussion: it never felt like a lecture class where the professor talks at you for the entire class period, but it also didnt feel like the discussion was solely dependent on the willpower of the students because the professor always added onto the discussion and was there to guide the students if the discussion ever slowed down. I chose this class as my fun class for the semester, and I was not disappointed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the movies and books selected were quite long and slow-paced, and it was a struggle to keep my eyes on the screen or on the page without falling asleep. However, the course also had its fair share of funny and dramatic movies/books as well, so it was nicely balanced.",
                "It was an incredible course, Professor Marcus and Sarah were an excellent pair to teach this course. All films/readings were worthwhile and the discussions were always enjoyable.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. We got to read and watch a variety of different texts and films that helped us better understand both Sicily and the study of film in general. My only criticism is that this course required a lot of work--some weeks we had to read a 300 page book and watch a 3 hour film. However, as long as you are genuinely interested in the course material, this work is very enjoyable and does not feel overwhelming.",
                "This corse is excellently designed for student leaning. There is a great mix of lesson and discussion. Prof. Marcus is an amazing teacher!",
                "The passionate, brilliant energy that emanates from Professor Marcus is infectious and creates an engaging classroom atmosphere that makes time feel like its going by four times as fast. I cannot identify any glaring weaknesses in this course.",
                "Strengths: interesting films/novels, accessible course material for those with minimal prior knowledge of Sicily, engaging conversations, Professor Marcus's passion for course material and interest in her students\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "All the course was amazing. It is my favorite class that I have ever taken at Yale and I would take it 100 times over.",
                "I think the professor and Teaching Fellow were both excellent, they certainly were a huge strength of this course. They were clearly there to help you develop as a student, not just to grade random assignments. As for weaknesses, nothing comes to mind."

It is crucial to broadening the American ideas of Sicily and how Sicily relates to the rest of Italy. It tackles relevant issues like the Migrant Crisis that desperately deserve attention. Anyone with an interest in Italy or Italian culture, specifically that of Sicily, should take this class. The films were life-changing.",
                "I would 100% recommend Spotlight on Sicily. ***This is one of the best courses at Yale.*** Everyone in the class was engaged, everyone was excited to be there, everyone absolutely adored Prof. Marcus. The films were fantastic and the books were pretty good too. I learned so much about Sicily and film. There's a lot of writing for this class (3 papers and a final) but it's worth it, trust me. I looked forward to this class every week. It was pure absolute joy..",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course! If youre looking for a fun class to take this semester, take Spotlight on Sicily in Literature and Film. I found this class to be a great break from all my lecture classes because it involved lots of insightful discussion around the films we watched as a group. The professor is amazing and you learn so much about Sicily and how to critically analyze a scene in a movie by talking about mise-en-scene.",
                "Absolutely. Its a perfect class. The content and Professor are both incredible",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in film. Professor Marcus is great at explaining concepts and is very patient with students; she makes the course very accessible for students without any experience with film or Italian. Although you do not need any experience in the subject for this course, it is still engaging for everyone regardless of level. It is a great way to learn more about a specific region's film tradition.",
                "Yes!! This is a very interesting film class where you watch some truly great films. This is one of the first classes Ive taken at Yale where I feel like I will carry some of the lessons we learned with me for the rest of my life.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who wishes to learn more about Sicily, Italy, and themselves. It is thought-provoking to the point where discussions have an effect on your own character, something I have not seen in any other class I have taken.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Marcus has an engaging teaching style that makes the films, novels, and analysis all the more interesting. This class expanded my knowledge and appreciation for film and Italy, and it was by far my favorite class this semester.",
                "Yes. I have recommended this course to everyone I know. They are taking her film course that will be taught in the spring and cant wait. I wish I could take all her classes.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Marcus is really great. I think the workload is very manageable, the class discussions/takeaways can be very insightful, and youre watching great cinema."
