Eliot Prize). I improved my ability to unpack meanings from poems from their content and also gained a greater appreciation of their historical context than in many other classes.",
                "I learned about historically contextualising poets",
                "I gained many insights into the styles, techniques, and concerns of the poets we studied throughout the course; more broadly, I gathered an understanding of the history and development of the English poetic canon, and how poetry has changed and remained the same over time.",

Besides poetry, this course gave me insight into broader artistic traditions and important figures for each time which I appreciated a lot. Technically, I learned a lot about how to craft a good essay and use close reading to build an argument."

                "This course is a great taste of poetry from the 1700's up to the present day. The unfortunate thing is that all poets are so different and obviously the class has to pick and choose who is taught, so I feel like I missed learned about some of the famous poets during this time period that I had never read but maybe should have (T.S. Eliot, Tennyson, Yeats, Frost, etc.). The good thing is we talked about the meaning of \"canon\" frequently and acknowledged that a lot of stuff got left out, which provided for an interesting discussion.",
                "Strengths - manageable reading, interesting essay assignments\r\nWeaknesses - classroom conversation was sometimes repetitive and unproductive, less guidance from instructor",
                "Strengths: My section of the course had pretty good representation of authors, as we covered both white canonical staples like Wordsworth, Keats, and Rossetti, but also Phyllis Wheatley and Gwendolyn Brooks. \r\nWeaknesses: the class isnt really designed for deep analysis of the poetry in class. While you get to read a bunch of riveting stuff, class time is not particularly structured to diving deeply into any poems.",
                "It was a strong look at poetry across time",
                "This was an excellent course, and I really enjoyed the way it was structured and designed. I enjoyed the way that we spent time studying each poet individually, so it felt like I could begin to understand the unique poetic voices and aesthetics, and I enjoyed that we frequently drew connections between different poets and poetic works, so we never studied anything in isolation. I think that the course was designed with an ideal amount of content. Though we didn't get to discuss every single work we read for homework in class, we discussed major works and were able to use our understanding from other works to better inform class discussion.",
                "We didnt have too much time to spend on each poet since we had to move very quickly",
                "Overall solid, if a bit rote.",
                "I really appreciated that we broke down in class the meanings of the more difficult poems we read, and I liked that the course felt like it didn't assume much prior knowledge of close reading poetry, so we got introductions to things like types of meter and literary devices. I also liked that we got a sense of the historical background and persona of each author.",
                "it was great. i loved the syllabus and the prof was amazing. understanding and invested in improving our writing. I also loved the opportunity to engage creatively with the material with the write-your-own-poems assignments",
                "This class had a strong syllabus and thought provoking essay prompts. I wish that it had been smaller in size, because the large seminar format made free-flowing discussion difficult to achieve.",
                "I think the strengths are that it is a class that feels very grounded in the readings and course materials. It also has a very clear and sensical organization. I loved the opportunities for archival research and visits to the Beinecke as well. A weakness could be that having the exact same seminar format every week started feeling repetitive and boring at times and generally seminar isn't always a welcoming productive space for all students. I appreciated when we changed things up, but also highly value how much of the class was student thought driven."

                "Yes! Manageable prerequisite for English major, good survey course of specific subsection of canon",
                "Absolutely! Especially for English majors, it gives you a great survey of English poetry without having to go into the potentially archaic curriculum of 125. Its a great opportunity to dive into poetic analysis and truly develops your passion for it",

                "Yes, I found it very rewarding to read and discuss all these impactful and unique poets, and I feel like my general understanding of poetry is now much better than it was before. Students who write or want to write poetry should absolutely take this course, as should students interested in English literature more broadly. Even students who are simply hoping to take an enjoyable writing/English class will take much away from this course.",
                "Yes! Even if youre not an English major, Prof. Levine makes the course super interesting. A great intro to poetry, especially poetry preceding the mid-20th century if youre interested in that.",

                "I would recommend this course to anyone with a vague interest in poetry, or who feels like they're missing a formal foundation in poetry.",
