                "It's a solid course for practicing your writing skills and forcing you to learn to write quickly, but doesn't offer too much new knowledge beyond that. I think spending more time working on essay drafts in and out of class and less time on breaking down the readings would be very helpful.",

                "This class is a wonderful introduction to the world of writing for those interested in ever modeling the big-name publications. We got exposed to the work of a variety of writers in a all four genres. With that said, I wish we spent more time discussing where the writers e studied could have improved their pieces. Although this may not have been intended, It felt sometimes as though we were to study the works of these acclaimed writers as the golden standard when writing is an extremely subjective field.",

Taking this class is a great way to generally improve as a writer, and it's fun. We got to read a variety of different essays and write about topics that were interesting to us. It is a staple Yale class, and there is good reason.",

This course forced me to produce a lot of writing in one semester, but I improved so much as a result.I recommend it for anyone looking to get a first inside look into writing for publications and learning how to write on a technical level. You'll find a support system of other students who want to be writers.",
