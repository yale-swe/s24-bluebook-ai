There are a lot of poets since 1950, and we covered what felt like a pretty could dent in that number. I knew almost nothing about modern poetry and poets, so this class had too much to write down here.",

                "Loves this course! Wouldn't change a thing about it. I enjoyed the format very much: we learned about one poet each lecture and then got to have a more in-depth discussion during our sections.",
                "Very strict grading, does not focus on student improvement but rather on absolute level of essay writing.",
                "No weaknesses! Very accessible, engaging course about a daunting topic like poetry; lectures were VERY engaging and a highlight of my week!",
                "I little more guidance on what is being looked for on assignments and papers would be helpful to guide learning.",
                "I really loved how this course taught poems in relation to one another, instead of simply analyzing single poems at a time. The way that poets and poems tied together was really enlightening because I got to learn about how poets influenced each other's poetry. I think this course could be improved if lecture were slightly less focused on the history of poetry and more about analysis of the poetry. Nevertheless, the course is extremely interesting and Professor Hammer did a great job of delivering his lectures to be engaging!",
                "The strengths of this course were the discussion sections with the super friendly and smart teaching fellows and Professor Hammer's incredible lecturing skill. You can tell he's passionate about this stuff, and he's an engaging talker. I think the weakness of this course was in the scheduling of the final essays. After the 8 page final essay, it was slightly demoralizing to have those two smaller essays right after, especially with so much other work going on during reading week.",
                "It's easy but boring",
                "Prof Hammer's lectures have really interesting content and his style of reflection introduces a new way to approach poetry. However your experience will highly depend on your TA and how helpful they are and good at leading discussion section.",
                "Overall, I think ENGL 183 is a lovely course and introduction to modern poetry, bringing poetry's importance to contemporary politics to the forefront. As a lecture course, however, I think instruction stumbled when it came to providing a more general introduction to reading poetry as well as to close written analysis of poetry. As a course with no prerequisities, I feel there could have been a more sincere effort to help students with little to no background in poetry understand the process of reading and analyzing poems.",
                "This course was very engaging and generally interesting for a non-English major. However, I believe the lecture and sections themselves didn't teach enough about poetic form or terms, which made it difficult to get accustomed to writing papers on poetry.",
                "This course has many strengths: it exposes student to a wide variety of poets, places works in conversation, and engages important contemporary issues.",
                "strengths - great syllabus and analyzing poems in lecture was really helpful; weaknesses - sometimes I feel like we didn't spend enough time taking apart poems in lecture",
                "The papers were hard",
                "Strengths: Interesting readings! Such a great survey of amazing poets. Weaknesses: It was hard for me to stay engaged in lecture, perhaps because lecture consisted of Professor Hammer just speaking at us the entire time. I wish there were more room for student interaction. Often it felt like lecture could just be replaced with a Zoom recording."

                "Yes absolutely! A very chill and good english cred to take. I was not necessarily a very pro-poetry person, but this class definitely opened up my view points and gave me a newfound appreciation for it. Overall such a lowkey and fun class.",
                "YES! If you love poetry this course is soul nurturing! Professor Hammer is next-level brilliant.",
                "Yes and no. It is a fun class to take and learn poetry of different kinds, but don't take it as an extreme gut, this class requires work.",
                "Absolutely! If you're looking to get into poetry, this is a great introduction!",
                "I would recommend this course to humanities majors but I would advise against it for other stem majors as it is't the best course for building your writing skills for someone with less experience.",
                "Great course to learn how to read, think about, and write about poetry, especially if you are new to the art form! If you are old hat at it (like I was), the course can still provide new insights, giving you a good sense of the history of contemporary poetry and the larger themes it organizes itself around. You will also get exposure to a wide range of poets, which can be a nice complement to more focused poetry courses! The work is certainly manageable (as writing credits go, this one isn't too demanding) and I found the memorization assignment especially enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! The material and readings were very engaging, but I'd advise them to seriously consider their choice of discussion section, as I found that having a welcoming group of eager-to-discuss students along with a committed TA is crucial to strengthening understanding of how to read poetry.",
                "I think engaging in this class can change your mind about poetry. I met a few people who didn't like poetry and just took this class for the easy writing credit. It is a pretty easy writing credit, coming from an English major who has taken quite a few writing credits. But a lot of those same people found that close reading poetry and listening to Professor Hammer and discussion section opened their eyes to something they never knew they could understand or enjoy.",
                "Yes if you need a writing credit, I took this class with friends so it was a little more fun, but you have to be really interested in poetry to get anything out of this class.",
                "Definitely. I took Poetry Since 1950 because I needed a second writing credit and it has a workload. It ended up being one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale. We read a wide range of poets (I know nothing about poetry outside of this course, but it is my impression that Professor Hammer crafted a brilliant, diverse syllabus) and the assignments\/structure of the course allow you to really dig into the poets and poems that get stuck in your mind while leaving behind the ones you found boring.",
                "From what I have gathered in talking to people in the class, Poetry Since 1950 is a somewhat polarizing course. Some people really enjoyed the class and the contemporary poets we read while others found the poetry too abstract\/confusing. Professor Hammer was a wonderful teacher who cared about the students and our well-being. He was also interested in our thoughts on the poetry we read. If you have any interest in contemporary poetry\/poets\/poetics, take this class. Otherwise, you may find yourself bored or confused.",
                "I would only recommend this course for students who have some experience in reading and analyzing poetry through academic writing.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in poetry, as it'll give you a solid (and contemporary) foundation.",
                "yes, I loved the poetry we read and am glad I took this course! I think lectures could be structured a little better but overall no major complaints",
