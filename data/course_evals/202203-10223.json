The consistent structure of the class also worked well, especially at the beginning of the semester. The weekly assignment of writing two pages each week meant that we had a consistent form in which to experiment.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the course might be improved by some variation, especially later in the semester. I would have liked to spend a couple of weeks on revision. And it would have been nice to give us an opportunity to edit each others' pieces outside of class. Perhaps towards the end of the semester, we could have been split into pairs and asked to give comments on the other's piece before they submit it.",

You'll wonder how a two hour class can go by so quickly. And you'll wish you met more than one a week. This class will take you on a writing journey, and it is spectacular. There are hard days, days you're uninspired, days you feel stuck. There are also days where you have so many ideas, it's hard to choose just one. Where you want to share your writing with everyone you know because you are proud of it. Where you discover something in the process of writing. And those good days are so worth it. Take this class if you can (and go to office hours every week, it really helps)!!!",

                "Definitely. It changed the way I write and read. It made me think about writing as more of an opportunity, less of a burden. I was introduced to some excellent writers, which is always a good thing.",
                "Yes! It was such a pleasure taking Verlyn's class. He's a master at his craft and I really got to see my writing develop over the course of the semester. I love love this class. Take it if you have the chance.",
                "If you haven't read the book.",
