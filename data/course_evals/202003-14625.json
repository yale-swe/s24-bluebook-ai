The course was also an amazing opportunity to write analytically about music that inspired me and explore its connections with other forms of scholarship.",

                "The subject matter of the class was definitely interesting and I appreciated that Professor Brooks spanned across so many eras and genres in our discussion of protest music. Something that I really struggled with on Zoom was Professor Brooks' decision to play music underneath her talking during the lecture. I spent much of the semester unable to hear what she was saying and it was extremely overwhelming having two different sounds coming from the same speakers and having no control over it. I definitely feel like I lost a lot because of that. Also, the amount of reading seemed to be unnecessarily much as it was often unclear how certain material tied into the class and we often didn't cover large chunks of it. I would have wanted a more clear overarching theme or argument that each class worked to further prove or analyze because the separate classes felt a bit disjointed and I was looking for a more clear through line to help me really know what the purpose of the class actually was.",
                "Strengths: I felt like the class was always making historical examples relevant to today's political climate. I also appreciated the creative options for the midterm and final assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: WAY too much reading. It was so hard to know which course material to focus on from week to week, so the syllabus felt very overwhelming",
                "I think this course tried to take on too much. There was far too much reading each week, and it became challenging to figure out what reading was essential and was unnecessary. Every text was one I would have loved to dedicate time too, but I could never get to all of them. I think the strength of this course was Professor Brooks. In all ways she is an amazing and engaged teacher.",
                "The strengths were the professor and her teaching, and the course is very interesting. Sometimes because of the readings, however, I feel that attention was taken away from the music, which is unfortunate in a class about Protest Music.",
                "The course was sound in structure and acquiring participation from students even in the Zoom format.",
                "Sometimes I struggled to maintain interest during the zoom lectures, and it was often hard to pay attention to the lectures. However the format of lecture over playing music made learning much easier as well, and allowed me to practice my own analytical skills during the lecture.",
                "This course was one of my favorite courses at Yale. The lectures were consistently engaging and sections were always helpful.",
                "The course lecture was, at times, hard to follow because of how little student engagement there was; students were rarely asked to participate in lecture, which disregarded accountability. It was very easy to skip live lectures. In addition, the assignmentsespecially those that required readingwere hard to keep up with because of the length and the multitude of topics that were covered in one day.",
                "Though I greatly enjoyed the subject matter and lectures themselves, I felt as though the grade breakdown and workload of the course was very uneven and would have liked more opportunities for feedback throughout.",
                "Strengths: really interesting material, passionate professor and teaching staff, fun and uplifting and illuminating. Weaknesses: lecture felt a little too general sometimes, I wish it had more detail about music theory and the actual definitions and genealogies of types of music, and gave us more solid a sense of what we should be listening for",
                "I loved this course, and I believe it went as well as it couldve, given the limitations of a virtual semester. The one weakness of the course was that we perhaps attempted to cover too much material for one semester, but in the context of this course, that was a good problem to have.",
                "The material is amazing, Professor Brooks is an absolute gem, and the TFs are really great. The only issue was that the reading assignments were pretty large, but the TFs helped manage that by telling you what readings for the week you should focus on. Incredible class, I got the chills multiple times every single class."

I would have loved to have this course in person, but on zoom the hour and fifteen minute lecture length became a challenge. I would have opted for three shorter lectures or two shorter and one recorded just to maintain focus.",

                "I thought the online discussion sections helped my analytical skills improve even better, and gave me access to varying opinions from other students which only furthered my growth. I felt like the lectures struggled with keeping me engaged. I'm not sure what would could change, but I struggled with the online format in this class.",
                "I think one thing that would be useful would be providing more of the course materials in the files. Living outside of the US, it was sometimes difficult to access all of the readings.",
                "I really love Professor Brooks but I just think it was A LOT to cover during a pandemic. Like I honestly couldn't even devote any substantial mental energy to it after a few weeks because it was just too much content. All of the information was of course very timely and important, but I do think that sometimes less is more in a pandemic school year.",
