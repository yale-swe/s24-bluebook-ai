                "This course has great content but maybe a bit too much. It changes topics too quickly yet still demands a deep understanding of concepts. There is also a lot of machining of parts. Time management among the students was hard because too much trust\/ power was placed on the students to manage large projects (unless this was a lesson in it of itself).",
                "This course is cool because it takes concepts from other classes (mostly Strength & Deformation) and applies them to real things. The lectures were all great. I liked being able to actually build something for the final project. The main weakness of this course was the lack of feedback and general chaotic nature of the design assignments. I basically had no idea what I was doing for most of the semester and didn't receive a ton of guidance, which made me feel quite alone. I think if the ULAs had in-person office hours and there were more opportunities for collaboration, that would have helped. Also I don't know what it was about the Matlab assignments because conceptually they weren't that hard to grasp, but they made me want to pull my hair out.",
                "One strength of the class was that we would learn about an element of a design in class, practice coding or a problem for homework, and also design that part of the final project.  This was helpful in gaining understanding and being able to apply it to our final project in chunks as the semester continued. One weakness of the course was the amount of work which made it difficult to keep up. The due dates were always accommodated so that we could finish and it was always just about getting the work done, but trying to keep up made the class a bit stressful at times."

I highly recommend all that are interested in MECH-E and have a strong theoretical or practical background to take the class.",
                "Please do not take this because it is \"the class where you get a free 3D printer.\" This class is a lot of work and you only sometimes feel rewarded for your efforts. But if you want to learn some useful engineering skills and feel empowered as a maker, I'd say this is a great class."
