                "I learned a fascinating account of the preferences and behavior of Americans.",
                "By the end of the course, I could carefully but quickly read dense scholarly articles and have a firm understanding of how they fit within the greater context of social science work as a whole.",
                "I was able to analyze and read interesting articles from different decades (starting in the 50s) regarding topics in political science that affect the vote of Americans. I was able to see the transition between trends that may be taken for granted in our present times but were crucial factors for voting for people 40, and 60 years ago. We evaluated different topics such as gender and the effectiveness of political campaigns and write three essays about such topics.",
                "I learned so much more about methods and research design in this course. Prof. Kalla allowed us the opportunity to carefully review our readings each week with a focus not just on the outcome of each study, but the way each author approached their respective research question.",
                "Knowledge of political science literature in American politics",

Great survey of many of the major debates and an excellent balance of historical foundational perspectives (e.g., Converse, Downs, Zaller, etc.) with recently published papers and working papers.",
                "Learned about voting patters, behavior, and history. Was very interesting and definitely useful given today's political climate."

                "Professor Kalla is wonderful and a big strength of the course. I think that it could be benefitted from not being taught in a basement, since I think the setting made many of us somewhat sleepy and disengaged. I would have also liked broader debates on each week's subject, instead of comments on the papers.",
                "Strengths: Strong readings, low workload (just three short papers, not harshly graded), interesting discussions; weaknesses: it was a good course, I have no real complaints",
                "This course is mainly designed for graduate students, which is something that is shown through discussions and seminars.",
                "It was an engaging course; the material and instruction Dr. Kalla gave were enriching. The only drawback is that I received full credit on the papers with no insight into what was good about the paper or what I could continue to do well for the next assignment. Further feedback, even on good work, would be appreciated.",
                "Strengths: Really great articles; Kalla is a source of knowledge, don't let his age deceive you; relatively low writing workload; seminar discussion setting (if you are inclined to only take such courses); a lot of help and understanding coming from Kalla.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness I see is that this course isn't opened for more people to take.",
                "Prof. Kalla leaves space for questions no matter how big or small, and I think that's a huge strength of the course. A weakness of the course is that sometimes particularly talkative students would derail the conversation away from the topic of the day and towards technical subjects that it didn't seem like everyone could follow.",
                "The main weakness of this course is the many undergraduates who enroll and never contribute to the discussion. This course would be improved by offering it only at the graduate level."

                "Yes, Professor Kalla is brilliant and cares about your learning.",
                "Yes, Dr. Kalla was a great professor who set up the course with a variety of \"point, counter-point\" with regard to the studies we were reviewing.",
                "Absolutely! I would probably advise such student that if they are not necessarily good with statistic/haven't taken stats, they should really reach out for help sooner than later. This is by no means a stats course, however, a lot of the articles deal with some degree of stats (even calc at times) that may be confusing when discussing in class. Kalla will talk you through it, but it might be good to have some background beforehand. Also, if you are an undergrad, it is easy to feel intimidated by the grad students in the class, but your opinions are valid and a lot of times correct and Kalla will ensure to let you know that!",
                "Certainly--anyone interested in public opinon or the intersection of statistics and political science should consider the course.",
                "Yes. Great grad level survey course that engages with recent literature in a very systematic way. Highly recommend!",
                "Yes, either to prepare for comps or to simply learn the recent advances in American political behavior research.",
                "Yes! Professor Kalla was engaged and always prepared classes so that discussions were fruitful."
