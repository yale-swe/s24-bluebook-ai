    "My verbal and written communication skills improved, my vocabulary expanded, and I became much more comfortable speaking in Spanish.",
    "I felt infinitely more comfortable with my speaking ability after this course and feel I can effectively communicate with anyone in Spanish",
    "I learned a lot about the Spanish language itself, such as the use of accents, grammatical structures, vocabulary, different and more difficult tenses like the subjunctive, etc. I was also made to learn about Yale, New Haven and the city's Latinx community, my own heritage, and other community-based aspects, which I appreciated.",
    "In this course, I was able to gain insight into the cultures of others, not just my own, which had been my first experience learning about the entire Latin world. I was able to learn at a pace that felt comfortable enough for me, but I felt a little rushed towards the end with the subjunctive. Other than that, however, the teaching style was natural and something that I had never engaged with before."

    "I really can't think of any weaknesses of the course. Professor Alexandrov is a fantastic instructor, we covered relevant and interesting topics, the workload was very manageable, and we got exposure to various types of media in Spanish (ex: political articles, short stories, movies).",
    "Strength - Prof. Alexandrov. She was the reason this course was so enjoyable! It was incredibly tailored to everyone's individual learning needs",
    "The small size of the course and the fact that all its students entered with some sort of foundation in Spanish were very helpful factors.",
    "This course allows for students like me to learn at a pace that is comfortable for them but yet pushes boundaries to ensure growth. The only thing that I would change with the course is to instead make it a daily class, but I know it may not be possible in the coming semester."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It will almost certainly help you be more comfortable speaking Spanish around your relatives.",
    "Absolutely. This course is so targeted to heritage speakers, and you can really tell since the curriculum includes basic grammar but also discussion about higher level topics and political debates.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who knows some Spanish from home and would like to improve their skills in reading, writing, and speaking.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for any Spanish speaker who feels insecure about their ability but has the capability to improve."
