                "The pre-class videos were an absolute gem in terms of learning the material. The practice exams and review sessions were very helpful. And the peer tutors and teachers made themselves very available to help. Unfortunately, I found that the teaching in class was lacking.",
                "One strength was the peer tutors. They were always so helpful and kind. I thought a weakness was some of the course wide review sessions before the midterms and final. While about half of them were very helpful (in general the ones taught by professors), there were a few where I thought the information was presented very unclearly.",
                "This course is very fast-paced, and that would be fine if there were better teachers but since the majority of sections are taught by grad students, the experience varies and really just depends on whether or not you are lucky enough to get into John or Miki's sections. The grad students are incredibly smart but ultimately fail to communicate/translate their brilliance to the level of those who are learning multivariable for the first time. As a result, i often found myself go out of my way to teach myself with the resources provided by the course and outside resources. However, that ultimately meant class was virtually a waste of time.",
                "Strengths: Reasonably paced, provided with lots of resources/additional help\r\nImprovements: The order of the materials taught at the end of the semester did not follow the textbook, which made learning some lessons a little confusing",
                "The design of the course is nice. Students are required to study required topics based on pre-uploaded videos before each class and the class is for answering questions that students couldn't understanding after the self-study. This is a very effective use of class time because attention could be put on more difficult topics rather than spread across the entire syllabus. Generally, all our doubts and concerns could be answered in class.\r\nThe weekly problem set is also a good and necessary measure to make students practice enough and get used to complicated mathematical concepts as soon as possible. I wouldn't have been able to master what this course covered without the practice offered by the problem sets."

                "Yes! It is a very clear and formulaic and organized course. It's a course that would never blindside you, which I personally appreciated it. The psets and exams are very doable if you go to class or watch the videos. And the workload is generally even throughout the semester.",
