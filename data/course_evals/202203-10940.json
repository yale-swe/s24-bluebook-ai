Specifically, I learned about the history of computer music, what computer music looks like now, and the direction it is taking in the future. I also learned how to code in SuperCollider, a digital audio synthesis platform.",

                "good",
                "This course gives a really nice overview of computer music, and each project taught me a new skill. I did feel like I was teaching myself a lot of the material for each project, but part of that might be inherent in the fact that it's a computer science class and you just need to figure out how to implement the things we discussed in class by yourself.",
                "I think that the course is well organized, structured by algorithms. However, I felt that we could have been eased into SuperCollider better, as coding in it was quite confusing and hard to grasp (I am still pretty confused).",

                "It would probably be good for there to be either quizzes to incentivize paying more attention to lecture.",
                "Getting to collaborate with people on projects was a huge strength in this course.  Not enough CS classes here allow collaboration on projects/psets, so that was definitely a plus.  Scott is also an awesome lecturer.  He's super engaging, leaves time for questions and feedback, and truly cares about students' well-being.  \r\n\r\nSomething that can be improved is making sure people have partners for projects (if they want one) before we start working on the project.  Sometimes it was really hard to find a partner for a project and I felt left behind.  I feel this can be rectified by allowing people to get into groups during class and having time to find other people who may not be in a group but want to be to find each other during the classes where the project is being introduced.",

                "Yes, if they have a strong background in both music and computer science. Professor Petersen's reviews of music and computer science topics were both pretty brief, so it helps to be generally familiar with them going into the class. That being said, I learned a lot about how computers can be used to create music, and it was really fun combining logic and creativity.",
