                "Many topics are beyond my comfort zone, but I learned a lot from both reading the books and discussing with classmates each week.",

                "The variety of assigned texts ensured that the class engaged in many different kinds of Historical scholarship. One thing that I would have preferred from this course is to hear more from the instructor; I felt I learned more from the instructor's engagement with the texts than from my classmates. I also would have benefitted from a slightly clearer introduction to the texts and how the themes of the course are relevant to the texts.",
                "Strength: Fascinating assigned readings\r\nWeaknesses: Weak discussions that often veered off-topic",
                "Strengths: the readings are extremely well curated and organized. None of the readings felt wasted and, like all Quarshie classes, discussion flowed well and the texts were extremely generative. Weaknesses: Perhaps an opportunity to get feedback on work before the final paper.",
                "Similar to other courses I've taken in the past, students are required to lead discussions. However, unlike many other courses, Professor Quarshie provides students with helpful resources on how to lead a discussions, and makes himself available before class to discuss the material and how the class will be run. During the class, he lets the student lead and intervenes at critical moments. This is a skill, which I came to appreciate. Professor Quarshie also lets students decide what their final essay/project will be, and provides incredibly helpful feedback to help shape their' papers. And while I found many of the books we studied challenging, I appreciated the emphasis on theory and the diversity of subject matter.",
                "Monday mornings aren't the most joyful time, obviously, but in this course it really felt like we were talking to each other, moving between the texts, our questions, and with Professor Quarshie and student presenters' facilitation."

                "I would recommend this course to someone who cares more about the books assigned than the discussion of said books. Otherwise, I would be conflicted about suggesting that anyone take History 948.",
                "Absolutely recommend. The readings are of excellent caliber and breadth and there are some surprises mixed in. The course discussions are often dominated by a few more active participants but this does not stop the conversation from being extremely informative, especially as an undergraduate to hear from compelling graduate students.",
                "Yes! Taking this course with Professor Quarshie who is a brilliant historian and anthropologist and generous interlocutor would help any student understand the 'archival turn' from a non European or US centric perspective."
