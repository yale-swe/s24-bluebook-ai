I learned what I want to take away from academia, what it can keep, and why/how I want to move through the rest of my college education and interactions with others.",
                "I learned about the history of Black feminism, how it influenced queer theory and Black queer and Black trans studies. We learned about the relationship between capital, race and gender, and Blackness, and why poetry and art and culture can serve to liberate Black people better or in conjunction with Theory. W",

As a Black WGSS major I really feel so disappointed that a course like this isnt a requirement for the major! So much is missing from LGBT studies if the foundational texts of Black Lesbian feminisms arent a part of the structure of the major/program. We covered literary, poetry, film, and image analysis in this course as well. Towards the ends of the course we engaged with some of the archives at Beinecke and Im glad to have had that experience as I feel much more comfortable with the library now.",
                "This class helped me gain an understanding of the genealogy of Black lesbian feminism and helped me understand the history of Black queer studies. I learned about the importance of offering critique and engaging critically with the ideas and work of others. I the class encouraged me to connect the work of different scholars together and build on their work by articulating my own ideas in the weekly response papers."

                "strengths: Olivia is very responsive to feedback and also offers very helpful feedback; readings and discussions were very interesting; syllabus was impeccable\r\nweaknesses: could be a lot of reading at some points, discussions were slow some weeks",
                "I think it'd be useful if there some sort of class glossary, just to keep track of all the terminology and lenses/modes of critique we learn. Some of the films were a bit harder to get hold of than expected also, especially upon learning how the film archive works, so maybe extra disclaimers there could be fruitful. I loved the way we did weekly presentations, and having the print outs of the presentations alongside the actual reports. I also really appreciated how often our reading responses were brought into class for us to engage with furtherit felt like a lecture and discussion section all in one.",
                "I really enjoyed the course. It was extremely difficult, theoretically and work-load wise, but I learned unprecedented amounts of knowledge that already have, and will continue to for the rest of my life, frame by scholarship. \r\nMy only critique is that, given the state of the world and students' precarious (mental) health statuses, there could have been more leniency with deadlines, hours, and reading responses.",
                "This course could benefit from a more thorough unpacking of the ideas in the theory based readings, and more trips/immersive learning, and creative assignments!",
                "Weekly responses are a little long, but ultimately useful and thought provoking - actually makes you reflect on the texts and verbalize your thoughts. Useful to look back on during midterms/finals as a sort of notes - forces you to record your thoughts! Was confused sometimes bc a few points were always docked from responses and not always given a reason, so this would have been helpful to know what I could improve going forward.",
                "Strengths: almost everything!! Excellent readings, Olivia has an amazing wealth of knowledge and is great at facilitating discussion. You can ask any questions and they help you/the class break things down. I really liked the think pieces as they allowed students like me who struggle to speak in class have a way to demonstrate that we are engaging with the material. \r\n\r\nWeakness: not exactly a weakness, but something that I wished had been done differently, we watched some films in this class and it would have been cool (and also more accessible) if we had the option to screen them as a class. Also sometimes there was a lot of reading but I still think it was all worth it!",
                "Strengths: I feel like the readings and videos were very well picked and were always interesting. It was clear why each reading was part of the particular week it was part of. I also really liked the presentations part of the class. I feel like the presentations on the authors and the readings of the week were helpful because the authors biographies helped me better understand their writings and, overall, the presentations helped me remember the main ideas of the texts. None of the work felt like busy work. We were also always able to ask questions and take time to work through those questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the readings were difficult to understand, especially readings grappling with words related to theoretical concepts that I didnt have an understanding of yet (ex: historical materialism). I think one way to make those readings less confusing would have been setting time aside before the week the reading was due to go over any confusing vocab. I know some teachers create official class discussion pages where students can ask each other and the professor questions as they are doing the work for the week. I feel like having a discussion thread like that could be helpful for the class."

                "Yes!!! Especially if you are wgss!! People tokenize Black Lesbian Feminism by quoting Audre Lorde here and there but this course actually exposes you to what Black queer studies is about! I struggle with reading comprehension and writing anxiety and this classroom was such a safe space to ask all of the questions or to just say Im mad confused can you explain this argument or thesis? Theres also room for creativity in this class through the think pieces and the final assignment which I thoroughly enjoyed.",
