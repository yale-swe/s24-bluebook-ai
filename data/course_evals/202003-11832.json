                "Strengths: Professor Semmel is incredible, and he made the course as amazing as it was.  I think another strength is that we cover a lot of material.  This does mean that the class goes quickly, though.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, we spent a lot more time on one text (eg, the Republic) than another, which felt uneven.  I also think that the reading could be reduced even more, particularly this year given the challenging circumstances, and made more inclusive and diverse.",
                "I really loved the format of the class and supplementing our readings with lectures and synchronous discussions. The texts were carefully chosen and interacted with each other very well in H&P and across the different DS sections.",
                "This course was strong on breadth and weak on depth. Unlike other DS courses, we rarely read works from cover to cover. Almost everything we read was excerpted. I would have liked to read one or two more full works, even at the expense of some other selections. Besides the reading, this course included a substantial writing component which prioritized the presence of good ideas over any polish in their presentation. This was a useful priority in the first year.",
                "The seminars went very well. Sometimes the lectures were uploaded later than I would've liked since I had class Monday and would not have time to watch it before seminar, so releasing the lectures earlier would help.",
                "There was a lot of reading that was sometimes difficult to manage so early in the week.",
                "The course readings were more varied than I expected (I really liked what the inclusion of Al Farabi and Maimonides added to it). However, sometimes it felt to me like we were reading a bunch of texts without a clear direction of learning. The course could be improved by more discussion of the ultimate takeaways"

I did not get nearly as much out of the lectures as I would have liked because I didn't end up watching most of them. They were recorded to be watched on our own time, the flexibility of which was both a blessing and a curse. I realize that if they were in person then the only difference would have been that they were at a fixed time and so I would have had to watch them then whether I had finished the reading or not--thus one could say that I should have just imposed a time when I had to watch the lecture whether I was done or not. That does not feel very satisfying either, though, so I'm not sure what my takeaway thought is."

The things I heard about DS are pretty accurate--you do have to be prepared for a lot of reading and (especially fall semester) a focus on ancient, Eurocentric texts--but if you're okay with that, it's an amazing program.",
