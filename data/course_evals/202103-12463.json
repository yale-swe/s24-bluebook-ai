                "After spending so much time in other economics / econometrics class hearing about papers or learning the theory behind economic studies, I really enjoyed how this class centered around giving exposure to the literaturereading different studies and understanding their methodsand then trying to contribute our own research to this literature, putting our knowledge to practice.",
                "I learned how to read Econ research papers and how to conduct econ research for myself!",
                "I developed more advanced econometric skills for research. I learned to read economic research papers with a more critical eye and developed a better understanding of the best approaches for different kinds of questions we want to answer in economics.",
                "Above all, I gained a greater understanding of what it is actually like to write an economics research paper in this class. As a Global Affairs student who had not taken anything above intermediate micro, I had little experience with doing anything than interpreting other research, so this was a cool opportunity to explore the back-end of academia.",
                "How econometrics is actually applied in the real world, lots of regressions, reading academic papers, learning how to write paper yourself",

There are three assignments, all of which can be completed pretty easily if you pace yourself and consult with your TF. The papers are interesting and easy reading.",

                "Strengths: very well laid out, helps you learn how to write a econometrics paper. much better than the other classes in the Econ department here (which isn't saying much, to be honest). Anthony is a very good TF, and Prof. Fair is exceptional in the field and at what he does. A very smart mind that can help you with research.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3 papers due throughout the course, which will each provide a lot of stress - plan in advance, please!!!!!!! don't end up like me and spend your halloween weekend in the library",
                "Strengths -- Interesting papers assigned for reading each week, well organized class, professor and TA really care about helping us learn how to do research, pretty chill class in general but high reward. I enjoyed the spacing of the assignments and felt that completing each assignment was really rewarding. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Getting cold-called on during class is pretty stressful until you get the hang of what Professor Fair is going to ask during class. Also, make sure you start thinking about your paper early! Do not leave it until the last minute, especially if it's going to be computationally intensive.",
                "I appreciate how clear the assignment structure in this class is. You have to write three research papers and do readings weekly, and they are all listed with due dates at the start of the semester. I also think that both Prof. Fair and the TF (Anthony) do a great job at giving you feedback on where you can improve your economic analysis.\r\nTime in the classroom was a little less engaging though, as most lectures were simply reviewing directly what was assigned in the readings.",
                "Strengths: chill workload, interesting to read academic papers applied to a variety of topics, difficulty of papers builds up nicely. I really like how we are given the chance to write econometric papers and dip our hands into actual application. It's honestly not that hard and you'll get the hang of it. The cold calling motivates students to read papers beforehand. Weaknesses: some lectures were kind of dry and boring, especially when it was just going through papers we've already read before class. But it makes for a really nice, chill and enriching seminar.",
                "Strengths: Open ended projects allow students to explore topics they are interested in. Broad variety of topics covered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The complexity of your work is contingent on how much experience you have coming in. If you want to do an interesting final paper, you will have to depend on prior knowledge.",
                "Strength: the class was well structure and the Professor really knows his material. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the coldcalling can be a little daunting and the grading scale for the papers can be a little frustrating."

                "If you take this course, be prepared that it wholly consumes three of your weekends. But yes, if you are an Econ major take it and be prepared to work very hard for these three papers.",
                "Yes. I like that the course gives you the space to explore econometrics & the support to get comfortable with writing original research.",
                "Yes! I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in conducting their own Econ-related research. This course really teaches you how to read and understand the Econ literature, as well as how to prepare and conduct your own original research question. I took this course as a junior and feel like it has really prepared me to write a senior thesis for the Econ major. In general, I feel like Professor Fair cared much more about students learning than achieving a good grade (the grading is super chill in this course). The assignments are pretty chill and interesting throughout the semester -- just three independent research papers, which you get lots of support and preparation for. Just make sure you are prepared to be cold-called on during class.",
                "If you want an idea of what it takes to write an economics paper, yes, take this course. It gives you a great opportunity to explore interesting sport and political topics!",
                "Absolutely! You get the chance to write papers yourself and actually do real econometrics research, in a chill and relaxing seminar environment. Prof Fair is approachable and very willing to help give advice and guidance. The workload is honestly manageable and the papers are interesting to read and you don't have to do them very thoroughly in order to answer questions. Anthony was an excellent TA and provided great guidance to students that was very helpful. He was helpful at office hours and always willing to meet extra outside of office hours.",
                "Yes. Fun course to explore a variety of topics and to conduct some novel investigations in topics of your choice."
