Weaknesses: none, one part that I was not most fond of were the discussion posts, since they added extra stress (this is a personal qualm since I they were simple, for participation, and should not have taken too long to compose)",

It was, we later learned, a planned deep crash course on morphology that would well serve us later on in the semester and give us time for research and discussion, but in the first half of the semester, I sometimes questioned my own sanity as my brain completely failed to take in all the information that we needed."

Sometimes, however, it felt like the class was a little too much. Eventually the discussion sections turned into lectures themselves, so we were doing 3 lectures\/week, all at the same quick pace of the regular sessions; the readings were very immersive, the discussion posts on Canvas forced participation (with reason, and they were fun, though sometimes daunting), the homeworks, etc.\r\n\r\ni think maybe a more centralized experience would benefit this class -- in the beginning we weren't being notified of assignments or deadlines, it seemed as though the instructors expected us to seek out that information ourselves on a regular basis, which was a little unreasonable given the COVID-19 pandemic mindset and general stress students were under (not to mention, having to do this for multiple other classes).\r\n\r\nHowever, the instructors' flexibility with and considerate actions regarding deadlines were very helpful and reassuring."
