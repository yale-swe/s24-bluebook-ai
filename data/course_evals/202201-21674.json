                "I learned so much about the thermodynamics of organics in the environment, the way organics partition, and the way organics behave in different environmental systems.",
                "Lot about partioning and other more advanced Orgo topics that I had never even heard of, which was cool.",
                "Throughout this course, I learned about the most important considerations that environmental engineers take into account when solving problems in the environment, important assumptions made in these situations, and the reality of organic chemical's behavior in the environment.",
                "I developed a great understanding of how the chemistry and characteristics of chemicals affect the environment in both positive and negative ways.",
                "A basic understanding of environmental organic chemistry",
                "Environmental pollutants and their partitioning into air, water, and soil.",
                "Learned how organic molecules will end up in the environment",
                "The basic of the environmental engineering, and thermodynamics. And how to analysis the partition in a certain system.",
                "Learned about organic chemicals and how they behave in the environment and where they partition into.",
                "I learned a lot about why different chemicals behave differently in the environment, for example, what properties cause chemicals to partition more into air, water, soil, or into living organisms. I also learned about ways to remediate these chemicals from the environment, which is super interesting, especially bioremediation, where you get usually bacteria or fungi to \"eat\" the chemicals to break them down.",
                "I learned all about what a career in environmental engineering will actually entail, and got insight into the physical perspective surrounding organic chemistry, especially when it comes to partitioning, which is incredibly relevant for pollutants as one needs to know what phase a pollutant will be found in and can calculate the concentration in order to remediate the issue. I also developed important problem solving skills that I know I can apply to this field, which made me excited as someone in the major to potentially follow through with this as my career or pursue graduate studies."

                "It covered a ton of material, and I felt like it did a good job of introducing very complex concepts but kept most of the learning simple. I think that the biggest improvement would be providing a more concrete explanation of WHY certain things are being talked about, I think especially early in the semester I would be confused about where certain equations and concepts were leading because they were not introduced with a ton of context.",
                "Professor Fortner is very engaging and also accommodating with assignments, which I appreciated. However, sometimes the lectures felt rushed and difficult to follow, and the homework required concepts not covered in lecture material. More example problems worked out in class would be helpful.",
                "The material is straightforward and well paced. Professor Fortner really cares about his students and is excited about the material. Sometimes the lectures were a bit fast and could be slowed down. Also it would be helpful to have more explicit definitions of concrete terms and to slow down with the basics at the beginning of every class.",
                "Well taught, homework challenges you in a great way, have to stay engaged through the term which I think is a good thing.",
                "The strengths of this course were how Dr. Fortner simplified and relayed the material presented in the textbook, how the exam material reflected what was presented in class, and the understanding given to students in terms of deadlines and grading. The weaknesses of the course were the complicated nature with which the material was explained in the textbook, the difficulty and lack of clarity of the homework problems, and the speed with which the material was covered in class.",
                "Great to have answer keys available. Both TA and professor were quite available. Would have been nice to have more timely feedback on homeworks.",
                "Really fun class!",
                "This course could be better organized to facilitate learning. Additionally, it would have benefitted from the lecture material/slide having been posted on Canvas. Furthermore, I think it would have been helpful to see more example problems and real applications of the concepts.",
                "the material covered in this class is highly applicable but the classes needed to have more example problems done in class without skipping steps considered 'simple'. It's hard to follow the chemistry when it's not all written down.",
                "Strengths: A lot of material was covered which meant I learned a lot in this class. It was fast paced, but manageable and broken up into clear segments. It was also always clear as to what topic was being covered in class in a given day. \r\nWeaknesses: Problem sets were hard and going to office hours was very necessary. Sometimes the content was hard to follow in relation to the way to book presented it.",
                "Learned the general transport mechanism of the organic molecule.",
                "Its a good way of knowledge build up when the courses going through but its hard to catch up  at the beginning for the people without related background knowledge. And the review session is helpful but we should have more example questions in the class period",
                "The course goes over very interesting topics that feel very applicable to work. The class is extremely insightful and flows at a good pace. While Fortner does a good job explaining concepts, the book that is used can feel a little cryptic at times and doesn't align exactly with what is being taught in class.",
                "Although the course was pretty hard, the content was really interesting and felt rewarding to learn, especially with such direct applications. The concepts were often hard to grasp, so I found it helpful that we were assigned a bunch of concepts/writing questions from the textbook in addition to the quantitative problems. One thing I found really helpful for the midterm exam was the big review powerpoint, and I wish they had given us one for the final too. The textbook was a little annoying at times, and I think there are mistakes in it, although it's probably the best textbook out there for this course, so I understand why we used it.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was Dr. Fortner's ability to explain complicated concepts clearly, especially one on one. Sometimes things went a bit fast, but that was necessary in order to cover all of the topics in the course, and discussing these more complex concepts with Dr. Fortner led to clarity."

Interested students should know that there is a lack of organization within the course that may cause stress throughout the semester in terms of understanding of the homework and knowing what material will be covered on the exam but in the end, the exam material is fair and reflective of the material emphasized in class.",

                "I would recommend it if you have to take it for the major. I would not necessarily recommend it to anyone who is not required to take it. For those in the ENVE major, I think this class is a good alternative to aquatic chemistry, and Professor Fortner is a really cool guy who is quite flexible and understanding. The workload is not easy, but it is reasonable. Same goes for the exams.",
                "Yes, if you are passionate about environmental engineering topics. If you aren't interested in environmental chemistry or environmental engineering then this class will be too much work/too challenging for you to put enough time/effort into the work needed to learn and understand the material",
                "If you are an environmental engineering major, yes. It is very doable with only the into chem sequence and no prior organic chem experience. If you don't need it or aren't interested in organic chemistry then don't take it as it is a lot of work and requires high engagement to understand the material presented.",
                "If my friends are interested in the environmental chemistry or engineering it will be a good class to take, I will absolutely suggest my friends to take this class",
                "If you are interested in environmental engineering and in particular the cleanup of organic molecules in the environment this class is a must. Before coming in, however, I would highly recommend taking thermodynamics and possibly fluid dynamics to prepare yourself for the course as the current prerequisites don't fully prepare you for the course. Fortner is also an amazing professor who will always work with you and do what is best for you.",
                "Yes! It's hard but the content is super interesting, especially if you're into environmental engineering topics.",
                "Certainly, especially if they're in the major! Don't be scared by organic chemistry being in the title - everything was approached from a very physics-oriented perspective, so if you're interested in that, I would strongly recommend this course."
