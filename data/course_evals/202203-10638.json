It was very interesting to see these how these two things differed from each other.",

                "Professor Gorski included some non-white male theorists, but I think that more could be included, even though the scope of the course generally limits the timeframe to a time when those were really the only people allowed to do this kind of work. More practice with writing about theory and/or more specific work on writing about theory would be helpful since this is an intro course and the papers are graded like you should already know how to write a theory paper.",
                "The strengths are the discussions and the readings. The weaknesses are the quizzes.",
                "Overall, I enjoyed this course and had few complaints. The biggest strength, in my opinion, was the small group discussions that we had during every class because they allowed us to discuss the readings and learn from one another. I also enjoyed the way the course was always tied back to contemporary American society. I think this course could be improved, however, by removing the pop quizzes and providing more opportunities to practice writing a theory paper.",
                "The class was very poorly structured and taught. I think we would have benefitted a lot from more discussion/lecture about the main points and takeaways of the reading, beyond in small groups discussions that always got cut short. The quiz format is absolutely absurd, since there are 2 question pop quizzes on obscure details / word choice in the readings that dont even touch on overall understanding. It was also way too big to be a seminar, and was not really structured as a seminar, but we were expected to participate as if it was one, which is unrealistic."

                "Yes. Its a good course just make sure to spend a lot of time on the papers.",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a course that introduces you to some of the most well known theorists in the field of sociology this is a great course. It is a good starting point if you have not had much experience in this field. The selection of theorists chosen were very interesting.",
                "I personally enjoyed this course and would recommend it because it was very thought-provoking and made me think about how the society in which we currently live is shaped by various social, ethical, political, and cultural factors that theorists have been considering for centuries. Despite being a course about early social theory, the course and the readings in particular still felt very relevant which made the course enjoyable. That being said, there was a lot of nightly reading for this course and it often took me hours. If you're not someone who enjoys a lot of assigned reading, this may not be for you.",
                "Definitely not. Only take it if you absolutely have to, and even then, credit D it. The class is not taught well, the expectations are incredibly unrealistic, and the class is overall very frustrating.",
                "No - it is so boring."
