Teachers across all sections seem to be very available for office hours, and Department holds multiple supplementary sessions each week. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Particularly for some of the grammar, would have benefitted from review worksheets with repetitive pattern recognition.",
                "Some of the asynchronous work assignments were really helpful - the Nico's Weg movie was the best language-learning movie I have used, and the videos about various things like dorm life and the importance of being ecologically friendly were interesting. Some were not the most helpful (the chocolate song). To that end, more German music would be great for listening practice and being more familiar with cultural references we might encounter in Germany/Austria/Switzerland."
