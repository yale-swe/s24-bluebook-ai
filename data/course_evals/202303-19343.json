                "I didn't think I would even learn so much language in a single semester. Ostad did an incredible job at covering vast swaths of material, while still making it relatively approachable.",
                "I learned a surprising amount of Persian for only one semester, as well as far more about Iran and Persian culture than I had anticipated. It was really exciting to not only learn how to read and write in Persian so quickly, but also to know so many words and cultural aspects.",
                "I developed all language skills, namely reading, listening, writing, and speaking. I came from no knowledge of Persian, and I already developed a very solid foundation of the language. The Professor ensures that you develop all these skills with frequent and rigorous tests. As a result, you can see your development clearly through test results. The tests are pretty difficult but still manageable.\r\n\r\nI also learnt a lot about Iranian culture, another fantastic aspect of the course. We learnt about arts, authors, movies, food, geography and much else. Probably the best Iranian history course taught at Yale, and it is a language course!",
                "Learned basic Persian vocabulary and grammar. Specifically, learned spoken and written form; how to talk about family, school, daily routines, and food; the  direct object marker; the past, present, and informal future tenses. Also, learned about Persian culture.",
                "I learnt the basics of the Persian language -- conversational level speech and the ability to read the script and some sentences. I also learnt the present and past tenses. I learnt a lot of vocabulary as well as many cultural aspects of Iran and pre-modern Persia.",
                "I learned a great deal not only about the Persian language but also about Persian history and culture.",

                "The textbooks we used were pretty bad (and extremely expensive). They also didn't coincide with the online language learning tool we were using. I think it would be really helpful to stick with the online language learning tool instead of the textbooks. \r\n\r\nThe language table was also not at all helpful. I adored my TA, and I think she just had to work with the instructions she was given. Instead of spending language table working on speaking skills, we just learned new vocabulary that wasn't even used on the tests. It honestly felt like a bit of a waste of time...",
                "The course can be very mildly disorganized, mostly insofar as only tests are graded despite there being many assignments and many announcements are made through Canvas which is hard to keep track of. However, this is a language course which I believe warrants some playing by ear and Ostad is a fantastic professor who knows what she's doing in terms of helping us learn the language. I also enjoyed that the class was at 10:30am and I think this class attracts really nice students who are fun to be around every morning!",
                "The strengths of the course are primarily down to the Professor, who makes sure that the level of language learning is very high, especially key in an L1 course where students are developing basic foundations. The Professor ensures that each student keeps up with their work.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I loved all aspects of the course. One addition might be if the homework for the week is published at the beginning of the week just so we know where to find a clear breakdown of the work, rather than having to check the night before class each day of the week. Again, though, I understand that often the work we have to do depends on how much we get done in class, so maybe a weekly schedule would be too inflexible.",
                "Strengths: learn a lot in a short period of time, gain confidence in speaking and writing, a lot of support (from professor, TF, and CLS), great professor.\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of group projects (3 each semester) that can be annoying, sometimes disorganized with assignments, sometimes difficult to get questions answered or feedback on when you speak in class (she seems more concerned with making sure that you are speaking than with making sure you are speaking correctly, which works well for some people, but I wish I had more direct feedback)",
                "I think the course managed to really instill in me the basics of the language, included verb conjugation and vocabulary, which is a great strength. It required regular work, but it was never unmanageable.",
                "This course does a great job of getting students to a fairly proficient level in the Persian language in only one short semester. My only suggestion for improvement would be more class conversation and dialogue between the professor and students in which students are given a chance to apply what they have learned in a real-life setting.",
                "The courses engagement with audio, visual, and textual resources helped me in developing elementary skills in modern Persian."

If you have a heavy workload or do not have the time, then I would bear in mind that you do need to work hard for this course, however, if you are an underclassman doing your language requirement or anyone who is dedicated to learning Persian then I would absolutely tell you to take this course.",
