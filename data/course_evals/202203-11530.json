Having more actual conversations about content we have read rather than \"how to write an essay\" would have been nice.",
                "A strength is the amount of discussions we had. I really enjoyed having time to talk in small groups before sharing with the whole class.",
                "The course has a lot of work for the amount of writing actually produced. It could have shorter readings to allow for more writing time.",
                "Strengths: wide array of media explored in class, different class formats (group discussions vs. workshops vs. independent revision time)\r\nWeaknesses: deadlines are a bit short, instructions sometimes unclear",
                "Strengths: strong breakdown of how to think about different writing process with different focuses over time, great job with understanding what good writing looks like and how to work towards it (and what's wrong with high school writing\/what we've been taught in the past), Sam always makes time for his students and is happy to help, Sam is also very understanding of his students' circumstances, check-ins were definitely nice to have, detailed feedback on essays and clear suggestions on how and what to improve\r\nWeaknesses: Grading feels a bit tough (?), discussion sometimes feels very BS-ey (as in students just say the most random things that are highly questionable and possible just straight up wrong interpretations) but maybe such contributions shouldn't be discouraged and maybe they're common in any English class\r\nDon't feel like these weaknesses necessarily need to be addressed though"

                "I think it depends on the level of English instruction you have received previously. A lot of the knowledge felt very juvenile and foundational which would have been a nice preface as someone with more English experience. I think other sections of ENGL 114 that were less meta (a concept like hope was pretty broad and thus not easily conducive to a class like this) may be better.",
                "Yes because it is very structured in terms of the papers and assignments we have but it also gives you freedom to explore certain topics you want which makes the overall writing experience more enjoyable.",
                "It is a tough class that may grade pretty hard as well, but it definitely teaches good writing skills. I personally am glad I took it once (improved my writing a lot), but I don't think I would take it again.",
                "If they are willing to spend their time discussing one topic for the entire semester. If not, maybe do not take the course.",
                "Yes great class for someone who's unconfident in their writing and who finds the idea of hope intriguing. Also great professor!"
