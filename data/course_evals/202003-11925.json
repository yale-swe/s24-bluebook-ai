                "Strengths:  Lisa is an empathetic and accessible professor. The guest speakers were interesting and offered a lot of advice. Weaknesses: Since the class was made up of people from different concentrations, not everything applied to my field of interest. I also really wish I was assigned an advisor earlier because I feel like I got too far into my project without any focused guidance. Ways to improve: Assign advisors at the beginning of the semester so they can help students with the critical first few steps of their projects (i.e. ideation, research, initial directions, etc.).",

There is definitely a lot of sitting around during critiques, especially when its outside your concentration and when there are guest critics present, but this class was a lot better than previous reviews had led me to expect. Lisa is a super caring professor\/DUS. The guest speakers shower you with information and advice. And its cool to see how other art majors have grown during their time at Yale and what theyre doing for their senior projects.",
