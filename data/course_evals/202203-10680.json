I was also able to learn more about Spanish cultures, especially the cultures of Central American countries. LinguaMeeting proved to be especially useful, helping me to improve my speaking and also learn about the Honduras culture.",

                "Taking the course, I was able to learn about more grammar rules and conventions in the Spanish language. I was also able to learn new vocabulary that I had not previously known before. I gained skills in presentation and verbal conversations in Spanish. Additionally, I gained an insight into the culture and work environment in Spanish speaking countries.",

                "The professor (Pilar) is undoubtedly a strength of this course, perpetually nice and patient while still helping us deepen our understanding of the course material. The fast pace of the course is another big plus because, even though there is a fair amount of work to do, you end up learning a lot throughout the semester. The grading is fair and sufficiently spaced out (through multiple exams, in-class compositions, cultural activities and projects, in-class participation etc) that, as long as you put in the work and study hard, you need not worry about any individual assessment. Speaking of cultural activities, the weekly LinguaMeeting sessions were a particular high point of the course because they allowed students to talk directly to a native speaker in an informative yet relaxed setting, while the multi-part cultural project also genuinely allowed us to learn a lot about the target cultures we were researching. Perhaps the only weakness of the course is the undue focus that is given to Supersite homework as a means of learning vocabulary and grammar; while Supersite is not bad per se, solving the exercises given there is hardly sufficient to get a truly solid grasp of the language, especially when the class sessions themselves are much more culture-focused.",
                "I think the class tries to fit too much content every day when it should focus on going more in depth on a smaller section of topics.",
                "The biggest strength is that students get the opportunity to learn various things about the language and Hispanic culture, and helps students become multi-cultured. I personally don't see any significant weakness with the course.",
                "Pilar is a great teacher. Sometimes I would find it difficult to get excited for classsometimes it wasn't the most engaging. To improve class, I would play more games.",
                "The course provided a good range of learning resources and covered a lot of material. However, I think the course could be improved by devoting more time to each concept, as it felt rushed at times.",
                "Strengths: challenging students tot talk in class by asking them questions \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not reviewing grammer in class",
                "The strengths of this class is how well developed the classroom setting is. I like how I was able to use my Spanish skills in class and practice speaking in Spanish. I was able to also learn more about the cultural aspect of different Spanish speaking countries and utilize the new vocabulary and grammar that I was learning to everyday life. A weakness of this course is how fast paced the class is. I thought there was not enough time spent on going over the grammar in class. It was very much study the grammar at home, but I wished we could've gone over more in class.",
                "The class is small so there is a lot of participation and you are highly engaged throughout the semester",
                "The class is well organized and well-paced, fostering a good environment to learn Spanish. You learn quickly and thoroughly. It meets everyday, but it's also interesting and fun!\r\n\r\nYou hit the ground running in this class (especially if taken off-sequence in the fall), so it would have been nice to have a little bit more time for structured review.",
                "More time in class spent on vocabulary would be of use. I also had a difficult time understanding the guidelines for some speaking activities and would appreciate more guidelines (such as a time limit). The best part of this course was having a small class size and spending a lot of time practicing speaking during class. Lingua Meeting was also a great addition to the course."

                "I would take this course only to fulfill the language requirement. I learned a lot, but there are much more interesting classes at Yale.",
                "Yes, I think it's a good way to improve one's Spanish skills.",
                "Yes, if you are trying to improve your grammar in Spanish I highly recommend this class. This class will also help you to feel more comfortable speaking spanish. If you don't push yourself to speak and ask questions in class you will not learn.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it was a smooth transition over from L1 Spanish. I would highly recommend Spanish department in general for the language requirement because the assignments are straight forward and as long as you put in the work and time for the assignments, the class in general is pretty straight forward. This class should not be treated as a gut course.",

                "Yes~ In my opinion, Spanish seems to be one of the more organized language programs at Yale. So, I highly recommend Spanish to other students, as you will learn a lot (with relatively low stress) and have some fun while doing it.",
                "Yes--prof made sure to engage all students in class conversation and thoroughly correct students when making mistakes speaking. At the beginning of the semester, I felt rather unconfident in my speaking abilities in front of the class, but by the end, I felt very comfortable and could use a lot of the new vocabulary and verb tenses that I had learned in class without having to rely on memorization."
