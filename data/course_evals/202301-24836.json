I also heard from some amazing, high-ranking guest speakers in the field of US-China relations, and it was great to hear about both their work experience and their thoughts on the future of US-China relations.",

                "Strengths: Professor Smith is super engaging and brings so much knowledge into the classroom. Listening to him talk is like listening to an informative podcast - he's able to talk about anecdotes from his work experience in China as well as factual knowledge about US-China relations in such an easy-to-understand, fun way. I like that the assignments gave us a lot of freedom to explore topics we're personally interested in. Workload is generally light, but the reading selection was great.\r\nOne potential weakness was that I wish there were slightly more feedback regarding the class debates - not necessarily which side won, but which arguments seemed more\/less valid, what important caveat we missed while arguing for one side, etc.",
                "The main strength of this course was Professor Smith, who provided great personal insights on the U.S.-China relationship from his own experiences working at the State Department. The two memos and two debates were tasks that are highly applicable to the real world and a great exercise to think critically about the topics.",
                "I loved the seminar style, and the projects and debates supported the content well.",

                "Yes! Professor Hanscom is very knowledgeable and hearing his perspective was eye-opening.",
                "Definitely, Professor Smith brings so much knowledge to the classroom, and he talks about US-China relations in such an engaging way. US-China relations is obviously a super important topic in today's world, and this class would give you considerable insight into the history, status quo, and future of this important relationship, while giving you the freedom to dive deeper into topics you're interested in through assignments. You also get to hear from some great guest speakers.",
