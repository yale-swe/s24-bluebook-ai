                "Strengths are that you only have to write 1 full lab report. All of the other writings are building you up to writing the full lab report, but it is only 1 kind of long paper. The professor and TA are also two amazingly helpful people who really help you with the assignments and labs as long as you ask for help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that the first 3 or so weeks are spent doing electronics which is kind of boring, but necessary for later lab uses.",
                "Dr. Cooper does a great job of balancing the workload of the class. He understands that writing full-fledged lab reports each week is onerous, so he gradually builds up the work to prepare you for a full report by the end of the semester. Data discussions are super helpful if you've started on the analysis, so make sure to get started early!",
                "The biggest strength of the class is Dr. Cooper. He is extremely supportive throughout the course, and his structuring of the class and workload were very reasonable and accommodating. The reformatting of the Errors packet and scheduling so the class ended by reading period were both very appreciated. The lab instruction packets were sometimes a bit dense and over explanatory in comparison to what we needed to understand for the lab and analysis; however, they are very comprehensive. Maybe a bit of streamlining or pre-emptively letting us know what may not be essential to internalize for class (ex. the detailed instructions on the bomb operation or the argon sublimation device when we're walked through it in detail in class).",
                "This course is a difficult yet rewarding course. The work is not very distributed and the course tends to disappear until reappearing suddenly a few nights before the reports are due.",
                "learned a lot !!!",
                "Strengths: Paul Cooper is awesome; he tries to make the course as best as possible. TA is also helpful. Having the option to only write a report for either Expts 3 or 4 was great. Final presentation at the end was great too.\r\nWeaknesses: Obviously its a lot of work. I believe the course has been made slightly easier so its not as bad as reports from 3+ years ago make it seem. It just feels very tedious. But if the work is spread out and planned properly in advance, it will is manageable. A lot of work, but manageable. Would say the biggest weakness of the course to be improved is the NMR lab: the data analysis guidelines were not clear, and it was extremely difficult to understand the theoretical principles, yet the least attention to explanation was given for it.",
                "I really enjoyed how fun the labs were, especially given that most of the experiments done involved techniques that I had never done before."

                "I would recommend this course to people interested in getting some significant feedback on your writing in a lab report sense. I would also recommend this class to all chemistry majors.",
                "Yes. Dr. Cooper is really helpful in clarifying confusing concepts and instructions. He strikes a good balance of guiding you through the experiment and also letting you figure things out on your own. It's a great class to learn more about physical chemistry if you're interested in the subject.",
                "You probably aren't taking this class unless you're a chemistry major--if you aren't a chemistry major or looking to eventually publish chemistry research, I would say it's not the worth it. That said, this class as Dr. Cooper teaches it is NOT NEARLY as bad as the hype leads you to believe. It is certainly not a class to change your major over, at least not anymore. To be clear, it is a lot of work--my final report was 5000+ words--but Dr Cooper eases you into it. There's one worksheet at the start of the semester and 6 lab reports afterward; four of which are entirely data analysis and only one full report. Again, this is a lot, but it is definitely doable. Take it in a four-credit semester, as best as you can stay up on the analysis as it happens (a stitch in time really does save nine here), and prepare to sacrifice a couple weekends and some break time. You've got this :)",
                "This course isn't as scary as many people put it out to be. So yes, take it.",
                "yes if you are a chem major",
                "Yes, I think the workload is still a 5. But the workload is manageable if you plan ahead and spread the work out effectively. Dont be too scared of the course; theres a lot of help and understanding from Dr. Cooper and the TA.",
                "Yes. The experiments allow you to physically apply concepts that you learned in lecture, making it much easier for you to conceptualize principles and see them in real life."
