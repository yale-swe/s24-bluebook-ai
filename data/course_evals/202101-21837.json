                "Because of COVID, we did not get to have any in-person labs. In a normal year it would be a great chance to get good hands-on experience in a ChemE lab, but this year we simply were given the data to do analysis with for our reports. The main skill gained this year was practice writing good reports, summarizing data, and identifying sources of error.",
                "I learned many useful excel skills and the ability to sift through lots of data to make sense of it. Also, I learned some more on experimental membrane separating, distillation, reactor use, heat transfer, and complex fluids.",
                "Most of the course focused on the bigger picture analysis of the labs rather than detailed correlations of data. I found that very useful especially since nowadays, those correlations are easily done on a computer and I think this course did a great job in training us to think about what the data actually means and what factors are influencing the data.",
                "I learned about important ChemE techniques (from lectures), how to analyze data, and how to write lab reports.",
                "I developed the ability to work quickly and efficiently with a team when presented with theory and mass amounts of data. Error analysis, etc.",
                "It was just building upon the chemical engineering foundation we already had from all our other classes. The difference was we got to see it in action vs in theory, so it felt a lot more real through this class."

                "I think the strengths of this course are the fact that you work together on every lab in a group of three. Also, I think having one TA per group greatly helped with answering any questions we had in a timely manner. I think a major weakness is that we could not physically conduct any of the labs in person which greatly hindered our real world skills with this equipment.",
                "Unfortunately, being a lab class, the virtual experience was not ideal. However, I think the lab group meetings after lecture were great for collaboration and problem solving between the team and it was great to have a TA there to help out through the difficult parts of the analysis.",
                "The variety of lab techniques reviewed was a plus, but I felt that there was little guidance on how to write a lab report.  I think a more thorough explanation at the beginning of the course would have been helpful.",
                "The fact that the course was a laboratory course conducted virtually was very difficult. Though this isnt a fault of the course itself as much as it is the fault of the circumstances, it made the data analysis portion difficult. Professor and TA availability is a strength.",
                "I mean the structure of the class is very good, two weeks to do a lab and then two weeks after that to do a lab report. I wish the expectations of the lab reports were made a little clearer earlier on, or like an example report was provided for us. That would have been very helpful. Also having a lot of TAs was very beneficial and a strength for sure.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't feel like I can accurately do this question justice being I had a virtual experience."

                "The work with breakout groups worked decently well. Class was 3 hours, 2.5 hours of which was working with your group to complete data analysis and .5 hours of which was a lecture from the professor. I think the lectures could have been longer to provide us with more background knowledge and instructions before we began actually working on the labs.",
                "I think that splitting up into breakout rooms for each group succeeded and allowed for easy communication at a set time.",
                "The lab videos where the TA's explained the lab setup were often critical to my understanding of the lab. Having at least a visual of the equipment used really helped me make more sense of the data we were presented and how we might use it.",
                "Hopefully this class does not have to be virtual again, as it's a lab class that benefits greatly from having students actually perform experiments.",
                "Maybe incorporating simulations for some labs (an example that could illustrate this is sapling learnings use of titration simulations to encourage student engagement and learning) could help understanding of the theory behind the labs. Group assignments was very effective",
                "Recorded lectures helped, using breakout rooms was good. I wish there was more use of the canvas page, as it has a lot of functionality meant to help both students and faculty alike, but it was almost never used. I am thinking specifically of the assignments tab, all our lab reports were handed in via email which is fine, but can definitely feel wishywashy at times as emails can get lost in an inbox all the time."
