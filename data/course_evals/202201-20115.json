                "Strengths were Professor Hartman! She was amazing and enrichment really helped tie together concepts. Professor Prum was also very passionate and had interesting lectures that were very important for a lot of modern topics. Weaknesses were that information was often presented in a confusing or disorganized way, especially in later lectures on specific groups like animals or fungi.",
                "This course could be improved by having exams count less, and have other types of assignments that would allow students to engage more with the material. This was my least favorite class in the BIOL sequence.",
                "The support system of this course is very good with access to professors, TAs, and the Ed discussion.",
                "Strengths: Professors Hartman & Prum are exceptional as always. Professors' enthusiasm for teaching and learning about the subject made me want to learn. The presentation and slides were engaging and just the right amount of information was needed. Weaknesses: Throughout the bio sequence, the peer tutoring sessions were admittedly not at all helpful, and I felt that this resource could have been better utilized if it was more effective at helping us review or learn the content. Some of the latter, more provocative lectures, could have used trigger warnings or some kind of disclaimer for students with trauma/sensitivity issues.",
                "Strengths: the content! Super fascinating. Also Dr. Prum! He was super interesting and definitely infused the lectures with some interesting idiosyncratic character. The content was generally well-taught. Also, enrichment was a great opportunity.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lecture was confusing and difficult to follow (but not always). Section was also sometimes low-energy.",
                "This course was very clearly structured and very organized. Any questions were clarified and there was lots of extra support.",
                "way too many slides and felt very poorly organized, studying was a pain in the ass",
                "Strengths: Prof Prum was a really nice professor and seemed passionate about the material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The main thing that will differentiate grades are the midterm and final because problem sets and writing assignments are pretty easy to do well on",
                "The course was absolutely fantastic overall and there are not many weaknesses that come to mind.  Prof Prum was hilarious and engaging, and if anyone sees Prof Hartman teaching or coordinating a course, they should absolutely take it.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Prum is a great speaker and provided an interesting perspective on sexual selection/ornithology; enjoyed the tour of the peabody\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture structure/content was poorly designed; the goal of the course appearned to be to race through as many disparate terms/concepts/diagrams with no coherent, underlying framwork unifying the concepts learned. Assessments were based largely on memorizing useless factoids that can easily be looked up in the digital age (i.e. whether or not an ecdysozoan is a protosome).",
                "There's too much direct memorization, no one needs to know what the distinctive trait of the clade lophoctrozoans is.",
                "I thought this class was really good, I didn't think the professor had to go as in depth about physiology since that is not a focus of the course just information he wanted us to know in general",
                "Strengths: i think birds are pretty cool, so that was interesting\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are not engaging, and the exams are poorly written/subjectively graded, the concepts that are tested aren't emphasized well",
                "This course is very strong in the structure and order of the lectures. We start with the basics of Darwin and end with Professor Prum's passionate explanation of his research and the greater impact of health and medicine as it relates to evolutionary biology! The Peabody Tours were an AMAZING addition to the course!",
                "Strengths: The lecturing was amazing and Professor Prum is very talented and has many ideas that I think us younger students are not traditionally exposed to in a classroom setting. I also thought that the class tour was a great addition, and the exams were pretty fair if you prepared well enough in advance. Student and TA/professor engagement was also pretty good, the ed discussion was always active.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the writing assignment did not fit in cohesively with the rest of the class, I would have preferred another PSET that focused on constructing phylogenetic trees based on what we learned about the Tree of Life from lectures 7-9 instead, since this was a critical skill that was tested on examinations.",
                "The sections were not super helpful in supplementing or adding to my learning and the lecture material. Assessments were also a lot of content that was not always relevant.",
                "strengths-- good amount of assignments, work, and problem sets\r\n\r\nweaknesses- difficult exams that required very high levels of memorization, lectures that could sometimes drag on",

                "The course evaluated us for memorization. Nobody will ever remember the phylogenies of fungi or plants or anything like that. The course would be much better if the lectures were focused more on conceptual thinking than strict memorization. Also the homework, like BIOL 103, was a research paper that didn't seem to add to my understanding of the content of the course.",

                "I would have loved for this lecture to be recorded to go back and be able to re-watch as I studied",
                "I think the course was extremely well formatted to allow for student engagement. Professor Prum was an extremely compelling lecturer and he did a great job giving us an introduction to ecology and evolutionary biology. The TAs also did a really great job at facilitating discussion sections and allowing us to maximize our understanding of the papers that we read. \r\nMy one suggestion would be to have at least one pset in the second half of the course, so that students can get practice with making phylogenetic trees and understanding the relationships between different monophyletic groups.",
                "Unlike the other intro biology courses, this course has a more direct way of studying (mostly vocabulary and understanding concepts). There is a bit of memorization with the phylogenies and the second half of the course is really packed with the last few lectures feeling really dense in material that felt like a lot when studying for the last midterm.",
                "Professor Prum obviously knows his stuff and enjoys teaching this topic immensely. Didn't really understand the point of the writing assignment when two psets would've helped us understand the latter half of the material.",
                "The course was organized really well. I did not come into this class very excited because I do not particularly enjoy ecology but this class was really interesting and I definitely feel like I learned a lot of important information that will be useful in a medical career. All of the lectures were super engaging and the exams and assignments were all very fair.",
                "Strength: lots of information yet delivered in an informative and exciting way",
                "Strengths: I think the teaching staff (especially Profs. Prum and Hartman) were the main strength of this course. I also appreciated how there was less punitive assignments on a weekly basis, which let me actually develop a self-motivated interest in learning the course material instead of forcing me to digest it all quickly and regurgitate the information I learned on quizzes. The overall phylogeny assignment was also pretty interesting, and the problem sets were not at all difficult. The field trip to Marsh BG/Peabody was also really cool!\r\nWeaknesses: I think the final exam was a bit harder than the course material that was taught, or it could have been the fact that there wasn't much in-between assessment to make sure we grasped skills earlier on. The lecture material was a bit too dense during the plant, animal, and fungus units, so spreading that out over more lectures would be really helpful as it was hard to learn every single detail within that short period of time. I also think that the teaching fellows weren't as involved in this course as I've seen them be in other courses, but it is a huge class, so I can understand that!",
                "Lots of memorization. Prum is an engaging lecturer but there is so much material.",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting. There were many cool examples. Clear instructions and deadlines were provided for assignments. I felt supported and knew who to turn to for questions.\r\nWeaknesses: Many concepts were not defined properly in lectures; nor were the definitions in the slides. Even though I paid special attention in lectures, I sometimes had to look them up in the textbook or on the Internet.",
                "Strengths: assessment structure is okay with non-cumulative midterm and final. There was a lot of information to memorize for the final and the exams focus far more on rote memorization than the other classes in the BIOL sequence. Prof. Prum is an interesting lecturer who clearly knows a lot. The human physiology was interesting and applied to being pre-med more than any other part of the BIOL sequence. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PSets and Writing Assignments didn't really do much to aid in my learning. The sheer amount needed to study for the final was a lot, but manageable. Not sure that sections aided in my learning either; the papers were pretty dry and topics were all over the place.",
                "The course will benefit from weekly psets like the ones in Bio102 which directly engage with the course material and the new vocabulary, which helps to consolidate the knowledge. Going through the review papers in sections is enough exposure for students to know what it is. Instead of writing a paper, a small task discussing the outline of a review paper would have been sufficient practice.",
                "Strengths: organization, the engaging way Prof. Prum lectures, Professor Hartman.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the insertion of photosynthesis and body systems was a bit awkward and odd in the sequence of lectures. I also think the lecture on Sexual Selection was oddly explained; I generally do not like the lack of nuance in the lecture, since to study animals in the context of human sexuality is odd as a construct to begin with. Prof. Prum said the word \"eugenic\" many times, yet did not explain what it means in the context nor expand upon the caveats of eugenics in this realm. Prof Prum was also generally not accessible outside of lectures, so that was a bit odd.",
                "Strength was the material was engaging and the writing assignment was kind of cool. Weakness was that the articles were not the most interesting.",
                "discussion sections are pointless and if you are going to be super strict with us turning in homework, you have to return it in a reasonable amount of time so that we can improve our homework",
                "Strengths: Really interesting material, taught in a pretty engaging way. Sections were much much better compared to the other ones in the bio sequence (you could easily understand the paper and talk through the concepts in class). The non-cumulative exams were also very very helpful and made the class less stressful. Weaknesses: There was a lottt of material to cover and it was sometimes hard to know what all we needed to know for the exams (especially the final). A comprehensive study guide might be helpful for the final just so everyone is on the same page as to what is expected. Releasing the recorded lectures would also increase accessibility to the class for those who were sick, out of town, overslept, etc (I think all classes should do this even post-COVID).",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, lots of resources to help with the course, great teaching team. Weaknesses: Lots of memorization (innate to evolutionary biology, not the course's fault).",
                "really great course, engaging and helpful for my major (MBB). lot of content to understand in a short period. sometimes I didn't know exactly what I should be trying to memorize and what was just extra information",
                "I loved this course and I wouldn't change anything about it. I just wish I had taken it during a lighter point in my semester.",
                "Strengths: very organized, knowledgable, and passionate professor, many resources for success, manageable workload, interesting and relevant content, etc \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of memorization (a good thing for some students)",
                "There is a lot of information in this course and it doesnt always come across clearly or in an easy to understand or study manner. Slides are dense and need a lot of time outside of class to grasp. Lectures just speed through the material and a lot of people end up confused.",
                "Very good content!",
                "Provides very refreshing and somewhat radical interpretation of Darwinian theory, but it is very beautiful and eye-opening",
                "A weakness of this course is we did not know what to study for exams because we were responsible for everything on all of the slides which would be impossible to memorize all of it.",
                "Richard Prum was a good professor. I wish the lectures were recorded in order to allow for rewatching.",
                "This was probably the most fun course out of the BIOL series. I wish there was a bit less memorisation, but you really can't expect much else from a course in ecology. Overall, the course structure was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the course content.",
                "I really enjoyed Prof. Prum as the lecturer, he was really engaging and made it more interesting",
                "Great basic course.",
                "I felt that there was a good balance between testing and writing/discussion. My only complaint was the amount of memorization that was required-- it felt unnecessary.",
                "Strengths: the professors lectures were clearly structured, and they did not skip around\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: too many changes in due times. WAY too strict about deadline time. Too much writing",
                "The strengths include the lecturer and lecture materials. Weaknesses include lack of opportunities to engage with what were actually learning in class (ex. Psets)",
                "I really enjoyed how the lectures were structured. I think that the discussion sections were also relevant to what we were learning. I do wish that the assignments were maybe restructured a tad, giving us more feedback on our final writing assignment or having it worth less of the grade. The expectations were not always entirely clear.",
                "Very detailed lectures, heavy on memorization.",
                "It was well organized and what was expected of us was clear, and there were many resources to help. I can't think of any weaknesses",
                "The lectures were engaging and interesting; but I found that the discussion sections did not engage much with what we learned in class.",
                "Course material was clear cut and Professor gave review sessions. Lecture slides could have been more detailed.",
                "Strengths: Professor Prum was a great lecturer. Enrichment was also so helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: The way the lectures were structured, it was difficult to tell what was important and what were just fun facts.",
                "The class is more enjoyable than previous BIOL units. I only felt the exam focused a lot of particular topics and did not reflect everything we covered.",
                "The lectures were a strength. The memorization of detailed phylogeny seemed a bit unnecessary.",
                "The course is taught by excellent professors, unfortunately it is so large that their full teaching effect is lost",
                "The material is very interesting and Professor Prum is a great lecturer. However, many lectures felt overloaded with content which was very demotivating at times.",
                "The strengths were the interesting topics we covered and the weaknesses were how the extensive topics were presented. Sometimes the teaching felt rushed",
                "Great instructor and fair tests.",
                "Professor Prum and Professor Hartman are the greatest strengths of the course. Of all the professors of the introductory biology sequence, I think Prof. Prum was the best. He was clearly passionate about his work, created interesting lectures, and definitely wanted to engage with undergraduate students.  The field trips to the Marsh Botanical Garden and the Peabody museum were excellent additions. The weakness of this course was that the writing assignment felt very much like busywork.",
                "This course is not very good. You will not learn very much if you have taken highschool biology. That's not to say it is without merit, but it is not a good use of a Yale class credit. Take a more advanced biology class instead.",
                "This course is definitely the best taught of the introductory biology modules, but it can still serve to benefit from a number of structural improvements. To facilitate student learning, the course should be restructured to make the enrichment materials and lecture available to all. This applies to BIOL 103, which follows a similar lecture-based class format with no regularly assigned problem sets. There are a number of ways to do this. Based on my experience in the class, the most effective way would perhaps be to replace the \"journal club\" discussion sections with a more traditional style of discussion section, focused on content review and class discussion (basically how enrichment was already run). Another way would be to convert the material presented in the enrichment lectures into (graded) problem sets that covered the same kinds of material. Regardless of how it is done, I really think making the enrichment material more accessible will present a net benefit to both BIOL 103 and 104. To students that benefit from learning by doing/application-based learning (like myself), the \"enrichment\" material isn't enrichment as much as it is necessity, whereas the journal papers discussed in discussion seemed like more traditional \"enrichment\" material.\r\nIn terms of the paper assignment: the guidelines for submission of both assignments were completely illogical and didn't make any sense (relative to how you write a research paper in essentially any other discipline, scientific and non-scientific). The first assignment should have acted as the introductory element to the research paper, and the second assignment should have been the continuation (which is to say, both assignments should have been submitted together for the second assignment with the first assignment acting as the contextual background for the second assignment).",
                "I think overall this course is taught the best out of the four introductory biology sequence. I think there is still some need for discussion in the amount of content that is taught in the course. Sometimes it feels a bit much especially in terms of understanding everything.",
                "It's an interesting course for learning evolutionary biology, however, there is an issue with knowing what it is that one must know for exams. Topics in general are also quite interesting.",
                "Strength is the enrichments which really helped. I just wish that the writing papers were graded less harshly.",
                "This course was very well taught and organized, as Professor Prum is a very engaging lecturer and Professor Hartman did an incredible job ccordinating the logistics as always. The structure of this module was different from the previous three modules, but felt more balanced overall in terms of assigning problem sets and writing assignments. I felt that this course did a very good job with facilitating student learning on the topic. One small weakness is that is was unclear what would be tested on the final exam if the student did not attend the additional enrichment sessions. Additionally, it would have been very helpful to provide an integrated tree of life that we would be required to know, as trying to synthesize the tree from slides scattered throughout the lectures was difficult.",
                "Strengths: Prof Prum is literally so famous which makes this a unique opportunity to hear directly from someone who is a leader in thought of the field. The material itself is fascinating and you learn nuances so that you can more critically assess current research and findings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Feels like a lot of content is covered in such unimaginably short time frames for lecture but at the same time it's challenging to pay attention to an information dense 1.25 hour long lecture.",
                "Strengths Prof Prum & Prof Hartman are very engaged and care about your learning. The course is pretty straightforward with material and the assignments do help reinforce learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses I think it would have been helpful to have psets/some sort of assignment to help us learn the relevant phylogenies in the latter half of the course. There is often a LOT of information in one ppt lecture and its difficult to keep up during class so some reinforcement would have been helpful.",
                "I wish I would have received more feedback from the first writing assignment. As well as a study guide before the final and midterm.",
                "Strengths: the professor was amazing, good lecture slides and went at a good pace, discussion sections were interesting\r\nWeaknesses: nothing in mind",
                "Lots of detailed information but online resources were great, professors/TFs were easy to contact (Ed discussion particularly)\r\nProf Hartman's Enrichment was great!!! So much helpful information, another explanation of material, and a chance to practice before assessments. They were especially useful before exams.\r\n\r\nProf Prum talked super fast and that made it hard to know what was important",
                "The course was a good intro to EEB but was very broad and some of the lectures felt very rushed (especially when we were talking about phylogeny/clades).",
                "I liked the format and everything about it.",
                "I would have preferred having weekly psets rather than the writing assignments.",
                "Strengths: The course was interesting and brought in relevant applications (COVID, antibiotic resistance) that I have not been exposed to. The ornithology topics were also interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish lecture recordings were accessible online. It is hard to hear the professor sometimes and the content is explained very quickly, giving little time to digest the information or take proper notes. It would be easier to study even if lecture recordings were made available shortly before exams. I prefer more problem sets over the final paper as it made me engage with the course material in a direct way. The final paper felt more like busy work and did not help me apply concepts as much.",
                "Strengths: Great professors, interesting content, Enrichment was very helpful in emphasizing the most important concepts, tests required memorization but rewarded studying content that we had directly learned rather than testing content in a new way.\r\nWeaknesses: Section was not very engaging compared to previous biology courses and didn't help as much with learning central concepts of the course. Lots of memorization and content for tests, which sometimes asked for pretty specific details that may not have seemed as crucial as key concepts.",
                "Prof. Prum is a really engaging lecturer and highly knowledgable. The content was super interesting, and it was a relatively light course-load compared to the rest of the bio sequence. Having the sections be a journal club I think was a great idea. I can't think of many weaknesses - I honestly loved the course.",
                "Strengths of this course include the interesting material as well as the writing assignments, which really allow you to learn a lot about one species of interest. Another strength would be the section trips to the Peabody Museum and Marsh Gardens. I definitely learned a lot on those trips and it inspired me to take advantage of Yale's resources and potentially study ecology. Weakenesses include the fact that lecture recordings are not released, so it is difficult to go back to information that you might not have understood well the first time.",
                "strengths: the professor is great at teaching, the information is well planned out, variety of assignment made homework more enjoyable/engaging, enjoyed the break of regular discussion section with informative activities, discussion section leader; coordinators; and professors were great",
                "Strength: p-sets were straightforward, fun, & reinforced lecture material\r\nWeakness: not enough p-sets (we need homework that reinforces lec 6-12!!!)",
                "I think the tests in this course should be more application based, rather than memorization based because I find that to be more effective in learning Biology."

                "Yes! You probably won't be taking it unless you have to (and it's definitely not worth taking BIOL 103 for), but it was super interesting and thought-provoking in a way that biology often isn't.",
                "No, just don't. If you can place out of it, do it. If you have to take it, just suffer through it for half a semester and you will be done.",
                "Yes, it it a good introduction to evolutionary biology and the subject matter is interesting.",
                "Yes - if you are premed/bio major you likely do not have a choice. But of the courses in the intro bio sequence, this is much better than the other modules and is more attuned to the knowledge that first-year college students actually have about biology.",
                "YES! Very interesting stuff, especially with Prof. Prum. I feel like it's really important to learn how the biosphere works on a larger scale, both temporally and spatially, so yep, I'd recommend this class.",
                "Yes. Lots of cool information, interesting teaching and overall great execution.",
                "no",
                "No, unless you are pre-med or you need for the major. I would not take this class for fun, especially considering you need to take 103 before this which is a nightmare",
                "Absolutely! You learn so much in a low-stress environment, get to write about the trait of a clade of your choosing, and come out feeling like you know the world a little bit better.",
                "Least unpleasant of the 4 intro bio courses, if that counts for anything.",
                "No, if you're trying to take a science credit, take some other class (only take this if you're premed or majoring in a non-CS/Math stem major).",
                "yes if you are interested in ecology",
                "I mean sure, you probably have to take it, it's better than 102 and 103",
                "I would recommend this course to another student! The passion of the teaching staff is amazing.",
                "Yes if it's required. It's the last module in the intro bio sequence, and in my opinion one of the least painful on par with BIOL 101.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should take some biology including this part of the sequence.",
                "I personally did not find this course interesting because I mainly like human biology and this was a lot of information and facts about plants, fungi, etc. \r\nthe lectures were not super interesting and the exams required a lot of memorization of information I found relatively pointless",
                "If you need it sure.",
                "No I wouldn't. The class was extremely packed with material and we had to memorize information before exams. The class wasn't evaluating you on what you learned, but more on how much information you could memorize.",
                "Yes, I believe that this course was very enjoyable and made me more interested in ecology and organism biology.",
                "only if its a major requirement -- its the best of the courses in the bio sequence but that's not really hard to do because biol 101-103 set the standards pretty low; nothing against prof prum though, the course was very well taught, the bio sequence is just a 0/10 overall",
                "Yes, very interesting if interested in biology",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to learn about ecology and evolution. Professor Prum does an excellent job of providing a detailed introduction on the subject, and he is a wonderful lecturer. The work load is very manageable and it's very possible succeed in the class as long as you put in the work!",
                "Probably have to take it as a requirement. Fun topics but the tests were really difficult.",
                "Chances are you don't really have a choice on taking this class or not but nonetheless it is a very interesting and enjoyable class.  If you can wait to take the class until Professor Prum teaches it definitely do because he is an amazing lecturer and provides a really unique perspective on a lot of evolutionary biology.",
                "100%. My favourite Yale course so far, so engaging and Prof. Prum and Hartman do such a great job keeping students engaged.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, so long as its required for your major or you have a true interest in ecology and evolutionary biology. Prof. Prum is a really effective teacher, and seems to genuinely care about his students and the topic that he teaches, which is great. I think my one recommendation to students would be to attend enrichment sessions with Prof. Hartman if she is still offering them, as it's extra practice to get a sense of what the key concepts from each lecture are, since they tend to be a bit dense and information-packed. The problem sets are incredibly easy, and the writing assignment is a bit more challenging, but not awful. Definitely take this course and do the work necessary to get back some benefits!",
                "I would as you likely need it for your bio sequence. It's typically referred to as the easiest of the four.",
                "The course is higher workload and more difficult than you would think. The exams are hard with a lot of memorization of random things. Week to week, however, there is not a lot of work. The content itself is interesting and Prum is an engaging lecturer.",
                "If this course is a requirement for you, I wouldn't advise against taking it with Prum. If you're just interested in the material, I think you can enjoy the course even if you haven't taken BIOL 101-103. Also, please keep in mind that although the lectures and sections are very interesting, you will be asked to recall many concepts AND EXAMPLES from the material in exams.",
                "No, only take it if you have to finish the bio sequence. If you are interested in evolutionary biology, just take an actual EEB class",
                "Not if it's a requirement.",
                "Yes, if you made it to bio 103 just stick it through to the end because 104 is easier and more engaging. I like the professor a lot too. I thought I learned some cool stuff.",
                "Yes!! It sucks you have to go through all the other bio sequence classes to get to this one but it was really cool and a nice class to end the sequence with!",
                "Yes, this course was a great overview of evolution and ecology. It was also very interesting! I would just recommend students to keep up with the material; since memorization is required in this course, falling behind will make it especially difficult to learn.",
                "yes, if it is required for their major",
                "Yes, absolutely. The content matter is fascinating and I really enjoyed what I learned.",
                "Yes, I would. This class was very interesting and the workload was much better than the other sections of intro biology. I'm leaving with a lot of new knowledge that is not only relevant to biology and evolution but also fascinating facts to know.",

                "Yes!",
                "I would reccomend this course because it was an interesting introduction to the ecology and evolutionary biology department, however, if we were told which concepts to learn and know explicitly it would have made the course much less convoluted.",
                "Yes I think understanding the interconnectedness of all species if important.",
                "Sure! It's important to know about all areas of biology if that's something you're looking at pursuing, so completing the sequence with ecology and evolution really is vital to understanding how everything fits into the grander picture of biology.",
                "Yes, it is a manageable class and it is interesting",
                "Yes - great for EEB.",
                "Yes, I think it's overall a great course.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in biology and specifically evolution. I also think it requires you to have some background in scientific writing and a knowledge of scientific papers, though the earlier classes in the sequence help with this.",
                "Yes, very good evolution and ecology course.",
                "Possibly. It was pretty interesting, but there's also a lot of prerequisites (BIOL 101-103), so you can't just take only BIOL 104 on its own (I think).",
                "Yes, I think this class was helpful and well organized.",

                "Yes!",
                "Only for the requirement, though it is the most interesting and accessible BIOL unit.",
                "Yes. I enjoyed this course and I found the workload to be very manageable.",
                "Absolutely, it was the strongest module of the intro biology sequence and gave me a passion for evolutionary biology. The assignments were fair and interesting, and the lectures were extremely well done and presented.",
                "Yes, first as a necessary prereq, but also as a excellent opportunity to learn about biological science as a whole",
                "I would definitely recommend it. It gives you a comprehensive understanding of evolution and how life is interconnected.",
                "I would if they wanted to further their studies in biology",
                "Yes, Professor Prum is amazing and so is Professor Hartman",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student! I found it the most enjoyable course of the introductory biology sequence.",
                "I would recommend this student to another student interested in obtaining a brief, cursory survey of the field of evolutionary biology. I would also recommend this course to another student interested in phylogenetics and population genetics/ecology.",
                "For all of the premeds who have to take this course, I of course would recommend this course. For all of the science majors that have to take this course, I would recommend it. In general,  I think that I would recommend this class because the ability for people to engage with the different biology based majors at Yale is very important especially to first years who are taking the course. It was also great to see many more aspects of biology that I did not know before.",
                "Yes if they want to learn about evolution.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students, as the material was interesting, and made me consider life from a wider, evolutionary perspective. Overall, this course was quite enjoyable, especially compared to the previous three modules.",
                "Yes! Hopefully Prof Hartman is also co-teaching the course",
                "Yes, if you need to take it or are interested in EEB!",
                "Yes, but only as a requirement.",
                "I would only recommend this course to people who are genuinely interested in biology and ecology. The content in this course is not necessarily applicable to everyone.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this to a biology student even if they're not specifically interested in EEB. It was an interesting introduction to some broad areas of EEB (don't expect too much detail) and I think I learned a decent amount without much stress or a high workload.",
                "Yes, I thought it was very interesting.",
                "I would probably recommend it",
                "If it is possible to place out of the course, I would. It does not feel totally relevant to a biology major if you are more interested in molecular biology. It does go over anatomy, photosynthesis, and cellular respiration but it is skimmed at best and must be studied in your own time anyway. The course does include interesting material but since it is the last module in the biology sequence, it would only be necessary to take it if you needed to complete the requirement. Otherwise, it is not worth it to seek out the course.",
                "BIOL 104 has interesting content and lots of support from professors. The information is broader than in previous parts of the BIOL sequence and makes interesting connections to other courses, and tests reward you for studying the content learned rather than applying this content in hard-to-follow ways. It is still a good bit of work, particularly studying for tests, but each assignment feels less high-stakes and more intuitive than BIOL 103. Section isn't always very engaging but does bring in interesting research.",
                "Yes absolutely! For the higher level courses I wanted to take, I only needed BIOL 101-103 but I figured I'd take 104 too since I was able to and heard good things. It's a really fun course I'm definitely glad I took it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I believe it was very engaging and the material was taught very well.",
                "I would recommend this course. It was the best of the four half course biol courses. I am not inclined to the ecological side of biology before or after this course, but learning in the meantime was enjoyable.",
                "BIOL 104 is a great cap to the bio sequence. Lots of interesting philosophy (kinda surprised me) and meaningful meditations on the nature of life and its history.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the Biology sequence to another student. It is a great class for students who need to fulfill academic requirements."
