                "We read and discussed many types of articles and books relating to order and disorder from different points of view. It was great to think so wide across different disciplines in relation to a single topic.",
                "I learnt A LOT. The discussions led by Prof. Mordechai are very interesting and cover a wide range of topics on history, political theory, information theory, philosophy of math and more. I think it was cool that not everybody walked away with the same interpretation, which meant people had hot takes, personal anecdotes - students from different majors had unique contributions. We learnt about important historical figures, time periods, events - I didn't have a strong foundation in US history or political theory, so this class covered a lot of ground and taught me a lot.",
                "I learned how to defend my thoughts and explain properly what I wanted to say",
                "I learned to embrace contradiction. In all seriousness, it taught me that narratives about order and disorder in political theory are often highly dubious and empirically false. This ought to be of interest to anyone thinking about the idea of political order (which should be everyone in PLSC).",
                "This course taught me how to critically evaluate the way I think about all systems of organization from math to government. I was really able to think about how humans structure themselves, find structure in other things, and impose structure on the rest of the world.",

                "Critical thinking. Ability to decipher key messages from long texts.",
                "It was a bit disorganized, but I think that was the idea. Fun discussion around high-level questions relating generally to the question of how we think humans should organize thrmselves as a society.",
                "I learned to read and speak more clearly. Surprisingly, I believe I can now talk about the concepts of \"order and disorder,\" especially as they relate to government, in a somewhat educated way.",
                "This course explores the many ways in which we come to think about order and ultimatelydisorder. This class will expand your view of what you think is right or wrong in important and sometimes revelatory ways. This was a highly stimulating course that I will continue to draw upon and think through for some time. And in many ways that was the point. Mordechai is not the traditional educator but his goals are clearhe wants to get his students to think and question their preconceptions of the ordered systems around us. In this way he was highly successful.",
                "Sessions were structured to teach students on a series of niche topics that would informed on the overall theme of order and disorder. So I learned about a lot of specific elements in society but also how they connect to order. The course really did teach me how to think about a bunch of different things and their societal implications."

                "I liked the discussion format. I also loved that we had class outside when it was warmer.",
                "I think a strength of the course was how it focused on doing reading to prepare for discussion in class. I think that's a really cool structure for maximizing actual learning, rather than overloading the student with assignments that add unnecessary pressure. And I say this as someone who did not participate much - but that was probably the best way to make the most of the class. While this class had way less assignments than any of my other classes, I honestly feel like I retained the most and gained the most from this one. I really enjoyed the readings (highlights for me include Democratic Vistas and How to Change your Mind) and learnt a lot from what peers said.",
                "Strength: Class discussions are lively and interesting \r\nWeakness: Sometimes it is difficult to relate readings to class theme",
                "Professor Levy-Eichel fostered a welcoming environment where all views were welcome. He encouraged healthy arguments and cold-called to ensure that everyone's perspectives were heard. I came away from the course transformed, which is the most you can hope for in a humanities seminar. The one weakness of the course is that there was no online syllabus or repository of readings, so if you lost the physical syllabus, you were out of luck, and sometimes readings would get lost because Yale's email servers would block Mordechai's chain-emails.",
                "This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. The readings were always interesting and engaging and the narrative of the course was very easy to follow.",
                "Strengths: Consistency, Relevant Readings,  Interesting Discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Vagueness in class instruction.",
                "Prof. Levy-Eichel is fantastic. I think it may be fun to incorporate written debates and discussions in addition to the spoken ones we have in class. I have a vague intuition that this class achieved its goals, although I would not be able to say what those goals are.",
                "The organization of the course at times was hard to follow and the syllabus changed. It was not a problem for myself but if you are a student who requires order. This is probably not the class for you. However, it might be, because you probably need to see things differently. The course materials are very well designed to stimulate thought and discussion and Professor is a greater lecturer.",
                "The topics all connected to order and disorder but it might have been useful to have one last class on what it all means. There was only one assignment which for many students could be stressful."

The course wasn't the most clearly structured (by design), but I appreciated the ways that not having a very ordered course made me think about the ideas of order and disorder. The workload was definitely manageable, and the readings/seminars felt like a valuable use of my time. I would definitely recommend.",

                "Absolutely",
                "I would!",
                "Absolutely. It will change your life and make you see the world in a new way. It's also a good opportunity to have a structured space to argue with fellow students, which I think is fun.",
                "Absolutely, I learned a lot from this course that I won't forget after finishing the final paper. Beyond learning the material of the course, I learned new ways of how to think in general.",
                "If a student is interested in Political Philosophy, then I would definitely recommend this class! Key and fundamental concepts are introduced & discussed in this class, as are key readings. This is a great class to develop your philosophical curiosities in a small group.",
                "Yes! Professor Levy-Eichel truly challenges you in the best way possible. If you put in the work, this will be a rewarding course.",
                "Yes. Unlike in nearly all classes I've taken here, bullshit gets called out in this class. You have to speak and think clearly, but you will discover that doing so is always rewarding and frequently quite fun, too.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student without a doubt. This is the type of class that should be mandatory at Yale it forces you to engage with both familiar and unfamiliar materials in new and engaging ways. This is a course that is designed to get you to think and leave class each day with more questions than answers. Take this course if you want to expand your view of yourself and the systems you engage with on a daily basis.",
                "Yes! It was a great experience and the Professor is super well read and really tries to challenge students. That being said there is a lot of cold calling (all in good nature and done kindly) and only one final assignment which can be stressful."
