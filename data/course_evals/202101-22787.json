                "My writing improved greatly throughout the course, largely because the essay prompts all highlighted very different parts of the analytical process. This was incredibly helpful, as it forced me to explore different types of analysis and engage with texts on the micro and macro level. I gained a survey knowledge of American Literature (if that is even possible) and feel well established with my knowledge of the tradition. Reading all of the texts in conjunction with one another in a single umbrella course allowed me to place works in conversation that I would never have thought to otherwise. This highlighted salient themes across genres and caused me to question the creation of a canon.",

                "I think this course is well structured in terms of assignments (in both spacing and range of subject). The texts themselves provided a wide range of content and were generally engaging. That being said, I think that, due to the necessarily fast paced nature of such a course, we did not always get as in depth in analysis/conversation in a given text as we could have. This makes sense when laying groundwork and trying to make sure that everyone understands the material, but sometimes it felt slightly rushed.",

If my friend was generally interested in literature but did not have a concrete direction/area of interest I would recommend this as a way of sampling different genres and aspects of literature.",
