                "Strengths: very interesting and inspiring guest speakers, cool projects (you get to make your own Bluetooth speaker), you can possibly work on your invention\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its kind of hard to say what I've learned in this class. I really did enjoy it and I understand the design process more but like I cant really explain what genuine skills I've learned in class. Also the speaker project takes forever to make when it can realistically be done in 3 weeks. You only have 1 month for your final project which is soooo short. If we had more time the project would be so much more refined and more relaxing. Just felt it was rushed.",
                "Strengths: A VERY dedicated teaching team, and it always felt like they wanted us to succeed. The subject is interesting, and it was taught very well.\r\nWeaknesses: The guest speakers could be a hit and miss sometimes, and a quarter of the semester involved guest speakers, the class suffered.",
                "The student projects are entirely student driven and organized. You have a lot of help available if you need it, but you are calling all the shots when it comes to organizing your project. It is a really empowering process.\r\n\r\nThe course could have used less speakers and more working sessions so students can be in the CEID during the hours in which design aides are paid to be there.",
                "Prof Zinter and the teaching staff are the greatest strength. They spent so many hours outside of class with us helping on team projects!",
                "I enjoyed working on the final project for the class. Starting earlier for More time to work on the final project would be helpful.",
                "Strength: hands on nature of the course\r\nCons: the first part of the semester is rather slow paced",
                "I think weaknesses are the reliance on teaching staff for support during the final project. Plus some of the speakers seemed kind of irrelevant to my interests personally, so I wish those events happened outside of class time/were offered to the broader Yale community. Strengths were getting to learn a ton of hands-on skills that are useful for building/making.",
                "The course is very cool in that you are given the space to work in groups to create a real product. You also get to hear from cool speakers. I found some issues with the lack of substance that we actually learned. We spent the first half of the course working on the speaker. While I definitely thought it was cool, I do not think it was a good use of time. All the speakers came out looking identical as they were cookie-cutter speakers, so I do not think we learned very much from this process. I think the speaker project should be more open-ended or way more condensed (1 to 2 weeks). If the speaker is shortened we can spend more time on our projects, which I think would have been a better use of time. I think given it is a product design class, there should be more projects throughout the course where you can refine your product design skills. These do not need to be huge, but when you take out all creative freedom in the speaker, students do not actually learn anything. If you gave us the speaker and told us to build the casing for it, I think we would have gotten a lot more out of it as we would have to design and build it, causing students to think deeply about design.",
                "Overall great course. Really engaging and you get to work on really fun projects.",
                "Strengths: size, diversity of skill sets in the class, final projects, teaching staff. Weaknesses: scheduling, we spent a long time on the speaker project and I gained a lot more from the final project and wished we had more time on that, I wish we had gotten feedback more frequently, we didn't get anything back until after right at the end."

There is no question that you have fun in this class, enjoy cool guest speakers. Joe is also a cool lecturer.",

It's cool to work on your own project and decide what you want it to be and how you want it to take shape. While the first part of the semester is really relaxed, it definitely picks up in the final weeks. Prepare to spend a high proportion of your hours at the end of the semester working on this.",
