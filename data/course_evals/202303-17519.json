                "I learned the beginnings of Greek.",
                "I learned the basic vocabulary and a little bit of history in Greek.",

                "I learned a very solid foundation of elementary modern Greek",
                "By taking this course, I learned so much vocabulary and so many different grammar rules, such as verb conjugation, subject-verb agreement, and article-noun agreement. I also gained insight into the structure of languages and orthography."

                "This course is strong all around. I think that Maria's style of teaching this semester was sort of brilliant. Rather than assign longer homework assignments every night, Maria assigned short assignments and built-in time to study for biweekly assessments. This made it easier for me to focus on studying the parts of the parts of the language I was having the most trouble with, without having to spend as much time on the parts that came easier to me.",
                "Prof. Kaliambou is a fantastic professor! The course is very well structured and she makes it easy to get acquainted reading and writing the new alphabet with no background. The classes are very enjoyable and engaging. No weaknesses.",
                "Have more explanation behind the meta language used.",
                "Sometimes it felt like we moved on to a new topic before I had fully learned the previous one, and I think more assessments to help actually learn the language more thoroughly could be helpful.",
                "No weaknesses and I loved learning in the class.",
                "Overall I think the course was a great introduction to the Greek language does a good job teaching grammatical concepts and vocabulary. I would appreciate more practice speaking and having conversation in Greek. I think it would be nice to require students to attend Greek table at least once per semester to get more practice speaking. I never attended Greek table but I think making it a requirement would be good motivation.",
                "One strength of this course is that we learn so much material in a short amount of time. We learn so much vocabulary, which quickly allows us to form sentences in writing and speaking exercises. One weakness of the course is that we don't get to spend a lot of time speaking. I wish we had more activities centered around conversations."

                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in learning a new language quickly. I feel like I have already learned enough vocabulary and grammar to write and talk about myself, my family, my classes, and my everyday lifestyle."
