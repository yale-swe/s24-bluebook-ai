I also gained insight in viewing different theories not as separate entities, but as separate layers, each built upon the previous, in the grand scheme of criminology. While different theories may be contradicting others, all are necessary to building a solid foundation."

This is not really a criminology class in the way that people unfamiliar with sociology would think. You dont really learn about killers from a psychological standpoint. I realized this during add drop but decided to keep the course because it showed that I had alot to learn about sociology, and I am glad that I did!! I think this is the perfect intro course if you are deciding you want to be a SOCY major, or if ur interested in criminology.",
                "strength - material and flow of the course was pretty straight forward and interesting, with a fairly manageable workload and organized classes\r\n\r\nweakness - was already a fairly small seminar, and felt that the additional discussion section was not the most necessary",
                "strengths- professor is really helpful and understanding",
                "A big strength of the course was how the midterm and final papers were structured. Rather than regurgitating definitions of theories, we were asked to apply real-life criminal cases to the theories we learned. For the final paper, we applied the theories to an article about the prison system. These assessments solidified my understanding of the concepts and I finished both papers feeling more knowledgable of the material."
