                "I learned about how the humanities intersected with medicine. Very interesting!",
                "Learned a lot about medicine and the uncertainties that doctors face -- what it really means to pursue the medical profession, and a lot of introspection on if I really want to pursue this vocation for the rest of my life.",
                "This class taught me so much. I learned so much about medicine, and about science in general. The memoirs we read were phenomenal; the doctors provided such amazing insight into the world of medicine, its challenges and triumphs, and what it's really like to be a doctor. We learned about the relationship between science and the humanities, and how important it is for both to coexist, especially in medicine. The readings were engaging, and Dr. Morrison is just an amazing human being.",
                "There are a few classes that I count as causing major shifts in the way I view the world and my place in it. This course was unequivocally one of them. On a weekly basis, I found myself questioning my passions, ambitions, priorities, and even my faith. I never expected to be doing so much questioning in this class, but I know that I am better for it. I'm not sure if I feel more certain about my future, but I certainly feel more comfortable living in the uncertainty. This idea is the main thing I will take away from the class: how to contend with the inevitable uncertainties of life and make headway in spite of them.",
                "How doctors should interact with patients, cognitive biases, medicine through a humanistic lens, philosophy of science",
                "This class introduced me to the human side of practicing medicine, especially our fallibility. We extensively discussed philosophy in application to medicine, but also touched on other fields such as art, history, and botany.",
                "This was the best course I have ever taken. This class touched upon everything from medical ethics, Russian literature to philosophy. Dr Morrison is a brilliant professor who is so well versed in his material. I loved the way the main themes of the course, the tension between rationalism and empiricism, informed discussion and the readings. Despite touching on a variety of materials from Dostoyevsky to contemporary medical memoirs, there was a real sense of cohesion ideas. Dr Morrisons love for science and literature brought this beautiful course to life and made it a pleasure to be in his classroom.",
                "This class provided a wonderful integration of humanities ideas intertwined in the everyday life of healthcare and medicine. I felt as though I gained a great ability to read dense literature both closely and carefully. In addition, I feel as though I learned how to sort through these ideas and make strong arguments based off of the provided readings."

                "N\/A",
                "Strengths: Prof Morrison is incredible! So kind, caring, compassionate, and extremely dedicated to teaching. I almost didn't take this course but am SO glad that I did -- most of the readings were engaging and the guest speakers\/field trips were a highlight. Morrison's lectures were also incredibly interesting and I learned so much from this class. Weaknesses: some of the readings went a little over my head",
                "The readings were engaging and interesting, the field trips were frequent, fun, and relevant, and the conversations were fruitful. The relationship I built with Dr. Morrison is one that I really cherish.\r\nAt times, Dr. Morrison would spend almost entire classes lecturing about authors of some of the pieces we read. It was really interesting to hear a lot about these authors, but I wish we had more time to discuss some of the readings.",
                "This course has no shortage of strengths. The content is rich and engaging, and Dr. Morrison always brings it back to medicine in creative ways. I think the best parts of the class were our trips to various places on campus, such as the Cushing Library, YUAG, YCBA, botanical garden, and nursing school. I look back so fondly on those trips, not just because they enhanced my learning but because they were so much fun and allowed me to get to know my class even better. The only thing I wish is that we had more time to discuss the readings as a class, but I so appreciated Dr. Morrison's lecturesthey really clarified the material and added a personal, human touch to a lot of our readings.",
                "Strengths: I really liked a lot of the texts we read, and the guest speakers and field trips were always really interesting and fun. There wasn't too much of a workload, and Dr. Morrison is always really insightful and understanding towards students. The class makes you really question your motivations for being a doctor and what type of doctor you want to be. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think sometimes Dr. Morrison's lectures ran a bit too long and detracted from time that we could have spent having discussions about the texts we had read for HW. Sometimes we didn't even have enough time to discuss the texts at all.",
                "Dr. Morrison is one of the most supportive professors. He was able to share many insights from his own emergency medicine practice, and he always make really detailed and organized slides to help introduce us to the authors we are reading and other concepts. He provided much feedback on all our assignments, encouraging us on our work and retaining his humor. Other than Dr. Morrison's expertise and personality, a big plus of this class is all the guest lecturers and field trips. Really fun! A weakness could be that some of the philosophy readings can be really dense, but we were assumed to know the very basics already. Not a big problem, however, and definitely didn't take away from the overall experience.",
                "Possible less reading",
                "One of the main strengths of this course was that the classes were held in such a wide variety of locations: the botanical gardens, Beinecke and the Yale Centre for British Art to name a few. This was such a beautiful way to engage with the material directly and take advantage of all of the resources available to us at Yale. The readings for this class were excellent - they came from a wide range of fields but were exquisitely selected and well linked.",
                "I think this course does an excellent job of integrating humanities education with science education. Professor Morrison did a wonderful job of exposing the class to a breadth of writers and literary forms. I felt as though the material we studied during this course was all extremely relevant and helpful in building a perspective of medicine from the lens of the humanities. My one criticism of this course is that I wish there was a larger opportunity to discuss the assigned readings in a larger capacity. While Professor Morrison's lectures were incredibly informative and appreciated, they generally constituted the majority of class time. For all the time we spent doing the readings, I think there could have been valuable insight gained if excess discussion time was alotted."

I almost didn't take it, but it is a significantly lower workload and provided a lot of intellectual stimulation and actually gave me insight into what I want to do with my life. Our classroom community was wonderful and this is by far my favorite class I've ever taken at Yale.",

The class is so fun and I can really say I learned a lot and assured myself that becoming a doctor is really what I want to do when I grow up. Any pre-med should absolutely take it as it gives a different perspective on medicine and Dr. Morrison is amazing!",

                "Yes. Almost everyone in our class was made to question whether they really did want to become a doctor and gained insight into how they want to be as a doctor. Dr. Morrison clearly loves teaching the class, which makes it really engaging.",
                "Yes. Great teacher, interesting readings, and cool activities.",
