I thought this class was the best virtual class I had and, although it is not ideal to learn a language online, my professor maximized the resources available to her and made the class the best that it could be.",
                "The class was incredibly well structured. I felt like every class was well planned out and I would always learn something new each class. I loved the games we played in the breakout rooms and the many different media we engaged with during class time.",
                "Strengths: You learn a lot of Spanish in very little time. The curriculum teaches the right vocabulary to be conversational. Profesora Pilar Asensio really cares about the improvement of her students, and she's encouraging and always available for feedback\/help.\r\nWeakness: I didn't mind how much work we had on Supersite, but because it's being graded by a system, the short answer questions could be very strict on how you phrased your answer. But also, with the amount of Supersite work being given, those few points are meaningless in the end."
