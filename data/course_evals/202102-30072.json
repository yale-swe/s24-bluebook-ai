                "Postcolonial lit and how to properly right an English essay without judgement from the Prof. Loved this class so much.",
                "I was exposed to more diverse literature than in comparison to many classes that teach western literature. I also valued the way we received a side of history that was not told by the conquerors.",
                "I've certainly become a much better close-reader, thinker, and analytical writer. This was my first exposure to Comparative Literature and I definitely think it's an area of study I'd like to pursue in college. Being a senior in high school taking this course, it was very motivating and encouraging to see undergraduate students from a variety of backgrounds, ages, etc. (all of whom were incredibly brilliant). I felt that being able to see my peers' discussion posts/writing and listening to their insightful comments during each Zoom session allowed me to better my own analytical skills and engage with each of the books we read in a more critical, penetrating manner.",
                "close reading skills and literature specifically focusing on the African diaspora",
                "This was a wonderful and enriching course. It had so much to provide for people of all backgrounds and was a strongalbeit brieftour of the world literature and literary analysis. Most skills in this class were new to me and I appreciated the ability to navigate them in an open and encouraging environment.",
                "Using various close reading strategies, I learned how to focus my analysis of a text. I also learned how to effectively structure my arguments and original research.",
                "I was able to consolidate my knowledge of various concepts relating to African and South Asian literatures. For instance, I saw the unique ways in which writers from different parts of the world broached notions of othering, dissolution, agency, interiority, etc., that are intensified by colonialism and imperialist systems. \r\n\r\nThe week in which we studied the Uneven U concept was extremely helpful in developing my essay-writing skills. I found that learning about this certainly benefited my ability to structure the information that I gathered in my final research paper and made way for my analysis.",
                "Prof Iheka and Dr Julia Chan offered students a profoundly rewarding experience in reading critically, thinking generously, and writing insightfully.\r\n\r\nThis was a supremely challenging course that respected the largesse of the readings--I had to read sensitively and with attention. The course readings (novels, poetry, historical documents, more) reflected a diversity of chronology, voice, identity, prosody, and more--very rigorous.  Prof Iheka and Dr Julia Chan were exquisitely attuned to the subject and directed the course with assiduous grace. The feedback on my writing was thorough. The feedback on my class comments was reassuring and respectful.\r\n\r\nWould definitely recommend to students who wish to engage excellent English-language readings from non-American writers--and who are prepared to enjoy the challenge of lots of writing. I loved the class in every way.  Was sorry it had to end!",
                "I learned about the concept of \"world literature\" and how it differs from other Anglophone literature not only in setting but also in focus. I also refined my vocabulary to discuss texts and practiced writing analytically rather than through summary.",
                "How to analyze a book closely and write close readings.",
                "A comprehensive overview of literary criticism in the postcolonial tradition.",
                "I learned how to better interpret literature in general and world literature especially.",
                "I developed the skill of analyzing literature in more in-depth way.",
                "I felt that my writing actually improved during this corse, particularly the way I approached longer pieces of writing. The class having a focus on World English Literatures made it very enjoyable as even though we still reading English texts, we were not reading texts that focused on the Western perspective.",
                "I developed my close reading analysis abilities a lot, and learned to pry out deep meaning even from the smallest of visual/textual details. I also improved my writing speed, efficiency, and clarity even further.",
                "Guidance on close reading analysis and thesis/essay structure was very helpful. Discussion of global literary market was useful and unique to this course compared to other English department offerings",
                "The skills I learned from this class include a series of analytical skills. I truly learned how to comprehend a reading and dive deep into it by asking questions and answering them with facts. I felt this class provided me with a deep understanding to read and analyze texts.",
                "I learned about the Anglophone literary canon outside of America and the UK, mainly focusing on the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia."

                "Strengths: TFs were awesome, relatively low workload. Engaging books. Weaknesses: putting more breaks earlier on to split up the 3 hour blocks of class time would be nice.",
                "I found that the class was quite large and sometimes hard to offer input.",
                "I think one major strength of this course is that students are able to interact directly with the professor during Zoom lectures (as opposed to them being recorded). I also find the discussion/TF sessions particularly useful for diving into close-readings and deeper analyses of the texts.",
                "i loved professor iheka and thought he does a wonderful job teaching us about the author/historical context of the text and how to closely read it. he was so kind and thoughtful and willing to work with us individually. texts are definitely accessible to all comfort levels of reader",
                "The texts are interesting and very well chosen, and the discussion sections really enriched my understanding, but the longer classes could be difficult at times without a more substantial break between lecture and section.",
                "The course was very good over all. Most things that could have been improved were entirely related to the online learning environment. The only thing that comes to mind would be around navigating, or overcoming, lulls in lecture. I can only speak for myself, but I often felt that discussion was the designated space for participation and lecture was more an opportunity to absorb information. Though, admittedly, there were moments of rich conversation in lecture, and I greatly appreciated Professor Iheka's efforts to engage directly with students.",
                "The greatest strength of the course, in my opinion, is that it introduces students to influential novels and texts with which they may not be familiar. I personally had never heard of any of the books we read, but I thoroughly enjoyed learning about their impact on the world and discussing their ideas. There were some concepts of philosophy and literary criticism that were entirely new to me in our discussion of world literature, and I feel we could have spent a little more time learning about them. However, I believe this issue was simply the result of my lack of experience with the subject matter, and I of course understand that the class was compressed for the summer term. Regardless, I'm so happy to have had the opportunity to take the course. I was always interested in the topics, and I was able to develop valuable skills that I believe will be incredibly helpful in the future.",
                "The texts were engaging and they enabled us to look at various different parts of the world (which is to say that they gave us a glimpse of how different areas have been effected by colonialism), although maybe only having one South Asian text makes the reading list feel a little unbalanced. \r\n\r\nJessie's advice regarding possible readings/sources for the research paper was on point.\r\n\r\nHaving a second lecture on a Wednesday is helpful if parts of the reading for that week weren't covered in the Monday lecture. However, there was one lecture that felt quite repetitive as we had already covered that which was being discussed in a prior session (by this I mean it went beyond a simple summary of a previous session).\r\n\r\nIt might have been good to set some secondary reading prior to the class to encourage conversation more, although the TA sent over some helpful resources after the seminar sessions, anyway, so that's a positive.",
                "Excellent class. See above.",
                "The seminars were engaging and improved my understanding of the texts. The lectures were sometimes interesting but weren't as exciting and sometimes seemed a bit scattered in terms of content and focus.",
                "This course had really great readingsProfessor Iheka chose books that non-English majors could easily understand and had incredible depth for humanities students. No matter how familiar you are with reading and writing, this course can be valuable. A major weakness is that the course expects a lot from the student. You really only met with your TA or Professor once before each paper (this might be a summer thing) and then you were expected to write a detailed and nuanced analysis of a complicated text. If you are unfamiliar with these kinds of papers, you might struggle to understand what the course expects of you.",
                "I think the reading list was great and that the essays were well-explained but I wish we got feedback on our weekly posts because we only got feedback once.",
                "The manageable workload despite the accelerated summer class is a strength of the course.",
                "This is an excellent class. The lectures were interesting, the discussion sections were engaging, and the assignments were straightforward. The assignments were all open-ended questions that allowed us to explore our own ideas more thoroughly. We got to discuss our ideas in class and develop them even further.\r\n\r\nOne weakness (due to the online format) was that the work was very intense on a couple of days and it sometimes was hard to stay energized. This of course cannot easily be mitigated since the class was online.\r\n\r\nOne minor thing is that all the books we read, although very interesting and beautifully written, were very sad. I would recommend having one happier book if possible to lighten the mood, especially since the analysis adds another layer of intensity.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, well organized section, writing skill building. Biweekly section was great, should keep that structure for future classes",
                "I feel that this course had very little weaknesses in the aspect of learning how to analyze texts. However I feel that the texts could be more diverse meaning instead of a single topic of choice.",
                "I enjoyed the wide variety of readings and the approaches to analyzing the texts. My main point for improvement would be to cut down on the simultaneous component of the class time (3 hours twice a week is a long time to be sitting in one place). I think it may be worth trying out what some of my other summer courses did and have part of that time be pre-recorded lecture to watch at our own pace, so we could then come to class and have a more efficient discussion."

                "yes but with a note-although this class is described as world literature 4/5 of the books we read took place in Africa. They were great books and I am really glad I read them but this class seemed more focused on African diaspora and impacts of colonization then truly comparing books from around the world.",
                "Yes, the readings are excellent!",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I found the readings and the assignments both quite demanding, but it was certainly worth the work. Our class discussions were consistently energetic and engaging, and I know I was able to truly develop my skills of writing and analysis.",
                "Yes, for the reasons outlined above. It's a great course to boost one's knowledge on texts that aren't covered on a lot of syllabuses and allows the development of writing skills.",
                "Yes--see above.",

                "I'd recommend this course to someone who is interested in being an English major.",
                "Yes. This is quite possibly the most interesting writing credit out there, but it will force you to reevaluate how you read and write everything. Do not take this if you want an easy WR credit. However, if you really like literature or want to improve your academic writing, take this course and profit.",

                "Yes, I would recommend the course to a student interested in world literature.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who struggle to find writing classes that interest them or struggle with the process of writing a good paper. As someone who is primarily interested in STEM, a writing credit has been something that I was apprehensive about getting. But there was no reason to worry! Even though this class is mandatory to English materials, the professor and TAs made the material very accessible.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. One often thinks of \"English literature\" as literature from England or the United States. This class breaks down this vision by revealing that English literature can come from anywhere in the world. We read texts from India, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and the Caribbean, which all contribute to global English literature by infusing it with their own regional flavors. This makes us question what \"English\" literature really is.\r\n\r\nI personally had a lot of fun in this class, since I got to read books and then go to class where we talked about them. :)",
                "Strongly recommend. Improved my writing and my understanding of colonial/postcolonial English literature",
                "Yes I would because I think the value of this course allows students to not only apply it to other aspects of classes but to apply it areas of life by looking at the single detail and building upon to see the bigger picture."
