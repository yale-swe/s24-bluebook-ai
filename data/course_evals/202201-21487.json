                "This was one of my first English classes in some time (I have only taken three English courses total at Yale, including this one), and I greatly appreciated building my skill set in critical analysis of texts and paper-writing. The types of papers that I wrote in this course felt very different, and more focused on writing quality and the progression of ideas, than those in my other classes (which are much more research-based). I strongly believe that this class has helped me become a better writer in ALL subjects.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of literature, and also I was introduced to many interesting books that I had never heard of. I also learned a lot about contributing to seminar discussions.",
                "This course does an amazing job of combining teaching the core tenants of each text we read with interesting feminist and queer theory. Even more, the essay comments were incredibly thorough and helpful and I feel that I learned how to connect texts in a fluid and easy to read way."

                "The syllabus of this course is excellent. It is incredibly diverse, and as a WGSS major I can confidently say that it did a great job in fostering intersectional analyses and awareness.",
                "I really loved the book selection in this course. I also think the paper topics were solid and flexible enough to write something fun and engaging.",
                "Sometimes the discussions fell into patterns of people who talked and people who didn't, more than I've seen in other seminars, but things improved toward the end of the semester when Professor Homans began building some structures into the class discussion that opened up discussions a lot more. But it was always wonderful to listen to the Professor Homans' framing of discussions at the start of class she cares about and thinks about the material deeply, and that makes the students care, too. Professor Homans is so genuine and reasonable, it feels like everything in the class has a purpose that's not overstated.",
                "Strengths: Professor Homans is AMAZING! She is kind, incredibly informed, and so passionate about what she teaches (which makes all the difference). Even more, this class has one of the most interesting and engaging syllabi of any class I have taken at Yale. The books we read, especially toward the end of the semester, are such classics and fly by. \r\nWeaknesses: We read a lot very quickly. Makes the workload heavy but not unmanageable. Also, it makes it so that we have to skip over a lot of what happens in each text.",
                "Strengths: an amazing syllabus that makes you look forward to discussion; supportive professor who genuinely cares about students; 3 different types of papers let you gain different writing skills"

                "Yes! I loved this class. There is a lot of reading, but it genuinely did not feel like a burden because Professor Homans picks great literature. If to you, there reading is not feasible she does not hold it against you, as she doesn't expect you to do it all, all of the time. Professor Homans is so understanding and such a great professor. I would take this class every semester if I could.",
                "yes",
                "I would, but I would caution students from other majors that this is an *English* course in every sense of the word. It is reading-heavy (but the readings are incredible and very engaging), and writing-heavy. For non-English majors, the course may be surprisingly difficult, as it was for me, but very worthwhile. However, I'd overall recommend taking this course for the intellectual challenge and for the skills you'll build (especially in writing) rather than for the content itself, especially if you are a humanities or social sciences major. I felt that I didn't necessarily learn any \"new\" content from this class, but I did learn a lot about how to write concisely and effectively.",
                "Yes I would. I had a lot of fun, and I feel like I gained a lot of knowledge about reading and analyzing, along with the knowledge about the topics covered in the books.",
                "YES! You read great books, learn the way they are connected, and do so in a low stress but engaging class environment.",
                "Absolutely; Im not an English major but it was definitely my favorite class of the semester! The syllabus is wonderfully designed and while it is a lot of reading, the class itself never felt too overwhelming. I would probably reccomend any class taught by prof Homans."
