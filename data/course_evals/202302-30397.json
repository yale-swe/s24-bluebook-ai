This includes accounting of GDP, mechanism of banking system, Solow Model, inflation, AD/AS model, etc. Furthermore, the course enhanced my understanding of the nature of economics as an academic discipline(particularly macroeconomics, but economics or even social sciences in general). The course is an introductory course but it goes way beyond high-school-level economics and is a very fruitful course that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in economics, regardless of whether they've taken economics at high school or not.",

                "Strengths: The material is covered in sufficient depth and the professor engages the class extremely well. The psets being marked on check is especially useful in facilitating learning as the solutions provided afterwards help you grasp everything clearly without stressing you out about being correct. Weaknesses: There is too much pre-reading for each class that is problematic because the class is taught in a very active fashion, relying heavily on question and answers. If this load can be reduced, its easier to prepare for class rather than being too overwhelmed and lost.",
                "Potentially holding classes three times per week to spread content out more evenly.",
                "I think the weakness was that I had to get up at 7:00am because of the time difference so it was difficult to focus sometimes because of how early my class was. I think making the class start at 8:00am or maybe at 9:00 pst because that gives people on the west coast a little more time to sleep. Strengths were that he was very clear at explaining the topics and based on the review sessions, even from just regular class you had a sense of what you were going to be tested on in the exam. I recommend this class."

First of all, this course teaches a variety of basic (but useful) economic models and covers a range of relevant topics, so you will really learn some economic knowledge. Secondly, (perhaps more importantly), I think this course demonstrates the charm of economics in general. For every model we saw in class, there was a solid deduction process that shows how these models are constructed and how are they supported by real-life data. Going through such process almost feels like being an economist and I personally enjoyed it.",
                "Yes, I would. This class is well organized and there are many resources that can help supplement your learning. I did not feel overwhelmed at any point and the material is presented in an engaging way. I thought that the professor explained the concepts we needed to know very clearly in discussion sections and I didn't ever feel lost during the course.",
