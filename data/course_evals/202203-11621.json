            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is that Professor Chalioti is probably one of the best professors at Yale. She is funny and genuinely wants students to do well on the exams.",
                "The class is very cohesively structured. Material is taught in a straightforward fashion, and the students know what to expect from the instructors. Because the material is accessible, it is also interesting, making hard to fall behind in the class if you apply yourself.",
                "The problem sets were too easy compared to the exams, which I felt were more difficult to an extent that caught me off guard. I personally prefer when problem sets are harder than the exams. I would support longer and harder problem sets every week.",
                "Strengths: psets align perfectly with lecture, and there's a plethora of TA office hours\/extra help.  Chalioti is a good lecturer, sprinkling in humor and outside topics sparingly but appropriately in a class that's otherwise 75 minutes of algebraic manipulation.  Section is actually pretty useful.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: So much hinges on the midterm and final (psets are essentially completion grades), and the class can get boring and headache-inducing with the sheer volume of variables.  Half A range half B range, but most of the As are A-s and most of the Bs are flat Bs.  I also think this class could benefit from having two midterms, or just something at all to make it more interactive.  You don't get feedback on psets (because they're rarely not a 10\/10).\r\n\r\nMixed bag: She doesn't post lecture recordings, in order to encourage kids to show up to class.  This is a plus and minus -- Davies is a lot more full in that class than in my other lecture classes, but sometimes we have a valid reason not to make lecture, and needing your dean's approval to get access to the lecture recording is... a hassle.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-Lecture style is very engaging\r\n-Discussion sections were super valuable\r\n-Problem sets were super reasonable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n-I didn't like that psets were completion. It puts more pressure on the exams to spread out the curve, so exams are functionally 100% of your grade in the class since nearly everyone has 100% in the homework category.\r\n-Similarly, exams are too heavily weighted.",
                "Strengths: interesting\/ practical material\r\nWeaknesses: tests are worth almost all of your grade",
                "Strengths: Taught very well\r\nWeaknesses: Only 1 midterm, so everything is weighted very high, taught very fast.",
                "The material was covered well, but at times it felt like we spent a lot of time just solving equations in class.",
                "The course seems to just be too theoretical and not practical enough. I'm getting sick of these intro\/intermediate economics lectures. They're very repetitive, and they all feel the same. It starts to distract me from the actual material.",
                "Strengths: Class has so many resources in order for you to succeed",
                "This is a very large lecture course. Professor Chalioti was a great, clear, concise lecturer. While there were many office hours opportunities, maybe some more structured review sessions right before the midterm and\/or final would help consolidate some concepts.",
                "Strenghts: interesting topics which were really well taught. Weaknesses: the semester started aggressively with jumping right in to Lagrange which was hard to understand and learn. So I guess it would be helpful to go over Lagrange and the first lectures a bit more slowly. Also, if you don't like math, this class is going to be hard because it's full of math (especially compared to intro micro where it was mostly drawing graphs and simple calc.)",
                "The biggest strength of the course is Prof. Chalioti: she's incredibly smart, funny, and most importantly, passionate about teaching. She made me enjoy coming to lecture each day, even when the topics were a little less exciting. The problem sets generally felt like they were an appropriate length (particularly in the second half of the course), and both they and the exams felt like they were well-constructed in helping us build our knowledge and assessing that knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is more about its general nature than anything specific about the teaching of it: the material feels rather repetitive. Basically the entire first half of the class is applying Lagrange multipliers to different scenarios and then working through the math over and over again, and even though the second half of the class moves a little further away from Lagrange multipliers, it's still just one optimization problem after another. Prof. Chalioti's engaging style of teaching, however, made the lectures themselves feel a little less repetitive and more enjoyable, as she frequently brought in real-world examples from a variety of contexts.",
                "The strengths of this course is the sheer number of resources put into helping students learn the content. I heavily relied on peer tutoring & office hours. The weakness of this course are the effectiveness of the lectures themselves - I found myself lost during most of the lectures, and it wasn't until after I had the concepts re-explained to me by a TA or peer tutor that I understood the lectures. However, I was discouraged from coming to class for this reason.",
                "Prof Chalioti explains really well, there's a lot of support from TFs and Peer Tutors, and the tests are (pretty) fair. However, tough math and lot of weight is geared toward the final.",
                "Strengths: This course is very straight forward. You are never expected to produce anything that isn't explicitly covered in lecture or discussion section.\r\nWeaknesses: This course is very mechanical. The entire course can be broken down into problem set-up and then turning the crank on some kind of optimization problem. I wish we spend more time learning economic theory and exploring its implications.",
                "The lectures were a little unclear at times, though the tests were fair and reflected the content taught in class. The lectures in this course were not recorded, though it would have been helpful if they were.",
                "Eva is the greatest strength of this class. I would recommend everyone take this class with her instead of off-cycle. The only weakness is that the last half of the class can feel a little unfocused with the sheer number of topics covered compared to the first half. I wish there were stronger connections drawn between the subjects towards the very end of the class. But, I enjoyed each subject separately.",
                "The lectures are helpful, especially practicing example problems. Sometime the slides have too little information and create more questions than they answer.  The readings often seemed unrelated to\/far more in depth than lecture, which was not particularly helpful. Practice problems in section were helpful, and office hours for psets were very helpful. I wish the psets were graded for accuracy, rather than completion: this meant that grades were not helpful at all for determining one's understanding.",
                "Strengths: well taught during lectures, professor was incredible\r\nWeaknesses: honestly wish psets weren't based on completion? Also more support from TFs on actual homeworks would be appreciated",
                "Strengths: This class is a manageable course. It focuses a lot on math and if you have a solid grasp on the mathematical concepts\/how to do them, then it will be fine. Exams were relatively similar to the PSET problems.",
                "Offering more practice tests",
                "This concepts of this course are quite abstract so it was sometimes hard to follow the mathematical steps in solving a problem. The professor was quite engaging however and she clearly cared about her students doing well. The course was also organized well in the workload, with each PSET being due each week, which helped to give a sense of what needed to be done each week.",
                "The material was very interesting, and the instructor and TFs made the course enjoyable and doable. Also, in the last class, we got free chocolate!\r\n\r\nHowever, this course is more of an applied math course than an economics course, as everything we did was math based, and the course did not cover any new concepts. While math is quite an important part of microeconomics, I would have liked to see more economics in this course.",
                "It's such a huge class so people's preparations are very different. For me as a math-adjacent major, the class feels really slow, because it's just solving one differential equation for a whole class, and I could have gotten the same information by reading the slides in 10 minutes. As a result, I think it would be nice to perhaps go faster in lectures then go more in depth or slower in discussion sections for those who need it.",
                "Strengths: Professor Chalioti is AMAZING. Take this class with her, even if you have to wait to take it by a semester. It's so worth it. The lectures are really well organized, the discussion sections are great, exams are super fair, and don't really test anything outside of the PSets and other practice\/section material. The TFs were great, super helpful and kind. A great class!!\r\nWeaknesses: Wish the lectures were recorded. Often the lectures cover a lot of things really quickly, so writing notes down while paying attention to the concepts can be challenging.",
                "Very little insight on what will be on midterm and final exams (limited review and practice questions)",
                "One strength was the casual atmosphere of the discussion section which allowed for honest questions and a tailored learning experience. I think another large strength was Prof. Chalioti's ability to tie in current events\/modern connections to the topic of the lectures, making the math more understandable when seen in context. I strongly appreciated that aspect of the course, because without a solid reasoning for why I am performing certain calculations, I do not understand them.",
                "Well-planned lectures, plenty of practice material, lots of help from TFs available throughout the week. Grading the psets for accuracy rather than completion would have helped clarify understanding throughout the semester",
                "Professor Chalioti is a great lecturer and expectations for coursework are very clear. Lectures are fast-paced and very informative.",
                "Releasing pass Exams and more practice for the first midterm would be very helpful",
                "Psets are marked upon completion which means you need to self-review them with the answers that are posted a couple weeks later, and you do not have much motivation to complete them thoroughly although they are essential review for the midterm and final. Required readings were oftentimes not the most helpful, but additional review material is posted prior to exams. Overall, the class is very manageable if you are willing to review all the problem sets and discussion section questions thouroughly.",
                "Section was very helpful, and lectures were great. Problem sets were very straightforward",
                "One strength of the course was the number of practice problems and the level of support. There were a ton of office hours and Prof. Chalioti posted a very large amount of practice material, all of which was very helpful. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was that the slides were generally pretty clear and we spent a lot of time in class working through examples. This made the problem sets much easier. Also, the problem sets were graded based on completion rather than accuracy, which I appreciated and took a lot of stress off. \r\n\r\nFinally, the material isnt easy, but I thought Prof. Chalioti was a good lecturer. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was the pacing of the course. Class would sometimes consist of rehashing concepts from last lecture for the first 30-45 minutes and then an explanation of new material towards the end of class that felt rushed. Me and my friend had a joke that 1:45 was usually when we stopped understanding what was going on. \r\n\r\nUsually, in cases like these, Id read through the slides before class to give myself a general sense of what was going on. However, only an incomplete version of the slides was posted before class, which didnt include steps for the practice problems we spent most of class working through.\r\n\r\nThese two factors created a situation where I often didnt understand what was going on during class and scrambled to copy down steps. I often had to return to the material after class and piece things together on my own.",
                "The strengths of this course lie in the quality of those who run it. Professor Chalioti is a wonderful lecturer, the Teaching Fellows are incredibly helpful and accessible, and the Peer Tutors are knowledgable and break down the concepts really well.",
                "Strengths - relatively low workload and clear guidelines on what to expect from the class. Weekly pset. 2 exams. Weaknesses - lecture style class sometimes not engaging, but if you forced yourself to go to lecture it definitely keeps you on track",
                "Strengths: taught well and the psets reflect exams, also plenty of practice materials are given so its easy to study for. \r\nWeaknesses: its hard",
                "Feedback for problem sets would be encouraged even though the solutions are published.",
                "The professor and organization was great. Would love to see more office hour opportunities",
                "Eva does a great job of keeping this course engaging with real world examples and videos, and she's clearly extremely committed to helping her students learn.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was extremely hard to follow this course as someone without extensive math background. I found the math on the slides very hard to follow, and was frustrated that the exams primarily tested one's math ability not their understanding of the theory. The biggest problem was that the answer keys for problems (the main source of study material for the exams) skip multiple steps at a time. I know lots of my classmates had this problem as well- I think the teaching team assumes things are obvious or self-explanatory when in reality most of the math is new to us. And it's virtually impossible to prepare oneself for exams if you don't know how Eva got from one line to the next in the study materials. (If this was the case in just one or two examples I could have gotten help from the teaching team, but it was nearly every single problem).",
                "good lectures",
                "This class is repetitive, basically teaches the same math equation over and over applied to different concepts. With that said, the lessons it teaches have little to no connection to real-world concepts (unless you want to be an actual economist), and this class ends up basically becoming an applied math class instead of an Econ class.",
                "Personally, math is not a strength of mine so I really liked how Eva related class to the world around us because it made me understand the concepts way better. I perhaps wish thee was more math extra help offered to students that felt less confident in that region (like me).",
                "I thought the course was organized very well. The lectures were enticing and stimulating. The problem sets were on material from prior lectures. Office hours were organized very well.",
                "Very math heavy. Large discrepancies in performance based on previous math courses taken.",
                "Strengths: Many materials were provided for reviewing the content from the lectures and practicing it. Lecture notes were posted regularly. Problem sets and exams reflected the content covered in class. TAs are available to answer questions regularly. Many, many opportunities for office hours and support. Prof. Chalioti's lectures were engaging and well-organized.\r\nWeaknesses: No feedback is provided nor corrections on problem sets which makes it difficult to gauge your understanding of the material. Answer keys with detailed explanations are provided, though.",
                "Strengths: lectures are very engaging, solutions to practice problems are uploaded on time\r\nWeaknesses: problem descriptions are not clear about their assumptions sometimes, this causes a lot of confusions to me.",
                "Strengths: Exceptionally organized, very well structured and reasonable in all expectations. Weaknesses: None.",
                "A big strength of this course was the clear lecture material given and the brief textbook readings assigned. Professor Chalioti was sure to only assign the exact pages necessary to understand the models and was clear in her in-class explanations of the models. The TF office hours were also especially helpful and the TFs were always willing to answer questions. The posted solution keys and example material were also extremely helpful and provided in depth explanations of not only how to solve the problem but how to understand it conceptually. Some weaknesses were that we didn't always get to finish all of the material in class and sometimes Professor Chalioti would go quickly through mathematical methods even though we were unfamiliar with how she solved the problem. The course also focused very much on getting the answer, which may be a strength for some students, but I found it to slightly dampen my experience as I wasn't able to get as strong of a conceptual understanding of the material.",
                "Strengths: lots of learning materials available to students like TA and peer tutor office hours, discussion section materials, practice problems, etc. Weaknesses: lectures were not very conducive to actual learning--it was very difficult to stay engaged in lectures despite Eva being very sweet and encouraging. I ended up doing most of my learning outside of class on my own rather than during lectures.",
                "Real-world applications for each topic were made apparent. The course could benefit from more practice material and more engaging\/applicable section problems.",
                "please record the lectures -- eva explains the material extremely fast and is not accommodating to student understanding\r\nher policies are irregular and unreasonable",
                "the psets were definitely helpful for learning the material.",
                "Strength: prof Eva Chalioti! She is spectacular. The course is difficult and the material can builds up quickly, but she is aware and tries to make this course as manageable as possible. Throughout the semester, she told us multiple times, I am on your side, which just goes to show how much she cares about her student. I entered this class wanting to fulfill a major requirement, but it ended up being my favorite class of the semester \r\n\r\nWeakness: some TAs are good and some not so much, which is always the case but I especially felt that way in this class. This is not to say that all of them are not smart and considerate of students, but some of them had a more difficult time leading office hours and sections in a way that was actually helpful (ie would just go through the answer key and spend little to no time explaining). HOWEVER, this is not a big problem at all. This course was extremely well organized",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "This course was well-structured and all the necessary information could always be found in the lecture slides. The discussion sections provided harder practice problems, and the office hours always helped me get any of the questions I had resolved. Professor Chalioti was also very approachable and helpful whenever I needed anything explained. The only weakness of this course is that the problem sets were always done in front of us in office hours - although it was nice to be able to verify our answers, I sometimes found myself unable to fully solve the problem myself later on. Perhaps it would have been more helpful if part of office hours were dedicated to answering questions, and the rest to solving the P-Set.",
                "I think this course was very well structured and the content was interesting considering the potential dryness of learning economic theory. I think the use of videos and real life examples strengthened my interest in the content, and I think that adding even more of that could make the class more interesting. I think something were explained in a convoluted manner during lecture that made sense in office hours\/section not because the content was difficult but because the original explanation was confusing.",
                "Expectations of the class are very clear and it is taught at a very fast pace. Eva grades the problem sets on completion which works well.",
                "Strengths: problem sets are very instructive in teaching the required concepts; exams were very fair || Course might benefit from increased focus on teaching the theory behind certain topics",
                "Strengths: This course had a lot of support with office hours and peer tutoring that I appreciated. I also liked how the psets were very manageable in length and the instructor was very clear about what was going to be on the exams.\r\nWeaknesses: The course required a good bit of Math 120 knowledge even though this was not a pre-req. I took Math 120 prior to this course and was alright, but I think some math concepts like partial derivatives should have been explained early on to help students who didn't have that math background. Additionally, an option to attend class while sick would have been helpful.",
                "Well-structured with a good support system.",
                "It is easy, but also quite boring, frankly.",
                "Strengths: Professor is great, psets really helpful to learn material, exams very representative of psets\r\nWeaknesses: HUGE jump in terms of mathematics from intro micro  definitely doable, but as someone who didnt have a large math background, spent much of the beginning of the semester teaching myself partial derivatives & la grange",
                "hard without preexisting knowledge",
                "Strengths: it does a good job of building off of knowledge from intro micro. Youll likely learn a lot if you try. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the organization of the class wasnt great at times; its easy to forget how lecture topics relate to anything learned prior. Also, some topics are very similar to each other and its hard to differentiate them because its not made clear.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-Communication with students \r\n-Grading \r\n-Professor is incredibly caring",
                "I thought the course was really good at offering assistance and guidance when needed through office hours. I think more time could have been spent on reviewing before the final and midterm.",
                "Really well structured class. Discussion sections were useful. Weaknesses were that problem sets were not corrected.",
                "Mathematical consistency and clear bounds on what is and is not assessed, but some room for improvement on how to include more economic intuition on understanding the subjects (a great example would be indifference curves and tangency to them, our explanations were almost entirely done via math, which is fine and makes sense but the economic intuition was missing)",
                "It was very math-based, which I liked in comparison to other Econ courses. It is taught very clearly and there are a lot of resources and practice material.",
                "Very engaging",
                "Strengths: great prof\r\nWeaknesses: content is not super engaging",
                "Strength - interesting concepts\/applicability at times\r\nWeaknesses - A little boring at times",
                "Was very effective at teaching quickly but sometimes boring",
                "Extremely strong course. Problem sets and exams reflect the material well. A big weakness is I wish the exams could be harder--in order to differentiate more between students.",
                "Strengths: concepts are very straight forward. Because this is very math based, problem sets and exam questions are quite straightforward.\r\n\r\nWeakness: this class is not the most engaging. There are many times throughout the semester where the material gets quite boring.",
                "The teaching and difficulty of the class needs to be fixed.",
                "Lectures are not that engaging",
                "Not a lot of time for synthesis in lecture",
                "Great lectures, psets were completion, great TA staff. Some weaknesses were that the course felt a bit repetitive at times with the math",
                "I think that section should be about going over concepts and material learned (because sometimes lecture moved very fast), rather than just doing practice problems. The practice problems posted were helpful to do on own without needing a TA to solve them for us.",
                "No lecture recording and poor slides which made it very hard to learn material and review",
                "Strengths: Straight-forward material with very distinct lectures and processes, gives a good overview on different equations and topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not really a cohesive structure (textbook, units, etc.) that makes it a little hard to study for, also no real study guides besides doing practice problems",
                "Some of the questions on the problem sets were not specific enough for me to understand exactly what to do to complete the problem.",
                "A lot of this course feels redundant with Intro Micro. Most of the concepts are the same, but this course just adds calculus. While the math itself isn't difficult, the questions would often devolve into long Algebra problems that are annoying to do by hand and easy to make a small mistake on. I didn't find myself learning that much new about economics, and the models we did use felt too abstract and general to be of any use.",
                "Strengths: The material is very well-organized. There were plenty of office hours with the Professor, TAs, and ULAs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of.",
                "Strengths: Straightforward and centered around a core concept (Lagrange). Good practice problem sets and materials that prepared us for exams\r\nImprovements: It's a grind and challenging class, and the fact that so many people need it for their major leads to this class being unhealthily competitive."

                "If you need it for the Econ major, don't dread it.  But if you're not an Econ major I don't really see the point.",
                "Not to a non-major. The course is fairly repetitive based on the nature of the material and probably not the most interesting elective class, but given the constraints of the material, it's very well-taught.",
                "If you enjoy math and economics, this is a solid foundational course. The intuition surrounding economics is not quite as important as the mathematical concepts.",
                "I would if you would like to really learn the specifics of economics.",
                "Yes if you're thinking about being an econ major. Otherwise, if you've taken intro micro, a lot of the material will be the same, but with some more calculus.",
                "Not unless it was a requirement for their major, but I think that's the point of the class. Not supposed to be the most exciting.",
                "Yes, if it is a major requirement",
                "I would. If you found the concepts in Intro Micro interesting, this developed and expanded on a lot of the same points.",
                "Yes, obviously if its required for your major you should take it. But if its not required and math isn't your strength, then I would not recommend this class. I'd instead recommend taking macroeconomics because it will likely be less math oriented.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class: although the material isn't always the most exciting, it's an important foundation for future studies in economics, and Prof. Chalioti makes learning the material much more engaging and enjoyable. She clearly loves teaching, and that bleeds through into the class.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Although the material was challenging, the professor did a great job at explaining everything thoroughly and making sure that there were enough practice examples. If you pay attention during classes and put effort into the problem sets, you will do well in the class.",
                "Yes, I would. It's a great introduction to microeconomics and brings in the necessary math skills to be prepared for future courses on the subject. I also felt that many of the intimidating concepts were easily broken down into digestible problems that were more easily understood. I did feel, however, as though one midterm and one final was not enough assessment for the class, and would've preferred a second midterm - especially for grade weight.",
                "I really liked the first part of the course, and then it gets harder. You should take this course if you have an interest in microeconomics and you like math. If you don't like math, this course can get pretty hard. It's worth taking to really understand the mechanisms behind what you learn in intro micro.",
                "I am a Physics\/S&DS major and took this for fun. I definitely would not recommend as a first economics class, especially if you are hoping to get a basic understanding of economics. The difficult part about this class is its mathematical intensity; however, if you are familiar with that, you won't get much our of taking it.",
                "I would not take this course unless you need to take it for the econ major. You won't learn much conceptually that you didn't learn in intro micro. You will just learn more complex\/mathematical models.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to put in the effort. Learning in this class requires frequent effort. Put in the effort, and you should succeed.",
                "In so far as it is important for the econ major and a prerequisite for many classes, yes. It explains important mathematical models which are essential for economics!",

                "Yes, I learned a lot from this course and others will too. This was the course that made me realize just how useful math is in other contexts.",
                "It's not too hard, but the material overlaps heavily with intro micro, but with more math. The math part is relatively straightforward though, so if you are just looking to gain econ knowledge for fun, it's not necessary to go through the whole intro intermediate sequence. Choosing one is sufficient.",
                "Yes!! 100%. I'd recommend this class even to non-econ majors. Skip Intro Micro, it's so boring and for whatever reason is terrified of math. Econ 121 covers all the concepts while explaining the math behind them. The math itself is nothing complicated, just partial derivatives that manifest in different formulae again and again and again. You absolutely don't need Math 115 or Math 118\/120 to take this class, as long as you know how to do derivatives, learning partial derivatives is a 5-minute affair. \r\nI did take Math 118 before Econ 121 though and definitely thought the Lagrangian concepts + Matrix determinant calculations that were taught were helpful, but it's just a few extra hours of work in the first 2 weeks if you don't take Math 118 so really nothing to worry about.",
                "It is a core class for the economics major. I don't believe the material is very helpful for those not pursuing an economics-related degree.",
                "Probably only if they were also seeking an economics degree. I think it is very helpful for future economics success, but not as much of an intellectual challenge or intrigue level as other Yale courses.",
                "Yes, you probably have to take it for your major",
                "This is likely a required course for students enrolling, but regardless I would definitely recommend the course for anyone good at math and interested in economics.",
                "Unless it's necessary for your major, no.",
                "Yes, but if you are more math-inclined the applied-math version of this class may prove more enjoyable and stimulating since oftentimes we did not solve all the maths behind different proofs such as Sheperd's Lemma.",

However, this class was not my favorite. \r\n\r\nA more accurate title for it would be economic applications of lagrangian optimization  basically, approach Econ 121 as a math class. I liked parts of it, but other parts were a slog: I get that understanding concepts like exchange economies is important, but in practice, problems with them turn into solving lines and lines and lines of algebra.",

It is extremely math-heavy, and is probably primarily useful for those planning to go on to PhDs in economics or careers in finance. It is a central course for both of those two career pathways, but does not teach general skills that could be applied to other fields. Unlike intro micro or the macro sequence, this class has very little theory (mainly a repeat of intro micro theories) and is mainly an extremely rigorous teaching of mathematical methods. If you are in the global major, I would strongly recommend taking intermediate macro instead, unless you have exceptionally strong math skills.",

Some people say this course is challenging but as long as you keep up with the problem sets every week, it should be easy.",
                "I would recommend this course if you need it for your major or want practice applying math to economics. We did not learn many new topics from Intro Micro, but instead learned many new ways to approach what we already knew. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this course if you want to learn new topics, but would definitely recommend it for anyone wishing to get a more profound understanding of microeconomics. I would also recommend this course just because of Professor Chalioti, as she was always extremely helpful and welcoming in class.",
                "Yes if they are pursuing Econ",
                "I would recommend this to any student who is seriously interested in economics (in which case they are probably required to take it anyway). It expands on the outlook for the economic world that intro micro sets up.",
                "Yes I would because it is a core class in the economics major, I would definitely recommend taking it with Eva.",
                "Yes, it is a required class for many majors, and sets up a good foundation for future advanced courses in economics; great class for students to dip their toes into the field and see if economics is something they like",
                "I don't think a non-ECON major would gain much from this course since it is just a deeper dive into ECON 115 material. However, if you are planning on studying more Econ at Yale, this is a good course. It is well organized and has lots of support.",
                "Only to those required to take it.",
                "If you have toand I am sure most people who take this course do so because they have to.",
                "Yes!",
                "not unless needed for major",
                "Yes, if planning on majoring in something where Econ is useful or if you enjoyed intro micro. Id recommend having at least some background in mathematics, as the class involves the use of math covered up to Math 120. This would just make the class easier to understand and more useful to you, but probably not required.",
                "Yes, the material is super interesting and the professor is outstanding.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I think the academic rigor is helpful to prepare you for the rest of the econ track.",
                "Yes if required, definitely a good course. Especially if you're good at math, this course will be relatively straight forward.",
                "Only if it's a major requirement",
                "Yes, if you want to know how to actually solve Econ questions using math, this is the course to take.",
                "I would recommend this course to further\r\nyour understanding of microeconomics",
                "I would, as long as you are very interested in economics or need to take the course to fulfill your major's requirements. The class isn't scary, but it's not glamorous either",
                "Yes, if you have to for the Econ Major or Global Major. Otherwise would take another elective for fun",
                "For sure. A must take at Yale. Super strong class, and you will learn so much about economics and optimization calculus.",
                "Yes if you are an econ major. If you are not an econ major, I would not recommend this. There is a ton of math involved which is not very applicable.",
                "No but its a requirement for economics majors",
                "Yes if the student wants to study economics",
                "If they are econ majors yes",
                "Yes Yes Yes! Prof. Chalioti is a great lecturer and so kind. She appeals to the needs of students well and always brings great energy to lecture.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, it's a good class that teaches ideas integral to microeconomics as a whole",
                "Yes",
                "Only if you have to take this course, or somehow really love Micro theory. I took this course for my major, and it confirmed for me that I don't enjoy microeconomic theory. The models we work with are simplified to the point of absurdity (e.g. an economy with two firms and two consumers, each of whom owns half of each firm) and the math is tedious. I found macro and econometrics to be far more interesting and useful than this course.",
                "Yes. It is a great course for understanding the math behind economics.",
                "Yes for your major but no otherwise. There are some great parts of this course (I really enjoyed learning about insurance and some of the foundational math behind actuarial science), but the environment makes it stressful but if you were to Credit\/D\/F, I think you wouldn't learn the important things this class has to teach."
