                "I gained a deep understanding of the theories of democracy of Tocqueville and Dubois, specifically how they relate to the role of race in a democracy. I have already been able to apply the theoretical tools that we discussed throughout the semester to my thinking about present-day challenges relating to criminal justice, voting rights, and generally building a multiracial democracy.",
                "I got an in-depth perspective regarding Tocqueville and Du Bois and their philosophies regarding race and democracy. Beyond this, I was able to work a lot on crafting cogent arguments and close-reading through the papers we wrote for the class.",
                "I developed a deep knowledge of DuBoiss and Tocquevilles works and was able to find connections between them. Although I preferred DuBoiss writings about race in America after the Civil War, Tocqueville has very prescient predictions and analyses about the Civil War to come. Overall it was very interesting material",
                "I gained a strong appreciation for both Tocqueville's Democracy in America and W.E.B. Du Bois's larger body of works on American society. This class really helped me understand the possibilities and shortcomings of democracy as a liberating and oppressive force, and I think my analytical skills as they relate to political theory were greatly improved.",
                "This close is highly reliant on close reading, and I would say that my close reading skills developed significantly. This course also asks students to examine the way that racial structures impact the construction of democracy and the way that we define democracy.",
                "We did a really intensive read into Du Bois and Tocqueville. The discussion was the best part and where I learned the most. We had fruitful discussions of all aspects by of democracy and I always left class in awe.",

            "comments": [
                "The environment of class felt a little tense, and it felt like your thoughts had to be fully developed and incredibly intellectual before speaking up. Thus, at times it was definitely difficult to feel comfortable speaking. However, the professors really did try to emphasize that was not the case, and they made sure to try and lighten the mood every once and a while.",
                "The readings and discussions were really great. Professor Oskian and Vatsal were great at moderating the discussion; they did not talk a lot, and they really gave the students space to share ideas and respond to each other's thoughts. They were also very kind and much more invested in their students than other professors that I've had at Yale. They provided detailed feedback on all of our assignments, which really helped me improve my writing and challenged me to sharpen my thinking.",
                "The course was strong in that the readings and topic areas provoked a lot of discussion among students, and everyone was always comfortable participating. I feel like the other students in my class also made this a very comfortable learning environment because people were courteous and willing to build off one another's idea. Sometimes, in political science seminars, there tends to be some students who just talk to hear themselves speak even if they don't have anything meaningful to contribute with their perspective and positionality -- however, this wasn't the vibe of this class at all, and it was great! \r\n\r\nI would say one weakness of this class is that there is a very high volume of readings and not all of them feel necessary, but I guess sometimes that can't be helped. To combat this issue, something more helpful might just be for the professors to introduce the next week's readings the week before and help crystallize the connections between them. If I'm being honest, I'm still not sure how Ambedkar's reading on Buddhism related to Tocqueville, Du Bois, or the other readings that week, and it would have been great to get a heads up about why the professors chose that reading in advance.",
                "Strengths: The readings and the professors. The readings delve deeply into race, slavery, the genocide of Native Americans, capitalism, white supremacy and democracy. The professors were very helpful in guiding the class discussions towards examining the connections between all these themes and allowing us to form our own profound opinions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there are multiple long and dense readings each week. This could make it difficult to finish all of them sometimes. Sometimes the shorter readings (outside of Tocqueville and Dubois) were also hard to find because some were posted on slack and others on canvas",
                "This class was fantastic. Discussions were rich and engaging, and there is not much I would change. I think the only improvement I would suggest is removing discussion topics from the realm of theory, because it was sometimes difficult to engage with ideas if you didn't have the requisite knowledge and background in Marxist or democratic theory, for example. This problem was probably a function of the specific personalities in the class rather than the actual topics or readings discussed though.",
                "Discussion could be really hard some time and it was hard to participate when it felt more abstract or secluded to a couple students",
                "Almost everything about this course was a strength: brilliant and caring instructors, amazing texts rarely read together, probing and creative discussion questions. I'd only change a couple things to improve it: add a bit more historical and biographical information on Tocqueville and Du Bois early on, and use the blog format for the entirety of the course rather than just the second half.",
                "I wish we had read Tocqueville and Du Bois concurrently rather than dividing the class into two discrete sections."

                "Yes. It is a lot of reading, but Vatsal and Professor Oskian were great.",
                "Yes! For anyone interested in learning about the interaction of race and democracy and how to work towards an inclusive multiracial democracy, this class is a really enriching deep-dive into these questions and how the writings of Tocqueville and Dubois contain insights that are still relevant today.",
                "I would for sure recommend this class to another student. If you're not in Political Science, EP&E, ER&M, or any other social science or humanities major where you are used to high volumes of readings and intense papers, I would definitely say this isn't the class for you. You should take this class only if you're willing to put in the time to engage with at least some of the readings every week and explore the themes of them in-depth when it comes time for the papers. I will say the papers are assigned to us far in advance, and there are only two--so it's definitely a manageable workload overall.",
                "Yes! It was a very enlightening seminar",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone but especially to those students interested in thinking through the problems of multiracial democracy.",
                "Yes! Do it for the professors and a great discussion! Be warned youll have to read a lot.",
                "Absolutely. This was the most imaginative and stimulating class I've taken at Yale. Where else do you encounter discussion questions like \"Should Black women rule us all?\" What makes this class so special is that it manages to be subversive precisely by being serious. You read Tocqueville and Du Bois (and a number of other authors) very closely, and in doing so, find that ideas that seem radical by normal standards are worthy of serious consideration."
