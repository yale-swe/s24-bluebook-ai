                "It's statics, but forces are not zero and acceleration is apparently a thing that exists. Usually viewed as a really difficult class, to me felt like physics on steroids. I enjoyed it because modeling and predicting how objects move is cool, albeit hard.",
                "It helped me cement previous dynamics knowledge from physics and other MENG classes. It also taught new things such as motions through various mechanisms. I left the course feeling like I could actually solve more complex dynamics problems.",
                "Many Engineering skills when it came to organisation of information, and retraining of the brain to not rely on intuition when information and calculation can be relied on!",
                "As someone who has never been good at physics and has terrible intuition, this class REALLY nailed it inand very well. My skills at problem solving and setting up questions improved leaps and bounds thanks to Prof. Diehls engaging teaching, difficult PSETs, and endless resources on the canvas page.",
                "Problem solving skills for dynamics problems. A solid overview of this topic.",
                "I expanded my knowledge of dynamics, especially in rigid body motion.",
                "I learned how to solve a variety of engineering dynamics problems, giving me greater insight into the workings of certain mechanisms and physical properties.",
                "We learned dynamics, the study of motion of particles and rigid bodies, as well as several techniques to analyze motion. These techniques were pretty intuitive for the most part, and they gave me a pretty solid understanding of how objects move/interact at the macroscopic level",
                "I learned how to calculate the kinematics and kinetics of both points and rigid bodies in dynamic situations (an extension of knowledge of dynamics from Physics).",
                "The main topics were kinematics, forces, work, energy, and impulse/momentum; we learned these in Cartesian coordinates, path coordinates, and polar coordinates. The first half of the class was about point particles, and the second half was for rigid bodies, when we also discussed how to find the velocities and angular velocities of linkages and connected systems (more involved than it sounds).\r\n\r\nI took AP Physics C in high school, and the majority of this class felt like review of that material. The main new topic were acceleration in polar coordinates, as well as velocity and acceleration analysis for rotating objects and linkages.",
                "This was an advanced survey of dynamics topics. Students taking this after introductory physics should expect to learn many new methods and solve new and challenging problems, including 4-bar mechanisms, rotational motion, and work-energy balance.",

                "Understanding of particle and rigid body kinetics and kinematics.",
                "This was the course I learned the absolute most in this semester. This class focused on rigid body dynamics, and thats all I want to focus on for this course review. Theres too much I learned to really jot down in such a small space. All you need to know is this guy was basically Jesus reincarnated when it came to teaching. If you dont poach him from the University of Hartford, I can guarantee you the department of engineering here will suffer a massive loss in terms of opportunity cost. He told us at the end of the semester he couldnt come back because of some tenure complications at Hartford. Fix your engineering department and bring Edward Diehl in as a permanent professor.",

                "Strengths: PLENTY of additional learning resources. Professor Diehl has recordings of him working all the example problems etc on youtube so you can always learn if you have the time. Generally well organized to have topics flow into each other in a sensible manner.\r\nWeaknesses: Class moves quickly. Because there's many examples and they take a while, they are often not done in detail because they are available to view after lecture",
                "The example and homework problems in this course really shined when it came to needing to fully understand the material in order to do them. It would be better if there were more simplistic examples, especially for the latter part of the course. Some concepts are hard to wrap your head around and when multiple concepts are combined into one problem, it can be hard to determine individual effects. Also, some of the homework problem sets seemed to take too long and could be shortened.",
                "Very hefty workload, but overall, very well taught.",
                "All strengths for this course. The Professor is amazing!!!! Understood linear and rotational kinematics and kinetics much more",
                "This was one of the hardest classes Ive taken at Yale, but by far the most rewarding. Although the PSETs were extremely challenging, Prof. Diehls emphasis on problem set-up and deciphering  over silly numerical mistakes really helped support my foundation of understanding the content, and his extremely generous grading for calculation errors made the class less tedious for the same learning.",
                "A strong curriculum and well planned course. Great care put into homework problems and example problems.",
                "Strengths: Engaging and well laid out",
                "This course is very difficult but the professor made it accessible. I wish there were more office hours opportunities because I found it difficult to complete homework on my own.",
                "Strengths: we had an adjunct professor, Prof Ted Diehl, and he was great; though the material can be tough at times and the class might be pretty formulaic, just a quick moments on the material then the rest of the class is dedicated to example problems, Prof Diehl made it fun and engaging with his constant jokes and lighthearted manner of teaching. All of his lecture and slide notes are online as well. \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the problems on the pset required thinking outside of the box and understanding of the material beyond what we learned in class. Prof Diehl put his notes online as well but it still gets tough sometimes. He's always quick and willing to help though.",
                "This course was well taught and all the work was very reasonable. I have no complaints about the course.",
                "Strengths: \r\nThe course was very well-organized, with a ton of extra resources on Canvas. I really liked Professor Diehl: he made class engaging, he was very understanding. I liked that he gave us three-question \"in-class assessments\" on our phones at the end of most classes, which were conceptual questions about what we'd learned; they were just a completion grade, and they made the class feel more involved.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI liked that we did example problems in class, but sometimes I felt that we spent too much time on them.",
                "This course, under professor Diehl, was an absolute delight to take. Professor Diehl made lectures exciting and always brought a lot of fun energy into what could have been a basic class.",
                "Dr. Diehl was great. I liked the material. Sometimes the homework assignments were a bit tedious.",
                "The professor was awesome and I loved his teaching style. The only bad part was how long the psets were.",
                "Fantastic course, well structured, fair homework and exam policy.",
                "No weaknesses. This is the most Ive ever written in support of a professor. Edward Diehl is fantastic, and his MENG 383 course should be a model for all Yale classes.",
                "This course was incredibly well-organized. The course website was the most populated I have ever seen, with way more example problems and videos than most courses. Dr. Diehl's notes were also an excellent resource. The extra credit opportunities were also a strength of this course, as they made it less stressful than other courses."

                "If this Professor is teaching, most definitely would!!!!",
                "Absolutely, if you have the time and want to really solidify Dynamics and physics backgrounds. None of your 20 hours of work per week will be wasted, but it will be challenging, even if the grading is completely fair (if not truly generous). You get exactly what you put into this course.",

                "With Prof Diehl, though it can be challenging, it's a fun course! Dynamics seems to be a pretty dreaded course but it really does teach you a lot about the motion of objects using a variety of methods of analysis.",
                "I would recommend this course because it is required for MENG majors. However, I think that this is a course where the professor makes or breaks the course, so definitely check of professor reviews.",
                "Yes, I would. If you like the material, which I do, then it's a fun class; I don't think Prof. Diehl is teaching this class again, but if he is, I recommend taking it with him. If you took Physics C Mechanics and understood it well, then a decent portion of this class will be review, but there are definitely still new topics that I learned (mostly involving rotation).",

                "Yes, although it is required for most MechE majors, this is a class that would appeal to anyone who likes physics. It is considerably more enjoyable than physics 180/181. The course is fast pace, but manageable for anyone with a decent physics background.",
                "Absolutely. I would definitely warn them about workload, but I didnt even care with Dr. Diehl as a professor. Class was extremely engaging and I think I learned the most I have at Yale.",
                "This course is crucial to anyone who wants to do any mechanical engineering in their life. If you're BS12 and want to consider yourself an engineer don't try to skip out."
