                "Strengths:\r\nthis close certainly brought me closer to my classmates, many of whom ended up becoming close friends.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe level of disorganization was extremely high. The professor failed to provide a definite syllabus by Thanksgiving Break (!) and modified due dates for major assignments up until the week they were due. I normally would appreciate the flexibility, but the poor communication given around deadlines made the situation anxiety-inducing. Secondly, the teachers did not communicate in a timely manner regarding assignments. Although students were expected to hand in first drafts of papers for comments a week or more in advance of the final deadline, comments on drafts were not returned to several students until hours before the final deadline. This failure on the teachers to provide feedback occurred even when students contacted the teachers multiple times. Finally, class discussions often felt superficial. Although I appreciate the importance of reviewing plot elements, there tended to be little substantive discussion of the material. This often led to many class periods consisting of sitting in silence.",
                "Only strengths; this seminar felt like a stream of peace in the midst of the chaotic life at Yale. It was just wonderful to get to spend quality time with 10 other people (who soon became good friends) discussing literature and the culture of the Near East. Professor Slanski is also an extremely caring and brilliant individual.",
                "The major strength of the course is that is it a seminar that is very student directed. Students can have a lot of sway over the discussion and the professor is very open to feedback."
