                "I think the greatest strength of the course is the discussions that we had during lectures. These allowed us to learn from on another and improve our own writing by integrating the skills of our classmates and other well-known writers.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness would be that the turnover period between essays can be quite short at some points in the semester.",
                "It was online. Maybe throwing in a creative project would have also been nice to switch things up instead of constantly writing essays for an entire semester.",
                "The strengths of this course were the collaborative workshops and discussions about the readings done for the class. I think it could be improved by providing students with more guidance as in how to approach reading the pieces that are given as homework, with more insight into how students should think of the readings and the topics of the readings as they are consuming the content."

The opportunity to have others read your essay and provide feedback also proves itself invaluable and I felt a genuine improvement in my approach to writing through this course.",
                "I would probably recommend depending on the person. If you like doing a lot of reading and writing then sure. It does feel a bit like a high school essay writing class if your course offered something like this. If you feel comfortable with reading and writing I would just jump to taking another more interesting elective right at the gate.",
                "Definitely, it improved my writing exponentially.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I think for me it was a course where I was free to express writing meaningful to my personal life throughout different concepts and frameworks, while also being exposed to that writing of others, experimenting with elements of writing I would otherwise feel uncomfortable using. I also think the collaboration this course brings is very improvement focused and a great way to develop new or sharpen writing skills."
