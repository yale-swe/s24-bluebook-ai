It gives insight into the fundamental goals and flaws of the penitentiary, as well as explaining the rise of mass incarceration in more recent decades.",

                "Strengths: the readings were really interesting and definitely led to good discussion in class. Professor Kunzel offered really interesting context and additional history.\r\nWeaknesses: none in particular come to mind!",
                "Professor Kunzel is an excellent discussion leader, and it's easy to engage critically and deeply with almost all of the readings. The reading load is heavy, but manageable, and the critical response essays force you to think like a historian.",
                "This class was so interesting! Lots of readings but every single thing on the syllabus is so interesting and pretty easy to read. Also I got a lot of feedback on my writing through the critical responses. Would highly recommend!",
                "Strengths: Professor Kunzel is very engaged with the material and pushes students to think critically about it as well!\r\nClass discussion was really interesting and each week connected to the next giving us a cohesive understanding about the history of incarceration in america.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of reading didnt feel necessary for the assignments/ discussion in class, but it was usually pretty manageable .",
                "strengths: Prof Reg Kunzel's introductory comments that opened our seminar discussion were extremely helpful in guiding our conversation.  though there are many of them, the readings are absolutely phenomenal. weaknesses: n/a!",
                "Was really great!",
                "Strengths: Professor Kunzel did a wonderful job leading and facilitating discussions. I appreciated how they set the stage at the beginning of each discussion by connecting the week's themes to past readings. They also did a wonderful job of responding to student comments and ensuring that everyone got the chance to participate. Weakness: The reading load at times felt too high for an undergraduate level course. An additional check-in regarding the final paper before the end of the semester (perhaps having us submit an outline?) could have been helpful.",
                "Class time was a real strength of the course the discussions were always productive and expertly led by Professor Kunzel. The readings were always relevant and interesting; my only problem was that sometimes they were so long that I had to skim and didnt quite get to take in everything. The system of writing response papers for half of the weeks worked well since it allowed me to write about the subjects that interested me most.",
                "The class is well organized and Professor Kunzel is great and accessible to students. At times, I think the reading load could have been lessened. It was sometimes difficult to write high-quality response papers when just completing the week's readings took most of the week.",
                "The class was structured quite well in that it attempts to provide a comprehensive introduction to the topic. I think it may have been beneficial to spend more time on mass incarceration and the latter half of the twentieth century. While I liked the flexibility that the six reading gave, I think some sort of midterm project in lieu of some of those responses might give students an opportunity for more formal writing feedback. Also, I think it would be beneficial to have smaller selections of readings that can be receptive in their argumentation as opposed to the entire book."

Much of the course is guided around the question \"what is the prison for?\" and the readings offered up a host of explanations that have informed my thoughts on incarceration today.",
                "Yes! I learned so much that I didn't know about the history and present state of American incarceration. The seminar sessions were always interesting and prof Kunzel is a really good facilitator. Also the readings were all really interesting, a lot of stuff that I probably would have wanted to read anyway if I didn't take the class, so large amounts of reading every week didn't bother me.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in understanding all the different facets of incarceration and how they came to be in the U.S, take this class!",
                "yes yes yes! this courses sets students up to deeply understand the formation of and articulate challenges against the prison industrial complex.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in the topic. The readings were excellent and assigned in a manner that made the course cohesive, class discussions were engaging, and Kunzel clearly cares that their students are learning from and engaging with the material.",
                "Yes! Kunzel is amazing, the texts and conversation were stimulating. I think the earlier texts felt more difficult and sometimes hard to grasp / made me feel out of my depth, but I was still able to participate in class convo, so if you feel this way at first dont get discouraged!",
                "Yes, definitely. It is critical for everyone to be able to trace the history of what we call the mass incarceration crisis today in order to gain a better understanding of how to dismantle present-day inequities in policing and imprisonment.",
                "I would recommend this course to all Yale students. It is extremely well-taught, and as becomes clear quickly, Americas carceral system is so deeply intertwined with other aspects of society that learning its history is key to understanding todays America.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you are at all interested in this subject matter (and you should be) take this course. The reading load is substantial, but the material is important and engaging.",
                "Yes, absolutely! I think this course offers the best overview of incarceration of any course at Yale. And you get to have weekly discussions with Professor Kunzel, who's quite humble but also a leader in the field."
