The class also provided ample time for class discussion and debate in a small (~10 students) setting, which was a refreshing change from my other classes.",

The material itself was interesting--being an in-depth review of naval tactics and strategy over time--but CAPT Withrow always added \"sea stories\" to spice up the material, too. CAPT Withrow also provided thorough and prompt feedback to essays.",
