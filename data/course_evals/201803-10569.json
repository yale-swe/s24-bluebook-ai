   "comments": [
    "I learned far more about planets and stars than I had previously known. I learned the science and\/or discoveries behind many of the universes mysteries.",
    "An introduction to some interesting topics in Astronomy.",
    "I developed my critical reasoning skills and a true passion for Astronomy. I feel far more prepared to approach mathematical problems and to understand the skies after this fall.",
    "I learned the math behind a lot of the space phenomena I knew about before.",
    "I developed a great knowledge of the sky and the universe. I originally took this course to simply complete a course requirement and keep my mind sharp while focusing on the humanities, but the course provided my desire for physics and math while also piquing my interest on stars and their formation\/evolution. While it is also nice to be able to spout facts about the sky to my friends and family, I genuinely learned so much ranging from the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to the lifetime of the Crab Nebula.",
    "I developed problem solving skills.",
    "Astronomy\r\nApparent motion of celestial bodies through the sky\r\nGeneral Relativity",
    "I learned astronomical equations and learned how to apply basic math foundations towards real problems.",
    "Better facility with math and reckoning",
    "I gained plenty of insight about our solar system and the underlying mechanisms that govern the physicality of our universe! It was truly amazing to visit the planetarium during this class and see planets and stars through telescopes to apply what we have been learning in class. I have developed a great appreciation for astronomy and have developed my knowledge of physics and a bit of chemistry.",
    "I learned about an introductory overview about the solar system. I learned how to calculate certain distances and angles of different celestial bodies.",
    "A knowledge and basic understanding of astronomy, observational techniques, and characteristics of galactic objects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting material, knowledgeable professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Psets could be quite long at times.",
    "Discussion sections were very helpful.",
    "This course is already fantastic. I would not change any part of it!",
    "One major weakness was that the homework took so long. The way the questions were worded made it nearly impossible to figure out which formulas to use. I planned on taking this class purely for my love of space, however it turned me off of any future astronomy classes because of how much time it took. I had two other problems sets to do each week and this one took up precious time I needed for those.",
    "Great content. More trips to the observatory would be great. More group projects\/interactions would be great as well.",
    "Strengths: review sessions\/ sections were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were often very boring",
    "Strengths:\r\nVery informative\r\nFocus on mathematics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nVery little engagement with the material beyond problem sets and tests",
    "Strength- fast grading, lot of information, answers a lot of questions, very approachable. \r\n\r\nWeakness - TA, instructor goes on and on about some topics that arent as important as others.",
    "The progression of subjects is very logical, and each chapter builds well on the ones before it. Good help is available for anyone who needs it.",
    "Strengths: Very easy to get help from the TA\/Professor on homework problems! Content is very interesting. Doesn't require profound knowledge of physics to understand the mathematical aspect of the course. Reasonable homework load.\r\nWeaknesses: Class can be a bit slow at times.\r\nImprovements: I would be nice to watch more videos and\/or documentaries on the aspects discussed during the course to really understand what is being discussed in class.",
    "I just was not very interested in the subject as it turns out. The class was a good pace, but it was just sometimes hard to understand the material and knowing when to apply what we learned.",
    "The strengths are the knowledge of the Professor and the clear passion he had for the subject. One problem was that the class is for non-STEM majors, meaning it's by definition a class to fulfill a science credit. This is necessary, but leads to low interest and engagement on the part of the students. I do not believe this should reflect on the professor, Prof. Zinn, who made every effort to engage and interest the class.",
    "Strengths: The professor was obviously very interested in the material that he was teaching which made the lectures feel more genuine. The professor also included historical  background alongside the scientific information necessary for the course which helped to contextualize all the the equations, theorems, and laws. The professor was also very willing to work with students, especially if they had questions about grades they received.\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures just seemed too long to keep the students engaged, but that is more likely due to the meeting times of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course is interesting and the work is very manageable.",
    "Yes. Especially for students who do not want to take especially challenging math\/science classes but want to fulfill their requirements in an interesting way.",
    "Yes! I definitely would recommend this course to another student. In fact, I already have told many friends to take this course if they can!",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone else. It took way too much time for the type of course it was. I thought it would be much more interesting than it was.",
    "Yes, I would 10 out of 10 recommend. The content the interesting. The course provides a manageable challenge that is satisfying once it has been completed. It's a great chance to get out of your comfort zone and do something other than a typical chemistry or biology course.",
    "I think if you have a background in math\/science it is manageable. Having a p-set every week was a lot. Definitely go to office hours. Purchase and read the book!",
    "Excellent intro to astronomy!  This is why science requirements exist!",
    "I would recommend this class to a very quantitative student.",
    "For someone with a basic background in astronomy, I would recommend this class. However, I believe there are more interactive classes that students could consider taking.",
    "Yes, I would. I would tell them it is a very good course to get a QR.",
    "Yes, though it was difficult for a non-science oriented person like me. If you take good notes and ask for help, it's doable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another non-stem student that is looking to complete their QR credit! It is a very interesting topic to learn about and the homework is easy to complete\/easy to understand.",
    "If you are interested in introductory astronomy, sure why not.",
    "If you are not a STEM major and need to fulfill a science requirement, this a good, interesting class to take",
    "Yes; this course is a good introduction to science and QR courses at Yale. It is challenging but not overwhelming."
