    "I continued learning Spanish, through speaking, listening, reading and writing. My grammar and vocabulary continued to improve - slowly but surely.",
    "This course was intense and quick, but gave me the skills necessary to use Spanish in real contexts and understand cultures, conversations, and literature that was previously inaccessible.",
    "I improved my speaking, comprehension, and grammar.",
    "I improved my Spanish to the extent that I feel confident communicating with native Spanish speakers in a variety of settings.",
    "Got to learn the final key grammar conjugations like past imperfect subjunctive and future. It helped me pick up more advanced uses of the spanish language as seen in the newspaper."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the professors, the syllabus and textbook, the readings, grammar lessons, and truly almost everything. I don't think I really saw any weaknesses, everything worked well to help deepen and broaden my understanding of Spanish!",
    "This course was engaging and included plenty of information and grammar practice, although I wish we read more Latin American literature and had more time to discuss the culture and traditions surrounding the language.",
    "A strength was how much we spoke out loud in class. Almost every exercise involved talking with partners or in groups which really helped me to feel more comfortable speaking Spanish.",
    "This course placed emphasis on expanding vocabulary while focusing on some new grammatical techniques, which I felt was an effective way to bring students rapidly up to a more advanced level.",
    "I think the course does a great job of reinforcing the core grammar concepts taught through in-class activities and online homework. I think having more opportunities to not only practice our spanish with other students, but other native speakers could enhance our learning experience."

    "Yes.",

    "Yes. This course is an effective way to learn Spanish, but only for students who wish to actively engage and practice speaking whenever possible.",
    "Yes, if you are looking to increase both your vocabulary and understanding of Spanish grammar."
