   "comments": [
    "I think my writing became more succinct and logically structured. I also learned how to write a research paper!",
    "improved research skills, better knowledge of the university library system, improved academic writing skills, improved writing process, read interesting philosophers and new perspectives on time, critically thought about the role of time in society.",
    "Analytical and critical thinking skills, listening and speaking skills, reading skills",
    "By taking this course, I did learn a bit about the writing process here at Yale. I do think, however, it was more through trial and error rather than things we were taught in class. I ended up writing several essays multiple times because feedback\/what the professor was looking for was not 100% clear. This was a good introductory class. I really enjoyed the seminar aspect. I feel like I always learned for the insights of my classmates and got a chance to get to know them, which was nice seeing as this was the first semester of my first year of college. I got better at reading and college level texts as well. With the help of the professor and class discussion, it felt like any piece of writing, no matter how advanced, was accessible! \r\n\r\nI also learned a lot about the topic of the class: time. We explored this from so many aspects, which was really wonderful!\r\n\r\nAlso learned about the library resources and how to write papers (including research papers) here at Yale.",
    "I learned how to write a good old fashioned english essay.  Sentence structure, close reading, interpretation, and above all else, argument, were the main focuses of this class.",
    "I learned to write better, and it improved my communication skills.",
    "I became a better writer in this class. Specifically, I refined the important skill of being able to sort through complex texts and subsequently form a complex argument about them.",
    "My writing skills improved immensely. This course really opened my eyes to new venues of thought and I thoroughly enjoyed taking it."

   "comments": [
    "I loved our topic of \"time's management\" and our readings were really interesting! I would've loved to go on another field trip like the one we took to the art museum.",
    "I really liked the small size of the class, as it facilitated conversation that was vibrant and interesting. I think that some of the readings, particularly the last one, were not as engaging as they could have been. There is a lot of potential in the class for great conversation and when a reading seems particularly dry or disengaging, it can harm the depth of the conversation. This is a very mild critique however.",
    "Strengths: class was manageable; professor split the readings into parts that were manageable and gave clear directions on assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Sustaining interest towards the end was difficult because a lot of the readings were a bit dated (which is understandable as we were looking at the ideas of famous philosophers like Aristotle)",
    "The seminar format was great, as well as the fact that the class was centered around one topic and concept. We dealt with several forms of literature in different formats such as essays, artwork, movies, and music which made the class more interesting. The class could be improved by having a more direct idea of what kind of writing is expected, maybe through providing more samples.",
    "Strengths: The discussion. Specifically in my section, Professor Ellermann is GREAT at leading discussion. He would often summarize what we said and draw other connections back to the text or other insights from our classmates. I cannot overstate how great he was at this! It made me, at least, feel confident sharing in class without every feeling unintelligent. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel as though feedback could have been more specific. I would go into office hours to talk over comments, thinking I just had to make surface edits to a paper only to find out (finally) through LOTS of discussion that it was actually more of a total re-write.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Ellermann. He consistently steered the conversation in interesting directions and provided valuable insight in the writing process. One of the best things about him is how detailed he is on the comments of rough drafts-- this gives you great opportunity to revise your writing before turning it in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were quite dry, hard to read, and\/or too technical in nature. This made for superficial (and sometimes unenjoyable) class discussions.",
    "The strengths of this course are that we learned to analyze complex texts and to close read them while also writing a good reflection and original idea based on those texts.",
    "Strengths: good discussions, helpful feedback on essays\r\n\r\nWeakness: Not enough writing practice in class",
    "The professor is very eloquent and knows how to keep the conversation moving; he makes everyone's comments relevant to the discussion at hand."

    "English 114 is a great introductory writing class. Make sure to take it in a topic you're interested in! I chose mine at random but got very lucky!",
    "I would definitely recommend, especially to first-semester first years. This class was a great transition to college writing for me and I appreciated having the small class size where I felt like I could connect with the professor and other students. The content was really interesting to me and made me think about time in my own life which I appreciated. Overall, as great class.",
    "Yes, but only to students who enjoy the topic of time and looking at different perspectives on time.",
    "Yes! I would 100% recommend this class with Professor Ellermann. He is GREAT at facilitating discussion. I would honestly look forward to class discussions so much after doing our readings. I also enjoyed having a creative final project for this class. However, I would know that feedback can sometimes be unspecific. Meet with him BEFORE you begin writing, utilize writing tutors, and go do office hours.\r\n\r\nFor English 114 in general, yes I would recommend it. It is a broad introduction to writing papers at Yale, but I think it really is dependent on the subject and teacher. I really enjoyed class with my professor, as well as my section's topic, so I ended up really enjoying class in general.",
    "I would recommend taking ENGL 114 if you care about improving your writing greatly. If you find reading the text and engaging with the materials in classroom settings more engaging, then consider taking a different type of course.",
    "Yes, it is a fun course and you learn a lot. Also there is a great feedback environment in the class.",
    "Yes. Overall, I became a better writer.",
    "100%. Best English class ever."
