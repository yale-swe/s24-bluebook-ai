Additionally, you also practice your writing in short responses (300-500 words) and you will practice your oral speaking for in-class activities and also for tests.",
                "My ability to speak and write French obviously developed a great deal. We also learned in class about the French diaspora, engaging with works of literature from many different Francophone places, something which I truly enjoyed. I also felt like I was now, much more than before, able to take my normal literary analysis skill that I use to understand English texts and apply that to French texts as well.",
                "I learned and developed my French grammar. We really solidified the grammar I had learned in high school and learned even more. I also read French novels for the first time, which greatly increased my reading comprehension skills.",

                "The course does a great job of supplying you with a lot of grammar work in addition to writing and oral practice. However, within the grammar work, a lot of the grammar that is taught is grammar that isn't widely used in the language, such as literary grammar. Aside from that, this course does a really good job of engaging you during activities and discussions.",
                "Overall, I think the course was excellent. The pace was very good, and Madame Koundi was a really clear and enthusiastic instructor. Frankly, I can't really think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths - Prof Koundi was very energetic and passionate. She made class enjoyable even though it was every day. I liked the texts that we read; they were actually interesting. The tests were very fair. \r\nWeaknesses - I thought the workload would be way worse than it actually was, and it ended up being very manageable except for when we had to read Un Sac de Billes. We had like 40-60 pages of reading each night plus vocabulary to do, plus reading comprehension questions, and it was really overwhelming and time consuming. I wish Un Sac de Billes had been more spaced out like La Symphonie Pastorale. I wish we worked more on speaking.",
                "Professor Koundi is very intelligent and knows many insights about the French language, yet the workload was sometimes a bit overdone",
                "The course packet for the course explains and covers the grammar material with great detail. In order to improve, I believe having extra worksheets for grammar topics would be useful. For studying and further understanding, I found that I didn't have as much practice as I would have liked."

While it is more work than other classes, it is worth it as you definitely improve your French. Professor Koundi is also great and is engaging during the course.",
