I have learn things that not in standard traditional textbooks. And the class make up also allows one to see things from multiple dimensions",

                "I gained a lot of valuable information in regards on how funding of academic labs/research groups is done on a very detailed level. I also learned about how universities also contribute to sustainability of a lab that arent always immediately obvious. Mainly things like equipment, facility maintenance, funding of emergency research related costs, and etc. I also gained a deeper understanding & appreciation for the many financial, ethical, and legal rules & regulations that running a research lab in a university setting entails. .",

I also learned about how policy has been and is being used to tackle issues such as harassment and bullying in academia. As a result, I feel like I can make a more informed and confident decision to pursue a career in academia."

I fully endorse this structure given that the material is full of nuance and warrants detailed discussions. Each class begins with student presentations about a selection of the week's readings, which allows the readings to inform the discussion."

I say this because as a current senior PhD student, I at many points throughout the semester realized that the information I learned during any component of the class would have been very useful for a younger version of myself, whether I was a sophomore undergrad trying to get into a research lab, a graduating senior preparing to start a PhD in a research field, and even as a 1st year grad student, would have found the information extremely useful in terms of general understanding and to also help navigate some of the unspoken nuances of how to know how well funded or not a research group or university is."
