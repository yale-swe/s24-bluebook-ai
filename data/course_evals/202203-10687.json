                "I developed my Spanish grammar, reading, writing, and speaking skills within this class. Although I hadn't studied Spanish in 2 years, Prof. Baffi was extremely helpful and overall an amazing teacher. She is extremely knowledgeable about all things related to the Spanish language, and she always made sure to make classes interesting. She is also really approachable and understanding.",
                "In this class we learned valuable information about culture, environment, and celebrations in Spanish speaking countries.",
                "I learned basic grammar structures in Spanish and was able to practice the skills of reading, writing, speaking, and listening in an active role. This course facilitated the ability to communicate more complex ideas in Spanish.",
                "I am now able to speak Spanish much more smoothly, and my writing flows better as well. In Spanish 3, I was able to put together all of the information I had learned in my previous Spanish courses.",
                "How to read complex texts and communicate with my peers in Spanish.",
                "In this course, I gained more exposure to speaking Spanish and gained exposure to various mediums of storytelling from short stories to short films. I also learned about grammar and gained more experience in writing."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Asynchronous day, lesson structure, balance between visual and literary works, thematic areas of focus.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Frequency of graded assignments",
                "I like how we did a lot of collaborative work in this class.",
                "Strengths: The course forces you to practice all aspects of the language and slowly develop your skills in a natural way. There is a wide range of skill levels in the class. Class often focused on understanding the materials that we read/watched on our own and usually were good at helping me understand the content better.\r\nWeaknesses: High, unpredictable workload due to the class meeting every day. Many long assignments assigned with not much time to do them or long notice. Difficult to ask questions about assignments due to the short time-frame to complete them.",
                "I really appreciated the pace of the course, as it really allowed students to process and practice information as they went along. In terms of weaknesses, I feel like some of the assignments felt like \"busy work\" and instructions were unclear at times.",
                "Strengths: Very eager professor to help students expand their knowledge\r\nWeakness: The class felt slightly disorganized at times when we'd jump from topic to topic and learn new tenses in between readings.",
                "This course has many opportunities for speaking in class, and the discussions in class make class very engaging. In addition, the variety of mediums in which we explore the language, from movies to a novel, makes learning very fun and interesting. That variety also gives the opportunity to learn about different cultures of Spanish-speaking countries, which is both interesting and important in my opinion for learning language. A weakness of the course was the asynchronous days, as the assignments were not as engaging as going to class. This can be improved by possibly decreasing the number of asynchronous days so not every week has an asynchronous day."

                "Yes. It is a very interesting way to develop linguistic skills & engage with Spanish culture. The thematic areas that we discussed throughout the semester were also extremely interesting.",
                "Yes this class is very fun and the learning method is different than other classes at Yale. Its a great class if youre interested in the Spanish language and cultures.",
                "I would recommend this course to satisfy the language requirement or if you have a general interest in improving at Spanish. The course will improve your Spanish skills without a doubt, but will also require some time. I found that it is pretty easy to get the grade that you want in the class as long as you keep up on the work since most assignments are writings and projects.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they're interested in improving their Spanish skills. The main reason I took Spanish is to fulfill a distributional requirement, and I feel like this class would be too much work for students in this situation. Although learning a new language is a very valuable skill, I'm not sure if this is a class I'd recommend to those who simply aren't as interested in languages. However, if someone genuinely wants to improve their fluency in Spanish, then I think this would be a good course to take.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning Spanish. I would advise that the workload can be a bit much to juggle sometimes because of the daily assignments.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course makes learning Spanish very fun and engaging, and the emphasis on speaking makes what is done class very applicable in the real-world."
