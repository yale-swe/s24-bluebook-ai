The class was discussion heavy, especially during the first half of the class. While I felt some conversations were important, I wish we had time to work with different modes of 3D modeling earlier in the semester as well, when we did not have access to the VR headsets. I really enjoyed the projects where we had to think about how to combine models to create a whole experience, but I felt this could've improved if we had some modeling abilities beforehand.",

On many occasions, we made decisions at the moment and took a while to start actually doing projects in the class. This is contributed to COVID and with many of us being around the world and not in the same place. A strength of the class was how flexible it was to foster your individual creativity, passion, and focus. YOu should definitely take this class if you already have a sense of self-improvement and growth, otherwise, you may not get much out of the class. The rewards of this class are all up to the student.",

Perhaps assign the final project at the start and ask us to design one or two components each week or so to keep us on track and testing out the Unity and gravity sketch features earlier on.",

The class can inspire you to continue learning about VR though, and you can learn the bulk of which you can learn on LinkedIn Learning.",
