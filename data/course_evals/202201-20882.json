                "I thought things were taught well and there were good resources to learn and review back on. The one thing was the exam practice solutions were never posted, I understand the tf's went over in their review session, I had lift during their Tuesday exams sessions for varsity athletics and couldn't attend making me unsure if I did practice right. Still did well on the exams though, just think in future keep same format and great teaching just post the practice solutions if people can't go to review session.",
                "The course material is very dense and wayyyy more quantitative than 163 (which may feel like whiplash at first). The lecture was usually full of conceptual explanations of the concepts as well as proofs for the important equations, but the Psets and tests are full of word problems and applying the knowledge. The tests were very difficult. PSets were also challenging and you definitely needed to work with the peer tutors to get them done, but the peer tutors were very helpful and easily accessible.",

                "This course delivered a lot of material in a short amount of time.  This course could be improved by providing clearer answer keys (especially for practice exams!) to allow students more problem based material to review before exams as the professor never does practice problems in class.",
                "I think a weakness of this course is how much time we spend deriving an equation instead of understanding how to use the equation.",
                "Strengths: amazing peer tutors\r\nWeaknesses: The teaching of this class was not very clear and easy to understand, and I thought the organization of the class was slightly confusing. I think the information that was taught in class did also not line up super well with what was tested.",
                "weakness: literally nothing you learn in lecture is what comes up on the psets or exams, so be sure to go to peer tutoring to learn the exam concepts. also, the achieve homework takes so long (2-5 hours/week) yet less than ten percent of it is relevant to psets or exams\r\nstrengths: the peer tutors",

Weaknesses: the achieve and practice exam problems often had nothing to do with what we learned in lecture, which made studying for exams somewhat difficult,",
                "Strengths of this course is definitely how representative the psets homework assignments are of the exam. The professor is very transparent about what to study for when it comes close to an exam. A weakness of this course is how sometimes the class felt a bit unorganized. A suggestion for this is probably to have set review times and such rather than finding them out the week of.",
                "Professor Wang was an amazing teacher, and the class was well formatted.",
                "The weakness of this class was both the lecture and the section. Lectures were not engaging or structured in a way that made sense. Sections were not well attended and did little more than go over the homework answers.",
                "Strengths: very thorough and new material that I hadn't previously learned about\r\nWeakness: very short exams that were difficult",
                "The PSETs are very difficult to do alone. This means that additional to discussion section and lecture you should allocate time to go to peer tutoring every week.",
                "I think the course is taught in a very predictable way that is easy to plan into schedules. I felt that some topics were a little more rushed than others.",
                "A great strength of this class is the organization of the curriculum. I felt as though I knew what information I was expected to learn throughout this course by adhering to textbook chapters and syllabus material. A weakness of this course is definitely the quality of lectures. I often felt uninspired to attend lectures because of the professor's indirect style of teaching.",
                "I feel like this course is a solid general chemistry class, but I think it tends to go into derivations a bit too much. You don't need to know the derivations of equations for exams, but it can become confusing in class especially if you're not math-inclined. Otherwise, the class is well-organized and well-taught.",
                "The class lectures were very theoretical and often derived the equations that we need for the problem sets or exams, but the knowledge needed to solve the problem sets on my own and the exams was not provided. I think that doing more example problems in class would have been helpful. Furthermore, the exams were 50 minutes and consisted of several very complicated and lengthy problems. The time available did not lead to successfully completed exams.",
                "The stuff taught in the class did not always help with the homework problem sets and the exams. Usually everything taught in class was qualitative and then everything on the homework was quantitative like calculations and we wouldn't know how to do them.",
                "This class involved a lot of difficult concepts that were not always taught thoroughly or clearly in class, but the textbook was an extremely helpful resource. The psets were much harder than the problems talked about in class.",
                "I found that this course and the tests were incredibly difficult. I completed every pset problem and battled through the achieves for hours, and then when we got to the tests I was unable to finish the questions. This is not like Professor Mayer's class where you get hit with an odd question and then have an extra hour to think about it. Here you get hit with an odd question and then have 10 minutes to come up with a solution. If you think that way go for it! I would have been better off in 165 even after 163.\r\n\r\nThe course itself was well taught. I didn't mesh as will with Professor Wang's teaching style as Professor Mayer's but he had meticulous powerpoints on canvas and offered a computational grounding for the chemistry that had been missing from my high school classes. I found that he taught me a new computational way of looking at the world that was quite valuable (kind of like Mayer does the big picture revelations). Make sure you remember you bonding/MO/ect stuff from 163 - its useful.",
                "I had a really hard time taking the exams.",
                "This course was disorganized and the lectures were not very helpful in being able to answer questions on the homework or tests. It was extremely disheartening that no matter how much I studied the material my grades stayed consistently around average, and so it was demotivating to study at all. The chemistry that we were being taught did not seem very relevant to chemistry we would be learning in the future, and questions we were being asked to solve were strange adaptations of the subjects we would cover in class.",
                "This course was taught in a very comprehensive way. There was a lot of opportunity to practice problems with the PSETs as well as the achieve homeworks. The lectures being recorded made it easy to revisit the material before exams.",
                "This class is just not well taught in my opinion. I wish the lectures lined up better with homework and tests so that we could have concepts reinforced and really walk away with understanding. Instead, it was always a first-time exposure to things it felt like. The class order also didn't have much rhyme or reason. Overall, did not enjoy it but I am glad for others that did.",
                "This course is adequately challenging, and it taught me a lot about improving my work ethic and study habits. However, I feel that the level of engagement in TFs' discussion sections and office hours was a bit disappointing. I found the peer tutors to be most helpful during this course."

                "No - to be honest I don't recommend the advanced gen chem sequence at all if you are a first-year. If you have taken AP Chem already, just take First-Year Orgo. It's probably the imposter syndrome making you feel like you're not smart enough for it, but you are. Or take the regular Gen Chem class, but this class is the level of work that is First-Year Orgo without the payoff of one less year of chemistry for premeds. It's not worth it. The class was fine, but I wouldn't take this over the other classes in the chem dept. for first years.",
                "I would recommend it since I thought it was interesting and a good class to learn general chemistry.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in chemistry. Although this class is more work than gen chem I, it is definitely more rewarding and interesting.",
                "I am neutral on this class. It was fine, it was hard, it was kinda what you expect when you think of an advanced level intro chem class. The professor was good, the material was good, it was all fine.",
                "If you are ready to put in more more work and develop a very mathematical way of approaching chemistry, something that takes adjustment, then I would really recommend this course. The exams are definitely very challenging and require you to think quickly on your feet, which is something you have to be prepared for.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in pursuing STEM. While the course material is difficult, the material is manageable if you go to lecture and attend peer tutoring.",
                "I would not.",
                "I would recommend this course because I would not recommend the advanced general chemistry sequence as a whole. If you want to gain a good background in general chemistry, take regular general chemistry. If you already know general chemistry, try to place into organic chemistry. Both advanced general chemistry courses taught information in confusing ways that is not applicable unless you want to be a chemistry major or take higher level chemistry courses.",
                "No. Do not take the advanced general chemistry course. It is nothing like the chemistry department advertises and if you take 163, you have to take 167. The chemistry DUS will not let you level down to the general chemistry sequence unless you fail 163. The \"smaller lecture\" advertisement is not even applicable because it is still a lecture (so no class time devoted to discussion and it is difficult to develop a relationship with the professor) and the general chemistry sequence has an equal Teaching Fellow to student ratio anyways.",
                "No don't take this it's not worth it. Plus so many kids chose the easy sequence so the class is small (bad curve). Talked to a lot of kids and they agree that an advanced sequence should be half the time, like one semester not two. Otherwise it's pointless. However, I will say I just stopped studying or showing up to lecture and I was fine. The stuff is hard but you only need to understand like 20% of it to do alright. At a point the material feels very familiar. I also was just very apathetic about this course so minimal effort, like I don't really know what I learned because everything I wrote on exams just felt like common sense.",
                "Eh",
                "If someone is just taking general chemistry to fulfill a requirement, it would be considerably less stress and work to simply take 165 instead of 167. 167 is interesting and you learn a lot, but it gives a lot more homework compared to 165. Unless the student is really interested in chemistry, it would be less stress to simply take 165, even though 167 is very interesting and the professor is very nice.",

It is also hard to take 163 and then drop to 165, which I think would be the ideal path. I think that that path should be more readily accesible to students.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are prepared for a greater workload and difficult to understand concepts. The course can be very rewarding if you have the time to put into it.",
                "No, I really wouldn't. Taking 165 I would have learned more chem than I did in 167 because I comprehended nothing due to the class organization, teaching style, and speed of the class. The math is also just ridiculous and concepts simply are just poorly explained and if you don't have time for tutoring like if you are an athlete in season, just don't take the class. The only enrichment comes from tutors, not even the TAs are that adept at teaching.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are truly passionate about the subject matter. Personally, I found this class to be very difficult at times. For people who are not too invested in chemistry, I would recommend CHEM 165 instead. Otherwise, this class teaches a lot of interesting material that may not necessarily be touched on in the other course, and it can be time-consuming, which is why it might not be suitable for other students. I truly liked the small size of the course, since that allowed for students and TFs to know each other and Professor Wang a bit better."
