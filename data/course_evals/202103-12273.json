                "Primarily, this class opened my eyes to a type of literature that I had previously been completely missing from my education. Professor Mitchell's selection in Harlem Renaissance texts, and the way he taught these textchronologically, was incredible in working to understand a remarkable era of literature history. Further, the research portion of this class, working to go into the Beinecke and extend our searches in ways we never could have imagined, was something I'll take from this class and apply to any future project I work on.",
                "I learned a great deal about the novels and short stories of the Harlem Renaissance. These works are of unbelievable artistic power and demand to be thoughtfully read and written about. Also for the final research paper, I spent a great deal of time in the archives of the Beinecke. I learned how to do original research and write about said evidence convincingly.",
                "You learn all about the Harlem Renaissance (how it stretches beyond just the 1920s and poetry and jazz). You read excellent authors and have great discussion in depth about the texts. You will also learn about archival research and the Beinecke.",
                "A deep dive into a selection of lesser known Harlem Renaissance works with a keen focus on writing style. I learned about the importance of publication history and the politics behind the term \"Harlem Renaissance\" and gained a necessary skepticism when approaching literary works at face value when they are often subversive in nature.",
                "I really felt like a graduate student in this class. My classmates and I engaged with fictional novels assigned to us, but we all went further into the context of these books by visiting the archives at Yale and other sources online. We paid close attention to the way these authors construct a story, which I would expect from an English class, but we also spoke a lot about the historical context behind the writing. That extra step really made this class feel like a history class, English class, and personal research seminar. I learned to look at books, their purpose, historical context, audience, language, form, function, and more, more deeply than I thought I could. Finally, I felt like my final paper for this class was one of the best things I have ever written. I was so engaged in the class that I found myself in the Beinecke on multiple occasions, and I found myself grabbing dinner / coffee with my classmates just to talk more about the material. I wish all Yale classes were this cool."

            "comments": [
                "This course is incredible in its syllabus, and the angle through which we look at how these texts communicate. The weekly annotation assignments are not too demanding and still force you to dive deeper into the text than a standard reading response would. Paper format is standard for English Senior Seminars, as is much of class discussion. Professor Mitchell gave one of the most unbelievable introductions to a class I've ever had, and quite frankly, the only weakness in the class was that he stepped too far back in many of our discussions, as all I wanted to do was hear more of what he had to say.",
                "The selection of reading for this course were wonderful and I appreciated the time devoted to each text. I do think more texts could be added to the syllabus. I also would have appreciated some more hands on guiding of discussion during seminar, as they sometimes went a bit off the rails.",
                "The course is shaped around finding subtleties in the text that are personally interesting, challenging, or confusing. As a result, the course structure and Prof. Mitchell both facilitate learning unique to the individual and their own interests. The content itself is also a strength. There was a balanced and diverse selection of readings in terms of difficulty, length, and subject matter, and Prof. Mitchell's approach to the discussion seminar allowed for satisfying and interesting conversation. The final research project was a challenging but necessary culmination of the work we had done throughout the semester, and I left the course happy with the ideas and questions I generated and attempted to answer.",
                "This class was really well designed. Each week, we had small annotation assignments, which maybe were a little tedious, but I am so glad we didnt have larger assignments/ papers throughout the term. Some classes at Yale require so much writing, it leaves little time for reading. This class encouraged us to read, digest, think, talk, take notes, over and over again, before writing and taking a stance. With a specific time period such as the Harlem Lit. Movement, I think it takes at least a full semester to get a decent grasp of the filed. Small annotations kept us on track for class discussions; the final paper seemed, at first, daunting, but we were ready for it by the last quarter of the semester. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to see this class meet in the Beinecke more. The final essay almost necessitates Beinecke resourcesmeeting there as a class could ease students better into the research process, especially sophomores. For example, on the week we read Langston Hughes, it would have been cool to go the Beinecke that week and have a room full of Hughes papers to view. Then we could have asked librarians/ curators specific questions to help our writing process."

                "Absolutely. This is some of the best literature I've ever read, and some of the best class discussions I've ever had, only paling in comparison to discussions with Professor Mitchell in his office hours. Anyone interested in literature, in race and its impact on America, or who just wants to see a side of the cannon often left out of education settings, needs to take this class.",
                "Yes, the professor is very passionate about his work, and it shows in the well crafted assignments.",
                "I highly recommend this course. Professor Mitchell is a brilliant kind person and the material is divine.",
                "Yes! This is an awesome course with an amazing syllabus of Black authors (refreshing considering the largely white/western canon of the English department). The texts are great and prompt great discussion. It is a very humane workload -- the text is what matters above all, so you spend a lot of time on each book.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in reading some excellent and often forgotten Renaissance works and anyone who enjoys the process of writing and archival research. Prof. Mitchell makes the content accessible, so even if you aren't an English major, as long as you have an interest, I recommend this course.",
                "Yes! The books are sooo good. I will keep these books on my shelf for fun re-reading in the summer. The conversations in class were so mature and insightful. Favorite class this semester for sure."
