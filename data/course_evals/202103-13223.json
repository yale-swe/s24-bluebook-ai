                "The teachers were amazing! The way this class was taught was very engaging and having the opportunity to go to tables was great extra practice. The service projects were also a highlight that allowed us to get engaged with the Deaf culture a lot more deeply, which I am not sure we would have as much without the project. That is something very special about this program",
                "I personally would have liked for it to be at a faster pace.",
                "Having asynchronous class on Fridays to allow us time to work on our service projects and participate in other Deaf community events really enriched my learning. It also lessened the pressure that is often associated with language courses and made it more fun and easier for me to engage with the material. One weakness of this course is the fact that the homework is more of a suggestion since it is never graded or checked for completion. As an upperclassmen, I appreciated this and already know how to manage my time and hold myself accountable, but I know that first-years and sophomores may struggle more with that and lose that aspect of learning \/ practice."

                "Absolutely!! I think this language course really encourages learning and immersion in the culture unlike some other language courses. I didn't feel pressure or anxiety like I have with my other language course in the past and this helped me feel more comfortable practicing and signing in class."
