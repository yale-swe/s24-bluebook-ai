The analysis of foodways is quite valuable, and each region is touched on lightly, with room for independent exploration of any region in the independent papers. Just as well, the latter half of the term delves into \"food\" topics as food intersects with migration, race, gender, class, globalization, etc. I think that students quite literally get a \"taste\" of different areas of history, so, beyond the information about foodways and the historical information on different areas, I think the biggest skill gained was a greater certainty in what areas of history interest me.",

                "easy and fun course :)",
                "Strengths: Professor Freedman is the most compelling lecturer I have come across at Yale so far. He is incredibly knowledgable and very funny. The information he provides is both relevant and entertaining, and his relaxed lecturing style (more like a conversation with stories incorporated as opposed to just spitting out facts at us) was very effective and kept the class engaged, even in a large lecture format.",
                "This course was so engaging and interesting. I audited so did not do the discussion groups or papers, but I think they would have made the course even more enriching. The professor's lectures were by far my favorite lectures this semester. \r\n\r\nOne major improvement that I think should be made: we should do more eating as a class. I often found myself feeling very hungry during lectures.",
                "super interesting course i do wish the readings on the syllabus were specified better",

                "Nothing in particular, if anything maybe the list of books to buy was too long when only parts of the books were read.",
                "super fun lectures and readings!",
                "Strengths: I liked how each lecture discussed a very different topic, which made me excited to go to every lecture. I also found all of the readings to be very interesting and insightful, and I genuinely enjoyed discussing them in discussion section. Weakness: sometimes the lecture seemed to discuss what was discussed in the reading almost verbatim, which made the lecture a little redundant.",
                "The strengths is that the course covers good subjects. The weakness is that it is hard to know what information is actually important and that makes it hard to stay engaged. The grading on our essays also seemed very unreasonable at times and I felt as though I was marked down based on my graders opinions of an open-ended subject instead of how good my writing and argument actually were.",
                "Sounds",
                "This was an enjoyable survey course that dug into some really interesting questions about the development of different cuisines and the social, economic, and environmental implications of these developments.",
                "I liked the lectures but the slides were random and discombobulated",
                "I like the content, but I think the lectures could be improved by having more direct content on slides (like facts, etc) instead of just pictures and stories. It would also be helpful to be told how to write a history essay\/exam because as a non-history major I did not know how to go into the essays\/exams properly. The discussion section is the strongest part of the class!! Isin is the best and I learned the most during the class from her.",
                "This class is very, very true to its name and is a class purely about the history of food and cuisine. However, the lectures were often slow and not engaging, as they sometimes lacked compelling visual aids and there were not as many connections to the modern day.",

                "Strength: Very interesting content\r\nWeakness: Feels like a lack of continuity between units, but it didn't bother me much",
                "Lecture format was effective, but could have been more accessible with uploaded slides\/recordings. Lectures and readings somewhat disconnected, and weekly section is probably better off as optional. Midterm and final essay topics were flexible and fun!",
                "Sometimes wish that they could focus more on the cultural aspect of food, but to be fair, it is a survey course so its limitations are justified.",
                "All good",
                "sometimes lecture was hard to follow or didn't go in a logical order. i would have appreciated a bit more info on some of the slides. section was good. did not enjoy having to write a 500 word reading response to make up for absences that i could not avoid (covid, etc.)",
                "The course was strong in terms of grouping material and organizing lectures, but the material covered in each class felt slightly more example based than explanatory. It could potentially be helpful to cover more of the rationale behind certain choices or patterns in addition to saying what they were.",
                "I think this course is great!",
                "I enjoyed the lectures and the section with TA. I would say that maybe finding some way to evaluate students' learning on subjects covered after the midterm could improve engagement with the course.",
                "I loved the weekly lecture and discussion section format. The lectures were extremely interesting, the readings always enjoyable and section helpful in bringing together lecture and reading. It would be nice to have slides during lecture, or some way of structuring the lecture for my notes and for better understanding what the key takeaways were. I also wish we had been given more support for the final paper.",

I also thought that the latter half of the course (which talked about American foodways and cultures) was quite personally relevant and further elaborated and elucidated American foodways throughout its history.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly think Professor Freedman should just skip talking about food cultures worldwide, and just focus on one. They're all quite interesting, but we blazed past India and China and different African regions, and I think those deserved greater attention.",
                "Weaknesses: Readings were at times long and boring\r\n\r\nStrengths: interesting course material, readings and lectures were closely tied",

Also the first guest lecture we had was super interesting and had a cool interview\/podcast style.\r\nWeakness: I felt like the essays and exams were not always graded equally in that some TFs graded harsher than others.",

A truly fun class that anyone can get something out of. I will say, however, how much you get out of this class is exactly proportional to how much you put in. It helps so, so much if you are already interested in and passionate about food and food history, but how could you not like food.",
