Professor Campbell is a very nice and accommodating professor as well, so I would take it if you get the chance to. She gives lots of feedback on your writing and meets with you often throughout the semester. Should be noted though that after the initial few weeks of class, the workload did feel like a constant cycle of turning in drafts\/papers which became overwhelming at times.",

                "A lot of reading as well as frequent papers. Class discussions often felt forced. The professor also spent a lot of time talking rather than listening.\r\n\r\nFeedback was very helpful though and I felt that my writing improved.",
