                "This is one of the coolest courses at Yale! A less-sexy title might be \"History of Earth and Environmental Sciences,\" but it's so much more than that. You'll explore how science is intricately entangled with systems of capitalism, politics, and religion; questions about human and natural agency; conservation, preservation, sustainability, and management of resources; environmentalism versus economics; the roots of human ecology; science as socially constructed (and deconstructed); the role of consensus and public opinion; and much more. This has perhaps been the course that has most often made me rethink what I previously understood about the world.",

                "Professor Rankin approaches topics like science, religion, politics, environmentalism, etc. in a very different way compared to other classes here at Yale and demonstrates how largely this topics all intersect with each other. The way he approaches these topics really makes you think about each of these topics really function in your everyday life and really shape the way you may approach these kinds of topics now and in the future.",
                "I learned about the history of debates surrounding global catastrophes, centered around whether catastrophes exist and how we should deal with them. I learned about the relationship between science and religion, and science and government and economics. I also learned about a bunch of cool historical moments I'd never learn about anywhere else, like the age of the earth debates and the history of plate tectonics.",

                "hard to summarize what the class teaches you in a title or course description, it isn't just about climate change or just about geology or just about the oil crisis, it's about how and why we go about trying to answer scientific questions.",
                "You very quickly learn that this course was not worth taking because every unit is more or less a reiteration of obvious facts about science, backed by gratuitously long readings that are discussed in pointless sections. The minimal feedback you get is arbitrary and punitive.",
                "Interconnectedness of science, politics, economics\/capitalism, social movements. Stylistic history of several world catastrophes including peak oil, overfishing, climate change, ozone layer, etc. A greater than expected emphasis on geology, religion, more mundane topics than the course title might indicate. Heavily American\/European centric.",
                "You learn a lot about how to analyze the history of science and you come to understand that this history is not linear. We go into the \"cartoons\" and bedtime stories of science and the narrative that this class helps weave is very interesting.",

The midterm is equivalent of 3-4 pages single spaced, and the final is equivalent of 5-7 pages single spaced. Writing all of this in one sitting is incredibly difficult. Week to week, the workload is heavy for a lecture. It is as demanding, if not more demanding, than seminars. If you take the class credit d it may not be too bad, but thats a strong maybe. Also, the grading is confusing, so it isnt always clear why you get points off.",

I also learned about the importance of different world-views and how that impacts science. The title is a little misleading - you don't really learn about specific catastrophes themselves but rather like how they influenced science and their connection to other things and people.",

                "Strengths: Thoroughly organized for student learning and quite interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Few, but there is a LOT of material that is covered",
                "Sometimes Professor Rankin just kind of throws certain information at you in the lectures or readings before it becomes clear how the material is relevant or important to the overall course themes (though I assure you it is). I didn't mind this approach but it can be a bit unusual at times",
                "I liked that the lectures were posted over the weekend so that I could watch them ahead of time.",
                "strength: prof rankin!",
                "Strengths: interesting material that is easy to follow, professor is very knowledgeable.\r\nWeaknesses: grade is based on a few major assignments, if you miss section you cannot attend another and must write a paper instead.",
                "Professor Rankin is the course's biggest strength, he's an amazing lecturer and just a great guy. The syllabus is well thought-out and engaging. Everyone, no matter how much experience you have, can get something out of this course. There's no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths- pre-recorded lectures were actually really engaging, and powerpoint slides were effective in conveying information\r\nWeaknesses- too many weekly readings, a lot of which were intended to be skimmed because of the sheer repetitiveness of the content",
                "My biggest issue with this course is that there are too many readings and not enough guidance or emphasis on which ones should be prioritized. Realistically, nobody is doing all the readings every week and thankfully my TA ended up letting us summarize one each week for our section and we would share our summaries with each other. Also the midterm and final were just ridiculous in length. They took around 4 hours and 7 hours to complete, and this would not have been the case if this was an in-person course. The TAs seemed really unorganized and there was no rubric for how our essays or exams were graded, so if you asked for clarification on why you lost points, it was hard to pinpoint the exact reason. This made grading super subjective and heavily dependent on who your TA was.",
                "A well-constructed syllabus, although the material seems to only fall into place at the end of each unit and at the end of the course.",
                "weakness - doesnt explain well how the readings are connected to broader themes of the course",
                "perfect. great readings that are mostly optional. cool and creative exam questions that make you think critically about what you are learning. op ed assignments are a bit tedious to do because your mainly parroting back what the class has but the grading is chill so they're fine i guess.",
                "Frankly, this class was just terrible. For one thing, every main takeaway in the syllabus was basically obvious and boiled down to some version of \"science is really complicated and nuanced.\" That's a good thing to keep in mind, I guess, but is it really necessary to read hundreds and hundreds of pages of detailed evidence for it? Does it necessitate an entire class? I think not. But it might still have been tolerable if the units didn't bounce back and forth in time seemingly arbitrarily, or if the professor and TFs had been accommodating about Covid rather than punitive, or if the lecture slides were formatted to be at all engaging. Of course, none of this was the case, and so the course was an irredeemably miserable experience.",
                "The concepts were not as exciting as I had expected, and we ended up studying a lot of dead white men. I learned some of the core themes from the course but wasn't able to muster the energy to engage much further.",
                "The course definitely posed some interesting questions and the assignments were not very time-consuming. One thing I wish we did more of was explicitly drawing ties between the different units and topics. We definitely did do some of that, but when I was studying for the final, I found it a bit overwhelming to try and create a flowchart of ideas and events on my own.",

The recorded lectures were very useful for time management purposes. Weakness is the readings - they are very long and dense - but you can usually get away without reading them fully (as long as you get the general ideas).",

The professor is engaging and the assignments are manageable.\r\nweaknesses: readings are very long and impossible to finish some weeks. section felt very unnecessary most weeks. \r\nGrading was harsh at times and it seemed like expectations were unreasonable. We were expected write Op-Eds without any explanation of how but then were graded on specific things that weren't communicated as expectations. TAs also couldn't give good explanations for why you lost points on the midterm it just seemed like if you didn't include every possible thing relevant to the question from the course you wouldn't get full points but the word count was so limited that that was impossible.",

Also, the content is relevant to today's climate crisis and understanding why it has become so polarized. Many of the readings in the course were relevant in revealing the themes of the course, however, some of the books and book chapters that we had to read throughout the semester were excessive and their content was extraneous for the score of the class. Additionally, the readings concerning climate change could be updated to include more recent literature on the topic.",

Although the course focuses more on the history of epistemology, it provides great lessons that can be applied to understand the production of knowledge in other fields as well.",
                "no",
                "took it as a requirement and was very pleasantly surprised by how engaging it was. very interesting and wide range of topics discussed in the course. informed how i will think about science, public policy, objectivity, and history moving forward.  easy grading. doing readings unnecessary to do well in the course but I do plan on going back to read some of them. one of the most intellectually stimulating courses i have taken because the professor uses evidence from a wide variety of disciplines across periods of time to make cohesive narratives about the inherent limitations of 'doing science' and how science interacts with capitalism, industry, social structures, bureaucracy, etc.",
                "ABSOLUTELY NOT. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. The professor and TFs are rigid and condescending, and the grading is harsh; exams are absurdly long (6 hours for the midterm and 12 hours for the final, and both took the entire time window despite ostensibly having been designed to take much less). Moreover, the course material is poorly organized and most of it is frankly a soap opera of minor characters with the broad takeaway always being some form of \"it's more complicated than ya think.\" For instance, science and religion haven't always been diametrically opposed because religious inquiry has historically sometimes been a route to scientific inquiry. Science and business aren't necessarily opposed either, but nor are they perfectly collaborative. Etc etc etc. In other words, the creation of scientific knowledge isn't always as straightforward as you'd think, and it's important to keep this in mind. Got it? Great! Now you've gotten the main idea of this course, and you don't need to take it unless you're really keen on reading hundreds of pages about arguments between townspeople and local officials in 19th century Washington state about how to manage their salmon fisheries; or the lengthy history of two professors' survey work--along with simply riveting descriptions of rock formation shapes and the full texts of several long, personal notes to their friends--in various parts of California throughout the mid-1800s. The fact that I can recall these details speaks to how important remembering them is to getting a good grade in section, despite their clear irrelevance to, well, just about anything. This class is BAD and I am WORSE OFF for taking it. Do yourself a favor and don't repeat my mistake.",
                "As a STEM major, I took this class as a Hu gut. It was not that interesting, and the workload was larger than expected, so I would not recommend it as a gut to someone else. If you are interested in the history of science this is a good course though.",
                "This is a good course if you're interested in learning about how scientific thought and consensus have been reached over time through the specific lens of global catastrophes.",
                "Yes, if interested in humanities or world problems",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is seeking a better understanding of the history of science especially as it relates to climate history.",
                "I think the circumstances of the class this year made it so I would not recommend. Although live virtual section did help, the recorded lectures were tough to watch since the material was so conceptual. I would need more interaction to more deeply learn the material.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in environmental topics and if you want to be critical of what is science and how it interacts with government, business, and religion.",
                "Understand that this is a history of earth science class. You learn about the history of geology, ecology, darwinism, fossils, etc; you learn about which scientist created which scientific theory, who debated with who, and how applicable their understandings are to today. Going into the course, I dont think I fully understood what it meant for this to be a history of earth science class, so please make sure you understand what that would look like from week to week. I thought the class would focus mostly on climate change, but it discusses climate change for about 2 weeks of the semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the environment and the history of science but this is definitely not an easy class. The topics are really interesting, engaging, and relevant to the present. However, readings are pretty long, sometimes multiple book chapters a week plus articles. Grading is also pretty harsh it almost seems like the expectations for a good great aren't actually attainable. They look for certain things when grading that aren't communicated well before hand and even when that is acknowledged you still have to deal with the grade you get even if it isn't your fault.",
                "Yes! Absolutely take this course - it will change your worldview and give you a much more nuanced perspective on the current debate around climate change.",
                "I would recommend this course to any of my peers interested in history, epistemology, or environmental science.",
                "Yes, if global catastrophes interest you.",
                "Definitely. The course has you thinking differently and makes you reassess how you view the world. While the course title is misleading, as it is less of an assessment of historical catastrophes and more of how we think of science, and further, catastrophes, Professor Rankin builds upon themes of science, paradigm shifts, and how we need to look further into ideas and history to understand how we view the world today -- each week was different and engaging, even with a Zoom and asynchronous structure.",
                "It depends. The title seems very interesting but sometimes does not reflect the course. I wish slides were more clear rather than having just big keywords. Also, this a course that focuses on the history of science. There are some small historical details and figures that do not seem directly relevant to catastrophe.",
                "Interesting content, lots of reading",
                "If it sounds interesting, go for it. I would say that some of the assignments are kinda tricky. For instance, they ask for a lot in the op-eds given that they are limited to a single page. So, don't take it thinking that it is a gut.",
                "Yes! The lectures are actually interesting and easy to follow; the professor focuses not on the remote memorization of facts but continuities in how science was perceived and used by different parties over time to make sense of catastrophes. This is a great lecture class to take in the HSHM department\/major, and is a refreshing change of pace from the department's focus on histories of medicine\/health.",
                "Anyone seriously interested in the history of environmental and climate change studies should take this course.",
                "Yes. For students who are interested in learning more about the nuances of scientific debates and the ways that politics\/economic\/religion plays into these issues. For people who are also interested in climate science and the politics of climate change, this course provides a very interesting lens to look at these politicized topics.",
                "Yes! This course is helpful for navigating a polarized scientific\/political climate."
