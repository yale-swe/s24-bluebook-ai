    "I really enjoyed the content of this course and how broad of a scope we had when looking at the different aspects of museums. I think the most important thing is to have an interest in the subject and the readings will be more engaging for you.\r\nThe one downside I had was that the majority of students in the already small class weren't as enthused about the subject as the remaining were and made it rough when nobody was willing to participate. But even then, the few that actually did the readings and enjoyed the subject managed to make the discussions very engaging."
