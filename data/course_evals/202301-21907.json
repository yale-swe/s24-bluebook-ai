                "Strengths: class is well-organized so the material connects to previous weeks. the guest speakers were super interesting insights into industry applications of IP law. Cece is super kind and is a Yale alum so understands the Yale student experience. \r\nWeaknesses: The grading is really stressful; very hard to tell where you land. Way too many reading response requirements (and they are like 4-5 pages every other week, which is a lot given that we don't get a WR credit). I think most students did all the readings b/c they were fascinating.",
                "Strengths: covers unique and very interesting topics. Instructor also teaches the course in a way that is engaging for students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: assignment guidelines and grading were sometimes unclear.",
                "Great discussions, just very interesting. The response papers were bit much, and it would have been better if the professor was the one grading it?",
                "Best class ive ever taken",
                "S: Great readings and lectures!\r\nW: Wish more people could take it!",
                "Prof. Xie was the strength of this course. She knew which topics of intellectual property law would be engaging to her students, and made a point to include them in her syllabus and class lectures. For instance, the case of Aqua's \"Barbie Girl\" or Bikram Yoga. The only weakness would be that I would have appreciated a bit more frontloaded guidance on how to write a reading response. I had to attend office hours multiple times to figure it out and was only able to see my progress after getting several less-than-ideal grades.",
                "Interesting topics, and lots of reading and writing (but hopefully very rewarding in the end).",
                "the course was well taught and the instructor was really nice. the guest speakers that the instructor brought to class were also a fairly enjoyable experience, however i felt that the final project was too open ended and could have been more structured if more guidelines were provided.",
                "Very chill course with a great teacher. Only real weakness I had with it wasn't so much anything with the course structure but that the field of copyright law and the rules around it seem to be sometimes based more on \"vibes\" than strong consistent logic. Wish the grading would be clearer about how to improve. Additionally I wish there was more clarity in terms of the structure and expectations of reading responses at the beginning."

I wish there could have been 5 required reading responses instead of 6 (maybe an optional 6th). The grading was a bit tough on the reading responses too. Very interesting discussions though, and certainly gauges whether you're interested in the law or not.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in law!",
                "Yes! Taking this course has shown me that IP law is a lot more complex than I initially assumed, and I spent more time thinking about why the laws are written in the way they are to begin with.",
                "Yes! Cece is great!",
                "100% yes, learned a lot.",
                "Yes this course made me want to be a lawyer",
                "Yes, you learn a lot in class and very little assignments.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone, not just students who are interested in law! Intellectual property is a hot topic, and quite interesting generally.",
                "Yes, the classes are extremely fun and interactive, you learn a ton about intellectual property. The workload is high if you do all the reading and bi-weekly writing assignments, which are 3-4 pages each. Expect writing 6 of such reading responses, and one final essay of 10 pages (or do a final project). The problem with assignment grading was that it is separately graded by a TA, who was really kind, but extremely rigorous grader, and even when I took careful approach to my next reading response based on her feedback, and worked extremely hard, I still got not amazing grades. In the end, however, you can (hopefully) improve your grade a lot by a little curve and 20% attendance, as well as 40% for the final project.",
                "yes if they are interested in intellectual property law or are willing to take a slightly challenging humanities credit then they will enjoy this class",
                "Yes! It is a very good course. Can be quite a bit of writing at times but its flexible."
