The class taught us about investment strategy and about life preparation -- each class had a different guest speaker from a different fund who was able to talk to us about their experiences, theses, and how they think about a lot of the concept we were discussing in class.",

I came out of this course with a much more solid understanding of VC in emerging markets and a clearer idea of how I wish to structure my career in the near future.",

                "The strengths of this course were absolutely the readings assigned and the guest speakers that came each week to talk about their experiences in relation to the topics at hand. We learned a ton about not only different fund strategies, but also about how they thought about the topics we were discussing in class. There were debates during class discussions, which were great to push our thinking outside what we might have originally thought when we were doing the assigned readings. The course could have been improved by actually applying a lot of what we were talking about and learning to an actual case -- some kind of investment analysis on a company of choice (or assigned) to see how we could think critically in an investment scenario.",
                "Strengths: everything. Ishan was helpful, brilliant, caring, and welcoming. He designed an incredible syllabus and brought in amazing guest speakers.\r\nWeaknesses: n\/a",
                "I wish there was more asynchronous work! Seminar was easily dominated by the same voices with little time to counteract\/anticipate the flow of conversations. Making reading responses visible to the entire class and encouraging student engagement with written work + submitting questions before each session would have made the seminar a lot better",
                "Strengths: I think the Q&A nature of the course is its biggest strength. Being able to ask Ishan anything and everything about his investments, his experiences, his thoughts on industry trends was an amazing experience. Also, being able to interact with so many guest speakers (who were all amazing--world-class VCs and C-suite of unicorns) was awesome. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NONE! Couldn't have enjoyed the course more.",
                "Strengths: really interesting class, Ishan is super knowledgeable and facilitated conversation, great guest speakers",
                "I particularly enjoyed that this course had a variety of phenomenal speakers who could share real world insights which were pertinent what we were learning",
                "Ishan is an amazing professor with deep insights on VC. He has a vast network of investors and entrepreneurs to choose as guest lecturers. The course was one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
                "Amazing guest speakers on a weekly basis",
                "Would enjoy even more technical assignments and course content",
                "Nothing. Ishan should continue to be a professor here. Yale needs to bring him back.",
                "Strengths: Ishan is a super engaging instructor! He responds to all of our questions with genuine answers and opinions. I loved the fact that we got to speak to SO many young individuals who are in VC or starting their own companies. I also loved the selection of books we were assigned to read. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not something feasible this year, but the only thing I hope this seminar can change is to be in person.",
                "Strengths: very informal discussion that made the class feel more like a chat than an awkward putting your hand up for the sake of participating class, very supportive, understanding, and engaged professor, incredible guest speakers, relevant readings and assignments\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I would have for the class would be for the guest speaker sessions to be more structured - perhaps with students coming prepared with a small assignment to talk about with the guest speaker rather than asking questions that end up going in many different directions and that are not always linear.",
                "Strengths: the focus on emerging markets is really interesting and quite different from within the US. Fund strategies and structures are also evolving, and founders need to take quite a different approach in overseas markets. The guest speakers were great: hearing directly from investors and operators is incredibly valuable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course is by necessity quite broad, although you get a chance to dive into a specific topic with the paper. We went deep on a few verticals like emerging markets fintech and within a few markets, but I sometimes wished for a more in-depth case study and discussion."

Each week, a different guest speaker from a different VC firm would join us to give their thoughts on the topics we were discussing\/had read for that class and we were able to ask questions about their experiences and background. It was an open forum discussion and then the class would continue the discussion after their left and we would debate out the topics at hand. It was awesome.

You walk away with a comprehensive overview of VC, a general understanding of how EM investing differs from Americas\/Europe investing, and most importantly, a clearer blueprint of how you want to structure your career. Ishan and all the guest speakers are super approachable and available to chat outside of class. I took this course with a 12 hour time zone difference at 3 AM my time, and it was absolutely worth it.",
