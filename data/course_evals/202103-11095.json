                "I gained knowledge on how to work with basic electrical circuitry (breadboard), Raspberry pi, microcontrollers, arduino code, Processing, how to build creative embedded systems and what they are in general. Also learned how to be more creative and make cool ideas come true.",
                "I learned a lot about applying all of the technical skills I've learned through the CS department in a creative way. This was the first projects-based class I had taken here, and it was really nice to get open-ended prompts that gave us the opportunity to create really whatever we wanted.\r\n\r\nIn a more objective sense, this was a really nice class to get hands-on experience at the CEID so that I felt much more comfortable using the tools there. I also learned Processing, Arduino, SuperCollider, and how to use a Raspberry Pi.",
                "I learned how to make an embedded system using an ESP32/Raspberry Pi and basic inputs and outputs. I learned how to design creative systems and build effective enclosures.",
                "I learned how to realize concrete systems from abstract ideas, going from \"I'm kind of interested in xyz\" to showing off a complete artistic project inspired by that idea just a week or two later. Quick turnaround times were actually helpful-- you learn to act on creative impulses instead of just sitting on ideas. It develops your confidence. I got familiar with: Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Arduino IDE, Processing, a little SuperCollider. Quite a bit of programming in Python. Got to make some exciting wired and wireless projects with different sensing methods. I became very fast at writing documentation and ended up with several cool projects for the portfolio. Also acquired CEID skills (laser cutting! power tools! etc) which seemed intimidating before, but it feels easy to pick up new skills when you have classmates to learn with and from. Basically I knew nothing about hardware before this class, and now I'm pretty sure I could carry out an embedded systems project on my own in the future.",
                "By taking this course, I learned so much about both the creative and technical side of embedded systems, with a specific focus on DIY arts and electronics projects. In particular, this course includes modules on generative art and large-scale visual installations, interactive devices via various physical inputs, installation art with sensors and wireless protocols, kinetic sculpture and motors, and distributed mesh networks. These modules included everything from coding visuals in Processing to configuring SSH on Raspberry Pis to creating a large-scale experiential exhibition using a mesh network. By completing an open-ended individual or group project for each module, I learned a lot about design and construction techniques, with ample opportunities to experiment with anything available in the CEID or OMI lab. Moreover, I developed so many soft skills by teaching myself new programming languages and techniques, designing artistic projects, researching technical solutions, debugging electronics, and brainstorming and working alongside my peers. Ultimately, I learned that it is possible to create practically anything you can imagine using hobby electronics, and this course gives you the freedom to learn whatever subset of this knowledge you need to realize your ideas."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: You are allowed to pursue your passions and you will be surrounded by peers who are just as passionate as you are. The course genuinely gives you skills that are useful and teaches you how to be self-initiative. You get to see a ton of cool projects and make a ton of cool things. It combines STEM and creativity!! How rare is that at Yale? I wish there were more courses like this because it's what I'm genuinely interested in.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a lot of work, even with a more reduced curriculum compared to the last time it was taught. I understand why everything is there though but everyone faced burnout. I think more required pair-based projects would reduce workload! I think everyone was hesitant to work with others even though it was an option and over a certain number teamwork becomes hard so pairs are good. Sometimes it was too self-directed and I felt I wasn't able to utilize all the info thrown during lecture at us. For example, I would have loved a demo on how to use a voltage regulator or a battery charger. It got too engineering-focused at times.",
                "The strengths of the class are that it's super open-ended so that you can really make it what you want. I learned a lot about outlining a project for myself and self-critiquing to make sure it would get done on time. This was also a bit of a weakness, since it was sometimes unclear how we might be graded artistically on a project.\r\n\r\nThe class also involved a lot of self-teaching, so I wish the lectures might apply more to the work that was assigned.",
                "The biggest strength was the small size of the class and the resulting interactions with classmates. It was great to see the projects that everyone else came up with, and get high quality feedback and help brainstorming for my own ideas. It really felt like we were all there to help each other and learn from each other, and we bonded over many late nights in the CEID. The group project was one of the highlights of this class, as we all put our heads together to come up with an immersive experience and used each of our unique strengths to accomplish it. One of the biggest weaknesses was that I didn't feel like I got much useful information from the lectures, which were very long. Most of the things I learned in this class, I learned on my own by looking things up and by trial and error. The labs were helpful in promoting this, but it seemed like lecture time could have been better spent or made shorter to match a normal class period, as many of the concepts we covered never came up again and/or weren't relevant to the things we were trying to build. Also, while our projects were all judged on how \"creative\" they were, we weren't given a clear understanding of what this meant or how we could improve in this area. While my hands-on skills greatly improved in this class, I don't know if my ability to think creatively has improved in the same way.",
                "It was amazing just how many tools we covered in one semester! It was super exciting to have so much freedom in our projects, save for the specific technologies that we had to include. Presentation days were really fun; I loved getting to see what everyone else had made. Towards the end, people were making hamster ball robots, music synthesizers/remixers (idk the exact term), educational, light-up plushies, and interactive generative art systems. Just so much fun to see. \r\n\r\nDespite the frequency of deliverables, this class was honestly not that stressful b/c Scott is a chill and capable teacher. Lab sessions were a great opportunity to learn from classmates-- the pair programming aspect was really helpful, esp. as someone coming in w/ no experience working with a Pi, the Arduino IDE, or hardware in general.\r\n\r\nI wish we could have gone deeper with looking at examples of work by established artists in lecture. Maybe some close analysis could be helpful-- it felt like we sort of breezed by most of the examples. Would have loved to have more inspiration for our projects. \r\n\r\nThe first task of the first module was lowkey the hardest part of the class, b/c of the weird limitations on the Leeds computer (why isn't python installed?) I'm not sure if that's meant to be a feature of the assignment rather than a bug, but it almost convinced me to drop the class back then... Wondering if there's a way to ease students into the task with hints (maybe a few days into the task) as to what the pitfalls are for working on that particular computer. The rest of the class was nowhere near as painful.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the students who have never done circuit stuff, maybe emphasize that resistors can burn up if you don't choose the right level. In Module 3, my project started smoking from the inside, and it took me way too long to realize why.",
                "The greatest strengths of this course were the overall structure and module design, the open-ended projects, the flexible deadlines and reasonable grading, and the great atmosphere for learning and working together. The course builds on itself in a really awesome way, moving through a variety of electronics techniques that you can continue to use in later projects after mastering them earlier on. But by focusing on one specific component or technique in each module, you can really dive into it; furthermore, this provides good direction for what would be an otherwise daunting set of possible project ideas. As a result, the projects have the perfect amount of open-endedness, with clear direction from the required technologies but complete freedom in terms of how you use those technologies to make something creative. This made it super fulfilling to complete each assignment, and by the end of the course I had a portfolio of exciting electronics/art projects to show off. While these projects could be extremely time consuming because of their self-directed nature, the deadlines were generally quite flexible, and the professor was very amenable if you needed a bit of extra time to finish up your work. The grading was also quite reasonable and generous, with consistent criteria across a great variety of projects. But most of all, I really enjoyed the collective experience of creating and sharing our projects as a class, and the many late nights together at the CEID and the OMI lab are what Ill remember most. Despite these strengths, there were still weaknesses from the time crunch of so many large projects in such a short semester and a sometimes frustrating lack of electronics review in class. The time requirement of this course is quite high, with the possibility to explode at any given time if a project idea or implementation gets out of hand. While properly scoping the projects helps a lot, it would be nice to have a bit more time for each project, rather than rushing through 7+ projects throughout the short semester. One thing that sometimes exacerbated the time commitment was limited discussion and instruction about the required electronics components in class, e.g. batteries or motors. It was good to do so much self-directed learning, but going over fundamental component operation and tolerances would make the course smoother for everyone. Something that could help significantly with both these issues would be changing the first tasks of each module such that they are about getting the required components working at a basic level, rather than implementing anything more complicated (e.g. getting joystick readings rather than demonstrating its functionality via some program). Moreover, instead of using lab classes to present our work, it would be better to present exclusively on discussion days (maybe the day they are due so we can actually share operating projects), allowing more lab time for the aforementioned component/technical instruction."

However, there is no other course like this at Yale and it's so fun despite how far it pushes you. You will feel actual satisfaction in what you make. I wish there were more courses like this. Especially if you are CPAR, this course is made for you!!",
                "I would! Just be prepared to teach yourself a lot of new skills, but this is a valuable trait to have anyways in the CS industry. It is a ton of work (not as bad as 323 by any means!) but definitely reduced since the last time it was taught. The last month of the class is definitely the toughest workload-wise, but is pretty manageable throughout the semester otherwise.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use your CS skills in a way that is so fundamentally different than how you use them in truly any other CS class at Yale, definitely take this class! It's really light in terms of coding, but you learn a ton and it's fun!",
                "I would recommend this class if you are genuinely interested in brainstorming and building creative systems and want to invest a significant amount of time in it. I think that most of what you learn by enrolling in this course is self-taught outside of class in the time that you spend building and debugging your projects, so make sure you are prepared for that and ready to put in the work. If you already have a creative mind (I don't think that's something you can learn from this course) and love building things, this course will give you the space to do so. The best part of the course is interacting with peers who have similar goals, so definitely take advantage of that.",
                "Yes! There's no other class like it at Yale. If you are interested in both art and technology, this was made for you!! When I was considering taking this class, a former student told me that it completely changed his art practice. I think it's done the same for me. You'll create a substantial portfolio, and get to show off your work + see what your classmates invent! Hopefully it's the same in future years-- but we would all run into each other at the CEID/AKW in the days before any due date, and we'd just hang out and give each other feedback. Pretty fun. \r\n\r\nPreviously this course was rated as having a super high workload, but the experience isn't really comparable with other high workload classes in the department. When you're working on a creative project you care about, it just... happens. It's work that you'll look back on and feel happy about. If the syllabus interests you, don't let the rating stop you.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in creative DIY electronics with a significant amount of time and patience for experimentation and self-learning. It is the perfect course for anyone who has felt constrained by the structure of traditional courses and their content and wants to use their creative side to build cool stuff with code and electronics. Even without much experience in electronics, embedded systems, or artistic projects, the course is very approachable and fun, and you can really focus on whatever aspect of the field you find interesting. However, you should definitely be prepared to work long hours on self-directed projects, and you have to enjoy learning things on the fly as you try to realize your ideas. This course definitely involves lots of frustration, but the payoff is more than worth it if you are willing to put in the work."
