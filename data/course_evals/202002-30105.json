   "comments": [
    "Basic understanding of philosophical and ethical theories that help guide moral values",
    "Background in many types of philosophical thinking and how to apply them to topical issues like animal rights, poverty alleviation, etc\r\nArgumentative skills in writing and discussion...evaluating what you and others take for granted, constructing a strong foundation for arguments",
    "The course pressed me to think about how one should live their life and what is the driving force behind our actions in life. The thought experiments we participated in and discussed also taught me a significant amount about how my classmates think and I learned a lot about the importance of differing perspectives.",
    "I learned the basics of moral philosophy such as, utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and deontology.",
    "I was able to learn much about different ethical frameworks which I can now refer to when making decisions. I also have a deeper grasp on morality as well as different perspectives of it.",
    "Definitely got a really broad overview of some of the major parts of ethics, such as utilitarian, kantianism, deontology, lying, animal rights, and their critiques of each.",
    "I learned how to make a solid argument. As someone who has already fulfilled writing credits, practicing forming an argument with solid counter arguments both in class and in my essays was a huge plus. I learned how to write effectively.",
    "I learned a lot about various different philosophies evaluating how to live a good life. It was really great to read about various new perspectives and understand my own beliefs on morality. Also sharpened my discussion\/debate skills through normal class discussions and my critical thinking skills during the reflection pieces.",
    "Philosophy, Writing Philosophical Papers, and debate skills",
    "I gain some new sights to analyze my old thoughts and stances. I have new perspective to look into the life",
    "Ethic knowledge that can apply to everyday life",
    "From the readings and discussions in class I learned how to think critically, and learn to have a substantive answer to the never-ending question \"why\". Further, I developed my skills in verbalizing my thoughts and debating a topic through conversations we had in class. Lastly, I learned how to write a in-depth philosophical paper based on my own thesis and thoughts on a topic."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the set up of the class where we had class discussions along with a lecture. We had many thought provoking discussions about the readings and lectures.",
    "Strengths: great balance of lecture, questions, discussions. relaxed discussion environment. fair workload and opportunity to engage as much as you'd like to with Austen and Mario. lots of feedback on reflections and papers\r\nWeaknesses: learning to write philosophy papers is difficult to learn quickly but given the time frame of this class, hard to improve this",
    "Sometimes the discussions were a bit dry, but, overall, the class was run very well. The readings were of manageable length and the professor keep the class interesting and engaging.",
    "Strengths: All the course subjects flowed into each other well, and the professor\/TA was def one of the major reasons why they flowed so well. Because of that, it was a really good intro course and didn't seem at all undecipherable (as I thought philosophy would be). The readings were also well chosen and was great at presenting the major parts of each philosophy tenet and their arguments. I also really liked how the course was structured, with lecture and plenty of discussion. The professor\/TA made themselves really available and understanding, especially if you are new to philosophy. There was plenty of office hours, which was great. \r\nWeaknesses: the short nature of YSS sessions (5 weeks) may make the readings and assignments feel a little rushed (but only if you have other summer commitments). Otherwise, it was pretty well balanced.",
    "Strengths-\r\nWeaknesses-Some of the breakout sessions were not",
    "Strengths: Professor was great at facilitating conversation, Professor and TA always made themselves available, enjoyed the leading a discussion requirement\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would recommend (for an online class) to have required discussion posts so that students can share their ideas outside of the discussion - could also give the Professor\/TA a better understanding of what the students want to get out of the days class",
    "Strengths: Interesting readings and content.\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough assignments to benchmark your learning",
    "I think the discussions are amazing. All of us play well in discussing and our instructors do well in leading us to different perspective and get us involved in the knowledge.",
    "not enough materials to preview and review\r\nmore learning materials can be provided",
    "One thing that could be improved is a sense of how the paper should be written, as it was a big part of our grade."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It was a great summer course and great for someone with no ethics background",
    "100%! This is a super useful introduction to philosophy and its many applications. I have already used the skills gained in this class to evaluate my own beliefs\/actions\/decisions and broader policy too.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It is probably my favorite course at Yale thus far. The material is very accessible to all types of students, incredibly interesting and thought provoking, and I learned a lot about myself in the course. It was a super fun course but also very educational and I felt that I really learned a lot.",
    "Yes. I found this class to be both fun and informative. I think the type of thinking and debating that occurs in this class can be valuable to any type of Yale student. The class is accessible to STEM, humanities, and social science students alike. All and all, one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Yes! Mario and Austen were lovely and highly engaging. The content was fast paced but always the right amount for me to feel like I was learning but also not overwhelmed.",
    "Definitely! It was a great intro course to ethics\/philosophy, and the readings are well chosen (it was interesting and challenging, but not indecipherable especially to non-phil students). The course was well organized, and provided a really great overview of the ethics field and their major questions. It inspired me to take up more philosophy courses in the future! It was really fun too, especially being able to discuss and debate with other students on issues. Professor Mario was wonderful, and our TA was great too! There was plenty of opportunities and time to discuss issues in further depth if you wanted, or ask questions if you were confused.",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone interested in asking the questions of why do we do the things we do and how should we live. Important for policy making.",
    "Absolutely! Great Professor and great TA (although I guess this would change), fun class to take - the essays and reflection pieces give you a lot of space to explore what you want to know more about",
    "Sure. Philosophy can born in discussions and I think this course do well in this part. Also, it can make you really participate in those knowledge.",
    "Yes. They are both responsible"
