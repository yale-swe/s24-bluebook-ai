                "I have taken a lot of religious studies courses, but none have taught me as much as this course did. Professor Grewal is incredibly intelligent, and everything she assigns is a banger (and I mean this in the most academic sense).",
                "Learned about the history of American spirituality and how we perceptions of religion are influenced by culture, racism, sexism, etc",
                "How to think about theology and spirituality.",
                "What a stimulating and interesting course this was! Taught me so much about religion and how we view religion in todays political climate. Additionally taught me so much about what spirituality means and how capitalism manipulates the term. Really made me think for myself and out of the box",
                "I learned about American religion and modern views about religion.",
                "A greater understanding of how American Spirituality came to be, understanding of the important concepts used to define religion",
                "I expanded my understanding of the concepts of religion and spirituality and how they fit into human history, especially Western history.",
                "This class taught me a lot about the way we (as people, particularly as Americans) think about religion, spirituality, race, logic, and the way that those things are all intimately tied to one another. It also taught me a lot about navigating the empire that is Yale, and how I want to show up for myself and others as a person.",
                "This course makes you think through your societys, familys, and own personal religious outlook and experience and gives you some tools to objectively look at your relationship with religion.",
                "A really great class, caused massive introspection into my one spiritual beliefs.",
                "I learned a lot about the implications of religious liberalism and what it means to be religious today.",

                "I questioned everything I thought I knew! Developed the skill to write narrative essays about myself and others which weaved in the things I learned in class. Learned to manage a high workload of texts of very different styles (novels, articles, and academic works). Most of all, I came away from the course with a renewed sense of urgency to resist the structures in our world that many people recognize are bad but think they can't do anything about.",
                "I learned a lot about philosophers",
                "I felt that this course gave me a good overview of the development of the concept of being spiritual but not religious in the United States over time. For me, the best part of this course was that it let me reflect on my own religious upbringing and think about how I identify in terms of religion and spirituality.",
                "Understanding of cultural appropriation, contemporary spiritualities, modern era of contingency, ability to compare and synthesize various texts",
                "Learn a lot about the role of spirituality or consciousness in our economic and political state. Requires a lot of reading and personal reflection to understand its real life application",

I developed how to synthesize difficult texts and critically engage with the arguments of scholars.",

                "In the best way possible, this course shattered many of my preconceptions and challenged many of my negative viewpoints about religion. It helped me recognize the inadequacy and the inherent bigotry of secularism, spiritual individualism, and vague but culturally-appropriating spiritualities in the West. The course emphasizes exposure to many different anthropological, theological, and historical interpretations with the goal of challenging us to think critically, rather than delivering an agenda of the one only way to think about these issues. Through lectures, short essays, personal interviews and memoirs, tons of readings, and often surprising interactive activities, we learned about the Spiritual But Not Religious demographic and its critics. Most of all, I felt deeply challenged and motivated to be more politically, religiously, and morally active in my life and resist the complacency that can often come with a SBNR (or in my case, fairly plain agnosticism) practice.",

                "Strengths: the readings are really interesting, the papers are fun to write and a good way to talk to friends/family about serious topics, Zareena is very knowledgable and reshaped my view of religion and capitalism, the discussion posts were a good creative outlet, the selection of books for section was really good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unorganized lectures, too much reading makes it difficult to keep up (in class and weekly novels for sections), needlessly difficult midterm, Zareena can sometimes say things that are a little controversial and might rub people the wrong way, the field trip was really unorganized and last minute so that most people weren't able to go (the date kept moving around and in the end we were only told that it was happening the day before)",
                "strengths - prof. growl's teaching style, good readings, super interesting material that I think all Yale students should know, great assignments and spaced out well\r\n\r\nweaknesses - sometimes too much reading between the scholarly works and the novels, would be cool if we could have a creative option for the book reviews",
                "Strengths: readings are engaging, I loved the book club sections, Zareen'a lectures are interesting, no final, and all of the assignments are so fun. Weaknesses: lots of tech issues that actually really affected my lecture experience, some due to IT issues and some due to user error. Also, sometimes Professor Grewal will read lengthy excerpts from our assigned reading in class, which I hated.",
                "I liked the books assigned for section",
                "Strengths: the interesting content, the books, the discussion sections, and the TAs. Weaknesses: the slide presentations and the in-class dynamic.",
                "The lectures were sometimes disorganized. The teacher can sometimes talk for long periods of time and say loaded statements without allowing thoughtful discussion. I think this class would be better as a seminar.",
                "Strengths are that the course is extremely interesting content wise and weaknesses are it is a little disorganized",
                "I learned very little useful information in this class. Lectures and section were disjointed, and together had a cumulative amount of reading which would be impossible to complete if completing a real schedule of classes.",
                "Strengths: It's very interesting, Zareena is an engaging lecturer, the readings are all fascinating, if you have never taken a religious studies course before you will learn a lot\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Disorganized, discussion sections are on books that are interesting but not super relevant to the course. Course is not about the unchurching of America, there is a lot of work at the end of the course. sometimes zareena gets side tracked during lecture and spends too much of class canvassing the room",
                "Overall this course was great. I think that it could be slightly better organized so that readings are actually discussed in the lecture theyre assigned for, but that wasnt a big deal.",
                "I think the main weakness of this class is that it's not always particularly organized, which sometimes makes deadlines and assigned readings hard to follow. But at the same time, I don't think that ever took anything away from my experience of the class. In fact the flexible nature of it all is I think one of its major strengths. There were a lot of different lessons I learned from taking this course, academic, personal, or otherwise. And I was never worried about my grade in this course, which let me show up as I could and needed to in a given moment and still take something away from a reading, lecture, or section.",
                "I think it would be nice if there was more cohesion between the section and the class.",
                "The section readings are very interesting, and the discussions are very worthwhile. The readings for class are dense, and the class lectures are often hard to follow and feel a bit discursive.",
                "The course at times felt disorganized and unrelated, but a really great professor who loves the topic. Great course.",
                "I think the ordering of the course is a bit off in that the things I was most interested in came at the end of the semester, when I was quite fatigued. There was very little incentive to do the readings beyond the midterm, which, in a way, I respect. It did make discussions in section a bit difficult after that, though.",
                "Strengths: Diverse set of readings and different viewpoints. The novels that we read for section were great. Content is manageable. Professor Grewal is very knowledgeable as well and is able to piece together the different concepts well. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings tended to be very heavy (although it slows down at the end of the semester). The lectures were hard to follow, I don't think reading out of the book is that helpful and this was done often.",
                "Way too much class time, little connection between various units and readings",
                "Less opportunity to engage directly with the more intense academic texts or ability to unpack them personally because the section focused on the novels. Strengths: great, incredible personality of the class, engagement from students. I actually felt like Prof. Grewal knew me better and in a more personal way than my TF, which never happens.",
                "Strengths: great readings and fun/interesting topics in lecture and section\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe it could be a bit more organized",
                "I think this course could benefit from reorganization and possibly a different Professor",
                "This class was highs and lows. Some days lecture was extremely engaging, with tons of real-world examples, class participation, and more, and sometimes it was just the professor reading from slides that were honestly quite confusing. The midterm was extremely difficult to prepare for (I think I studied more than any test ever before, just because of the sheer volume of material,) but then the writing assignments felt fun and low-stakes. Readings were interesting, but having unrelated section and lecture readings often made it hard for me to feel like I *got* the readings' purposes, and also made it hard to keep up. All this is to say that when this class is great, it is great... but it is not always that way, and it might be worth streamlining the readings and trying to keep lecture consistent to make it better.",
                "There was very little organization in this course.",
                "Professor Grewal is a phenomenal lecturer. That being said, this course is not for the faint of heart when it comes to lecture organization. The slides can be all over the place and it is stressful if you are someone who struggles to write quickly or process audio/visual at the same time as taking notes. Still, one strength of the course is that very little new material is presented in lecture. It is a high workload of reading, but if you are doing the reading then lecture is an outstanding experience where you can hear Prof. Grewal speak brilliance for 75 minutes.",
                "More inclusivity on the topics of religion and maybe going more into depth on material or at least providing the material from lectures",
                "i think that less lecture readings would be ideal. because it's all phenomenal work but it takes lots of time and it is easy to fall behind quickly because of the reading amounts. but it is entirely worth it when you get to put in the work.",
                "More of a connection between section and lecture? I would've loved if section conversations went over some lecture topics in greater depth",
                "A lot of reading but they are meaningful if you want it to be. Kind of talked about the same things in many different ways which can be helpful but became repetitive at times. TAs are very encouraging and engaging during section",
                "This course had a lot of readings but the core ideas were emphasized and made clear in lectures which was really helpful. Lectures were sometimes difficult to be engaged by because slides were very crowded with knowledge and it would be read off of.",
                "The lecture format works well, but I would shorten it to a 50 minute lecture. The 75 minute lecture would often have too much time, and the lecturer would veer from the content, making it hard to hone in on the course information. The midterm exam by itself would either make sense accompanied with a final exam, or no exams and just paper-based.",
                "The course packs a ton of content. Lectures are really exciting and the readings are extremely powerful. The course is very good at accommodating different engagement levels, but I would highly recommend taking it at a time where you can truly make time in your schedule to sit down with the readings and accommodate a roughly 6-hour per week workload (not including class time). The class was quite life-changing for me, and my only regret is the way that my deep investment in the course could take me away from my other classes -- which again, was still worth it for me.",
                "Strengths: a variety of texts from video to essays to books, super thought provoking combination of readings, exciting energy and structure of lecture \r\nWeaknesses: lectures do not always align with class readings and thus we don't always engage with the texts in detail or with rigor and thoughtfulness",
                "Strengths: Wonderfully chosen readings (Octavia Butler!!), amazing professor and TFs, so many opportunities to reflect and theorize on how the course topics affect the lives of you and those around you, even if you don't ID as SBNR. Altogether light workload outside of readings. No weaknesses, unless you don't like reading.",

If not, it's pretty much a waste of time. Lectures are not super helpful, it mainly just consists of Zareena directly readings parts of the text, and then asking people for opinions. I know she doesn't really care, but her slides are pretty unorganized, and honestly it's hard to keep up sometimes. Without really focusing on the readings (which are sometimes hard to understand), I genuinely don't think I would have learned anything. Also, it's a LOT of readings + books we have to read for section.\r\n\r\nOverall, this class really did have a hugely positive impact on me, but I got much more out of thinking for myself and writing the papers than I did from class itself and lecture. If you do take the class, beware, she calls on people and is not afraid to debate you in front of the whole lecture!",
                "yes, only if they come to lecture on the first day and vibe with prof grewal's teaching style",
                "Yes. This course is particularly excellent for seniors, as Professor Grewal forces a lot of personal reflection that I valued having to do during my last semester. Also there is no final. Also it is interesting. If you are at all interested in religious studies, you should take this class. You will get more out of it than people who are taking it as a \"gut.\" Take it to learn something, not to get an A. You'll probably get one anyways, so at least push yourself and do the readings to learn something beyond the grade.",
                "YES!! Whether you are religious or not, radical or not, political or not, there is something to gain from the course material. You also read from so many greats like Malcolm X, Octavia E. Butler, Toni Morrison, etc.",

I don't think the class is for everyone because you very much get out of it was you're willing to put in, but I think it's a really unique class to have the opportunity to take at yale. It introduced me to a lot of texts and concepts I don't think I'd have come across otherwise, and I think opens the door to a lot of self-reflection that isn't always encouraged by other courses.",

                "Yes! Had me think a lot about religion and spirituality in relation to my life.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE!!!",
                "I definitely would; I feel connected to the material in that in really changed how I think about my life.",
                "Yes 100%, it was super interesting and I felt like I learned a lot and was super engaged throughout!  especially during lectures, which were very unscripted and insightful",
                "No",
                "Yes... sort of. Now being done, I am so glad I took this course, as it helped me learn a lot about myself and about religion in general. But while I was in it, there were times where the readings and lectures just felt grueling. Honestly, this class is kind of a cult in its own rite (and yes, I went to the lecture on cults... I know what I'm saying!) Take it, but only if you're prepared for it to sometimes get weird and sometimes get hard.",
                "No. Very disorganized. Some of what she spoke about was interesting, but there was no clear take away.",
                "I would recommend this class to the intellectually curious, the skeptics, the nonreligious, the haters, and everything in between. I think that this course was so enriching and provided a very nuanced and respectful view of religion todays social climate requires.",
                "Yes yes yes! The work is lengthy and hard, but they were the most worthwhile reading and writing assignments I have ever done at Yale. Prof. Grewal is a phenomenal lecturer and I was genuinely excited to come see what she had to say in every class. I will be thinking about this class for years to come.",
                "No. This class was a lot of complex stuff without like context very difficult",
                "Absolutely! I think so many more people should 1) experience Zareena's greatness and 2) engage with the themes of this course in efforts to confront their social and political responsibilities and strengthen their personal beliefs",
                "Yes- however, with the caveat that truly gaining something from this course requires actually doing the work / readings.",
                "Yes, but it is not a gut, you should not wait last minute to complete the work or your hair will fall out",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student! The course will have you critically thinking about spirituality and religion after each lecture in new ways that you would never think about before.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody hoping to try out the Religious Studies department, or top anybody interested in contemporary American history.",
                "This is such a valuable course. Zareena and the TF team really care about you and your engagement and it shows. If you show up and do the work, you will learn so much about yourself and grow.",
                "Absolutely! It is very different from other classes at Yale and is exciting.",
                "YES. YES. YES. This class is so f****** mind-blowing, and it will make you theorize about religion, politics, and \"the culture war\" in ways you almost certainly haven't before. Even (especially?) if you don't ID as SBNR or know people who do, this class is SO relevant to the lives of anyone even remotely interested in any of the things on this syllabus. Also, take any class Zareena teaches; she's amazing. I will say, even though the grading in this class is pretty nice, you won't get much out of it if you're just looking for a gut. There is quite of a lot of reading, but if you want to get your mind blown, you should read all of it. Trust me.",
                "yes, to gain more religious literacy about the current religious climate in US",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I learned a lot about religion in a way I hadn't before. Although, I would make sure to tell the student that I didn't think the lectures were the easiest to follow and that the class was a tad disorganized. I think with minor adjustments to these aspects, I would definitely recommend this course to another student."
