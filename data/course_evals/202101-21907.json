                "Content is really interesting and presented well. Problem sets are challenging but give good preparations for exams. Lots of office hours make getting help easy.",
                "This course was taught in a relatively intuitive manner through examples and simple explanations which made me feel as though I was learning the material very well. Unfortunately, the pre-recorded lectures were often not very engaging but I think that was mostly due to the difficulty of staying focused for 90 minutes on a person on my computer screen.",
                "Strengths: Professor Steinacker. My favorite professor I've had at Yale so far. She is firm and sticks to her expectations, and yet so kind and genuinely cares about her students. She loves when you come and chat with her and really gets to know you. She cares about her students, frequently expressing concern about our well-being. At times in the semester, she removed questions from homeworks and decided to put less questions on exams than she had planned because she felt the stress level was high. She chose to make the exams 24-hour open-note because of the online learning environment and pandemic, which was the most wonderful decision any of my professors have made while teaching this last year. She loves to talk to you about your major and give advice on other courses to take. I wish I could take more courses with her!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really. I would like if there could be office hours on the days that homeworks are due for last minute questions, as there are office hours every day besides the due-date days.",
                "The lectures in this course were very engaging and well-put together to help promote student understanding, but on occasion they could become mired in minutiae and fall behind the lesson plan detailed in the syllabus. The problem sets were an extremely appropriate level of difficulty, but as the lectures fell behind the problem sets increasingly were focused on content covered in lecture only shortly before the release of the problem sets themselves.",
                "One of my few complaints about this course is that everything was recorded lectures in terms of learning. There were office hours and such but I felt like through my learning experience I wish I could have interacted with the instructor more.",
                "a fair physics courses, exams were a little tough",
                "I do like the recorded lectures since it allows us to work at our own time, and the sessions with tf's are great for homework help",
                "I think that this course covers the material needed very well. The course itself isn't particularly exciting, but that is to be expected for a common pre-requisite.",
                "Office hours and peer tutoring hours were really helpful. It would be nice to have a problem statement or a sentence about what exactly we were solving or deriving during lecture. I appreciated parts of the class where steps were delineated or there was a bit more of a walkthrough in lecture, but sometimes when I was watching lecture and we were solving a problem, I couldn't recall what information we were given in the problem statement, so just having the problem briefly written out or giving a quick recap of what we were solving/deriving would be helpful.",
                "This course is an intro course that is very orderly and easy to follow for the most part. At some times, I wish we could have spent longer on certain concepts.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Steinacker is absolutely great, and really cares that we learn the material well! The lectures are thorough, help is easy to access through peer tutoring and office hours, and the material is interesting.",
                "Strengths: material is fairly interesting; demonstrations and content are pretty cool, and the instructor tries her best to present it as such. \r\nWeaknesses: particular to 2021 - the course is provided solely through recorded lectures, which means that my engagement with the course is, unfortunately, relatively low. I imagine that this course is quite engaging in person, as demonstrations and such would happen live, and there would be more interaction with professor (who is very kind and passionate about physics). Some homework questions could have been phrased better as well. \r\nOverall, a fairly decent course.",
                "I sometimes got behind with the pre recorded lectures but the participation questions kept me in check.",
                "Prof Steinacker is one of the best and nicest professors at Yale. She cares about students and physics and teachers engagingly.",
                "Excellent tutoring and support options. Difficult but manageable material. Could improve clarity on exam procedures ahead of exams.",
                "I found it very hard to keep myself engaged through the online course. Though it was great to have infinite replayability of lectures, the format of recorded lectures made me lose focus very quickly. Lecture notes that accompanied lecture videos were a good alternative, however. TAs were very accessible. Homework required significant time investment.",
                "Strength: Prof. Steinecker is very approachable with very easy to read lecture notes, a lot of resources are available for students (including office hours basically every day)\r\n\r\nWeakness: I personally felt like 181 was a lot harder to follow than 180 because she makes certain assumptions about what people know (e.g. defining what in series or parallel resistors look like) so there might need to be more proactivity from the students to fill in gaps of understanding sometimes",
                "Strengths: well taught, good TAs, many office hours, professor that cares so so much",
                "A major strength of the course was the large number of office hours each week. They were extremely helpful with completing psets and understanding course material.",
                "The professor is a great teacher - she explains concepts clearly, does many examples so we are prepared for the homework, and the live demos she does keep the lectures interesting and engaging. The participation assignments were good for keeping me on track and reinforcing the concepts learned in class. I honestly have nothing for the weaknesses category; I think Professor Steinacker is doing a great job teaching this class!",
                "The strength of this course is definitely the professor. She is so sweet and really passionate about teaching so the course is well taught. The only downside of the course this semester was that it was online.",
                "This course was extremely strong in every way. Professor Steinacker's made complicated physics topics incredibly clear with her precise explanations. The assignments, demonstrations, and presentation of topics were all extrememlythoughtful. The class was very well organized, with clear deadlines, plentiful opportunites for help, and a clear grading scheme. I appreciated how the grading scheme was clear from the start and included test corrections and homework and participation cutoffs so that I was not stressed during the course."

I took PHYS 180 in 2019 as an in-person class and definitely did better this semester with recorded lectures where I could pause, work through examples on my own, and return to them repeatedly. I hope that even when lectures are in-person, more lectures can record and post their classes for that reason. Professor Steinacker recognized that teaching during a pandemic could not work the same way as during the before times, and every decision she made was out of a genuine concern for her students.",
                "The virtual lecture format was well suited to the content, and the release of the lecture notes and the oppurtunity to consult TFs and the professor at synchronous office hours allowed any remaining doubts or confusions to be banished extremely efficiently.",

I hope I do not fail this course but if I did, it is because I felt completely alone in my learning. I know that a lot of that is my fault, but I still felt lost and alone the whole semester.",

                "It was pretty good! My only suggestion is to have office hours after class hours, since I wanted to watch the lectures during the scheduled class hours, but couldn't since the office hours started halfway through.",
                "The course is provided solely through recorded lectures, which are nice in some ways (there's not too much pressure to do them at a particular time), but which also, unfortunately, decrease engagement with the course (physics is sadly not the same through a screen vs. in person :/). The professor provided 'participation questions' that were mandated in order to make sure students engaged with the lectures, but these were not too bad and were due at the end of each week, which helped with flexibility/time management on my end. \r\nThe professor gave 24 hours for each exam to allow for more flexibility than the normal 3-hour period for exams, as it would have been difficult to enforce the shorter time span. This increased time span was a godsend, and was very generous on the part of the professor. I thought this practice was very helpful, especially for learning during the pandemic.",

                "Though all the lectures were pre-recorded, the professor managed to keep them interesting and engaging. The participation questions embedded in the lectures were a great way to do so. She was also available during the scheduled class hours for student questions about the lecture. The timing for the exams was also extended and I greatly appreciated that. The professor did a great job of adapting to COVID-19 and constantly showed her care and compassion for her students during this time.",

                "Yes.",
                "Yes! People will tell you that this course is too much work, but that isn't true. The best piece of advice is to never, ever work alone. The homeworks are not designed to be done alone: between Professor Steinacker, the peer tutors, and the TAs, there are (by my count) more than 80 person-hours of office hours a week (8 Sunday, 13 Monday, 13 Tuesday, 20 Wednesday, 25 Thursday, 10 Friday). *The homeworks are designed to be done in study hall or office hours so that you can check your work as you go through. If you try to do them alone, they will take you 4-5 times as long and will feel impossible.* Also, you don't need to do the practice problems on the homeworks right away, but I strongly recommend doing them before exams and talking about them with a peer tutor or Professor Steinacker because they are often very similar to exam questions.",
                "This course is in many ways a natural continuation of its predecessor in terms of format, but the content covered herein is of a radically different type. An intense interest in electronic dynamics or particle physics would likely be a great help to a student in this class, and without that interest, much of the content will seem like it is present for its own sake.",
                "Listen, you will hear raving reviews about Adriane and how great of a lecturer she is and that this class is really great. And it's partially true. Adriane is a very intelligent person and goes above and beyond to make her class have many resources to get help. However this class is pure masochism. Adriane brags that she is a not a \"by-the-book\" professor, which in its own regard is nice to know since she dedicates herself to making her own class materials, but this comes at the expense of orderly, concise material. There are lecture notes and many review materials on canvas, which again are nice, but this class feels wholeheartedly like a word salad of Adriane's physics knowledge. Some of the topics covered are so incredibly esoteric and quite frankly needlessly complicated as to diminish the students' experience. There is perhaps no better example than the psets to justify what I am saying. I came into this class with the ambition of perhaps studying physics or EE and am leaving a regret-less social science major. The problem sets in this class are SO long, filled with ridiculously long algebraic expressions that do not contribute at all to learning. I wasted so many hours doing tedious algebraic simplications after doing a conceptually interesting integral/derivation from first principles. Also, everyone just goes to the study halls to get the answers and I know of many people that would just divide and conquer, each person getting an answer to a pset question and then sharing all of the pset together. The workload in this class is so so so needlessly over the top. By the end of the semester, I ended up loathing this class and having to spend countless hours every weekend either going to the study halls or asking peers for help just to finish the 10+ hour pset every. damn. week. I honestly felt like I learned very little from doing these psets and overall from this class. I had taken a physics class at a local state college in high school and it was so much better, which is embarrassing considering I attend an institution with seemingly infinite financial resources and thus power to implement a successful physics program. At this state school, we followed concepts from a book which were expanded upon in lecture with reasonable, practical examples to do as homework. In PHYS 181, you attend a lecture where Adriane haphazardly slaps a few new concepts into your head, she does an example or two on her board, and then you are rewarded with a 20-hour death sentence in office hours to apply the concepts that were shakily taught to you on a problem set that everyone just copies from each other for an easy 100. You have no time to throughly play with the class material in your mind as you are too busy drowning in tedious, mind-numbing psets. This class truly drained any joy that I had in the sciences from me. And also, the exams this year were basically just copy and paste from her lecture notes, save for the final which was death. The only saving grace in this class is that it is graded so leniently such that if you bomb the exams and just do everything else (psets and participation) the worse you will get is a B. I am begging you for your own sanity, unless you HAVE to take intro physics, save yourself the stress and take classes that Yale actually dedicates its resources to in the humanities and social sciences departments.",
                "Yes: very helpful and informative",
                "yes, if its required only",
                "No. I dislike physics and the course is really challenging. However, Professor Steinacker is wonderful and kind and helpful, so I would recommending taking her course if PHYS 181 is a requirement for another student.",
                "Yes, but make sure you know physics I well, and know your taylor series",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to get a thorough understanding of the E&M portion of physics or if you need it as a pre-requisite.",
                "This course is a good introduction to electrostatics from a physics approach and should be taken by students looking for such.",
                "Definitely! Great in-depth introduction to E and M, even though I had a bad experience with it in high school.",
                "This is a fairly interesting course. I would recommend a course with professor Steinacker, as she is very passionate about the subject and it shows. As for the course itself, the course material is fairly interesting, though it is also very heavy on mathematics and technical details, so it is definitely geared towards those with an interest in physics/physics majors. Might not be a gut science credit, but if anything it's a nice, challenging (in a good way) course that keeps your stem-brain honest (if that's what you're looking for).",
                "This taught is very well taught! However, if you do not need it, do not take it due to the workload and intellectual challenge!",
                "Yes I definitely would recommend this course. Very engaging and rewarding.",
                "yes, it's interesting.",
                "Yes. I was a DS student and will likely major in history. I did not take PHYS 180. But PHYS 181 gave refreshing rigour and a supportive environment for an entirely different experience. Would recommend with professor Steinacker.",
                "It's an introductory Physics course, and though Prof. Steinacker is an amazing professor, I would only recommend taking this course (on any of the introductory physics sequences), if you have to. That said, from what I heard from peers, 181 might be your best option.",
                "If you need to take a physics class, take this over 200",
                "There are more fun QR/Sc credits, and if you are interested in Physics and related subjects, you should consider 200/201.",
                "Absolutely! Learned so much about the world and how to approach long problems",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course",
                "Definitely! I learned so much and had fun while doing so, and the professor was great both for her teaching skills and her personality. I loved that her sense of humor still shone through in the recorded lectures!",
                "Yes, if you are deciding between 170/171 and 180/181, definitely take this class! There is so much more support offered and is better taught in general.",
                "If this student is interested in physics and has a strong background in math, I would recommend this course.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. It was engaging and enjoyable, but most of all it strengthened by electricity and magnetism foundations tremendously.",
                "Yes! With prof steinaker this course is amazing, even though its hard."
