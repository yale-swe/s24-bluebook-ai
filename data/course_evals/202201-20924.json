                "NA due to auditing",
                "Professor is extremely enthusiastic about content of the class, very engaging as a lecturer.",
                "Strengths: CS gut\r\nWeaknesses: everything is very high-level. Students are not very engaged - like 1\/6 of the class shows up.",
                "Strengths: Great instructor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "The lectures were interesting and the psets were cool. However the exams are awful. Super specific questions that are hard to predict. Also scaz got mad that people werent showing up to class and started deleting notes and lectures as punishment. Office hours were not helpful and questions on ED were left unanswered.",
                "I wish the slides were posted :)",
                "Well designed homework",
                "strengths: breadth of course\r\nweakness: not the most fun problem sets",
                "Clear lectures, Prof. Scaz is very engaging. The range of topics covered is broad. \r\nCould work to build a stronger sense of community in the class.",
                "A strength of this course was that the format of it allowed for it to be recorded and the lectures be made available online afterwards, so that any student could access ALL available course materials. However, this turned into a major weakness for me when these lectures were made unavailable unless a certain percentage of students attended class in person. As a student with ADHD, any courses that have materials (especially) lectures available outside of class are a major assistance, as oftentimes, even if I am present in class, I am almost certain to miss some material. On the other hand, what bothered me more is that there can be any number of reasons that someone may have to prefer an online course to one that is in person, and thus the whole class would be punished over someone's preference and decision on how they as an individual prefer to learn, and how they believe that they might learn best. This ruling was put into place after the midterm in the hopes of improving class performance (which it did not, based on midterm and final averages both settling around 70). I am frustrated with the fact that this course had the ability to give every student even more tools for success than the average class, but chose not to. In fairness, we were given the opportunity to \"unlock\" them for the entire class by participating in creating review questions. We did not meet the threshold, yet everyone was able to benefit from the few who took the time to write review questions. After a semester of amazing lectures and material (I truly mean this, everything was presented and explained exceptionally well), as well as fair homework and exam assessment, it upsets me to feel how I do about this. I understand that recorded lectures are not the norm, and there very well are likely reasons for the decisions made that are unknown to me and beyond what I've acknowledged, but I very much am struggling to understand why any course that takes the time and resources to record lectures for the benefit of student learning would at the end of the day choose to keep those unavailable - keeping an already created, valuable learning tool, unaccessible to any student who would greatly benefit from it. I am leaving the answer to this course being well organized to facilitate student learning as agree, because at the end of the day more was available from this course than some of my other ones. However, I do still believe that if the tools are already available to help students succeed, they may as well be accessed and used by students instead of sitting in storage. \r\n\r\nA final weakness that I would point out is with autograders being set for homework, yet not available before the submission deadline. I believe this was only the case with one assignment, but I was able to complete the assignment clearly and coherently enough as to get a near perfect score on the human-evaluated portion - yet did extremely poorly on the autograder portion due to one parameter being off before submission (which I documented). Yes, this was my fault as I should have double checked that value before submission, however, had I been able to use the autograder before submitting I would have recognized immediately and fixed that one parameter. Again, my fault, but mistakes like this can be easily avoided.\r\n\r\nAgain, I would just like to point out how much I enjoyed this class overall and I would recommend it to anyone interested in AI. Lectures were extremely interesting and presented in an excited and engaged manner. Homework and test assessment were both fair and transparent. Aside from the above weaknesses I describe in this evaluation, I have absolutely no complaints or regrets taking this course - overall, extremely glad to have been able to take this course.",
                "The strengths are the fun of some of the assignments. The weakness was everything else about the course.",
                "The lectures are interesting and quite organized. The problems sets are pretty interesting but could be made to be more helpful to understand the material. The exams are quite different from the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, most of it taught in an engaging and easy to follow way. \r\nWeaknesses: a few of the homeworks were unnecessarily complicated with not much support. The slides had very little information on them to encourage attendance (because it was very low) so this made review difficult.",
                "Weakness: lectures were good but prepared us little for programming psets",
                "Lectures were boring unless 3x speed, then they were fine and actually interesting.",
                "strengths: really interesting and organized lectures, clear teaching weaknesses: variety in quality of TAs -- while in core classes, most of the teaching staff are undergrads who've taken the course before, here, a lot of the TAs are grad students, so they might not have learned the material in the same way\/the exact same info, so generally, they're not as helpful for this specific course. The grading scheme is also very unclear with little info given about exam\/pset distributions, and the exams are really unrelated to the lectures -- while they follow the same topics, they go into heavy detail about really niche topics, and a lot of the calculations that we need to know aren't really covered at all",
                "Scaz is a great lecturer but I wish the class were a bit more flexible. For instance there are no late days and we also didnt get some of the class recording when attendance didnt reach 50%. And while all the content was really interesting and the lectures were made fairly engaging, I wish we had a better connection between topics. Like how do neural nets relate to genetic algorithms or how do researchers actually decide which algorithm to use?",
                "Strengths: Addresses issues that are very relevant to the world today. Psets were also interesting since they used the AI techniques for applications like Pacman or Othello\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the work is overly technical, it is super easy to get lost in all the nuanced details of first-order logic, decision trees, or other forms of learning that detract from the big picture. Also, the exams felt overly focused on memorization of all the vocabulary and many algorithms that were only mentioned once briefly in class.",
                "The lectures were engaging and the professor's is very good at storytelling \r\nDisappointed with the homework.... not sure why Yale let's professors \"adapt\" homework from other schools.\r\nI also wish that there were practice exams or problems to get a better understanding of how the tests were going to be structured.",
                "Scaz is a great lecturer, and I appreciate that he encourages people to participate (and actually come to) his lectures.. \r\nThe greatest strength of this course is that it covers an astonishingly wide range of topics in Ai, but an inescapable weakness of this approach is that few topics can be treated with much depth.",
                "The course explains to a good extent a lot of stuff regarding Artificial Intelligence, in a contemporary way. The practice problems are good and helpful to actually understand the course material. A weekness of the course would be that certain practice problems were too easy.",
                "Strengths: The course covers so many aspects.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The assignments are a little bit intense."

                "No, the teacher was needlessly petty towards the class and took zero accountability for the poor performance of the class in the midterm and final.",
                "Probably not, the lecture content was mostly interesting but it moved on from each topic very quickly. The assignments were not terribly difficult but not terribly interesting either, mostly we used Python to implement the important parts of some AI topic (a genetic algorithm, a planner, etc.). It is a decent class if youre looking for a CS elective that doesnt take as much time as the more difficult ones in the department.",
                "No, also not a gut",
                "Yes, if the intention is to have a general broad survey of topics in AI. It helps to build some knowledge about the field in general in most topics, but does not go in details on any specific topic",
                "I would recommend this to a student in the CS major that needs an elective. The workload itself is not that much, but some of the problem sets can be tricky to solve.",
                "Best class I have ever taken at Yale, and the best professor to take it with.",
                "Yes! It is a well taught and interesting CS elective that is not too much work. A couple problem sets are a bit of a slog but most of them are super reasonable couple to few hours and a couple are even an hour or less affair.",
                "I would say that the material itself seems super essential to any modern-day programmer, and Scaz himself is a good lecturer. However, the workload actually isn't as light as everyone makes it out to seem -- while each pset only takes a few hours, the psets are weekly and can be kind of hard to debug. The exams are also a bit harsh as they don't correspond to the lectures well and can test tricky topics. So I would take the class if you're interested in the topics, or try to self-learn, but this class isn't 100% as much of a gut as it might seem",
                "I would recommend it if you are really interested in learning about AI but don't really know anything technical about the field yet. If you already know a lot about AI then it won't really dig deep enough for you since it just covers a wide range of topics.",
                "Depends. I think if a student wants to learn artificial intelligence from a practical or applied standpoint then no. If they want to understand the complexities of the field in our world socially or with regards to policies then yes.",
                "I highly recommend it! Don't expect to gain a mastery of any one topic, but do expect a sweeping overview of the field that places AI in perspective in a way few can.",
                "Definitely! The course is really well-set. While I personally had already a good background, it can work as a good introduction for several topics."
