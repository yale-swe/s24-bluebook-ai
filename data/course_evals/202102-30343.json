Although I do not plan on joining a laboratory or doing field work, my understanding and appreciation of public awareness of scientific etiquette will help me in my own future endeavors in academia and how I communicate with colleagues and peers. There is also an aspect of seeking broader social change through the way in which scientific claims are interpreted. Science is NEVER  I repeat: NEVER  black and white. The world is a grey spectrum, and people need to learn how to navigate the rhetoric presented by media outlets, family, and friends.",
                "I learned very valuable skills on statistical analysis. I learned the flaws of our current methods of statistical analysis as well as ways we can combat these issue. I found the course very engaging and insightful.",
                "People misuse statistical methods, you need to be skeptical, and human judgment is very important in science",
                "I learned to evaluate scientific arguments and methods. I developed the tools to account for uncertainty and variability in scientific reasoning. I also gained a better understanding of the fundamentals of experimentation and study design.",
                "Throughout this course my classmates and I developed critical thinking skills that are applicable to almost every aspect of life. While the title of the course certainly emphasizes the class' focus on science, many of the concepts we explored provided tools that are also generally relevant to every field. We learned how to look past the data presented to us in order to truly comprehend what it means--and not just what we're TOLD it means.",
                "Learned to read research",
                "Use of excel, use of endnote and general studying skills",
                "I now know how to figure out what exactly a scientific article is telling me. Before, I used to only be able to read an article's interpretations, be it from a news source or from the authors' conclusions. I took what was given to me at face value without actually understanding what was being said to me. I have a solid knowledge of basic statistics. I can understand the concepts involved in statistical analysis, a skill I've never actually learned in a statistics course in the past. I have a better understanding of what science is (and is not), how science is conducted and the major issues in current-day scientific communities."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course were the semi-interesting readings we sometimes got that made homework a little more bearable. Weaknesses were mainly everything else. One was the way the class was graded, another being the information sometimes just wasn't interesting at all and was sometimes difficult to focus on.",
                "Every reading in this course is great on its own. Discussions were directed according to the intellectual demands of the class; this is a huge plus. Since the scope of the course was broad, not everything about science could be covered in depth, however the breadth and access to further resources is certainly already there.",
                "Strengths: the content is very interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: the course was very big compared to what I expected (23 people, I think) and the course really suffered over Zoom. It was so hard to pay attention. Also, the grading is unnecessarily harsh, when Eduardo stresses that he doesn't think we should focus so much on grades. He MAKES us focus so much on grades by being so tough on grading. Class average for a midterm was a 74... Also, there's little feedback given for the midterm",
                "This course had many strengths. The syllabus was innovative and engaging. We covered a lot of \"meta-scientific\" \/ epistemological topics that rarely surface in other courses such as skepticism, uncertainty, error, principles of study design, and the fallacies of the p-value. I think some more structure to the class discussions might have been helpful.",
                "Class time was very bad questions were rarely answered by the professor",
                "It was super fast paced and the reading was tough with a full schedule",
                "This course did for me what no other statistics course (I have tried two before!) have been able to in the past: I understand statistics. Its focus on conceptual understanding is one of its biggest strengths in my opinion. The professor did not try to teach us how to conduct major statistical analysis or which formulas to use on advanced statistical softwares, which is what most professors do in introductory classes; he made it so we could have a full understanding of what statistical analysis actually is, what it can and cannot do. This is important for all persons to understand; I think this particular strength benefitted students who work with and study statistics\/students from STEM fields, students from social sciences fields and humanities students, such as myself, in equal amounts. I wish all introductory statistics courses reserved a portion of their syllabi to address the conceptual part of statistics and the current crises in statistical analysis as applied to the sciences; it would make learning much more interesting, easy and relevant. The seminar-style was an intriguing concept for a science class, or at least in my experience I had never encountered a science class with this structure before, and it was amazing! Getting to engage in discussions about the material was just as valuable for learning as any lecture-style moment was. This course was EXTREMELY organized. The most organized course I have ever taken at Yale. Each class had a detailed description, with well explained learning objectives and directions and context for each reading. This was honestly just AWESOME. It made it so much easier to keep track of the content and of the learning experience in general. Another strength was the professor's use of the TA's skills in the class. Our TA was essential in my learning experience, and I believe this not only to have stemmed from her competence and experience, but also from the professor's purposeful class dynamic when it came to her involvement in our experience. The only weakness that comes to mind at this point is the fact that most scientific studies and articles we got to practice our skills on were from the professor's field of behavioral biology\/anthropology. This was a bit daunting and alienating at first, though along the course of the class I got used to it and was able to engage with these materials more quickly than before. I would suggest adding studies\/articles from other fields for practice purposes."

                "Yes because it was fun but there was a lot of work",
                "I would not recommend this course to any student. The professor was incredibly difficult to work with and made racially insensitive comments. The syllabus itself is loose and vague, so the actual classes are also loosely defined. A good portion of the readings (especially at the beginning) are not about science at all, but about his personal teaching strategy. The first and second classes were about how we (as dutiful students) should platform and listen to white supremacists, and how sensitive people are nowadays when it comes to white supremacy. The first midterm was graded arbitrarily (for a certain question, the TA read the answers all at once ranked them by how much she liked them and gave grades according to rank), and the second midterm was significantly better but still arbitrary. Overall, if you appreciate consistency and clarity, this is not the course for you.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any and every student, in any year, from any field\/major, with any level of scientific understanding and experience with statistical analysis, from the most basic to the most advanced. I have never encountered a course quite like this before. If you care even a little bit about the way scientific work affects our lives and our society, I urge you to take it. For my fellow humanities majors, TAKE THIS COURSE! Especially if you would like to take a useful science course that will stay with you."
