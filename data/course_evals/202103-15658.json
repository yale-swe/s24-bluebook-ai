I not only learned procedures to solve problems but Math 112 explained theorems and logic with math I never thought about or learned. I took Calc 1 and 2 in high school, but Calc 1 at Yale made me love math after hating it and despite coming in with tools and skills that were sufficient to continue to Calc 3, I learned soooooo much and definitely got way better at solving problems and really understanding how to approach weird examples."

                "Taught extremely well but a little fast.",
                "Ian is a great teacher and there are lots of resources for help if needed.",
                "I think the strengths of this course was how organized it was. However, I think a weakness of the course it the difficulty that ranges from in class to the PSETS and class. In class there are basic examples given but in the PSETS the problems are far more complex and it is difficult to make that shift without any guidance.",
                "This course was very difficult, but some of the peer tutors really enhanced my experience.",
                "I wish there was more of a background sometimes on the basic aspects of this course because sometimes it seems they assume a lot of knowledge of the students coming in. I did love the ximeras though they were super helpful and helped me keep organized by unit as well. The practice tests I think were my favorite they were really incredibly helpful when studying for exams.",
                "The class is very well organized however I wish the exams were more reflective of what we the material we focus on in class and less of them being challenging. I also wish we got actual feedback showing us what exactly we did wrong on a pset or exam (or some sort of master key of psets and previous exams).",
                "Strengths: IAN ADELSTEIN. He truly cares about his students and has a passion for teaching and it is reflected in class everyday. He is such an amazing professor and although I am not a math person, he definitely made the class go by fast and was very enjoyable",
                "I though the teaching was very clear and I felt prepared for each PSet and homework assignment. One thing I really appreciated was how accessible the peer tutors are. It really made a difference in my ability to perform in the class.",
                "I thought this course was very well structured.",
                "Strengths: The classes were very well structured, and I liked that we had Ximera to consolidate our learning as well. The PSETs were challenging, however Kexin is a great tutor. There are also so many resources at our fingertips.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Midterms/final significantly more difficult than what we learned in class, however, there is a plethora of practice midterms/exams to help us get used to the more difficult problems.",
                "My strengths in this course were my engagement in each class and my understanding of the material thanks to Ian explaining things well.",
                "Weaknesses- occasional issues with scheduling around the academic calendar and students time. I think having a Ximera due during Wed. of October recess and having two psets due 4 days apart (1 during reading week) is not great. I also think it would be more beneficial to student success not to have exams in the evening because this makes it difficult for students with sections and evening commitments. \r\nStrengths- My individual instructor made a clear effort to be inclusive and engaging during class.",
                "Strengths are Ximera which serves as another aide for understanding the content. Weakness would be the structure of the course. I learned more outside of the classroom than during class.",
                "I believe that the material covered was too simple to be stretched out for a semester-long course. What I have been observing this past semester is that some students found the material self-explanatory and were confused even as in why it was being taught as a relatively hard subject. Yet, this class provided me with knowledge and new skills of thinking which I hope will be applicable in the future.",
                "The course strengths: organized material completed in a timely manner, good amounts of helpful homework through Ximera, the psets were easily understood with TAs as well. The only weakness I can think of is better clarity on where to get help and how to get help. What are my resources if I do not understand something. Honestly, this was not made clear in the beginning of the year."

                "Yes, with Ian Adelstein. He is wonderful. I took Calculus AB in high school, so this course was a bit of a recap. However, it is taught differently than it is in high school. It's more conceptual, and we don't use calculators to look up graphs at all in this course.",

                "I highly recommend math 112 to any math student who is even the slight bit shaky on their math concepts or trying to complete higher levels of math at Yale. This is because it is such a foundational class to prepare you for Calc 2 and 3. The emphasis on \"why\" you are solving for something and \"why\" you are doing it is amazing to keep you engaged and really think about what your solving rather than just calculating an arbitrary value."
