I had never taken a stats class in high school, and I had only learned a little about probability during one unit in math during my junior year of high school, so this was all a lot of new and useful information for me. Even if the learning was a little tedious at times, it was all very interesting, and probability and statistics are tools that I will undoubtedly use in some of my future courses. After we built these tools during the first half of the course, we moved onto applying these tools and learning about linear regressions, differences in differences, and regression discontinuities, all with the goal of trying to measure causality. To do this, we also looked at real sets of data from real economic experiments, and performed these methods on that data. I also learned how to use the programming language R."

I appreciated how many peer tutor hours and TF hours were available and I thought a strength was establishing study groups for the semester. I think a weakness would be how the problem sets were organized. It was clear that a new person was writing each one as one week would have a lot of hints or advice and the next would have none of that. I think having them be more homogenous would be nice. But I did love how many examples and actual data sets we got to work with.",
                "strength: you learn useful stuff\r\nweaknesses: i think lectures are very boring. the professor speaks very fast kinda monotone but honestly it probably isn't his fault that the material was dry...",
                "strength: humphries is great and super sweet and you can tell he's passionate about social justice through the lens of data analysis which is super important work\r\nweakness: coding, literally take it out bc no one enjoys it and you don't test us on it",
                "The problem sets had good datasets that were actually pretty interesting to learn about, which shows how the skills from the class are directly applicable to real econometrics. The exam was also very fair, and Professor Humphries was great at explaining concepts.",
                "I didn't always follow the lectures, but partly that is due to the hefty content. Great resources and the p-sets weren't as bad as I anticipated.",
                "Strengths: John Eric is wonderful! He explained things clearly and answered questions well. He and the TFs were super responsive on Ed discussion, which I appreciated for psets. The graders left helpful notes on psets. The slides were organized and easy to refer back to. The exams and psets exposed me to some really interesting papers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: honestly, not many. This isn't the kind of class that people usually rave about, but it does a great job teaching the content it's supposed to teach.",
                "I enjoy the easy access to all materials if one were to not be able to make it to class every day.",

                "Strengths: You will learn so many useful skills in this course. John Eric is super organized and has great slides on all of the topics. He also does a great job reviewing the key concepts. \r\nWeaknesses: There is so much information that it is overwhelming at times. I wish we had more time to understand the applications of what we were learning a bit better, because at times, I felt like I had a lot of knowledge but struggled to apply it. I think it would be better if we had more time in class to talk through analyzing the data rather than just going over the methods of analyzing. I also think a stats bootcamp at the beginning of the semester would be helpful, because as someone coming into the course with little stats knowledge, it was hard to catch up.",
                "strengths: many office hours, interesting problem sets.\r\nweaknesses: didn't learn as much R as I had hoped to.",
                "Strengths: The first lecture was awesome. Lecture slides were clear and helpful for reviewing the material. The homepage on Canvas organized everything really well. Creating real-world application for even the simple early concepts made everything more fun. The Section Notes and section itself were really, really helpful to me in understanding the material. Overall, just a wonderful class. Office hours were helpful (Emir was especially great). \r\nImprovements: I didn't understand the final lecture about Machine Learning all that well. I got the vague idea that machine learning was using huge multiple linear regressions, and it was important to remove the coefficients that were there just by chance, and that the data is broken into three parts. But I didn't feel I understood specifics about how ML worked--like what LASSO was exactly.",
                "One of the biggest highlights of the course was that it was extremely well organized, probably one of the best-organized classes that I've taken so far at Yale. Additionally, the content was pretty interesting and the problem sets were overall manageable.",
                "Strengths: This course is absolutely amazing! The teaching team was great and seemed really committed to helping students. I took this course in spring 2023, but dropped it since I was entirely unable to understand the concepts and it felt like there was no support for students(like I genuinely learned NOTHING). Consequently, I dreaded this course so much this semester and was expecting to hate it, but I ended up absolutely loving it. Professor Humphries is great, the TFs were awesome, and there was a lot of resources provided for students. This course is the reason that I'm pursuing an S&Ds certificate. If you can take this class with Prof. Humphries, do it! I also loved how the lectures in this class are recorded, how students received helpful and informative responses on EdDiscussion, and how students had access to annotated notes. \r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "Strengths: the content is decently interesting and the problem sets were excellently designed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were sometimes very dry and the overemphasis on probability theory feels like a mistake.",
                "I think the course is inherently a little dull/theory heavy until post-midterm, which is when we started learning about regression and experimental methods that real researchers use. However, I really appreciated the effort put into creating interesting psets that used interesting economic datasets in cool ways, and I appreciated Professor Humphries' good vibes + energy as well!!! Definitely a bit of a challenging course, but it's set up well for learning, and I appreciated the sections, low-stakes quizzes, and the availability of practice exams",
                "Clear expectations, many graded assignments, thorough slides, good professor",
                "truly well executed.",
                "I thought it was generally a wonderful course. No weaknesses.",
                "Very strong courses. Problem sets were well designed to help you learn. Exams were reasonable and lectures were well delivered. Sections were also well delivered and office hours were very helpful. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness, I think the section of the course about variances/covariances/continuous and discrete probability functions felt a bit jumpy. The explanations were good but it took taking a step back to fully understand everything.",
                "Overall I found this course to be very accessible. The lectures were very clear, Professor Humphries was available after lecture and during office hours for questions, there were many helpful Teaching Fellow's for questions and psets, the sections had useful reviews of each weeks' lectures, there were various practice exams and review sessions before exams, and Professor Humphries created summary lectures that contained most of the important information from each part of the course. The only thing I can think of to improve the course is providing more opportunities to practice the \"a little bit harder\" type of questions to better prepare for the final.",
                "Strength: clear expectations, homework problems manageable for someone without any R programming background, and Prof Humphries teaches at a good pace for the class. Weaknesses: sections aren't very helpful, but other than that, just a solid foundation course to take.",
                "Strengths: structure, problem set quality\r\nWeakness: Quiz questions, lecture style",
                "The material is interesting and applicable to disciplines beyond economics. The lectures are very good. The psets are kind of fun. The only issue was that there were instances during the midterm, the final, and many problem sets where questions had to be corrected after they were issued.",
                "I liked the online quizzes as a way to check your understanding without killing your grade as it was only worth 5 percent. However, I would of preferred if each answer had a more complete explanation when you got it wrong. I would often get a couple questions wrong on the quizzes but never actually understand why I was wrong because there was either a tiny explanation or none. \r\n\r\nI also thought there was a great amount of TA and peer tutoring available for the course. As someone who struggled a bit with the content, having so many people doing so many different hours was incredibly useful",
                "Strengths of this course were the psets, which were long, but used R and real-life datasets to solve problems using actual data and programming. Another strength was the professor and teaching fellows making the learning environment more inviting and available to the students. I think one weakness of the course was that the theoretical problems in the psets should have been less theoretical and more practice problems with numbers, which I think would have helped with doing similar problems on the exams.",
                "The material in class was explained well, and the sections were lifesavers. The bulk of the course built up to and was explained in the last two weeks it felt like, and I blinked and we had covered it all, which meant that studying for the final was very painful but doable. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the class and found it to be very interesting. \r\n\r\nThe class is super well organized and psets are long but reasonable. More explanations/better examples of R code (such as R template code for psets) would have saved some pain but otherwise everything was good.",
                "The teaching is excellent, and the material and psets are very interesting. However, the beginning of the course is a little slow.",
                "The course did not have any official learning material but the slides and rough notes provided were very clear and easy to follow and learn from. The lectures themselves could have been more interactive as I feel though the professor was very passionate about what he was talking about and making sure he would answer questions, many tended to dose off or not attend the lectures at all as they were recorded (this is a strength as well however for reviewing content or small nuances missed in class). The class could have been more interactive by for example asking students to vote on a case study to use or having quizlets in class for the quizzes. The quizzes themselves were quite short and though provided to boost our grades and ensure we were understanding general concepts in the class, I believe they could have covered more content or synthesized our knowledge better if given slightly longer questions.",
                "- Strengths: Super organized, clear lessons/teaching/powerpoints, class notes & slides, problem sets & quizzes help encourage learning and engagement throughout the semester, Prof Humphries teaches super clearly, ties in real-world examples, and is a really engaging lecturer\r\n- Weaknesses: n/a",
                "Wish this was taught on the blackboard and not slides.",
                "Slides are very straightforward and easy to understand, overall the pace of the course is also really good.",
                "Strengths: covers material well.",
                "I liked the theme a lot: solving the question of causation. The course was very well crafted with case studies and applications.",
                "Strengths: Professor Humphries is a very engaging professor! Well organized! I really liked the notes that the Professor posted. The midterms were fair, and so were the problem sets.\r\nWeaknesses: Office hours were not great",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it is very practical and very applied. I'm not saying by any means that learning all the theory behind probability and stats is useless, but for someone who has never taken probability or stats before, they may not want to dive right into the theory right away. They might prefer to learn it for the first time in a practical and applied setting. I was one of these people. Now that I have begun to learn about probability and stats and now that I know that I find it interesting, I may decide to take other courses that are focused on the theory, but having taken this course first was a great experience for me. Another strength of this course is that it was very well organized. There is a lot of material that has to be covered in this course in not a lot of time, and so if the course were not so well organized, then it could become pretty challenging to master all of the material."

                "Yes, if you're willing to pay attention in lectures and work hard on the p-sets, it'll go well. There are great resources and its an interesting class. It is hard though, but not as bad as people say.",
                "Take this with John Eric!!! You are likely only considering this class if it's required for your major, but know that there is a big difference in experience depending on who you take it with.",
                "Foundational course for Econ. Tough but necessary",
                "Yes if it is required for your major",
                "Yes, I would totally recommend this course! It is difficult at times, but if you use the resources (like section), you will learn a lot.",
                "If you're not an Econ major, it'd probably be wise to take some other statistics course. I think I wish I had taken SATS 230 instead.",
                "YES! Even if you're not an econ major, this course would be an awesome way to learn statistics (it was my first ever stats/probability class). We saw so many cool applications of the concepts we learned, and the stuff about causality at the end was especially great. Make sure you take the course with Professor Humphries. He's an excellent teacher. And Jaime has great sections. Have a positive attitude about the course. People will complain, but you should ignore them and just realize how awesome the stuff you're doing in the class is--it's so relevant to so many things in the real world.\r\nI think the course is a bit easier if you have some coding experience (doesn't have to be R). I took CS50 at the same time, and that made the coding easier for me. Maybe do a little coding over the summer to prepare. There are tons of free, fun resources online. But even if you don't have coding experience, you will be fine. You have two weeks for the problem sets. Add them to your weekly schedule, and go to office hours, and you'll be great.",
                "Yes 100%. I think that everyone should, to some extent, have some experience with coding and statistics, and this class offers a great introduction.",
                "Yes, it's probably required anyways.",
                "Yes! It's probably a major requirement for you, but if you have to take it, do it with Professor Humphries. It takes a bit of work to understand the concepts, and I sometimes wished slides moved a bit slower, but it was an interesting and well-structured course overall! I did have a stats and R background before this class (AP stats and s&ds230) though so I'm not sure how much harder it would be without that",
                "Yes, its a no-surprises econ course that does a great job giving a grounding in data science.",
                "This course is a very fair and well organized approach to econometrics.",
                "Absolutely. Teaching staff were wonderful, content was interesting.",
                "Yes, most people are probably taking it because they are economics majors. But regardless, it's a really good introduction to statistics as is relevant to economics/social science. Enjoyed working with data from actual papers in R and on problem sets.",
                "take it if you want to get a ground knowledge in statistics in the context of economics and social sciences",
                "Yes. This course provided a great background in basic statistics and provided a fundamental understanding of how to analyze data and apply it to a population. It also taught me what to look out for in any sort of study using data, and has opened my eyes to consider the various omitted variables that might be missed or even intentionally overlooked when data is used to argue a claim. This is clearly applicable to life no matter what career I might go into, as understanding politics is something that everyone should learn, and these skills are great for interpreting the evidence behind government actions and decisions.",
                "Yes - start the psets early so you have time to troubleshoot R programming questions, but other than that, follow the syllabus and expectations which are clearly laid out. Solid course. Take it with Prof Humphries if you can, I heard he's the best teacher and it's no wonder. He's good at explaining concepts and teaches at a good pace. I never felt completely lost in this course.",
                "Yes, it's important content and definitely helps you understand research papers better",
                "I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's interested in data analysis, even if economics isn't their thing, particularly if Prof. Humphries is teaching.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I took econ 117 as a freshman with no coding experience and minimal economics experience. Nevertheless, I feel like I have ended the course with a basic understanding of R ( I really was useless before and now i'm still pretty bad but better than at the start).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they want a good solid background in econometrics and statistics and if they're majoring in economics. I think the exams were fair, and there were a lot of practice exams beforehand which helped with understanding concepts more, and discussion sections that emphasized concepts in class also helped a lot.",
                "Yes! Be prepared to work: the material that is the primary focus of the course (data analysis from experiments) can be a little confusing, but is absolutely understandable if you dedicate some time to doing so. Also, the course is not super math heavy (the first half is the only part that is a little more reliant on math because it is a probability and statistics refresher), so if that is something you are worried about, don't be!",
                "Yes, it's a doable course for anyone, and most material is explained well.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course! R is generally useful and much of the causality and probability theory is valuable even if you aren't an econ major.",
                "Yes, this class is great for those who plan on doing economic research in the near future. It introduces basic concepts used to do research and the professor is a great resource for any kind of economic research I believe.",
                "Definitely!",
                "Not unless it is a requirement for the major.  As someone who has never taken stats, I felt constantly behind in this course and there was not that much help to catch up besides the PSETs which almost every does well in.",
                "Would recommend. If you're doing S&DS as well, I would recommend taking this with 241, they go together quite nicely since you're learning similar things in the first half of both courses (slightly different pacing but still good).",
                "Yes, if there is an interest in statistical reasoning.",
                "Yes, students who like statistics, but isn't their main focus of study, would enjoy taking this course.",
                "Yes! It's likely that it's a required class, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student if they want to learn about probability and stats, especially through an economic lens. You do not need to have taken probability or stats before to do well in this class, nor do you have to have taken any computer science. This is also a good class to take if you want to gain some basic experience with the programming language R. I would honestly recommend this course to any student since it is accessible to everyone and you will learn a lot of useful and applicable skills."
