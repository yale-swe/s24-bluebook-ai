Sun is a kind professor, and it was clear she was invested in our learning over the course of the semester. However, the course was pretty disorganized. The first few weeks when we covered models were great, but after that the course often diverged from the syllabus. We didn't end up covering the last 3 subjects on the syllabus, and missed 2 class sessions that were never rescheduled.",

                "Strengths: Some of the papers we read were really cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Lee. I heard great things about her from previous classes, but she was really disorganized this semester."
