   "comments": [
    "Examining, analyzing, and forming an argument about a poem, then articulating that argument in an essay - there's a lot more to a poem than just metaphors and rhymes! The different levels of a poem can actually argue two different stances on the same subject, which is just wonderfully complicated, and this class really helped me learn to read a poem and really understand what the poet is trying to tell me - to look past the superficial subject, tone, and argument and dig into the form, poetic devices, rhythm, diction, etc. and figure out exactly what the poem makes me feel, and how it does that.",
    "Marta is extremely good at what they do. They made an extraordinary effort to meet with me one-on-one and make sure that I was keeping up with the rest of the class. They always had extensive background information ready to share about authors we were reading and the context in which their poems were written. I appreciated that because it helped and carried over into the research and analysis part of the papers.",
    "I learned a lot about English Poetry and also about history. I'm a better writer and analytical thinker now.",
    "It was great experience for poetic analysis, but not much else. I definitely improved as an essay writer both in quality and speed.",
    "My poetic analysis skills developed a lot during this course and I feel that Prof Figlerowicz helped us to look deeply into the text, beyond the obvious literary devices and rather than say what devices were use, to look at the effect of those devices on the overall message of the piece. I feel that I learned how to talk about poetry and my analyses with much more confidence and how to develop deep conversations about the text in class discussions, bouncing back and forth with ideas from other classmates.",
    "I learned how to read difficulty texts, from the Middle English of Chaucer to the winding syntax of Milton. Specifically, I learned how to balance close reading with more broadly focused, theme-based reading because we had to read long poems like Paradise Lost and The Canterbury Tales. Even collections of sonnets, like Shakespeare's, were helpful in developing this mixed reading because my peers were very attentive towards the broader themes, and Professor Figlerowicz also made sure to guide discussions toward a consideration of how a single poem played into an author's wider collection of works. Professor Figlerowicz's workshops on essay writing strategies were also very helpful in walking us through how to better compose an essay.",
    "Besides first-time exposure to Chaucer, Donne, and Milton, I gained a stronger understanding of how to evaluate poetry. I'm also no longer daunted by Middle English!",
    "I learnt a huge amount about early English literature, and in an environment where I could simultaneously improve my knowledge and my writing skills",
    "This was a great survey course of English poetry from Chaucer to Milton. It helped me develop my close reading and essay writing skills.",
    "I developed profound insight as how to approach literary analysis. I also learned about the historical forces shaping poetry, formal elements in poetry, as well as various poetic forms.",
    "I learned a great deal about a genre of poetry that I previously had minimal experience with. I also improved my analytical writing significantly.",
    "I learned how to appreciate poetry and write more interesting\/powerful papers!",
    "I learned a survey selection of English poetry. I loved being able to immerse myself and take time to enjoy and discuss pieces such as Paradise Lost and The Canterbury Tales. My essay writing also improved quite drastically, thanks to the professor.",
    "We read from Chaucer to Milton, The Canterbury Tales to Paradise Lost. I learned how to write an English paper and to apply close reading skills both in class and to my assignments."

   "comments": [
    "I wish we could have spent more time on Spencer! It was so weird and engaging, and I really wanted to read more about the rest of the story. That said, I do also recognize that we had just finished Chaucer, so another tale with a similar tone might have been a bit exhausting after a while. I really appreciated the days where we just learned how to examine and write about a poem, instead of just doing it - it felt like it leveled the playing field, so that there weren't just the kids who knew how to talk about poetry contributing to the discussion. Since everyone knew how to read analytically, everyone brought their own wonderful insights into the discussion. I also really felt like I understood what was expected of me in the papers - I wasn't just groping around in the dark; a habit, unfortunately, that I've had to learn to navigate in other classes with less clear instruction.",
    "I think that as a department, the structure of English 125 has to be relooked. I think that having workshops is not beneficial, rather is a waste of time, and that reading Paradise Lost in 3 weeks is not enough time to truly delve into the beauty of the poem.",
    "I greatly enjoyed this course. I think all the texts we read were very interesting and I greatly enjoyed the discussions we had. Perhaps more of a diversity of assignments could have been fun.",
    "Discussions are usually engaging despite the dryness of the material. Could be improved by covering more historical contextthis would at least make the course more interesting.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was definitely the class discussion. The reading material could have been boring and quite dull, but Prof Figlerowicz facilitated really interesting conversations about the texts and made talking about it fun! Rather than suffer through Chaucer and Milton, I and the rest of the class genuinely enjoyed them. She also helped us through the writing process, especially with textual analysis and how to incorporate quotes while also emphasizing our own interpretations and opinions. Sometimes the blog posts seemed a little monotonous, especially toward the end of the semester when we didn't have a prompt and just wrote about something in the reading, but overall I didn't see much of a weakness in the course.",
    "I can think of no real weaknesses with the course. It's you'd expect for an intro level English course, though there is less babying than what you'd get in ENGL 114 or 115. That being said, if you haven't taken those courses (I didn't), Professor Figlerowicz was always willing to meet with students to discuss drafts. The biggest strengths of the course were the people. I could tell that my peers really cared about what we were reading, and they always brought insightful comments to class discussion. In addition, Professor Figlerowicz is one of the best professors I've had at Yale thus far. She's very understanding and is always willing to help you when you reach out to her. Furthermore, she is extremely skilled in guiding discussions - such a clear, sharp thinker.",
    "Strengths -- Marta is a phenomenal discussion leader. Super approachable, gives tons of feedback if you seek it out. The chosen texts were also very good. \/\/ Weaknesses -- while I liked our short weekly discussion posts on Canvas, I sometimes felt lost with the complete freedom to choose a topic. Especially with longer, more complex texts like Paradise Lost, I think I would've gotten slightly more out of the material with some guiding prompts or questions to think about.",
    "The breadth of the course is great, but due to the number of materials covered it means that some of the lyric poetry in particular is not studied in particular depth as there is not the time. I loved studying Paradise Lost in its entirety and in depth - for me, that was the best part of the course",
    "Strength is the teaching, which helped with creating productive seminars and gave excellent paper writing feedback.",
    "I appreciated how the essays progressively increased in length and the integration of blog responses into the curriculum.  I also appreciated Professor Figlerowicz's flexibility and willingness to meet one-one with students to help them with their writing. I wish more guidance was given regarding literary analysis at the beginning of the course. I also would strongly suggest restructuring the essay workshops in order to ensure clarity.",
    "I think we spent too little time with Spencer; it would be better to skip it, and perhaps do more Shakespeare.",
    "Strengths: Professor Figlerowicz always helped put an interesting twist on whatever we were reading so it was never dry. We had a lot of freedom in our papers and she was always available to meet beforehand to help plan\/go over drafts. No real weaknesses I can think of.",
    "I wish we could have skewed the course towards less songs, and more time to peruse through The Canterbury Tales and Paradise Lost. Also I find workshops very helpful and wish we had more of those!",
    "I think the pace is well thought out. It is an introductory\/foundational course to the major, and I think the structure of the course is accommodating to different types of students taking the course. I almost wish we had our essay assignments earlier than we had received them, because it would have been helpful to think about what to write through the reading process."

    "I've had students in STEM majors ask about classes they should take if they're interested in broadening their literary experience, and this is the class I recommend every time. Not only does it feel even (that is, every student is prepared through the coursework to contribute to discussion and write satisfying literary papers), but it also facilitates a depth of conversation that I feel is sometimes lacking from other English courses, which are filled with mostly English majors whose brains are trained to focus on the same, specific things in a way that biology, computer science, psychology, history, etc. majors are not - the conversation brought thoughts into the discussion that I felt like really helped me understand the poems from different angles. The poems themselves, too, were incredibly diverse and illuminating, and the instruction of the professor gave me a lot of insight into the actual history, biography, etc. that the poems were introduced into, revealing a lot about how poetry changes through time. The diversity, too, of the poets made the class feel more accessible!",
    "Yes, but only if they are picking between the prerequisite requirements for the major (4 of the 5 courses between 125 and 129).",
    "Yes. English Poetry has something to teach everyone.",
    "Ehhh...if you're an English major, the other three prereqs are probably more interesting. Definitely less reading than 127 and 128, though. I would only take it if Prof. Figlerowicz was teaching again.",
    "Well, considering that this course qualifies as one of the three foundational courses required for the English major, I would say that it is a good choice and gives a solid grounding in the roots of English poetry. Even if you aren't an English major, I would recommend the course if you have any interest in poetry because I found it very interesting to see how these works influence the entirety of the poetic world that comes later. If you're just taking it for a WR credit, this probably isn't the class for you - there are more current, easier classes you could choose that are probably more interesting as well.",
    "Yes, and that's a lot for me, considering that I don't like reading old things. I took this course as a kind of \"eat-your-vegetables\" course, thinking that there was value (as indeed there is value) in studying canonical works. While I know that discussions over the value that we place on the \"canon\" have validity in their questioning of its worth, I do think that one can learn how to be a better thinker and writer by studying and writing about these works. That being said, that doesn't mean that you can't do so with world literature courses for example (cough, cough @theEnglishDepartment). If you're choosing between ENGL 125 and ENGL 128, don't choose ENGL 125 because you think it would be \"good for you.\" Make sure that you're genuinely interested in the works on the syllabus. I wasn't, so I really got lucky with my amazing classmates and Professor Figlerowicz, who helped to make the at times, not-so-enjoyable readings bearable. In fact, there were many times that I left class with a new appreciation for the works because of their insights.",
    "Yes, absolutely especially with Fig",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, especially with Marta!!",
    "Yes - the works covered in this course are classics and are hugely influential on the works that followed them, and even on literature today. The emphasis on writing allows you to develop your writing style and skills in a relaxed but focused environment",
    "I would recommend this to any student interested in a survey of English poetry from Chaucer to Milton. It is also a great class to improve your paper writing skills.",
    "Yes if and only if the student has a particular interest in the subject or the class is required for the student's major.",
    "Yes, but probably only for English majors or those with interest in this type of poetry.",
    "Yes, definitely! Especially if you're considering the English major.",
    "Yes! For sure. My writing improved very much.",
    "I would recommend this course to both English majors and non-majors. It's a great introduction to literature at Yale, especially if you've never taken a literature course before!"
