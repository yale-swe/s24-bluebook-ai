   "comments": [
    "I learned more about the early centuries of Christianity and improved my writing abilities.",
    "As a writing seminar, Professor Doerfler was very helpful in improving my writing. I came in thinking I knew what I was doing, but she quickly shut that down and guided me on how to improve.",
    "This course taught me to really think about everything I read and every bit of information that someone passes along to me because things are rarely what they seem. Though everything we learned was in the context of religious documents and understanding things like the motive of the writer and whether or not the work is what it seems, I believe that this philosophy applies to almost all situations. Professor Doerfler also helped us learn to critically analyze texts in a way that was productive for our in-class discussions and helped us to develop thoughtful and insightful conversations about our studies.",
    "I learned about forgeries, alternative New Testament narratives, Gnosticism, and how orthodoxy is about whoever wins the power struggle.",
    "I became more comfortable working with ancient texts and primary sources while learning to think about Christianity in a more nuanced way",
    "I learned so much about how the bible was canonized and the history of the bible that are all so fascinating to me because of a personal investment due to my religious beliefs. Everything, especially the way I learned to critically analyze the bible, is super applicable in my life and I think are skills I will carry with me for the rest of my life. This class changed the way I view religion and Christianity, and I will forever be grateful for that.",
    "This was an interesting approach to the development of early Christianity. I became more familiar with analysis of historical sources from antiquity.",
    "How to evaluate religious texts as a scholar. I am more open to different perspectives and beliefs, and have learned to challenge my own.",
    "I was able to improve my critical and analytical thinking skills as well as employ those skills in written format. I improved generally in essay writing, specifically developing arguments, maintaining consistency throughout the paper, as well as translating ideas properly.\r\n\r\nI have a deeper and more robust understanding of early Christian history and literature and I was able to gain satisfactory answers for the questions the drew me to the course, such as why certain texts were not canonized.\r\n\r\nI also improved my reading ability and speed, and my ability to do comparative analyses between texts has improved greatly. I've also learned how to analyze texts objectively, without allowing personal biases influence my observations.",
    "Familiarity with canonical and noncanonical Christian texts, greater understanding of landscape of the Christian tradition in the first and second centuries, analytical research ability",
    "First and foremost, I developed writing and deep reading skills. I also learned valuable time management skills; this course really challenged me to do all the work ahead of time and plan my workload accordingly so that I would have ample room to put meaningful effort into all my work."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The small discussion format was great.",
    "This course's strengths are its small size, the setup of the course and course assignments, and the professor and teaching fellow.\r\nThe only improvement I could suggest would be to have students provide feedback on all essays throughout the semester, perhaps in a discussion board on Canvas, because that was immensely helpful when writing my final paper.",
    "This was such a fun course and very much my favorite class this semester. I loved discussions with classmates and learning about different perspectives and interpretations. I only wish we had more time to talk about the texts because sometimes we'd read three texts, focus on one, touch on another, and not really get into the third when there are aspects in all three I'd like to talk about. Also, not having to print so many pages and use so much paper would be nice.",
    "I found that mandatory discussion posts helped to hold me accountable for readings, but I sometimes found class discussions to be less engaging- especially when we didnt have time to discuss all of the readings. Classes often ran a little late too.",
    "Strengths are the syllabi and the teacher and the level of engagement and class discussions. I honestly see no weaknesses.",
    "This course could be improved with a stronger communication of what grade a student is getting.",
    "Strengths: small seminar therefore students get a lot of individual attention-- as much as one wants. \r\nWeaknesses: Often it is the same few students speaking",
    "The strength of this course was the reading list and its organization. The class was organized into major themes within Christianity, from which we did comparative analyses between canonical and non-canonical scriptures. These themes helped us to compartmentalize all the information we were exposed to and was useful in later parsing through it for further analysis. The readings were also robust, and interesting. The provided great exposure to the breadth of available literature and kept us interested in class discussions.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that sometimes the readings were very long. This would not be a problem if not for the fact that sometimes those long readings are not discussed in class. I think it is great to read beyond the scope of the class, but those assignments should not be too intense.",
    "The workload of the course was appropriate, and all the texts Professor Doerfler assigned were interesting.  Writing the responses to each reading additionally helped me stay engaged and ensured that I had a few talking points for when I came to class.  The classroom, being a technology-free zone (no computers, phones, tablets, etc.), was very conducive to learning, and I felt like all the students were engaged during class.",
    "This class explores the world of early Christianity and late antiquity in a wide range, and it goes through many of the major early Christian and Gnostic texts that influenced Christianity. It's very interesting, and the professor doesn't take anything for granted; for example, at the beginning of the semester we spent a lot of time studying orthodox Christianity and reading the Bible so that we could be comfortable with orthodox Christianity before we delved into Gnosticism. On the other hand, I thought that sometimes we spent too little time on some readings and topics, and I wish we could've gone deeper into some topics."

   "comments": [
    "I would greatly recommend this course. Prof. Doerfler is amazing and extremely knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "If you have the chance to take this course, go ahead and do it. It was one of my favorite courses and even as a pre-med, STEM major, it is a welcome reprieve from some of the more difficult courses you'll have to take. The fact that it covers either a WR or Humanities credit is also a plus.",
    "Absolutely. It's so much fun to discuss these ideas with peers and to see what we come away with. The professor and TF are also both great.",
    "Yes. This classes provided an incredibly fascinating and wonderful opportunity to both improve my writing and explore ideas (especially within Christianity) that are a part of my every day life.",
    "Only if youre really interested in Christianity in antiquity",
    "Yes, if they are prepared for the heavy workload. I think every one should take this class as it make me view religion adn Christianity in a completely different light.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! The professor is considerate of students. This was a great first writing credit because I had the time and feedback to construct the papers. Rather one is personally religious or not this is a thought provoking class.",
    "I would definitely, recommend this course to other students. I think the subject matter is extremely interesting and pertinent to today's society given the bible and Christianity's role in it, and also the teacher does an amazing job of explaining difficult topics and making the literature accessible to other students. The essays, while few, also dramatically improve one's analytical writing ability.",
    "Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course to another student.  The material has completely impacted my view on religion as a whole and my understanding of my own faith.  Professor Doerfler is not only an excellent lecturer but also facilitated discussion well.  She asked incisive questions that encouraged discussion, allowing me to learn from my other classmates.  The workload was manageable and interesting.  I was the most excited to come to this class this semester.",
    "I would, given that the student is willing to spend a lot of quality time on the readings and understand each reading. This class requires a lot of commitment and effort from the student, but if the student is willing to input that time and effort, it's a very rewarding class."
