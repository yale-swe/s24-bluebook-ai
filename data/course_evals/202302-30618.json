                "I had forgotten everything that I had previously learned about statistics in general, so I was learning all of the content anew.  I particularly enjoyed learning about hypothesis testing in general.  I believe that all the content learned in this course will be useful for me in the work I hope to do, and I plan to build upon this foundation both inside and outside of may coursework at Yale.",

                "After several weeks into the course I felt that the course needed to have been taught during a regular semester as the timeframe during the summer is too short. \r\nThe two summer months we spent focused on Biostatistics required a significant amount of focus and much time and effort was utilized for preparing for the course. \r\nMy efforts  involving my work and health issues suffered.  I had anticipated that Yale would not be easy but the amount of work for 535 was over the top for the amount time involved. \r\nMore time and perhaps more explanations of the subject matter needed to presented in the timeframe we had for this course. \r\nPlease consider teaching the course during the regular calendar year but not during the summer.",
                "I developed greater understanding of the different hypothesis tests that can be used in biostatistics in particular as well as the controversies surrounding p-values.",
                "Analytical tools and more critical thinking using a completely new platform, R. I also continued to learn time management skills.",
                "I learned more about R and statistical testing. I would like to ideally learn more about statistical testing and empiric techniques.",
                "I gained the knowledge, skills and insights in areas of both descriptive and inferential statistics. The newest skills I developed is learning about the R software language and its application in statistics.  Learning about parametric and non-parametric tests was also interesting and exciting.",
                "A large repertoire of mathematical and computer skills that will assist me in formulating research studies.",
                "This was an amazing course with an amazing professor. Mike is one of the best with innovative pedagogical methods!",
                "Strong foundations of biostatistical concepts\r\nProgramming in R",
                "I learned a lot more about R and was exposed to a LOT of real world examples where we needed to figure out what biostatistic methods should be used and then needing to properly apply them.",
                "I acquired knowledge about biostatistics generally, various hypothesis tests and use of R.",
                "I walked away with a better understanding of biostats. I do wish there was more time to soak in the information than just 7 weeks. There was so much information presented and evaluated on that Im not sure I got out of it what I put in.",
                "Wow, what a great course!  I learned R, Statistics and the many tests in statistics that are used in evaluation. It's hard to believe how much content we went through! \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think there should be a Biostats 2 or Quantitative Methods course added to the curriculum. IMHO there is more to learn. TBC - This does not imply that more content should be added to this course, it means the topic deserves more coursework further expanding topics and in other areas.",
                "Knowing when to ask help. Better at knowing what will be tested. Knowing how to learn difficult topics that I don't particularly like. I feel that I actually know something about biostatistics now, which should shock everyone.",

                "I created a weekly timeline to work through the content. The structured, asynchronous content was extremely helpful for reviewing while weekly attendance for the discussion and lab sections were imperative to my success.",
                "- Biostatistics Primer was beneficial \r\n- Also the textbook is a great add along \r\n- I completed all the labs \r\n- I also attempted all the quiz's -- practice and real [post the exception]",
                "I consulted different online sources and strictly followed the professor's live sessions, participated in discussions and ask question on areas I didn't understand.",
                "I studied immensely. I referenced lecture notes and the textbook. I asked questions of my lab instructor.",
                "The different learning methods consisting of videos, video transcripts, and slides.",
                "I really engaged in the scheduled discussion sections",
                "I printed the transcripts for the videos, asked many questions in my R lab work and watched the lab videos and often paused at the R formulas to better trouble shoot.",
                "I worked extremely hard at this course. Each week I watched the videos, read the transcripts to reinforce the learnings, attended lecture, completed the lab, attended lab session and asked questions on the discussion board. I also read supplemental materials to help solidify concepts.",
                "Its hard to say. It was a mad dash to the finish line, from before the class even started (primer). By the end of the 7 week class, I was finally getting in the swing of thing (videos, lecture, labs, discussions, quizes, exams, etc). I did have several discussions with Peggy and Mike on some concerns I had along the way which was very helpful.",
                "I feel the number one thing to be successful is the stay on top of the schedule and try to do some work every day and not wait until the last minute.\r\n\r\nI think the major challenge with this course is the time frame and how it is compressed. If, for some reason, you can't study one week, you are effectively two weeks of content behind. The course structure is a little complicated, video, problem sets, labs, office hours, textbook, sample quizzes, quizzes, and tests. But I do appreciate the learning methodology because if you can keep on top of the process, you can truly learn a tremendous amount fairly efficiently, given there is reinforced learning.",
                "I had to admit that I was not as smart as I thought? I asked for help and was not shy when I didn't know things. I started taking notes that helped as well as I am good at knowing what will be tested.",
                "- Listened to all pre-recorded lectures prior to the live sessions\r\n- Completed all labs prior to sessions with TF (working through the lab myself really helped me build my knowledge of R and also benefit from the sessions with the TF)\r\n- Prior to exams, reviewed materials (live sessions notes and transcripts from videos) and created a summary sheet that was useful as a reference on the exam and also helped synthesize knowledge"
