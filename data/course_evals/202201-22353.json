                "More weaknesses than strengths. If you're looking for a \"high school\" type of language learning experience, then this is the one for you -- most classes we get a worksheet, fill it out, then go over the answers all together. No movement around the class, no shuffling of seats, so you don't really get to know other people in the class. Sometimes there was textbook work - read the passage and answer the multiple choice questions, which I hated. Sometimes for class work, I thought \"what the heck is this\" with a disappointed face. When it seems the professor didn't put in much effort into developing interactive and varied lesson plans, the class is dull.",
                "I thought it was great to be able to speak with native speakers every week. There was a lot of busy work, but I guess that is necessary to learn a language.",
                "Professor Reymundi was very understanding and she is also very communicable to her students. Her feedback on compositions, exams, assignments, etc. were very helpful. I think a weakness would be the lack of guidance on the last two class projects. The difference from her class and the other Spanish class I took last semester was that my other professor made sure that we started our projects early and guided us as to what she expected out of it. Professor Reymundi just gave us a rubric without very clear instructions as to what she expects from the projects.",
                "A strength is the sturcture. We knew what was coming next and everything is clearly outlined in the syllabus with minimal changes. A weakness is the pace in which the course goes. We only have a semester and it is a lot of content to learn and retain rather than just regurgitate for tests.",
                "A strength of this course is that it really is full immersion and the teachers are very invested in your growth. We have many assignments during the week that help us enhance our abilities.",
                "Stregnth: Prof Reymundi is extremely kind, understanding and engaged with the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt lost when we needed to learn the material through Supersite before actually learning the grammar in class.",
                "Fast grading and good testing of my knowledge",

In general, the language department at Yale is known to be very rigorous and I think that the Spanish department is one of the most rigorous at Yale. It is very challenging but if you are someone who really wants to learn the language, I recommend that you take this class because it would really force you to learn the language.",
