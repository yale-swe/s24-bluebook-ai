                "Professor Frenkel described the topics from the seminar as the top hits of mathematics. The topics were very beautiful and had two main themes: Number Theory and Representation Theory. We had freedom when it came to choosing the topics but were encouraged to pick algebraic stuff (though there were some exceptions such as a couple of analytic number theory talks). I developed the skill of giving lectures and writing comprehensible handouts. This was very rewarding.",
                "I learned a lot about my topic, which focused on a branch of math I didn't know much about before and which isn't covered in any of the standard courses.  I also learned a smattering of other thing from other people's lectures.  Most importantly, I think this is good practice in learning a thing by yourself (albeit with some help from Professor Frenkel).  It's a very useful skill to be able to learn something difficult and lengthy without lectures or psets or other systems like that.",
                "For my iteration of the senior seminar, it just so happened that basically every talk was about either Elliptic Curves/Modular Forms or Representation Theory (with a few exceptions) so I gained a bit of exposure to those topics. You also get practice in preparing/delivering highly technical lectures."

                "I think it does what it intends to do perfectly. Professor Frenkel is extremely knowledgeable and seems to know all there is under the mathematical sun. He discussed many connections between topics that students chose that were incredibly interesting. It is fun to listen to your peers lecture so attending class was very enjoyable too.",
                "Professor Frenkel is very willing to meet and discuss with students as often as they would like, which is great.  The course forces you to learn a particular thing really well, which is fun.  The atmosphere is also very relaxed, and it was nice to come to class and just learn some math in a more casual way without the anticipation of being tested on it.  The course is to an extent as much or as little work as you want it to be.",
                "Strengths: Exposure to very interesting math I didn't see in prior coursework.\r\nWeaknesses: I think it would be good to make attendance mandatory (or at least prevent people from only coming occasionally) - I felt bad for some of the later presenters who had noticeably fewer people at their talks."

                "Yes.  Of course it fulfills the senior requirement, so you may want to take it just for that.  But regardless, it introduces some important topics which lie at the heart of modern math, and it teaches you how to study and prepare material independently.",
                "If you're a math major, it's either this or the essay - I think this is the better option for most people (it's also basically no work outside of your own presentation, so it's a chill semester).",
                "Yes, but I dont know why everyone says this class is super easy because putting the lecture together is low key hard and takes a good month or so of work. After that you dont have to do that much"
