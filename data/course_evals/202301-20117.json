                "French speaking, writing, grammar, listening, and reading skills; engaging with classmates in French; elements of French culture. This is the best class environment I've been in by far and at the end of the year I was able to talk to my French friends in actual French and they didn't laugh at me not even once. I've improved so much and I came to every single class with such joy",
                "This course has greatly improved my understanding of and ability in the French language. I am now more confident with the various rules as well as my ability to speak the language and understand when it is spoken.",
                "Compared to Fren 110, I saw incredible improvements in my understanding of French. I was able to truely grasp the mechanics of the language rather than just parts of it. I learned most of the tenses, expanded my vocabulary, and GREATLY improved my pronounciation of words. After completing L2, I feel like I can move on in working on more advanced skills and gain increased proficiency.",
                "-Further Development of French Grammar\r\n-I feel like, at the end of L1, I was 40-50% of the way to conversational/colloquial fluency, but at the end of this course I am nearing 80%.\r\n-Further Vocal development from L1, food, motor vehicles, transportation, states of emotion, housing and furniture, directions, more verbs\r\n-Less focus on tests than L1, biweekly tests instead of every week",
                "Various French grammar skills including different tenses (Passe Compose, imparfait, conditional, etc.) articles and pronouns, prononciation and auditory comprehension, and more.",
                "Elementary and intermediate grammar in French, including pass compos, imparfait, and subjonctif. Useful vocabulary for daily conversations on topics such as food and travel.",
                "I learned so much over the course of this semester. Not only did I learn a ton of new French vocabulary and grammar concepts, but I improved my French comprehension and speaking skills immensely. Professor Guan always created such creative and helpful exercises to get us speaking in new ways, and they greatly helped my French skills."

                "Nothing could be improved",
                "I think the course material is kind of outdated and the course is structure such that you have to constantly put in a lot of effort, which can be difficult some weeks.",
                "I'm having difficulties thinking about the weaknesses of this course, because there aren't any. As a stem student, I had a very heavy workload this semester with 5.5 credits and big cs lectures. Obviously my friends at the beginning of the semester told me to drop french especially because I didn't need to fulfill the language requirement. Not listening to them was easily one of the best choices I've made in my longer-than-the-average-undergrad life. Not only did my French actually improve, which I was very taken aback by as my 3+ years of high school French left me with nothing but je ne parle pas francais je suis americaine (I'm not even american), but I was able to destress & wind down every morning before walking up to science hill. I was very lucky because the French department in general has high standards and strict guidelines, but I met a good section and a good professor and throughly enjoyed my time learning French. I'm even considering taking L3 (again, not necessary) next semester alongside cs323 because I just really like how I talk in French.",
                "The French in Action syllabus for this course is rather outdated and I think this was the main weakness of the course. I believe that, had I been with a lesser professor, this would have hindered my engagement with the course and consequently the quality of my learning experience. I do however think that the course covers and develops topics that greatly improve one's comprehension of the language if engagement is sufficient.",
                "This course was incredibly engaging, in-part due to our wonderful professor. Having French every morning really allowed me to get to know my classmates and professor and form genuine bonds with them. The weaknesses in this course lies with its material. Using the Capretz French in Action Method has become outdated and classless. It emphasizes insignificant vocabulary (for instance 'telephone booth', 'cross-eyed', etc.) rather than actual important vocabulary like furniture, animals, parts of a house, food etc. Learning these required the profs to draw from materials outside French in Action. The workbook itself was incredibly boring and long - and in the end most students didn't even do it.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-The seminar environment is the clear strength of this curriculum; it really encourages conversation and exploring French at a personal level. I have taken Italian at another university, and while that course was still very good, it was more of a small lecture format, with seminar features. I think that Yale language excels primarily due to this seminar format, as you get to interact with the language on a more personal level.",
                "Sometimes if felt like we were learning grammar/vocab just for the sake of taking the test or because it showed up in a video",
                "The French In Action curriculum is detrimental to the course. The videos are boring and unengaging, making watching them and using them to actually study French a chore. The frequency of the course is helpful for learning, but going to class each day knowing we will have to talk about Robert and Mireille was something I dreaded each morning. The videos are outdated, providing vocabulary that is no longer useful or relevant.",
                "The course is well-organized, covering crucial grammar in the French language and useful vocabulary. I learned a lot through fun activities thanks to Xinyu. In terms of the the overall course design, sometimes the workbook, videos, and regular tests feel a bit disconnected, so I hope there can be a better complementary relationship between different parts.",
                "The strength of this course was absolutely Professor Guan's teaching. Both her and the other French instructors fostered such a high level of engagement among our class throughout the term. She not only came up with so many creative assignments to improve our vocabulary and grammar skills, but she engaged with each and every one of us on an individual level to provide specific advice on the areas with which we struggled. Throughout my time at Yale, I have never had a professor who is so willing to extend her office hours to accommodate students' schedules and answer their questions. This course had no weaknesses--it went above and beyond to make sure each of us had the support we needed to learn the difficult material. It was my favorite class of the year."

However, if Xinyu Guan is teaching, I would really recommend trying to be in her section. She is kind, she is a good instructor, and she tried to make your life easy.",
                "Yes I would. I almost don't want to recommend, because Xinyu is too good... this section should be mine and mine only... but if I were to recommend this course to myself a year ago I would do so definitely.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course. While my experience was bolstered by an amazing professor and classmates, I do believe that there is a lot to gain in terms of understanding and confidence in the language.",
                "Yes - in our globalized world, the importance of being able to speak another language is only growing. I took French because I love the culture and language. The Yale French Department here truely cares about improving the skills of its students. Though the class is hard, you truely do learn a lot and I believe that after finishing more of the levels, I will be confident in speaking with native French speakers.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in actually learning French, whether they love the culture, want to do business in francophone regions, or just love the language. Though I feel that French is grammatically that same difficulty as Spanish, (more difficult than Italian), I think that due to the difficulties in pronunciation and general speech patterns that French lends itself more to an active studier. Not that Spanish or Italian (I have taken Spanish to L3, and Italian to the L5 level) does not benefit from an active study, but I feel that one can \"get by\" easier without as much passion for the language. This is why I would recommend French to those who have a more active passion for it. I may be committing a faux pas by saying this, but there are several more \"useful\" languages for one to learn if they will be living in the United States, Mexican/Puerto Rican Spanish and Mandarin being the principle two that come to mind. Don't have fear to take this course, however, if you do not have as much passion for French. I took French L1 on a whim (they didn't offer the Italian class I wanted fall semester), and I loved it. If you have an inkling that French may be your thing, I would recommend trying it out, it is an incredible language and culture! I have not done as much study on French African cultures, but I met someone from Guinea who told me a bit about West-African culture, and it sounded like they had some real cool stuff going on as well!",
                "If they want to learn French, yes. This couse is the only option for those looking to learn French at Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if Xinyu teaches it. The workload is not light and the topics can be challenging, but you very useful language skills and build a solid foundation for future studies.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. French was one of my favorite classes this semester. Even though the material can be difficult, Professor Guan provided my classmates and I with an immense amount of support throughout the semester. She continually extended her office hours to answer our questions, and she was always willing to answer an email or meet throughout the day to help us with any material. Moreover, she fostered such a caring and fun environment among our class. Attending this class was the best part of my day, and I feel as if I got close to my classmates over the course of the semester. I am so grateful I decided to enroll in the French department this year."
