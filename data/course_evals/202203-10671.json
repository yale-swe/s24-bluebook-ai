                "Definitely learned quite a bit of the basics of the Spanish language, as well as Spanish culture. I took some Spanish in high school and definitely never learned as much\/got as confidently far in the language until this course.",
                "I learned how to read, speak, listen, and write Spanish on an elementary level. On top of vocabulary and grammar practice, I was also able to learn about the diversity of cultures (and languages) in Spanish-speaking countries and interact with my peers about these topics quite often.",
                "Since I had work for this class essentially everyday of the week, I found myself gradually getting more comfortable and confident in my speaking ability. I also feel that my level of vocabulary proliferated.",
                "I learned more about the Spanish language and Spanish-speaking counties and cultures. I feel like I developed a well-rounded understanding of the Spanish language by taking this class.",
                "I learned the basics of Spanish and how to have a conversation.",
                "I learned the foundations of speaking Spanish. This included the present test and past tense, as well as a bag full of vocabulary that I am now familiar with how to use in conversation. Additionally, I learned more about Spanish culture and its influence throughout the world.",
                "I learned a lot more about spanish culture and reviewed grammatical structures which I think will be very helpful going through the next few levels of spanish."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths  Engaging class. Does a good job at having us practice multiple skills: writing, reading, speaking, listening, etc. Engaging and lots of assignments, but I also didnt find the grading was harsh\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  More of a flag but its really fast paced, so time management and self organization is key. You cant really have an off week, as assignments are daily. I wouldnt say it really requires 2 hours of your day as the syllabus says, except immediately before projects and tests",
                "Strengths: the professor is very easy to communicate with (and responds quickly), the daily Vistas assignments constantly allow students to interact with Spanish (which promotes exposure), the interactive classroom environment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the weekly Canvas assignments don't always seem to incorporate the basic vocabulary from a certain week or unit very well; there were many times it felt as though I couldn't effectively answer assignment prompts because I didn't have a strong enough understanding of Spanish to do so",
                "I think by focusing in class on more discussion and lessening some of the homework load would make this course not easier, but more fruitful. I often found myself not feeling as though I did my best work on some of my assignments just because I was rushing to submit projects, compositions and such. With languages I feel as though taking your time with things is very important.",
                "The strengths that this course had was the course load and the teaching style of this course. I think one of the weaknesses if this course were that the amount of times we had to meet up for an introductory course were a little too overwhelming and I think that could be improved by having one more asynchronous day.",
                "Strengths are that we meet so often, so it forces you to actually learn the material. The online website was amazing but there was a lot of busy work assigned on canvas and the speed of the class was often too fast, so it was easy to feel left behind.",
                "I think the major strength of this course is that it gives students a great introduction and base for learning Spanish. Its only weakness, however, and how I think it can be improved, is that it is a very fast-paced class. The class required several hours of work outside of class to be able to be in pace with the classwork, and I don't know if this is what I would expect from an introductory Spanish class.",
                "I think the biggest weakness for this course is that it is only available early in the morning. I struggled making it to classes most days which severely harmed my grade. I also struggled a lot to understand when assignments were due because they were not communicated well by the professor and were not updated in the syllabus as assignment dates tended to change without any notification. However, I think the course is very strong in teaching cultural aspects of the varying spanish-speaking areas around the world. I also think the structure of small class sizes really helped boost the conversational aspect of spanish which I had never had before.",
                "The content in Canvas seemed disorganized and not easily to determine the homework and class assignments."

                "Yes! Really well organized course to quickly learn Spanish. I barely knew Spanish at the beginning, and by the end of the course, we all delivered a 15 min presentation in Spanish",
                "This course provides an effective base-level understanding of elementary Spanish that is vital for advancement into more difficult concepts or patterns of the Spanish language. While my use of Spanish still isn't perfect, this class has given me the skills to think, write, speak, and read Spanish relatively well, which has helped my comprehension and utilization of the language immensely.",
                "For anyone wanting to improve upon the little Spanish they already had known, from high school or such, I recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel like this was a great way to be introduce to the Spanish language, but also you learn history about Spanish-speaking countries that I personally found very interesting.",
                "Maybe, it's a fun and practical langauge to learn!",
                "I would. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in the class and truly got to learn a lot more about Spanish and the Spanish culture.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in learning a new language. The course provided a good foundation for Spanish."
