                "I learned a very basic basis of some of the most important rulers in Ancient Egypt, creation accounts, religion, pottery, writing and grammar, geography, and a little bit of Egyptian Magic. We also talked a lot about the reasoning behind certain archaeological techniques, and discussed how some of them are used. Even now, at the end of the semester, I remember very little and forget everything in the next few weeks. It was all very interesting, but so much was covered I did not fully grasp very much.",
                "I gained important writing skills and learned about Ancient Egyptian history.",
                "I learned a bit about analyzing pottery and basic hieroglyph reading techniques, which is cool.",
                "I gained a significant amount of knowledge about Ancient Egyptian administrative, cultural, and religious practices. I had interest in these topics before, but after taking the course, I have found by talking to others about the class, that I can now explain concepts like the intersectionality of magic and religion in Ancient Egypt, the various eras of Ancient Egypt, and the importance of semiotics in writing, art, and culture.",
                "I learned an in-depth analysis of ancient Egyptian culture, both predynastic and during the dynastic era. We dived specifically into the reigns of a few notable pharaohs, like Hatshepsut, Amunhotep III, and Akhenaten.",
                "I gained a lot of broad knowledge about ancient Egypt, learned how to closely analyze artifacts and the techniques that Egyptologists use.",
                "Very niche facts regarding niche parts of a niche field. I took this class expecting it to give a broad overview of Egypt and its history. This was not the case. The class is hyper-focussed on random details about ancient Egypt that often lacked context. I felt like it was rarely clear what the justification was for why we were learning what we were learning, and the content was never tied into more broadly applicable themes or concepts."

            "comments": [
                "A strength is that Yale has many many sherds and pots in our museums, so we could handle and see a lot of things first-hand. Also, the professor is extremely knowledgable on everything Egypt. Also, the quizzes or papers were not too much - the professor did an excellent job of talking with us and making sure to not overwhelm us. Weaknesses would be that we were all over the place and did not stay on one topic very long until the end. The readings were extremely long, so by the end of them I had forgotten/not understood what I read, and because we tried to tackle everything, not very much has stuck with me, and I found the exams and essays to be stressful and really make me question everything as I had no idea where to start with studying or writing. I didn't even know what I was meant to know.",
                "The course is very free-flowing. Dont expect to follow the syllabus. That may be a strength or a weakness.",
                "We didn't learn about Egyptian history from the perspective I was expecting. I was expecting a more sequential, broad overview of the processes that took place in Northeast Africa similar-ish to AP World History. Instead we hyperfocused on specific concepts/people and had a significant focus on pottery. While I think knowing those facts are interesting and cool, I would have liked a little more information on the structure of government, politics, economy, etc, instead of specific people. For example we didn't talk very much about the Pyramids, foreign occupation, Old Kingdom or Middle Kingdom, Roman world, etc. I would ask for a little more standard historical approach instead of learning about specific people, which doesn't feel as meaningful or useful.",
                "The course material was very engaging, and the topics were fascinating. I would have preferred the weighting of different topics to be a bit more even, though. For example, we spent a lot more time analyzing pottery sherds than learning Middle Egyptian, and I wish we could have devoted enough time to Middle Egyptian to be able to read a few simple sentences.",
                "The strengths are that the topic is so niche, and most people don't come into the course with a lot of knowledge, giving us all equal levels of starting understanding. I also thought the topics were generally pretty cool and themes of lifestyle and political conflict mirrored some of the themes found in our lives today. The weaknesses were that I felt like the course was a little scattered, and we fell behind on the weekly reading schedule later into the semester. I also thought the course itself should have been a little more discussion-based; at times, it felt more like a lecture about Egypt than a true seminar.",
                "The lectures were really amazing and engaging, and one of the highlights of this course. Another highlight was all the artifacts we got to physically touch and see as we were learning about the material. It could be improved by being slightly more organized.",
                "This course somehow managed to be both boring and unpredictable. The content and readings were very boring, as it felt like most of it was focussed on internal debates among egyptologists. Each class, the professor would just stand up in front of the supposedly seminar-structured class and rant about whatever he felt like ranting about on that particular day, often the same things over and over. At the same time, the professor's lack of organization and his eccentric personality led to a class that was unpredictable, especially when it came to written assignments and tests, which involved instructions that were difficult to parse at best, and oftentimes nonexistent."

                "Only if you are extremely extremely interested in Ancient Egypt and Nubia, their religion, geography, writing, gods, etc., and already have decent knowledge on the timeline of their history and major characters. I came in knowing nothing, and because of that I still know very little. The course is definitely very interesting, the history is very instructing, but the sheer amount of topics that were tried to be covered, and being all over the place meant I felt lost for a majority of the time, and have simply accepted whatever grade I get.",
                "No, the teacher expects students to know very specific facts and details for the exams, and asks for a lot of readings each week, and often asks for things last minute.",
                "This is an easier writing credit for people who need it. However, the content can get very specific and unengaging at times.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would warn them that even though it is listed as a first-year seminar it does not feel like an introductory course. I had some prior knowledge about Ancient Egypt and a lot of interest, but even still I felt like I had been thrown into the deep end of the pool. I learned to swim by the end of the semester, but if someone is looking for a gut writing credit this is not that class.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is open-minded and would actually find interest in Egyptology, to some extent. I feel that this class, if one does not find a genuine interest in the topics, can feel like meaningless busywork.",
                "I would strongly recommend if one is interested in learning about ancient Egypt in detail and willing to put in the work. It's worth it in my opinion!",
                "No, unless you already know a lot about egyptology and know that you deeply care about its most random details. Do not take this class just because you think the content sounds cool and you want to learn about a field you know little about. It is disorganized, unpredictable, and boring."
