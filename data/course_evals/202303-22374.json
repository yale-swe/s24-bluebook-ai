                "Strengths: Always community. Basically everybody is excited to be here and exchange ideas. That's what DS does strongest. At least for my section, people were encouraged to share their own takes on the philosophies we read, which added a more personal aspect to the course.\r\nWeaknesses: It's definitely a lot to get through, and it will always feel like you're not going as deep as you want to. But it depends on if you're willing to sacrifice that for the experience of traversing the span of the Western canon. For philosophy, it can be especially overwhelming because the language is often complex.",
                "Learning philosophers' opinions by reading their texts seems a strange choice given that these texts have required extensive analysis to interpret. I understood correctly almost none of the philosophers' points by reading the text.",
                "The course's strengths are the amount of ideas you encounter and the lively discussions you hopefully get to have in section. The lectures ranged from mostly explaining the ideas to making an argument about them, but overall they were very good. The main weakness is the inconsistent pulls on your attention: nailing down specific philosophers' arguments while understanding the sweep of the intellectual history, understanding the ideas while also forming your own. It's a lot.",
                "I think this course was a cool way to be introduced to philosophical and debating discourse. However, it felt a bit unguided at times and like we didnt cover all of the content we had to read in class.",
                "Professor Levy-Eichel fosters an environment which allows for a lot of input and differing opinions, and we spent probably more time in class on our own thoughts about the issues/philosophical ideas we were reading than about what the authors themselves had to say. This was both a good and a bad thing because it allowed us to engage with the texts very fully, but also in some ways prevented us from having a really good grasp on them because we didn't go through each idea/argument of the author's in depth. I don't think this was really to our detriment, though, and while studying for the final I felt as prepared as my friends in other classes.",
                "The material is vast, and the time to cover it, not nearly vast enough. For the goals of the course, however, I do think it is effective. I wish the Neo-Platonists  actually received a week, instead of us just jumping to Augustine."

                "Yes, if you're comfortable with being confused and working through that confusion. It can be intimidating to speak in class! But everybody else is just as perplexed and intrigued as you are, so at least it's not lonely.",
                "Yes. It's a fun introduction, and the papers are more fun than in the other DS classes as they involve mostly just laying your thoughts out, making the process not too formulaic.",
                "Yes -- DS Phil was incredibly rewarding. Though a tough class, I have a fantastic groundwork for understanding how ideas have developed over time.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed this introduction to philosophy.",
                "I absolutely loved this class. Professor Levy-Eichel was a fantastic professor who really sought out our own opinions on the texts we were reading. The class environment was wonderful, and though we didn't have a ton of instruction on the texts themselves, we had the opportunity to engage in very rewarding philosophical discussions. Hugely recommend, just know there's a lot of reading.",
                "Yes. I think it gave me a good background in Ancient Philosophy, at least as far as Plato, Aristotle, and Epicurus are considered (along with their derivative schools in Late Antiquity/Middle Ages)."
