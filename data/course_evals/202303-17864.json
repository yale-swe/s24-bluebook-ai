Weaknesses: the class seemed to evaluate your ability to speak German before coming into the class more than what you actually learned during class. That mean that students who had previously studied a lot of German we're at a significant advantage, and it felt like it was harder for students who had only started learning German at Yale to keep up."

The class isn't as challenging as some languages, but is also not a joke like some others. You'll work a bit, but you'll learn too and the grading is fair."
