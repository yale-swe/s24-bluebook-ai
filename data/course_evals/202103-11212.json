                "The content is pretty interesting, and the course is not a ton of work. However, some of the lectures feel like they go one a bit too long and there isn't a ton of engagement.",
                "Strengths: Really enjoyed the diversity of topics and the amount of readings was just right. \r\n\r\nWeakness: I found the grading to be too strict at times, especially considering this was just an intro course.",
                "This course succeeded in providing many opportunities to improve your grade and catch up on class material. The course also provided a broad and interesting selection of readings. \r\n\r\nThere were some assignments that I didn't feel really contributed that much to my overall understanding, the discussion posts in particular. Since we were already discussing information pretty regularly and actively in class, the discussion posts felt more like a relic from zoom class than a useful teaching tool.",
                "In class discussion was very helpful.",
                "This class was incredible! I loved how creative and fun the assignments were, and how the lectures were filled with opportunity for discussion.",
                "I think the format was not the most conducive to learning; it might have better held my attention and produced more cohesive discussions if it was two 50 min lectures per week and a discussion section. As it was, the class lagged somewhat. I also did not get very good feedback on assignments.",
                "I think the biggest strength of this course is the professor. Jim Wood is simply a wonderful professor and kind person. He taught every lecture with enthusiasm and plenty of references to his personal life and pop culture that made it easier and more fun to contribute to in-class discussions than in other classes I've taken. The workload is also super manageable as long as you're paying attention during the lectures (you generally don't need to understand the assigned readings to complete the assignments.)",
                "Dont think there were any weaknesses.",
                "I thought it was a very strong course overall. The lectures were engaging, and I appreciated the opportunities in class to do activities and have discussions in small groups. In addition, the readings and guest lectures were very interesting. My main piece of feedback is organizational - sometimes it was difficult to find assignments or see readings until soon before they were due, which made them harder to finish in time."

                "Yes!! It's not stressful at all, but it doesn't feel like you are wasting your time. I learned a lot about the fundamentals of morphology, and I was able to apply them to random words that I would hear throughout the semester.",
                "If this is something you're interested in then yes!",
                "Yes! I would highly recommend if you have any interest at all in language or linguistics. The professor was very fair, assignments were straightforward, and we all learned a lot.",
                "Yes, especially if Jim Wood is teaching. Regardless of whether you're considering a linguistics major or you're just trying to get an easy social science credit, this class would be really enjoyable. It focuses on English so you aren't at a disadvantage if you don't speak another language (in the way that you might be in some other linguistics classes) and anytime other languages were brought up in examples in class, those discussions supplemented my understanding of the content. Overall, the class is interesting, not hard and a lot of fun.",
                "Absolutely yes. It is a very enjoyable class regardless of whether you have studied linguistics previously or not. Professor Wood is a fantastic teacher.",
                "Yes! As a non-linguist, LING 101 was a fascinating peek into the kinds of questions linguists ask and the way they think about words, though I suspect this class would be too elementary for an experienced linguistics major. It's a low-stress, low-work class that emphasizes exploration and learning over exams and strict assignments. There's a big element of student participation in class, which is great for a class about the diversity of language. Prof Wood is clearly passionate about language, and his enthusiasm is infectious.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in linguistics. It was a good overview of many different topics and provided an interesting and strong foundation to linguistics as a whole."
