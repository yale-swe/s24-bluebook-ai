                "I learned so much about how anthropological methods. Our readings included fictional books and short stories, academic pieces, and occasionally even memes. Excerpts of documentaries, music videos, poems, and commercials also informed our understanding of postwar Vietnam. These cultural artifacts helped broaden my horizons on how the war with the US, land reforms, long-standing cultural virtues, and more all contributed to shaping how Vietnam is today. From Professor Harm's thorough feedback on the final project, I also learned how to structure an anthropological paper. He helped me develop the background and argument of the paper, suggested sources to read into, and helped reword sentences for clarity.",
                "I learned more about postwar Vietnam from an anthropological perspective. I also got a taste of anthropological theory through seminar discussions, but the focus of the class was a survey of postwar Vietnam's history, politics, economy, and society.",
                "I learned so much about Vietnam and the field of anthropology",
                "Wow. So much. We started by reading selections from the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and looked at professor-translated pieces of media after the Northern Vietnamese won the war, and then went on to read a novel that came out in 2020 that traversed the perilous landscape of land reform and socialism in Vietnam pre and postwar, cataloguing sacrifice, suppression, grief, and memory (which Erik graciously provided a reading guide for b\/c there were so many names). Then we talked about refugee camps in the postwar sphere (and watched a really catchy music video, Tyler Oakley certified) - the book was really engaging, please keep it on the syllabus, so easy to understand. We went to bird flu (\"how to own a virus\" is such a cool concept that I asked my mcdb prof about) and then inevitably moved to economized rituals and traditions, which provided an interesting look at how economic liberalization has commodified religious pilgrimages and excursions to temples in the middle of mountains. Of course, we talked about the My Lai and Ha My massacres which sparked a debate on remembrance and memorialization that has stuck with me ever since, and discussed Christian radicalization through the radio. Lastly, we discussed sex work, inequality, environmental crises, the Sino-Viet sea conflict, and a movie that encapsulated the entire semester. My writing got more concise, my understanding deeper, and my analysis skills stronger. I'm continually impressed by the breadth and depth of course materials Erik assigned as well as the actually interesting material he uncovered for us. Completely accessible to non-Vietnamese people and 100% fascinating."

Even though each class met for about 2 hours every week, our engaging discussions always made time fly by.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Harms as a seminar leader, and as an understanding professor. Prof. Harms was more aware of his students' challenges this semester than any other professor I had this semester, and he adjusted the syllabus to make sure that we were never overwhelmed with work.",
                "It was the perfect course. The readings were fascinating and we would just talk and share insights",
                "STRONG: this class was. so. cool. It was so unique. And Harms is so open-minded and understanding and helpful and great and he really makes the class (even when some students were a bit condescending, albeit likely unintentionally). All of us had different backgrounds: stats, erm, east asian studies, history, film and media, anth, etc. and not once did it feel like nobody had nothing to contribute. The class was such a low workload it was almost relaxing, but I was so motivated to do the readings that I found myself pushing off other classwork to do these readings! And, we had the option to do our research paper on COVID-19 in Vietnam (or not, which many chose) and he put us in contact with 2 contacts and then 2 more who were both super perceptive. In essence, you could write about whatever you wanted and be as argumentative as you wanted (i.e. take risks, like make a claim that may not have been entirely proveable given your lack of evidence, but b\/c you really just wanted to say something). Grading was super clear and very fair, and he was so incredibly helpful every step of the way. I've never received clearer feedback or more help from a professor before so this was phenomenal. WEAK: the timeline assignment felt kina pointless. It wasn't really part of our grade, it didn't go anywhere, and without constant reminders, after like week 4, no one was filling any of it in. I did my part, and then never visited the doc again. Harms had us lessen the workload a few times by assigning us to take notes on individual chapters, becoming the designated spokesperson for that section so as to not have to read as intensely, but the amount of notes one took varied widely. There wasn't really any guidance--would've been nice to be like \"find the thesis, organize into chunks, keywords, key quotes\" (and maybe even offer a critique? wasn't an option there, kinda just rote reiterated what the authors said without considering the implications and validity, i.e. I really do not agree with some of Natalie Porter's far-fetched avian flu propaganda poster analyses, they were very \"out there\" so to speak) b\/c some students went overboard and took like 5 pages of notes (single spaced) on like 5 pages which could've been avoided. A few classes felt a bit worthless; while it was nice to be given a week's worth of readings off to focus on our papers, coming to class to ask non-expert peers what to do about your research question was not conducive to learning, especially when some people spoke for 25 minutes and others only got 3 because there weren't any time limits and we ran out of time. Or, the last class was \"discuss movie, listen to music, talk about papers\" which not everyone had finished or even started writing, and we didn't even really get to talk about the movie? Discussion questions were also a bit dry sometimes, like \"what'd you think\" I mean idk man, I'm compelled to believe the author but I'm not an expert so please for the love! of! all! that! is! holy! ask a more exciting question and provide a more riveting answer instead of \"nice.\" I mean, sure it was an ego boost to get the validation of \"wow [student x] you really got it down\" but was it conducive to learning? Nope lol."

Professor Harms also took advantage of Google Docs, encouraging us to share our paper proposals with each other and providing in-class feedback while we followed along on the Google Doc.\r\n\r\nWhile this course was synchronous, which makes it difficult for students in different time zones, we would not have been able to have such engaging discussions if it were asynchronous.

That's a surefire way to shut discussion down and discourage more participation (which it certainly did, because it felt like my comments weren't valued). Not necessarily COVID specific, but definitely could have been ameliorated because we can indeed see everyone's faces. Otherwise there weren't very many places for improvement."

The course itself is geared towards broadening horizons, encouraging students to evaluate the material for themselves rather than guiding their beliefs. Even if you are not interested in postwar Vietnam specifically, this class helped me learn so much about anthropological methods and how to approach studying a culture. This knowledge is highly applicable outside of the field of anthropology as well, so even if you are not an anthropological student, I would highly recommend this course. Aside from its contents, the class is well-structured and laidback. Completing the readings and participating in class are pretty much all you need for an engaging discussion in Professor Harm's class. He poses thoughtful questions about the readings and provides plenty of background information for those who are not well-versed in what postwar Vietnam is like.",

                "100%. Prof. Harms is truly one of a kind. I was excited to go to class every morning at 9:25, something that cannot be said about any other class I've ever taken (and I've taken 37 college courses). I barely had any knowledge of Vietnamese society at all going into the class, and now I have a thorough comprehension of so many postwar aspects of a constantly modernizing country that I can't shut up about it. The topics are so relevant and the readings are never too many. He even offered to put us in contact with actual Vietnamese people, and our first reading was a novel?? SO COOL! First day of class he said \"you see those discussion posts and leader things on the syllabus? yeah, let's get rid of those.\" He treated it like we were chatting in a caf in a Vietnamese city, or a \"boutique seminar,\" where we bounced ideas off of each other. I hate it when professors turn to students to lead discussion, so I was overjoyed when Prof. Harms would take the reins. If there were 5+ readings one week, he told us we could  pick the ones that were most interesting and only read those, and then be the \"expert\" on that reading-immensely helpful when all my other classes had so many readings already. And, the only assignment the entire semester was a final research paper which was so well scaffolded throughout the semester that by the time we sat down to write, words just flowed onto the paper. This class has inspired me to take the Vietnamese language, travel to Vietnam, and even maybe double major in ANTH. Even with 7 people (mix of Vietnamese-American, non-Viet, and an auditing grad student from a dif university), class was lively and even sometimes entertaining. We didn't shy away from sensitive topics like sex work and we also covered modern issues like erosion and environmental catastrophe. And, he NEVER BRAGGED about his research either, which so many profs just looove to do; we read his articles when necessary, and he even allowed us to critique ~his~ style?? When do you ever get the opportunity to give your input on whether you understood an academic article to the author's face (hint: never!). Email responses were thorough and written with care, material was engaging, and feedback was fantastic and quick-he even copy edited our final papers to ensure they sounded good and were clear and not clunky. Fantastic hidden gem."
