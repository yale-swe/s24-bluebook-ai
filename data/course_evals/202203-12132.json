                "My comfort and proficiency with R improved significantly.",
                "I learned a lot about statistics. This class was more stats math heavy than I anticipated but definitely very useful and necessary for social science research.",
                "You learn how to read and write poli sci research papers. You learn statistically techniques and how to use them in R.",
                "I learned lots of different methods of statistical analysis and how to write a research report.",
                "This is the course where I broke through and actually become confident in using R. It forces you to figure things out using code and does a great job of guiding you without holding your hand.",
                "I was unfamiliar with how to use R before taking this class (I usually worked using Stata) and came away with significantly better knowledge of how to use R to carry out quantitative research and statistical methods. The problem sets are pretty relentless as we had 10 across the semester so it was pretty much every week, but they set you up to have a wealth of code and packages to refer back to. There was also an element of the course which focused on statistical theory e.g. OVB, instrumental variables, diff-in-diff - I didn't find this as useful because I had covered this content many times before, but the class was a mix of first year PhDs, undergrads etc so it was a tricky balance for Professor Kuriwaki to strike",
                "This course provided a very helpful background to quantitative research including how to computationally conduct analysis, how to interpret statistical output, and how to write a thoughtful research paper.",
                "I learned how to produce publication-worthy data visualizations using several R packages that I had never used before. This is a very important skill that I learned in this class and have already been able to use in my other S&DS classes.",
                "Learned a ton in this course! We covered various methods of political / social science research design (observational analysis, RCTs, surveys) and how to implement appropriate statistical techniques for each design. Also learned tidyverse in R which was helpful and interesting.",
                "Two parts: Conceptual knowledge about research methods and coding skills in R. The research method covers RCT, instrument variables, Network Analysis, DID, LASSO, and survey weighing. The coding part is more about the applications and realizations of the research methods on real data sets.",
                "I was able to develop my quantitative skills particularly in R-programming language which I had no knowledge of prior to the class.",
                "I learned how to use a number of applied quant research techniques (e.g. multiple regression, fixed effects, LASSO regression, survey weighting, IVs, network analysis), including how to code this in R, and how to analyse and write a social science research paper.",
                "Learnt how to use R, learnt a lot of practical methods in Research Design.",

                "This course offers an overview of some of the more common quantitative methods in use in current political science research, such as OLS, instrumental variable design, survey analysis, and network analysis. These techniques are taught in an applied setting, by reading academic papers that use these techniques and then replicating elements of the papers in R. Therefore, this course also provided a great way to learn the statistical coding software R. I feel much more qualified to critically engaged with political science literature that uses these techniques. Moreover, because the final project required us to replicate a paper or conduct our own research, I also feel better prepared to implement these techniques in my own work.",
                "I learnt R from scratch from this course. It helped build a strong foundation for my coding skills which will be extremely useful in econometrics.",

            "comments": [
                "The main weakness of the course in my mind was the order in which concepts were taught. Personally, I feel like leaving fundamental ideas of statistics and probability to after more complicated causal methods had been taught didn't make sense. \r\nI also think that there were times when the mix between teaching R and teaching theory was confused. This might partly reflect that there was significant variation in the incoming knowledge and ability of students. I think it might be helpful to more narrowly define the required prerequisite knowledge. \r\nThe main strength is Professor Kuriwaki. He clearly cares deeply about the course, and values student feedback and input, and puts a lot of effort into how he teaches the course.",
                "Section and office hours were super helpful. Also you could correct your psets which really helped for learning and my grade. This class could probably be improved by having more prerequisites. It was mostly grad students and seniors and I was not prepared well enough despite having fulfilled the stated prerequisite. Also the final project was a lot.",
                "This class provided quite a good crash course on how to write a good research paper in political science, especially when it comes to the statistics of it all. The crash course nature, however, means that many statistical concepts are blown over very quickly making it hard to understand the inner workings behind the R functions we used.",
                "The class was organized well around some examples of the concepts we studied. I also liked the PSETs and sections, they really helped my learning. The end of the semester could be improved by involving the final project more with the class and not rushing through the probability theory unit.",
                "Strengths: The course layout is impeccable. It is clear what we have to do and when we have to do it. The problem sets are difficult but clear, and the support was good. The highlight of the course is the final paper, which actually gives you the confidence to do research. I am incredibly proud of the paper I wrote as a result of this class!\r\n\r\nWeakness: There was a stats quiz that ate up two weeks towards the end of the semester and it only counted for 5% of the grade. Just take this out and make probability theory and stats (241/242 or equivalent) a hard prerequisite. Or just drop this content entirely.",
                "Strengths - If you're willing to put in effort to the Problem Sets and go to office hours, you will come away with much better proficiency in R - even if you were completely unfamiliar with it like I was. The empirical papers chosen by the Professor which form the questions in the Problem Sets were really engaging and covered a wide variety of research areas (international development, comparative politics, algorithms/machine learning). For example one of the papers was an application of the PageRank algorithm that underpins Google's search algorithm. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The familiarity with statistical theory in the class was really varied, so if you're someone who knows this content the lectures that go through this will feel fairly mundane as they really start from the basics. The ordering of the class content sometimes didn't make sense e.g. we went as far as instrumental variables/panel data a few weeks in, and then started a week on \"regression for prediction\" which went back to the basics of OLS. The last few weeks of term were reserved for a statistics review of concepts such as standard errors, the CLT and conditional probability, with an exam that the class were not really well-prepared for. It felt a bit like we were going backwards and forwards and if there really is a requirement to cover statistical theory (even though this is an applied class), it should be gotten out of the way at the beginning of the semester.",
                "Strengths: The teaching staff were definitely a core strength of this course, they always provided helpful feedback and made themselves very available for questions (both related to the course's assignments and pertaining to individual research projects outside of the course). The content of the course was generally helpful in providing broad exposure to the \"greatest hits\" of quantitative research in the social sciences. The assignments  especially the final project  were awesome opportunities to practice what we learned and discussed in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the content felt rushed given the breadth of the course. Given a few of the concepts were new to many students, the quick use of complex notation was often confusing at first.",
                "I think the unit on instrumental variables was a bit weak; I ended up being more confused about instrumental variables than I had been before the class started.",
                "The final project was very hard, especially because the guidelines could have been clearer (but this was the first time the course ran so it will probably be better in the future). Other than that the course was great, lots of new skills, fair grading, and manageable psets.",
                "I really like the Ed Discussion. Prof and TAs respond our questions really fast. Also, we can read peers' posts to solve some common problems.",
                "Strength: ability to build programming skills of students without prior knowledge.",
                "I feel a difficulty with this course is that everyone has different mathematical backgrounds and also there's a need to balance the practical content (how to use X technique in practice) with the theory (when is use of X justified). I think the course could do with going a bit deeper on the theory, and this could be achieved by: \r\n\r\n(a) Actively enforcing the pre-reqs: a pre-req for the course was familiarity with multiple regression but we had to cover fundamentals of regression in class in lecture time. \r\n(b) Using section hours/office hours for mathematical preparation rather than coding help. I think this would be a better use of in-person time, whereas coding help is readily available online and example code supplied by the TFs.\r\n\r\nA real strength of the course is the material covered and the focus on close readings of papers, I found this immensely useful.",
                "Strengths- Prof. Kuriwakis ability to teach difficult concepts well. Using R to apply these concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the final project is quite unclear and muddled. Could use more structure especially since it is worth so much.",
                "The organization of this course was very thorough and intuitive. My only wish would be that there was more time spent on the underlying assumptions needed to use the various causal inference methods.",
                "Nothing",
                "workload is very manageable, and we get to learn a lot of useful skills to analyse data using R",
                "The applied nature of the course is a definite strength because it is more engaging and brings a richness to the learning process. The use of handouts for class lectures was a helpful way to organize notes and I appreciated the hints and resources on the problem sets. It did feel as if the course got a little rushed towards the end and the section on probability felt a little out of place. It would be helpful to have a better understanding of why those concepts are important and how they reinforce or enhance understanding of the other statistical methods taught throughout the semester.",
                "The course was designed effectively to work well for students with diverse statistics and coding backgrounds. I liked the class discussions about the research papers as they helped build intuition and rationale for the data analysis we would be doing later.",
                "This class was extremely fast paced and felt like it was difficult to strike a balance between the more and less experienced students. I felt this course would have benefitted greatly from reducing the number of topics covered in order to go more in depth and slow down to make sure that all students understand the material. The workload was extremely high, almost to the point of feeling arbitrarily dense. The statistics quiz was a good example of this, as the subject material seemed to appear almost out of nowhere a week before an extremely difficult exam amidst other problem sets and the final project. By far the most stressful course I have taken at Yale. However, many aspects of it were very rewarding, and I did come away feeling that I had learned a lot and grown significantly in an area that was previously a weakness for me. I really enjoyed the case study approach, which helped ground the class in real life research rather than remaining theoretical or abstract.",
                "The quiz did not fit in with the overall course at all. Sometimes this seemed to be the case with the Psets as well. It sometimes seemed like the course was a bit all over the place."

                "I would, but I think if you have a reasonable econometrics/stats background, then I would only recommend it if you are looking to build proficiency with R. Otherwise, the course is likely to be repetitive.",
                "If they are really serious about doing social science research in the future yes, not if they are just looking for an interesting statistics class.",
                "Yeah! If you like political science and statistics, this is a great way to learn statistics in an application setting. You will learn some very powerful R techniques which will allow you to write professional academic research papers. This class is organized incredibly well, I think maybe two or three other classes I've taken in the past 3 years at Yale were organized this well. Professor Shiro is also fantastic. If he stays at Yale and teaches another class, I highly recommend you take it.",
                "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in quantitative research.",
                "**I am an undergrad with no prior research experience**\r\n\r\nIf Shiro is teaching and you are interested in research, TAKE THIS CLASS. He is an amazing professor and the final paper is the perfect step to take moving from classwork to actual research. I carried an easier-than-usual schedule with this class as my hardest and it was incredibly fulfilling. At the beginning of the semester I was ok at coding at RI could reproduce some code for the sake of simple assignments (e.g. S&DS 230). By the end of the semester, I was producing beautiful visualizations in R based on my own research findings! The assignments for this class ask you to do meaningful work, without being too restrictive on HOW to get to your result. This allows you to actually learn what's best for your own workflow. Don't get too greedy and think you can take a super difficult courseload alongside this class. Make this class the central piece of your schedule and it will be incredibly rewarding and worth your time. Oh, and you WILL get an A in the class if you put honest effort in.\r\n\r\nThe only con of this class is that a lot of grad students take it and they hog the professor's time. Stand up for yourself and get the help you need.",
                "If you're someone who really wants to learn how to use R for statistical research, this class will really prepare you. If you don't have a background in statistical theory, I would say you'll be better off taking a class on that first and then taking this course, otherwise you'll likely feel out of your depth",
                "This course is a must-take for any students interested in improving their fluency in research in the social sciences; particularly if you are also interested in conducting quantitative research. It is especially helpful if you are planning to write a senior essay using these types of methods.",
                "Absolutely!! If youre serious about learning the skills necessary for quantitative social science research this course is a must. Would recommend having a good understanding of regression statistics and at least a little experience in R (this course was a great follow up to s&ds 230, wouldve been much harder if I hadnt taken that)",
                "Definitely! It is an excellent course to help students build up their research skills! Especially, I would recommend those with some prior coding experience (introductory level is enough). Sometimes, the weekly problem sets can be a bit challenging.",
                "Yes. The course is helpful to students who want to build their knowledge in R programming language",
                "Yes, if you don't feel 100% comfortable analysing social science papers and/or are not familiar with the research techniques listed in the syllabus and/or want a course that will help you learn to use R.",
                "Yes 100%. Its a lot of work but definitely worth it.",
                "Yes definitely, if they are interested in learning the fundamentals of causal inference and how to code that in R",
                "Yes very nice teacher",
