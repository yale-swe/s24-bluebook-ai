                "In the course, I have come close to understanding true \"Chekhovian\" writing, where every word of every sentence needs to be intentionally used. I could clearly see the differences in the tone, precision, and purposefulness of the language of my first and second papers. In the first essay, I would spend a great deal of time trying to find a better-sounding synonym for simple words. In the second, I would rather prefer a simpler, more effective word to an unreasonably vague alternative. Not only has it made my writing more clear and easy and more pleasant to read, but it has also made the writing process a much more fulfilling experience. Because no extravagant synonyms are forcefully put in sentences, I started to enjoy writing in a cut-to-the-point and more intuitive style, which requires much less effort to produce than the former. \r\n\r\nIt was also interesting to follow how philosophical reasoning has shifted from a theological inquiry to a more human-mind-centered one around the time of the Enlightenment Era. The observation of the evolution of modern philosophy reveals that our perceptions say more about us than just the nature of God or that of the \"external\" world. Comparing Kant's system of categories to that of Aristotle's demonstrates this change. Aristotle's categories focus on the objective properties of substances as individual entities, while Kant's categories relate to the cognitive framework through which we understand the world. Kant's emphasis on the mind's role in shaping our experience signifies a turn toward the centrality of human cognition.\r\n\r\nWhile this comparison concerns two systems developed in starkly different historical contexts, in the discourse of Modern Philosophy, some thinkers were in contact with one another. In the exchange between Conway and Descartes, for instance, subtle differences and underdevelopments in the authors' arguments are revealed, allowing the reader to think about what is important in interpreting philosophical writings. Interestingly, Berkeley's response to Locke's qualities of perceived objects shows the subtle ways in which a philosophical idea can be misunderstood.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- MDR is a character and fantastic at explaining concepts in a digestible manner. You'll find him referencing Lady Gaga, Olivia Rodrigo, and Taylor Swift as part of his explanations of these abstract philosophical ideas. I did barely any of the readings and was still able to follow along and succeed in the course thanks to his teaching.\r\n- Concepts are incredibly interesting. You answer questions like \"does God exist?\" and \"how do we know anything is real?\"\r\n- Lectures are organized yet have plenty of room for questions, which is incredibly important for a class of this nature.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone",
                "Strengths include the reading selections and topics of focus. No weaknesses, though I was confused by how long we spent on Descartes at the beginning of the semester. It seemed to be moving quite slowly, and I wish we could have distributed the semester more equally.",
                "Strength: lectures are helpful and sections help strengthen what we learned in class\r\n\r\nWeakness: we didn't get to finish Kant, which is actually an important part of the final exam",
                "strengths: clear and informative lectures\r\nweaknesses: doesn't teach beginners how to better engage with the material, steep learning curve",
                "The course is thorough and thought-provoking. However, I feel like it would benefit the class to expand from its Eurocentric roots to explore modern philosophy from other cultures as well.",
                "Weaknesses- I dislike the grade distribution between 2 papers and a final exam, lectures alone don't really prepare you enough to write papers",
                "Strengths: I truly enjoyed MDR's lectures. His energy was infectious and he was overall very skilled at explaining difficult concepts with friendly analogies for the beginner philosophy student. The content is also quite fascinating, and MDR does a great job drilling these concepts into your head. Review for the final was quite straightforward and easy, which took off a lot of pressure during reading period. \r\nWeaknesses: As this was my first philosophy course, I wish there was more support in structuring philosophy papers. Feedback for my papers was quite sparse and unclear, and I was often left confused as to how I could improve my writing. Grading was extremely subjective to the TFs, and the essays really do make\/break your grade. I would have appreciated a greater number of smaller assessments\/essays spread out through the semester. In addition, because we only had two essays and a final, it was easy to become disengaged in between these assignments.",
                "Strengths: Lecturer, discussion sections, material. Weaknesses: Final exam instead of a final paper.",
                "Very lecture-y. No powerpoint slides to refer to or anything, which made it a bit difficult to keep up sometimes. This is a classic case of a class where you get back the amount of effort\/work you put into the class.",
                "Generally a really great course. All of the information is provided in an accessible and interesting way.",
                "very interesting material at a good pace",
                "Strength: MDR is a great lecturer. He breaks down the often complex and obscure arguments of each philosopher really well and conveys their arguments in a clear, engaging, humorous way. He is also one of the most patient and caring professors I've met at Yale - talking to him during office hours is a pleasure. As someone who has never done philosophy before and is always kind of daunted by the idea of philosophy, MDR's class gave me a wonderful start and made me feel encouraged to take more similar classes in the future.\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think this is a weakness per se, but MDR refers only occasionally to the readers we do before class, and oftentimes his delivery is so clear that there is no need to do the readings at all unless you make the effort to go talk to him during office hours --- if not navigating the readings on your own can be pretty challenging. Nonetheless, you still get a really good overview of these philosophers just through MDR's lecture alone, just be aware that this is digested through his perspective.",
                "Very interesting introduction to philosophy -- MDR is an amazing professor and breaks down concepts comprehensibly and engagingly. I really enjoyed coming to class, even when the actual philosophy we were learning wasn't the most interesting. I would have loved to see philosophy from different cultural and religious traditions in the course -- I understand that this is a \"modern\" philosophy course, but having done a deep dive into Western modern philosophy makes me more interested in other philosophical traditions.",
                "Strengths: MDR. He's one of the sweetest professors here. He's also a great lecturer and really engages you in the material. Weakness: there were many cog sci students in my discussion section (ig it's a required class for them) who were clearly not interested in it, and therefore the discussions were often lame.",

                "Most of MDR's lectures were super engaging and interesting, and I liked that even though it was a lecture, students could still ask questions. I also appreciated having discussion sections, but I personally found my TA to not be super helpful (this wasn't true for everyone though).",
                "The course is well-designed and I learned a lot. Teachers are helpful and engagin.",

                "I enjoyed learning about the views of a variety of philosophers, and lectures were excellent. The only weakness is that there are significant disparities in grading and expectations for participation across sections. Also, sections sometimes felt a bit rushed.",
                "Strengths: papers were engaging\r\nWeaknesses: No lecture resources were posted such as notes or guides, made it difficult to catch up and follow along. Study of metaphysics and God primarily, was misled into thinking it was a broader philosophy course",
                "Lectures are very good, but section was disappointing -- our TA turned it into a mini-lecture again, which meant that we didn't get to discuss the concepts.",
                "Strengths - great lecturer\r\nweakness - would have been helpful to answer practice questions in class so we understood how to write a philosophy paper before writing our own",
                "MDR is a great professor and engaging lecturer, the content is well chosen, and the course is well organized",
                "I think that although the class moved a little too quickly, it was still great and we got to cover a lot of material.",
                "Strengths recorded lectures, GREAT professor, interesting class, fair level of difficulty \r\nWeaknesses discrepancies in difficulties of different sections due to different TFs. Some TFs seemed to grade a lot harder than others",
                "This is an excellent course. It was structured in an accessible, challenging, and interesting format. I would not change anything about the course.",
                "This course is great for anyone who does not know much about philosophy or is trying to get into philosophy. If you do have prior experience, it is enlightening to learn more about these philosophers' standpoints.",
                "This course is outstanding. The content is fascinating, the professor and TFs are incredible philosophers and unusually accessible outside of class, and the course certainly forces you to level up your thinking skills.\r\n\r\nMy only critiques are that I wish we examined Kant's philosophy more closely at the end of the course and received additional clarity and a few samples on the paper expectations beforehand.",
                "Strengths: The structure of the class was very consistent, we spent a good amount of time on each philosopher, and the lectures were very engaging and clarifying. The encouragement of questions in lecture was very fulfilling. I feel like I learned exactly what the syllabus said I would, and I learned it with much meaning and permanence (which can't be said for other courses!)\r\n\r\nCan't think of any weaknesses, besides the fact that the final grade is based on two papers, one final exam, and participation. This system is quite popular in Yale courses, so this is understandable.",
                "strengths -- great TAs, interesting lectures (MDR is a great professor and readily enthusiastic to talk during office hours\/after class); weaknesses -- Kant felt rushed and time spent on different philosophers varied widely",
                "Organized, great professor and TAs. Lecture style is engaging.",
                "A strength of the course was how well-organized it was. Each text and specific excerpt that we were assigned to read felt essential to the course. As a history major, I enjoyed being able to step back from the philosophical details and get a broader sense of how Western philosophy developed over time. Professor Della Rocca was also a major strength of the course. He's a super engaging lecturer and explains confusing concepts well. The TFs were also great!",
                "Strengths: Professor Della Rocca is a wonderful lecturer and makes the connections between philosophical systems very clear, as well as the philosophical systems themselves, which is particularly impressive because the readings can be nearly unintelligible sometimes (*cough cough* Kant). My TF was incredible in terms of feedback and diagnosing issues in my essays, and essays were returned sooner than I expected based on previous classes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although I love the selection of philosophers\/readings especially because of the connections MDR makes between them and the sense of direction we get from the sequence, I do think we spent too little time on the few women philosophers who were on the syllabus. I could easily imagine a world in which even just one or two additional lectures on, say, Du Chtelet would have done so much more justice to said philosopher without sacrificing that much material on other philosophers that got several lectures, like Descartes or Leibniz. (I will say, though, that I doubt this is a bias thing; I would instead attribute it mainly to time\/schedule issuesKant got very little lecture time tooand amount of reading available from each philosopher. But I still think more could have been said on Du Chtelet at least).",
                "I think MDR was a very engaging and good professor. My section leader Angela was also very helpful and cleared confusion I may have about the material.",
                "This course is amazing in every way (and I do mean in every way) except for the disparity in grading for the TFs. There needs to be a greater establishment of the standards such that they can be applied uniformly.",
                "The strength of this course would be the Professor, MDR is a really great professor even if he is kind of wasted on the class because it just asks you to regurgitate information. I don't feel like Im a better philosopher after the class but I do feel like I am more well versed in the a few early modern philosophers.",
                "Strengths: MDR is an excellent lecturer. His lectures were always engaging and clear, and I got way more from attending lecture than I would have if I had only done the readings. The readings struck a good balance between being long enough to get a sense of what the philosopher was saying, and short enough to be quite manageable each week. The workload is not too bad: two 5-6 page papers and a final exam.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally didn't find the material as exciting as I'd hoped in the first half of the semester, but it got better in the second half as we got to do more comparisons between philosophers. Throughout, it helped that MDR's lectures were always good.",
                "Th course had very interesting lectures was able to cover a lot of material very fast. However, the courses were often a repeat of the week's readings.",
                "My discussion section could have been better organized. The lectures were engaging.",
                "I think the strengths are that Professor Della Rocca is very passionate about philosophy and loves what he is talking about which makes class more interesting. I also think the TAs are very helpful but the format of the class is the same every day so it can get monotonous and hard to continue to pay attention and stay engaged. There were also only two assignments and a final so there were not many opportunities to receive feedback to be able to improve more so I feel like more assignments that were smaller would help make sure everyone is understanding everything.",
                "The strengths are the professor (Prof. Della Rocca is excellent) and the TFs, all of which are incredibly knowledgable and committed to helping their students. The only downside of the course is that the readings are often very dense and difficult to decode, but of course this is a necessary feature of studying modern philosophy and bespeaks no shortcoming of the course itself.",
                "The course is very interesting and taught well. A weakness is that sometimes the concepts are very hard to grasp and we go through them very fast."

                "If you're looking for an accessible and enjoyable introduction to philosophy or a relatively lax humanities credit, this course is for you. Two short papers and one final make for a lower workload than most Yale classes. However, this also means that your grade will be heavily reliant on just a few assignments. Getting feedback from MDR and your TF on your essay is likely a must if you want an A. I took this course Credit\/D\/Fail just to explore and didn't have to worry about this much. If you're a first-year with expiring Credit\/D\/Fails and want a chill fifth class, this is it. Just note that this class is primarily about metaphysics instead of other areas of philosophy like ethics, philosophy of mind, etc.",
                "Yes! This class only has 2 essays, in comparison to 3 essay in 125. I find this class to be more interesting than ancient philosophy, personally. Lectures are very engaging, and MDR is wonderful at encouraging questions and responding to them. He's a stellar philosopher in his field.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, if they want to know the basics of modern philosphy.",
                "i would recommend this class to someone already familiar with engaging with philosophy and writing philosophy papers",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with a genuine interest in philosophy, especially ideas such as naturalism, essentialism, necessitarianism, etc.",
                "No- Focused so much on metaphysics and is definitely not an overview of modern philosophy",
                "Yes - the things I learned in this course brought a whole new perspective of philosophy which I was previously unaware of. Beyond the topics themselves, I believe this course helped me immensely in critical\/logical thinking, as well as writing philosophy papers. The course is as boring or as exciting as you make it out to be, so it is quite self-directed. I encourage future students of this course to take initiative to reach out to MDR\/TFs if you really want to improve. Being lazy with course will lead to poor performance.",
                "Yes. The material is very interesting. The course helps you build writing skills. And lecturers were fun and engaging.",
                "I would, but only if you are willing to do your readings and pay attention in lecture. If you do, you'll get a lot out of it, but if not, not really.",
                "Absolutely. Della-Rocca is a great, passionate, and intelligent lecturer. If you have any interest at all in the modern philosophers on the syllabus I definitely recommend this course as its the perfect introduction to their ways of thinking.",
                "yes very interesting intro class",
                "Yes, for all the reasons discussed above. Fantastic intro-level philosophy lecture. Knowledgable and caring professor. Ample opportunities for support. Intellectually exciting material.",
                "Yes, especially if you take it with MDR. If you haven't taken a philosophy course before, you really should take this one!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone. There is no reason I can find to not take this course.",
                "I definitely recommend this class, even for non-majors!! The material is just extremely interesting, and the class is not really stressful.",
                "I'd recommend the class if you like metaphysics or are interested in trying out philosophy. The lectures were interesting and I came away with a general overview of different modern philosophers.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in that era of philosophy I think it is a good introduction.",
                "Yes, the professor is excellent.",
                "I would recommend this to another student if they are very interested philosophy. This class is a lot of reading, so take if prepared to do the readings.",
                "Yes. I am not a philosophy student nor did I think I was interested in philosophy. I took this course and by the end felt very challenged but that I also learned a lot and improved my writing and thinking greatly.",
                "Yes! Good intro course to modern philosophy",
                "yes if you want to know about the beliefs of these philosophers. the information wasnt actually that interesting",
                "Yes! I think this is a great survey course for an arts and humanities credit if you are no where near a philosophy major, but super interesting if you are a philosophy major as well.",
                "Definitely.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in philosophy! It is a fun intro course and you really learn about the thought systems of a wide range of philosophers",
                "Yes. It is an insightful course that allows you to explore the philosophical thinking and arguments of pioneer philosophers in a clear and compelling way.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. MDR is a great lecturer and makes the class interesting and engaging. Questions are welcomed and answered thoroughly, and the discussion sections allow you to flesh out some of the more complicated ideas. A lot of \"prerequisite\" classes at Yale are boring or arduous, but this class was genuinely interesting and fun.",
                "Yes- this course provides a great insight to early philosophical thought and MDR makes the class engaging and interesting.",
                "Yes! The course provides an introduction to several different philosophers and by the end of the semester, you can get a good understanding of their main ideas",
                "Yes, this was my first philosophy course, and I would encourage anyone to take this class since it will change the way you think  youll learn to question your assumptions and ask why questions that you wouldnt have thought of asking before. As this is an intro course, I liked that we had the opportunity to learn about the views of multiple philosophers. However, if youre looking to focus on ethics\/morality or particular philosophers, this probably isnt the best course for you. MDRs lectures are amazing and convey the material in the readings in a way that is much more concise and comprehensible. Go to his office hours if you can! Readings are light, but expect to devote a significant amount of time for the two papers.",
                "Yes if you are specifically interested in the philosophers studied and in metaphysics .",
                "If you're very interested in metaphysics, then yes. This class is not, however, an ethics class. You will not be discussing the trolley problem. Instead, you'll be discussing whether the physical world is real and if the mind and body are distinct.",
                "Yes, if they are interested in modern philosophy.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in philosophy and want an introduction to major ideas",
                "Yes I definitely would because it helps get a taste for philosophy, even when you start with zero knowledge of it.",
                "Totally this course is awesome for someone with not much experience with philosophy",
                "Absolutely. The readings are interesting, lectures are engaging, and Professor Della Rocca is incredible.",
                "I would recommend this course, especially to students who aren't strong in humanities; it provides great exposure to philosophy.",
                "Definitely. If you're considering the major, definitely take this course early. If not, I still strongly recommend you take this course. You'll be fascinating by the ideas of the philosophers and will likely enjoy dissecting and evaluating their arguments. It's no easy task, although it's well worth your effort.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student genuinely fascinated by philosophical ideas and questions, and who will actually do all the readings. The class is such a rich experience if you allow yourself the time and space to be fully immersed in the ideas and questions. After all, philosophy is supposed to refer to life as we experience it. It is incredibly important to be comfortable questioning things, and meet new ideas with a sense of openness and with a calm and inquisitive nature. If you truly are interested in the content, take the course. If you are solely looking for a writing credit and don't plan on doing many of the readings, you will get nothing but frustration and dissatisfaction out of this course, when the alternative is a rich, thoughtful, meaningful experience. You get out of this course what you put in.",
                "yes! MDR is a great lecturer and this course is a great overview to basic philosophical questions (mostly metaphysics though) as well as the answers modern thinkers tried to come up with to respond to them",
                "Yes. Great into to philosophy. Lecture but feels like seminar.",
                "yes! great understanding of modern phil, wide range of (western) authors.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I think it is an excellent introduction to philosophy for those who have never taken a philosophy class (like myself) since you read a range of different texts and learn about many foundational thinkers from Descartes to Kant. This class also made me think about the world in many new ways.",
                "Yes, I would. I wish this was a writing credit because I think it would encourage more students to join the class. But I found it very interesting and would tell anyone who wants to think more deeply about philosophy but has a basic knowledge should take the class.",
                "Yes! I really loved Dr. MDR! He is really funny and I loved how he taught the course with demonstrations on the board. I thoroughly enjoyed the readings too. He answered as many questions as he can in class and was incredibly helpful and kind. If he is teaching other courses, I hope to take as many as I can. 11\/10!!",
                "Take this class! This was a really fun intro to Philosophy, and it convinced me that I should take more classes in the major.",
                "Absolutely, it was a great class if you are looking to learn a lot about modern philosophy.",
                "Yes, I would. I think I might have found the material of a moral or political philosophy course a little more exciting in itself, but MDR's excellent lectures made up for it. Between the good lectures, manageable readings, and reasonable workload, I really liked this class. I took this class with a few friends, and that definitely made it better than if I'd taken it alone. I also recomment going to MDR's office hours, if you have the time.",
                "I would recommend a more specific course to students who aren't pursuing the philosophy major since this class moves pretty fast.",
                "Yes. Great course to take if you want to test your basic level of interest in philosophy.",
                "I would if they are interested in philosophy but if not I would not recommend this course because it is not super engaging if you are not interested in the topic.",
                "Yes, although I think that Philosophy\/Humanities majors will get more out of this course than others. Most of the theories discussed are quite bizarre and seemingly implausible (e.g. Leibniz's monad-based idealism or Spinoza's monism) and are thus helpful insofar as they are demonstrations of highly complex and well thought-out argumentation rather than intuitively-backed ways of looking at the world. The content can seem overly technical and removed from real life at times. So, for those looking for a solid foundation for further philosophical exploration, this class is a must; but, for those simply seeking to dip their toes in the pool of philosophy I might recommend something else.",
                "Yes, because I believe philosophical thought is a fantastic tool. It is helpful in many disciplines and is much more important to the real world than people think.",
                "Yes, especially if MDR is teaching. Just know going into it that this is a class primarily focused on metaphysics and epistemology."
