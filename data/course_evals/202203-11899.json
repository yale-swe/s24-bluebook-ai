When we had to do our final projects, he was very helpful. The labs that we did for class were great models for how to conduct analyses for the final paper. I only have positive things to say about this course.",
                "Strengths- interesting, classes helped to prepare for labs, labs and class discussions helped to prepare for final projects\r\n\r\nWeakness- it would have been nice to get feedback/grades on labs before the final data analysis and/or report was due",
                "Assignments are all pretty helpful and not too stressful. Interesting subject material. I felt the skills I learned were valuable and I can already feel them helping in my other classes. One point of improvement in my opinion is that in-class discussions sometimes fell flat due to the on-rails format - being asked / answering questions based on our discussion question responses. The timeliness of feedback could also maybe be improved - lab assignments were not graded until after finals period, and it could have been nice to have feedback on those for the final paper.",
