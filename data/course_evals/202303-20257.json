                "This course was extremely useful in developing laboratory skills for someone who has never taken a lab course before. Essentially concepts in laboratory science were taught, and the TAs were there to guide students to ensure everyone comprehended what was required. Additionally, the class paired quite well with Chem 161 as it solidified certain topics that were covered in the lecture class.",
                "This course helped teach lab techniques and develop familiarity with commonplace lab equipment for experiments in various areas of chemistry. It also helped develop skills with recording data/observations, as well as writing procedures when preparing for each lab. Finally, the lab reports helped to develop skills in making conclusions based on data as well as scientific writing (ex. abstracts and reflection questions). Overall, this course develops the skills needed for any lab courses/lab work.",
                "I was able to apply the skills I learned in CHEM 161 through the various experiments that were completed, thus giving me a better understanding of the concepts taught in general chemistry. I also developed my skills in using basic laboratory equipment as well as in properly recording and reporting data.",

                "Lab skills are acquired by taking this course. You learn how to use basic lab equipment and learn the actual experiments behind the CHEM 161 content.",
                "I learned basic laboratory techniques and general lab decorum",
                "Basic lab introduction similar to that done in AP Chem, main improvement was with Loggerpro graphing software and using a pipet bulb",
                "While taking this course, I learned that your TF makes a huge impact on your understanding. I learned a lot about the materials in the lab and how to safely use them. I also learned how to properly record lab activities by knowing how to effectively fill out notebook pages.",
                "This course taught me how to perform a variety of experiments - titration, calorimetry, electrolysis, and Vis-UV spectroscopy. The techniques and different equipment were well-explained in the pre-lab lectures, and the labs aligned well with the lectures.",
                "I was able to learn a lot of basic lab skills and lab safety.",
                "I learned to be patient and not rush through labs. I also learned the importance of preparation when it comes to labs; it was always imperative that I watched the pre-lab video before the lab.",

                "I learned how to work in a chemistry lab and perform relatively simple chemistry experiments applicable to gen chem 1.",
                "I developed better understanding of chemistry concepts, as well as the ability to write formal lab reports and conduct experiments in a lab setting.",
                "I developed general lab techniques and lab report writing competencies.",
                "I learned a lot of basics about how to stay organized and sterile in a lab environment. I experimentally confirmed some of the gas laws I had learned about back in AP Chem. My favorite part of the course, however, was when we would calculate constants (like Avogadro's number or the R value for gas laws) using experimental data that we collected. This was cool because it showed the origin of the values that are now essential to a lot of scientific equations.",
                "I developed practical knowledge for working in a chemistry lab. For example, I learned how to titrate and fill out a lab report.",
                "I got to work on my fluency in lab and my skills writing lab reports. I was able to feel much more comfortable working in a lab setting in this course.",
                "Definitely learned things that would be useful for any hands-on lab. It was also a good way to begin to get used to scientific writing.",

                "Laboratory skills, how to be safe in the lab, how to write a lab write-up, how to work well in lab with a partner.",
                "I learned how to apply my basic chemistry textbook skills onto lab procedures and experiments that many times validated the concepts we learned. This included trying to understand the gas laws, spectrophotometry and density of objects.",
                "I learned very basic chem lab techniques, how to write a lab report and an abstract, and how to use Excel to create graphs.",
                "I developed various skills in lab that I previously had in high school and gained knowledge on a variety of associated chemistry concepts we covered.",
                "I learned a lot of wet lab skills, such as safety precautions to take.",
                "Taking this course helped me understand concepts in CHEM 161 better. It also taught me how to write formal lab reports.",
                "The main skill that I learned as a result of taking this class is about asking questions and collaborating with others to figure out what I did correctly and incorrectly. I learned to ask my TF and my classmates questions to further my understanding. I also learned a lot about lab equipment and how to correctly handle various items.",
                "I loved learning new lab techniques and the \"hands on\" learning. It was really fun to do the experiments.",
                "Learned the basics of Chemistry Lab. Learned the safety equipment, as well as how to use various apparatuses and other tools. Learned how to organize my lab notebook and how to write lab reports.",
                "I learned how to write lab reports and perform basic lab skills. I also learned the effectiveness of office hours in completing assignments.",
                "I learned to be precise in the lab and complete standard chemistry experiments. I also learned how to write a post-lab and analyze the data received from the lab.",
                "Learning how to keep a lab note book. Otherwise I found the course fairly unhelpful.",
                "Lab skills and etiquette are probably the most important thing you learn in this course (measuring, cleaning, and weighing properly) but you pretty much learn this all within the first two labs. After that, the experiments feel pretty pointless and don't teach you much. You always know what your results will look like and your grade is heavily dependent on the lab reports, which don't teach you anything and, to my knowledge, are not even used when doing actual research.",
                "I didn't gain any skills or insights in this course. All the experiments were very basic and didn't make me feel like I was doing anything scientific at all. It was no different than the things you do in a very basic high school chemistry class.",
                "I learned how to effectively carry out basic procedures in the lab that will become very useful as I continue taking more advanced lab classes. I also developed skills on how to write an abstract for a lab and write a lab report too. I gained insight on how important small details are in lab reports, like the number of sig figs given for an answer or the layout for a graph. Overall, this course gave me a great foundation for doing lab work and writing the corresponding reports, which I will continue to do in my Yale career and beyond.",
                "A great review of the material I previously learned in AP Chemistry. Some topics were taught more in depth and I felt like I developed a overall better understanding of the material.",
                "I developed basic knowledge of chemistry.",

                "I learned basic lab skills and how to write lab reports.",

                "Through this course, I was taught the introductory information and practices seen used within chemistry labs; furthermore, this course helped apply many of the concepts that were introduced through CHEM 161, allowing for a better understanding of the reactions and phenomena shown through that course.",
                "I learned many different lab techniques and also how to write a chemistry lab report.",
                "Learned how to work in a real chemistry laboratory. \r\nLab skills such as spectrometry, calorimetry, a lot of excel and lab report features (for example, the abstract).",
                "How to write abstract and use lab equipments and carry out experiments",
                "This course introduced me to fundamental laboratory skills that can be applied in future lab experiences. Although the grading scale and requirements for the lab reports were strict, it has taught me to be more attentive as a prospective scientist. Furthermore, this course built and expanded on the content learned in lectures, which helped me better understand the course material.",
                "Learned how to preform various experiments in a lab setting and write practical lab reports.",
                "I didn't gain much out of this class. I learned how to handle lab equipment properly? And maybe you could say how to work with data, but the methods for working with data in gen chem lab such as using excel to prepare graphs are not good compared to the current standard of using code like python and matlab."

            "comments": [
                "This course is a lot of work and required equal work to a normal credit class. However, the strong work load is useful in ensuring that you develop lab skills. The course teaches very basic lab techniques that build on each other.",
                "Strengths: weekly meetings with some workshops between lab meetings, to help work on a particularly new or difficult aspect of the upcoming lab report. Structured well, as each week's routine felt fairly similar, yet all labs felt fresh and unique. The labs themselves covered a wide variety of chemistry topics and involved the use of many unique pieces of lab equipment. Weaknesses: only one in-person office hour each week was offered the entire semester. Very often, the lab reports took far longer than any work in the actual gen chem class and felt unnecessarily lengthy. Grading was also extremely inconsistent, as having a different TF grade your work each week when some TFs prefer to see certain things others do not often leaves you unsure as to what to include/not to include since you do not know who will be grading you that week.",
                "I felt that this course was a good way to supplement the information being taught in CHEM 161. The pre-lab lectures and manuals were very helpful for understanding the procedures for the experiments carried out in the lab. My biggest issue with this course was the inconsistency in grading and feedback.  Some teaching fellows left excellent, detailed feedback on my lab reports, whereas others were less than helpful, failing to describe why points were deducted or what the correct answer was. The advice given by TFs during office hours also seemed inconsistent with grading standards, which led to confusion about some of the scores received on my lab reports.",
                "The strengths of the course is that is utilizes project-based learning to create memories along with knowledge, which has been proven to be among one of the highest forms of learning. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course is the hands-off approach of teaching coupled with strict grading. Since the majority of the final grade is based on lab reports, and students were never directly taught how to do lab reports* (expanded more below), scoring well in this class became a difficult challenge. Coupled with the fact that the rubric for the assignment was general enough that exact details required for specific questions were never made public, it was very easy to lose points. \r\n\r\n*Instead of being taught how to do lab reports, at the beginning of the year students were given a very broad outline of one and was told to use their best judgement in a sense. The feedback from the lab reports would then inform us in the future on how to best create lab reports. While this would typically foster creativity and resourcefulness, this proved to be much more challenging when the feedback returned with many lost points and insightful comments such as \"this is missing something\" without clarifying.",
                "Terrible too strict grading system",
                "poorly aligns to chem 163",
                "The prelab lectures are very long and not always super helpful as most of the necessary information is in the pdf procedure. Additionally, the lab reports vary in length from week to week. It would be easier to manage the workload if the length of each report was more standardized, but the homework assignments were not too too long overall.",
                "Strengths: Teaches how to work in a lab and how to collaborate with others\r\nWeaknesses: Grading was not consistent at all. TAs were far too harsh on reports and different TAs wanted different things and graded reports completely differently. Parr was also very difficult to approach and would never really disagree with any of the TAs decisions on grades.",
                "Strengths: I really liked my TA and Prof. Parr was willing to help if you needed it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lab reports are graded horribly, graders were extremely nitpicky",
                "First density lab could be replaced with something a little more engaging while still providing a good introduction",
                "The weaknesses for this course were the lab reports I wish that there was another workshop to show how to enhance lab reports, which would be beneficial, especially since those hold the most points. The strengths for this course were seen with the TFs and their availability to answer questions during lab sessions..",
                "Strengths: The pre-lab lectures and pdf's explained the experiments thoroughly in advance, and the TF's were very helpful while performing the experiments. I think the course was very well planned and organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only weakness is that sometimes the TF's assumed everyone was in CHEM 161 and forgot that CHEM 163 students take the same lab, but have different lectures, so it was hard to understand references to CHEM 161 as a CHEM 163 student.",
                "This is a great class to be introduced to lab basics, but there can be more support at better times.",
                "Ensuring that TFs are dedicated to our learning and equipping us with the instructions to successfully complete the lab. That was a major weakness of the course: my TF constantly led me astray causing me to have to redo the lab. Also I think if we were able to work with partners lab would be a better experience. I am not sure there were any strengths of Lab other than the set-up for each lab was always throughly done. Another weakness was that the grading was extremely unfair and subjective. Your grades on the lab reports depended on which TF graded them and there was no basis for the grades one received. Because one TF could say the Abstract didn't fulfill its purpose but another could say the complete opposite.",
                "This course meets once a week to perform the concepts general chemistry covers in lecture. However, many of these labs were not as explanatory as they were made out to be. I feel that this course did nothing to improve my knowledge and understanding of chemistry. I think if the course was less based on the lab reports at the end and focused more on the actual chemistry we are performing, then the course would be significantly better.",
                "The work is not coordinated with classwork, so sometimes we do labs on topics we have not learned. The grading was not consistent, and your grade was very dependent on the TA you happen to get. I appreciated how thorough instruction was.",
                "The marking is a little vague (and is different depending on the marker.) Could have a more systemic grading system.",
                "The strength of this course is that the course really values independence, which results in feeling very proud of your work. Also, my teaching assistant was really helpful, but that may have not been everyone's experience. The course could be improved by being a little less strict about points on lab reports. Sometimes, I feel that points were taken off for tiny insignificant details.",
                "A strength of this course was the receptiveness of the TA's when it came to questions regarding the lab reports. A weakness of this course was the inconsistency that accompanied the grading of the lab reports.",
                "Strengths: The experiments were very cool and there were multiple times throughout the semester when the lab course strengthened my command of the lecture course's content. Also, the TFs and Dr. Parr are very helpful!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pre-lab lectures are quite dry and the grading on the lab reports can feel demotivating. It's also more work than a 0.5 credit to be honest, it deserves a full credit.",
                "unnecessarily picky on students, very little strengths (i didn't learn anything new in this class despite learning a lot in my accompanying normal chemistry class)",
                "I liked the setup of watching prelab lectures to get a better understanding of lab. However, I wish we got more guidance on completing the lab reports. The reports took very long to make and we were unclear on what we were being graded on.",
                "The strengths of this course are the workshops where you are advised on how to improve your lab reports. The weaknesses of this course are the very time-consuming lab reports. The pre-lab lecture (though helpful) could be upwards of one and a half hours long. Pre-lab quizzes sometimes had confusingly written questions.",
                "Strengths: clear (and very quick!) feedback, walks students through basic lab techniques and tools, teaches students how to use Excel to make graphs\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Parr doesn't care about individual students (but the TAs do!), labs can be boring and repetitive",
                "I understand that this course intends to develop independence within its students, but I think in striving for that, instructions were often vague and it felt like I was being set up to do poorly. I think clearer criteria, more explanation of why we were doing each experiment, and how it may relate to the CHEM 161 material would have made reports a more accurate demonstration of our understanding rather than us grasping at what we think the TF wants to see.",
                "My overall satisfaction with the material which was taught was low due to the poor structuring of the course and overly harsh evaluations.  I think that the grading process for the lab reports could be more holistic and rather than taking off points and grading harshly, they could provide constructive feedback and grade on improvement.",
                "Strength: many TA office hours, being in a chemistry lab setting is fun\r\nWeakness: very limited Dr. Parr office hours, lab reports were very meticulous and extremely (perhaps unnecessarily) detailed-oriented\r\n\r\nI think the grading scheme of the lab reports could be improved to truly demonstrate concept mastery instead of losing a significant number of points to a very small grammar error, for example.",
                "This course is a great supplement to the material learned in CHEM 161, and often times it helped me attain a better understanding of some concepts that were taught in the general chemistry lecture course. The experiments were easy to follow and the lab professionals were incredibly helpful in case there were any issues. Although some times the rubrics for the lab reports were vague, the assignment of writing the lab reports themselves is a good method to develop writing skills, especially for the science field. The feedback for the lab reports was also very informative and helped with future reports.",
                "Some strengths are the structure of the course and the breadth of scientific topics covered. Weaknesses would be inconsistency in grading.",
                "I think hands-on chemistry is intrinsically a strength of this course. That is one of the best kinds of learning. The variety of experiments were also great. The biggest weakness I can think of was that the pre-lab lectures and quizzes were only released 24 hours before lab. Sometimes the night before could be particularly busy with other work (I usually had PSets that happened to be due on my lab day). Oftentimes, I would just read through the manual, take notes, and do the quiz, rather than watch the full lecture. I would have preferred the opportunity to at least start the pre-lab lecture and notes further in advance. I also feel like there was a lot of variability in the grading of each lab report. Each report was graded by a different TF and I felt like there was a lot of subjectivity there. Sometimes my abstract would be \"too thorough\" and then a similar abstract on another experiment would be \"missing key details.\" I wasn't upset about my grades, but the wide array of feedback made me genuinely confused how to approach the next report: how detailed should I be? I think a more standardized rubric and expectations would make it clearer how to go about each lab report.",
                "Strengths of this course are the hands on learning, and workshop sessions to learn how to fill out lab reports.",
                "This course is an incredible introduction to working in a chemistry lab. I was able to learn/practice many key skills and feel a lot more comfortable in the space. One weakness of this course was the grading discrepancies across TF's which made it feel like additional time and effort in lab reports was not being reflected.",
                "A big strength was the report templates we got each time we had a report due. It was extremely helpful in organizing material.",
                "Strengths: The pre-class lectures and quizzes are helpful, the experiment sheets that the TAs make are great, and there are a lot of TA office hours. The TAs are awesome.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab reports are graded differently depending on who grades it. They are extremely confusing, take a long time to finish, and rquire the student to consult multiple people to get right.",
                "I really enjoyed when workshops for the postlabs were held, and I would have benefited from there being more of them.",
                "As an introductory lab course, this course does a decent job at not being exceedingly boring. There were some cool experiments that we had the chance to do, and some satisfying graphs and write-ups. However, the grading and feedback was unnecessarily harsh and critical, which made the experience of an intro lab class frustratingly tedious and difficult.",
                "I think the lab reports could have been graded on different scales as they were mainly focused on the type of report produced, with the sig figs and whether or not the report was clean, instead of the actual content written about. The strength of the course was that the number of students per TA was good because they were all able to focus on the smaller group instead of having to worry about more students.",
                "Strengths: Pre-class videos and manuals were very helpful as they easily explained the procedure of the experiment. Very hands-on experiments. TF's were very helpful in explaining complicated parts of the experiment. Lots of office hours to answer questions about the lab reports. \r\nWeakness: Lab reports were very long and time-consuming. Each TF grades differently so there is a difference in the grades you receive from each TF.",
                "The strengths were the amount of help that was offered, through both workshops and office hours. I'd also say the pre-lab lectures aided immensely in the success and smoothness of lab procedures. The weakness of this course was the tediousness of the post-lab reports, and the lack of consistency of grading among the TAs; often your success on a report was based on who was grading your work rather than your ability to learn from the lab.",
                "A big strength is that we get to start on the lab immediately because we are able to prepare beforehand (love the virtual lectures). I think the weakness might be how the rubric isn't specific enough sometimes, so points are easily lost in the lab reports.",
                "I took chem163, and the material covered didnt really reflect what I did in lab. I would really like to see a future lab section that accurately shows what is being taught in class. Otherwise I dont see a point in offering 163 or not having a 163 lab section. Also if there was a video tutorial just on how to use Excel that would be awesome.",
                "The labs themselves were fairly engaging. The process, however, is heavily dependent on the TF in your section. If your TF is very inefficient, you may be staying in the lab much longer than other groups. Furthermore, each TF grades very differently which can be quite annoying when writing lab reports.",
                "The one thing that I wanted really badly is for the Postlab number to match the experiment number. For example, if there were two experiments for one postlab, I would have preferred that the experiments be divided into sections (Experiment 1 part 1, Experiment 1 part 2) so that the Postlab could be called postlab 1. I felt like I had to look through to see which postlab corresponded to which experiment too many times to count.  \r\n\r\nThe TFs were definitely a strength in this course as some of them were very helpful. I also liked that we were allowed to ask for regrading from Professor Parr as I ended up doing this and know many people who also did this.",
                "It was fun to do the labs, however, it is a lot of work for a .5 credit class. It is very interesting and engaging though.",
                "Strengths- Never did the lab take the full time, learned a lot of valuable skills, fun\r\nWeaknesses- none",
                "The course had thoroughly explained lab guides that made each lab easy to perform. However, despite detailed explanations, the guide or prelab videos frequently contained incorrect or contradicting information that made it difficult to fulfill requirements for the following assignments. It could be improved by keeping the TA's better informed or by having a stronger instructor.",
                "I believe there could be more involvement than just a pre-lab video. Before lab class our teacher hardly went over anything and was not very helpful during the experiments. I think I would receive a deeper understanding of the experiments and the meaning of the procedure with a short preview prior to the lab.",
                "This course is really not as painful as some make it out to be in the course evaluations. I think it's fair to say that the course is a lot of busy work that's not intellectually challenging but incredibly time-consuming. The lab reports are actually really easy to complete but most people end up spending many hours on them because the grading is harsh and arbitrary at times (ex. losing five or ten points for including incorrect sig figs/units.) If, however, you have a keen eye for detail and consistently ask the TFs to clarify something you're not sure of, then it's pretty easy to do very well in the course.",
                "The grading was very opaque, the feedback on lab reports was mostly unhelpful, and the experiments were uninteresting.",
                "Grading of the lab reports varies greatly by TF. Labs are usually pretty boring and tedious because you don't do any interesting experiments. You only learn to use really basic lab eqiupment (burets, scales, hot plates).",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is the grading. This class gave me anxiety. I would spend hours on the lab reports each week, trying to look for every miniscule detail and every possible place the TFs could take points off on. We are given no clear instructions on what the graders exactly want and furthermore the grading is extremely inconsistent. Despite spending hours each week, going to office hours, and getting advice from TFs on what to change in my report, I would still get numerous points taken off what I thought were extremely silly reasons. This class brought down my experience of Yale and I feel like if I didn't take it, my quality of life would be way higher. Of course, I was still required to take the class for my academic path.",
                "Strengths: The TA office hours were helpful and at very convenient times. The TAs (mostly) were very approachable and kind. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ambiguity and unfairness in grading. Sometimes, the TAs would grade the reports however they wanted without looking at the answer key, which led to disagreements between scores of students that had the same answers. For example, one TA would want 2 sig figs for an answer, when another would want 3. Also, the help that TAs offered in office hours were sometimes not correct, which led to points being taken off on the reports. In a similar manner, sometimes a TA would say a student's report looks good and they would still get points off. Additionally, it was very annoying how the TAs would take off for the smallest things on the report. Tiny errors in sig figs should not cost a student 20 percent of their grade (especially when the sig figs of the measurement taken wasn't given), but it often did. Lastly, there were no office hours on the later days in the week, which was irritating to those who had lab later in the week and needed help with their report then.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. It was my favorite course of my first semester.",
                "This course feels very impersonal, very low engagement is required to succeed in the class.",
                "Strengths: The course helped me better understand general chemistry concepts by seeing the ideas in action. I really enjoyed doing all of the experiments in the lab and familiarizing myself with a laboratory environment.\r\nWeaknesses: This course emphasized perfection over learning and understanding. The grading system for the lab reports was incredibly frustrating. I would spend hours making sure my graphs had tick marks, double-checking sig figs, and ensuring that my calculations were written acceptably. It was frustrating to completely understand the underlying experimental concepts yet lose many points for these small errors. (Or, get only 50% credit for an abstract that was missing one of ten important details.)\r\nFor an introductory laboratory class in which most students have never written an abstract or graphed using Excel, I think the course should have better emphasized learning and skill-building.",
                "One weakness of this course was that we had a different TA marking our reports each week which made it challenging to show improvement on the given feedback as everyone was marking differently.",
                "The grading was not standardized across the graders",
                "I enjoyed having a wide range of labs to do and how they could be related to what we were learning in class. The grading of the labs, particularly when writing the abstract/introduction section, was a little difficult to figure out though.",
                "The strengths of the course were the labs themselves, I believe they were designed well and helped me as a student be able to better understand how chemical processes worked. I also think the difficulty of the labs themselves varied slightly, but were never too difficult to follow along with. Some weaknesses of the course were that the some of the lab reports were significantly longer than others and the excessively harsh grading on some of them made it difficult to know exactly how to improve scores on later lab reports. It was not until the second half of the semester that I was able to improve my scores and also fully understand what the graders of the lab reports were looking for.",
                "A weakness was the lack of standardization in grading. A strength was the availability of feedback. It could be improved by a more informative rubric.",
                "Given that this is my first lab, I do not have any baseline to compare this course. Overall, the course had a structure that was easy to understand and adhere to, and the professors/teaching fellows who oversaw experiments were helpful and easy to understand.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe course material is interesting and useful.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nDifferent TA's grade the lab reports with different levels of harshness.",
                "The lab directions and grading were a weakness but the help of the TFs was a big strength",
                "Strengths: the labs are well set up and easy to get in and just start working, also engaging. \r\nWeakness: There is not enough guidance on the lab reports and the rubric is extremely vague and then points are taken off for things which were not even very clear.",
                "Lab grading is very picky \r\nGet a lot of points taken off for answering pre lab quiz wrong as it scales up from 5 to 20 points total",
                "The strengths of this course are the comprehensive hands-on experiences that students get in the lab. The weaknesses would be the grading system and rubric for the lab reports. The rubric for lab reports were pretty vague, which resulted in the grades being subjective at times. There was always a lot of confusion among my peers and I about the reasoning behind penalties, etc.",
                "Strengths: all labs were clearly planned out and i knew what was happening and how to do the lab before walking in\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading was very very harsh for a first time gen chem class and instructions on lab reports were limited ans sometimes hard to understand.",
                "I absolutely hated writing lab reports and doing pre-lab quizzes with lectures that only open the day before your lab time. They need to give more time to watch the pre-lab lecture and do the quiz. Also, the lab reports were awful because the TAs would take away points left and right for the tiniest reasons (such as missing a period or giving two instead of three reasons for something when the prompt only says to give a \"couple\" of reasons)."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student considering taking further STEM laboratory classes. The course develops great foundational skills in lab and allows students to learn and grow from their foundation.",
                "Only if this class is a requirement or you have a really strong interest in chemistry, but even then I would say just take gen chem if you have an interest in chemistry. It is half a credit, but the workload often feels like much more than many full credit classes you will take. However, if it is a requirement, it is manageable as long as you make use of TF office hours, as well as finding a few people to check things like significant figures with before submitting the reports.",
                "In this teaching style I would not recommend this course to another student. Recommendation assumes that they are not taking this class as a requirement, and it seems like a couple wrong steps in this class will reduce one's GPA without learning, thus this unnecessary stress would be best to miss out on.",
                "No because it was too much work for little effective feedback and incredibly harsh grading. It felt like the rubrics for the lab reports were hidden and we had to guess what to write.",
                "it's a requirement",
                "I would not recommend this course if a student did not have to take it. However, it is a prerequisite for many other science courses, and I believe it helped teach some important lab techniques for future classes.",

                "Somewhat, if it is necessary for your academic journey, this was a fun course. But the workload is harshly graded.",
                "I would! I felt this was a relaxed introduction to chemistry lab, with relatively easy but relevant experiments. The workload was pretty manageable (just don't save your lab reports for the day-of), and the entire teaching team were friendly and helpful!",
                "Yes, it is a great way to apply concepts learned in class.",
                "No. Lab was awful for me because my TF wasn't helpful and it seemed as though the work I put into my Lab Reports was all for naught due to the inconsistency in grading.",
                "No. It seems that this course was not meant to generate deeper understanding of chemical concepts, but rather, it was meant to teach how to make lab reports. This is not a skill I value as much as understanding chemistry.",
                "I would not recommend unless it is required for your major.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it. It is a lot of work for it to be only 0.5 credits. The lab reports, especially during the middle of the semester, are very long and not clearly explained.",
                "If you need to take it for your major/pre-reqs, then yes.",

                "no",
                "I would recommend the course because its valuable to learn about how to work in a lab. However, the workload was pretty high for it only being half of a credit. I took as much time to complete work in this class as I did in my other courses that were a full credit.",
                "I would recommend this as an introduction laboratory course for all STEM majors. However, I feel that the labs being worth only 0.5 credits is somewhat strange given the workload.",
                "Not necessarily, but a lot of students have to take it. The material is sometimes boring/monotonous/disengaging, but I loved my section and TA so I always had a good time.",

                "If they do not have to take the course for a major requirement, no.  I think the course should count as one credit because it has a very heavy workload and I spent a lot of time on my lab reports just to have them torn apart by graders.  I had to ask for regrades because different graders graded harsher than others which was frustrating.",
                "I would if it is a prerequisite to other courses in the chemistry sequence.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. It is a good opportunity to become familiar with the lab environment if that is within their field of interest, and it helps develop critical thinking and writing skills that are useful in the science career fields. Often, the experiments were fun and engaging as well, which helped supplement chemistry lecture material.",
                "I would recommend the course.",
                "Most students, it seemed, took the course to fill a prerequisite. However, if you're genuinely interested in chemistry, I would recommend this course. I found a lot of the experiments interesting. My understanding is that they complemented and coincided with the CHEM 161 (GenChem) material quite well. I was in CHEM 163 (Advanced GenChem), and the experiments did not really relate to what I was learning in class. I think this would be a great companion course, especially for CHEM 161 students.",
                "I would recommend this course to others because of its informative value.",
                "I would. It was a good introduction to the lab portion of chemistry.",
                "It was nice but really only take it if it's required.",
                "It's probably a requirement, I don't think anybody takes the lab for fun. But if you do, it's a solid course. It will give you some of the basic skills you'll need if you'll be working in a lab. The lab reports are a pain, but they'll teach you how to write scientifically. Useful course for sure.",
                "Only if you need to. If you're looking for chemistry or a science credit, the normal chemistry class is way better to take. You don't gain much concrete knowledge from this class, besides how to do lab write-ups (which is definitely helpful if you're going to continue chemistry).",
                "Yes as it is a base course that is required for many majors and students interested in premed field.",
                "If you need it as a prerequisite, then yes. Otherwise it really is half a credit for double the work.",

                "Yes! I think this will help set you up for future labs!",
                "Not particularly, you are much better off just taking your chem class as is. The lab reports are really just busy work that you might get a bad grade on regardless. For some reason you can get a good grade on one lab and think you know how to write a report, only to find out the next TF that reads your report thinks its terrible and leaves you confused as to why you did it wrong when the previous TF thinks it was good. Even when you go to office hours you can still get some points off. Seems like a lot of times grading is subjective and theres nothing you can really do.",
                "I would recommend this course if you need this lab for something. It is definitely a challenge, and as the semester went on, I ended up putting more and more work into this lab. I would say to not take this class if you don't need it, but it is do-able, and I learned a lot from this class.",
                "Yes! It was really fun and I liked the course very much.",
                "Yes! Take it because it'll teach you the basics that you will need for future chemistry labs.",
                "I would only recommend it if it's required for your professional goals or major.",
                "Not the worst pre-req for an aspiring physician to take. It's not as bad as the course evaluations claim it to be. Not hard to do very well in, and the class is also curved so most people get decent grades in the end. I don't think you should change careers or majors just because the grading of this course can be really frustrating and nitpicky at times.",
                "Not unless you absolutely have to take it. It is boring and difficult and only half of a credit which is crazy for the amount of work and time it requires.",
                "Don't take it if you don't need a lab requirement. It feels like a waste of time, and the lab reports and lab prep will take up a good amount of time out of your week without you actually learning anything.",
                "No, this class, as I've stated in my previous response, completely lowered my mental health. The amount of work you have to put in for intense grading is insane. I've also left this class feeling like I've learned absolutely nothing, but with my self confidence shattered .",
                "Yes, if you need to take it to fill a requirement. If not, no.",
                "It was fine",
                "If they have to take it or have an interest in chemistry then sure.",
                "Yes, I think that this was a good introduction to chemistry lab.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it is a helpful way to get exposed to the basics of being in a lab space and performing experiments.",
                "I would recommend this course. For those pursuing a major involving chemistry, this course was a great introduction into how labs work and a great starting point for those who have no basis in the field.",
                "Yes, it is an interesting class as an introduction to lab techniques.",
                "Its a good lab course to take especially for those without much experience",
                "Yes, if they are a natural sciences major. Not only is it a requirement for a lot of natural science majors, but it also provides some insightful skills that are useful for future scientists.",
                "No, not unless you need lab credits.",
                "If you don't need lab courses for what you plan on doing, DON'T take this class. Unfortunately, for pre-meds and a good portion of science majors, we're stuck with these intro labs."
