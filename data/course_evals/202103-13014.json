I developed my skills in reading academic papers in social science: critiquing texts, distilling the most important points into a sentence or two, and understanding complex arguments and analyses."

This was far and away my favorite class I took this semester; I did all of the readings thoroughly, took detailed notes, participated a lot in our class discussions, and spent a long time doing assignments because the material was so engaging. Professor Messari is brilliant, concise, and skilled at asking critical questions about the texts and having students figure out what the central themes, important takeaways, and difficult questions are. This class is definitely one you have to commit to, but if you do, it will be one of the best you take."
