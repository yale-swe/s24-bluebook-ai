    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the biology underlying neurological processes and vice versa. It was very interesting to see how the fields of neuroscience and biology were so interconnected and learn about the various processes that lead to things such as muscle movement.  I developed the ability to apply these concepts to interpret data and develop an analysis of how alterations could impact them and much more.",
    "Learned information on synapses, brain circuitry, and formation of memories",
    "This course taught me fundamental knowledge of neurobiology and neuroscience.",
    "I gained in-depth knowledge about the brain's circuitry and electrical activity on a molecular level. I was also able to understand how small electrical changes in the neuron can affect behavior and other body systems.",
    "An overview of the brain's visual, sensory, and mechanical system. An understanding of action potential generation and mechanisms with pumps, ion channels vesicular fusion etc.",
    "neurobiology, how to analyze experiments to extract biological principles",
    "learned about brain function through a variety of different lenses, including the molecular, cellular, electrophysical, and broader scope view.",
    "Learned a lot about neurobiology.",
    "This class talked a lot about neurophysiology (especially gaining a deep understanding of action potentials) in the beginning and then delved into specific sensory systems (including visual, motor and somatosensory) at the end",
    "I learned about cellular neurophysiology, systems neurobiology and neural development and plasticity.",
    "a solid working knowledge of human neurobiology, from the molecular level to the macro level.",
    "I learned in depth about the electrophysiology of neurons and action potentials, the visual system, motor systems, and lots of neural circuitry.",
    "I developed knowledge of the neuroscience of the brain in particular and brushed up on my cell biology and physics knowledge in the process."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the lectures were very informative and a lot of information was presented in the short amount of time provided. I think better practice exam questions (perhaps from previous years) could have been provided to help with studying. I appreciated the open note structure of the tests. I think the lectures could have been a little more engaging and I feel the professor could have made better use of the chat. Obviously participation is simply more difficult for students in an online format and with other courses the chat has been used very successfully to answer questions, but it was hardly utilized at all in this course. The professor was completely unresponsive to my emails throughout the course and unresponsive to any form of accommodations a student may have.",
    "The strengths are the wide availability of discussion sections to ask questions as well as online resources helped a lot with having the material available.  The professor was also always willing to answer questions and I never felt like anything was unclear. The biggest weakness is definitely the lecture style and lack of engagement with the material within the class. I felt as though the class was mainly focused on teaching a high volume of material in a short time rather than actually having students engage with it.",
    "Strengths - small class size and very interesting material \r\nWeaknesses - like all summer courses this was fast-paced but I think this was especially hard for this course",
    "It was well organized.",
    "Teaching and long length of class made it difficult to pay attention, felt like things were just being thrown at me",
    "The professor and TAs were extremely helpful and engaging. Overall, a very impressive course. I would have liked if the lectures were broken up with other styles of teaching because the amount of information taught in a short period of time could become overwhelming.",
    "Material is reviewed very quickly, notes and order of material is not very clear at first (where things connect\/are leaked to each other). It is a great introduction to neurobiology and links in other knowledge from cellular biology classes you might have taken.",
    "comprehensive & interesting\r\n\r\ntests were way too long: it took me double time to complete them",
    "I think they did a great job getting a lot of information into a small period of time. It strikes me as terrible pedagogy to have three tests be the only engagement with the course, though. I think weekly psets would be super helpful and force students to think about the subject in the way the exams call for.",
    "Strengths: Interesting content, good professor and Kathy and Sharif were great TAs.\r\nWeaknesses: Class was rushed and sometimes it was hard to grasp how to connect some topics. The handout help, but especially when it comes to all the derivations, extraneous information during YSS often feel burdensome and unnecessary.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot of information and Professor Haig is really knowledgable and really wants to make sure all his students are learning\r\nWeakness: its a ton of information in a short period of time which can feel very overwhelming",
    "Haig is a wonderful professor who creates great handouts to follow the course material. There is a lot of material, but he made it pretty easy to follow during lecture. The teaching fellows' review sessions each week also contributed to consolidating the material better.",
    "Although it was online, Professor Keshishian was super accommodating.",
    "Haig is definitely a strength to the course, as are his team of TA. Lectures were clear and interesting, despite their length, and the lecture handouts made material accessible and easy to master outside of lecture.",
    "This was a great class, Haig is a cool professor but he will tend to fly through content so take time to cut in and ask questions during lecture. Go to the weekly discussion sessions with the TAs, they were all super helpful (you can go to all of them to get slightly different explanations of the content which is helpful.",
    "This course had loads of TF sessions to help students understand the material better. There was also ample time\/accommodations for taking the test online and gathering the materials to submit.\r\nHowever, I found the class to be incredibly fast-paced, and at times, overloaded with information. It was unclear what exactly was going to be on the test, so at times I found myself studying one particular area that seemed important to the exam during the lecture, yet something completely different was on the test. This information would likely have been easier to memorize\/understand in the stretch of a full semester, but I felt that there was too much to potentially study for the tests with few specifics of what would actually be on said tests."

   "comments": [
    "It's not that bad of a course although there's certainly going to be a lot of self teaching involved. It's required for a few majors so some of us just have to take it. The course didn't really adapt well to online format and the professor seemed very concerned with trying to make it as identical to the in person version as possible, rather than embracing the advantages of the new format and making the course more interactive. Take it if you have to, you probably won't have any real problem grade-wise, but you may not enjoy the course that much either. It's a typical lecture style course with little student-professor interaction. Open book tests are good but entirely basing a grade on 1-3 tests is probably not ideal for the majority of students, even though it is typical in science courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it because even though i'm not in the neuroscience major or neurology track of MCDB, I found it to be a refreshing twist and alternative to traditional biology courses and it's just interesting to see how various disciplines are interconnected.",
    "I'm pretty sure only people who have to take this course for their major (MCDB, Neuroscience) take this course but it is very interesting!!",
    "Yes, this is an amazing course for pre-med and neuroscience and MCDB students.",
    "Yes, the course was interesting and engaging",
    "Yes, however it requires a lot of attention and I would not recommend to take it with another summer course at the same time.",
    "yes, but only if you've already taken NSCI 160",
    "Yes definitely! Supremely interesting content that covers a wide swath of neuroscience without being too overwhelming",
    "Yes - if you have to take it as a requirement or if you are really interested in gaining a deep understanding of neurobiology I would say take this class- I was scared to do it in the summer because of the sheer amount of material but it was super interesting and Haig organizes the class really well!",
    "Yes. If you want to know more about the brain that is relevant to research.",
    "Neuroscience students have to take this course anyway.",
    "Yes, Id wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. A preliminary background in chemistry and intro biology is all thats required to grasp the material, and the insights gained have profound effects upon your understanding of cognition and consciousness.",
    "Definitely, it's a great course if you're actually interested in the content. No busy work or homework, so its really on you to put the work in and prepare for the exams but pretty awesome class if you want it to be.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were capable of memorizing large quantities of information quickly and were truly dedicated to all aspects of neuroscience--and a morning person--but even then, I would recommend the semester course as opposed to the five-week intensive summer course (especially if they were already considering taking a second class during that time). Reading through the hundreds of pages of handouts\/book, along with memorizing the various diagrams and chains of reactions takes loads of time and effort. If you are not good at memorizing even the basics, this course would be incredibly difficult."
