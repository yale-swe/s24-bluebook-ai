Meeting everyday definitely felt like a lot, but ultimately it felt necessary in getting enough exposure to the language so that I could really improve. I feel that my reading comprehension, verbal comprehension, and verbal ability have all improved.",
                "My speaking and audio understanding abilities improved greatly over the course of this semester.",

                "I learned how to more fluently converse and comprehend in Spanish, as well as different aspect of culture and practices of Spanish speaking countries.",
                "I developed a deeper understanding of Spanish II and I also understood new things about my study habits.",
                "I gained significant knowledge and experience with Spanish language and grammar. My understanding of how to use Spanish grammatical structures and tenses grew dramatically, and I am now much more confident in my ability to express ideas in Spanish and understand others.",
                "This course developed my knowledge of Spanish more than I was anticipating. We learned a lot of vocabulary and grammatical structures that have made me more confident in my speaking and comprehending abilities."

                "I feel like sometimes the projects were unnecessary. I also felt sometimes that it wasn't entirely easy to prepare for the exams. I think more resources for studying could potentially be beneficial. Overall, I thought the class was well structured. Meeting frequently felt like a necessary part of the learning.",
                "The strengths are the frequency of classes and the style of teaching which involves a lot of student engagement and student speaking.",
                "Strengths: cold calling on students in class was scary at first but greatly helped us improve our conversational skills without dictionary help. The out of class Lingua-Meeting improved my conversational skills greatly. the composition in class essays improved my ability to write in spanish. Overall, it was a highly engaging class, the professor made the work fun and she also cared deeply about the success of her students. \r\nWeaknesses: the course work was very high, it was time consuming especially with assignments (at the end of the year after the final exam) that felt like busy-work.",
                "This course is designed very well as having conversations in Spanish is an extremely effective way to practice quickly and naturally comprehending and responding in the language. On the asynchronous days, the work could be more engaging, as having time off from speaking a language can make re-entry more difficult.",
                "Strengths: meeting almost every day & having assignments. Weaknesses: truly not many. If I struggled it was because of my time commitment.",
                "It was very helpful that the course was taught exclusively in Spanish and that there were many opportunities to practice speaking in Spanish as a result. The homework was helpful and the ability to revise was fantastic. LinguaMeeting was also a fun and helpful way to practice speaking with native speakers.",
                "This course is very interactive, but I think learning the vast amount of information so quickly can be very challenging."
