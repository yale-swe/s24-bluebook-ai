We spent almost the entire semester on those two topics, at the end of the semester we talked about the \"logic\" part, which was so rushed that none of it really got into our brain.

                "It felt that while we eventually got to our goal of proving the incompleteness theorems, such a proof doesn't need a whole semester of build up, or it if does, we should have explored more interesting ideas that logicians have thought of along the way. It felt like a lot of beautiful ideas went undiscussed, and that we were so focused on the incompleteness theorems that a lot of mathematical logic was skipped over.",

The final is almost impossible, though, in that it expects you to come up with proofs using techniques barely mentioned in class. I wish the course was more rigorous, since at its current pace you don't really learn enough to understand the cool stuff at the end, so you mostly come away with a few specific facts and some vague understandings.",
                "STRENGTHS:  The Prof is nice, she is a wonderful person and she would even meet with you on weekends if you needed help . \r\nWEAKNESS: The prof is horrible at teaching, if you have no background on this type of stuff then reading the book is basically out of the table, and reading the lectures notes is simply just a waste of time.  To succeed in this class you would probably need recorded lectures, or a bunch of time to read the lecture notes until you understand them.",

THIS IS NOT TRUE, this is what they don't tell you:  The exams are HARD AF, yes this course is a gut in terms of workload, but this is not a good thing because it does not prepare you for the brutal final and oral exams. I have taken some of the hardest math classes at yale ( 350, 305 ,310,...) and I still thought the final was simply brutal, but this is all because we never learned the material properly in the first place because of how little homework there was. The week before the oral exam I pulled a couple all-nighterS just trying to read the book(which is also impossible to read)   and watch the lectures at least twice because of how bad they were. I had no background on logic or any of this kind of material, so I, along with some of my friends with the same background, found this class really hard towards the end of the semester. I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND this class if you have some sort of experience, otherwise it almost better if you simply stay away.",
