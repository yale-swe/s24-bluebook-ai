   "comments": [
    "Knowledge on how to write an expository essay, knowledge on cities as centers of culture, architecture, people, etc.",
    "Urban planning theories, writings about the city, zoning laws, HOLC\r\nHow to make a good claim, hypotactic structure, engaging with sources, making an argument effectively",
    "I learned about cities, their development, and the issues facing them. I improved my writing skills, specially when it comes to writing clearly and cohesively, developing an original argument, and structuring my essays. I would recommend ENGL 114 to anyone who wants to improve\/solidify their writing skills.",
    "I learned how to write an argumentative paper and analyze the works of others.",
    "I really learned how to develop strong argument in papers and carry it throughout the whole piece. I have become confident in creating a claim and having sources collaborate to back it up.",
    "This course really reinforced my ability to write a standard academic essay and helped prepare me for all the future Yale courses I will take. It did so while simultaneously introducing me to the idea of city planning, which is now a topic I find very engaging.",
    "I learned to write academic essays at an advanced level using a variety of very useful writing and rhetorical tools that will help me in writing essays all throughout my time in college (and beyond). I became a stronger, clearer, and better writer not just at the paragraph and sentence level, but at the level of the entire essay.",
    "I learned how to plan, write, and edit an essay on the college level. I learned strategies and skills to strengthen my writing and to create a foundation for the rest of my writing in college. Through this course, I also learned much more about urban and public spaces. Additionally, I learned how to conduct research and how to compile my findings into a research paper.",
    "I learned how to construct an argument more thoroughly, which aided both my writing and reading analysis skills.",
    "Just how to better sculpt my writing"

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting topics and mostly interesting readings. Weaknesses: There should be more professor feedback during the writing process (i.e. before handing in the paper).",
    "Strengths: the essays build on each other, good progression of workload\r\nWeakness: pace too fast",
    "The weaknesses of this course is that it is supposed to teach students how to write a college essay but the initial grades already expect us to know how to. The system of Engl 114 is inherently flawed. The strength of the course is that the teacher was there to guide us and make us better writes",
    "Sometimes we dont work on the papers in class as much as I think we could. But the readings we do and the feedback we get is super useful.",
    "I think the weighting of the assignments and the distribution of the assignments throughout the semester was well-thought out. Having the 3rd essay, rather than the 4th, be the highest weighted assignment was great because it took the stress off of the final exam period.",
    "The strengths of this course include instructor and peer feedback on writing, reading about an array of topics relating to cities and city life, and introduction to strategies to aid writing. Some readings in the course did feel unnecessary and I wish there was more guidance for the written assignment in the class.",
    "The content was interesting as well as the skills learned. It could be improved with more feedback stages."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who enjoys writing\/English and has an interest in cities.",
    "YES!!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. If you're looking to gain, improve, or simply ensure you have the writing skills you need for college, I would really recommend taking this class. Professor Newton gives clear feedback that helps you improve every essay. There is a lot of peer review so that you can learn from others as well!",
    "Depends. If they want to be pushed to become a better writer than sure. However, if they only want an English credit then the amount of work in this class is not worth it",
    "Yes, it is a great way to become more confident in your writing abilities.",
    "Yes, but not if you already feel very confident with your writing. This is a great introductory course that will help you get the hang of college-level writing but it may be boring if you find that you are already an organized and purposeful writer. Additionally, the topic of this strain of English 114 was extremely interesting and definitely worth exploring!",
    "Yes; it is a demanding yet necessary and beneficial course to take.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to improve their writing skills and wants to know how to write a research paper. Also, this course does a great job of introducing students to issues that occur within cities and their impact on city life for different groups of people.",
    "Yes! Professor Newton truly cares about her students' understanding of the material. She is interested in cities, and is willing to learn alongside us, and is a great writing teacher. She offers help outside of the classroom, which is a very useful supplement to the class.",
    "Yes very much so, was really engaged with it and found the teaching exceptional"
