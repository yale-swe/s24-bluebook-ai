                "I think my interactions with the subject of imperialism has often been from a theoretical or moral standpoint; ER&M 439 certainly supplemented that ambiguous, emotion-driven framework with history and theory that had a clearly defined lexicon.",
                "A much better grasp of decolonial commodity histories as a methodology for subverting the violence of the archive. Wonderful peer-based insight.",
                "I learned about colonialism's effects on our present day world, and how imperialism shapes the pathways of the items that we interact with on a daily basis. I learned the most from doing my final paper in this class, which was very open-ended. I chose to do a deep dive into Malaysian cuisine as a hybrid representation of the country's ethnic diversity.",
                "What didn't I learn from this class!!! I definitely learned how to engage with theory and overall just a myriad of methodologies which has been so valuable to me. I learned about empire, colonialism, and the metropole-periphery relationship, about the material and discursive. I learned so much from this course I cannot recommend it enough.",
                "I received good theoretical insight into the ways in which imperialism manifests in our society.",
                "This class was incredibly helpful for my senior thesis. The focus on imperialism, past and future, is a must for any student in ethnic studies, political science, and other social science\/humanities major."

                "This course had a lot of reading, much of which was quite dense, and which sometimes felt as though it required a certain bank of prior knowledge. I almost wonder if this course might have been more successful as a twice-a-week seminar; meeting only once a week, it was difficult to cover every reading in its entirety while also addressing potential areas of confusion with the works.",
                "Gary Okihiro is fabulous and possibly the best professor I've had at Yale. Some readings could be recombined, and more clear rubrics from the TF re: presentations would be nice.",
                "Strengths: the minimal reading responses (250 words) were the perfect length and not too much of a burden on students; a great space for us to synthesize what we read that week. I also really enjoyed the open-endedness of the final project, and enjoyed hearing other people's projects in student presentations. \r\nWeaknesses: I wished the discussion was a bit more guided; some questions posed to the class were too broad and might have felt very difficult for us to tackle.",
                "The strengths of this class are that we engage with new text(s) and scholar(s) every week and our only expectations, weekly, are to read and then write a reading response that engages with the text and demonstrates our ability to think critically about the readings we are assigned, not just summarize them. I can definitively say that my writing has improved from this class because I had to learn how to write reading responses every week and now it is a skill I have. There are no weaknesses to this course, it is such an amazing course.",
                "One strength is the ability of Prof. Okihiro and TA Erich to create a community rooted in care for each other. It was wonderful to have such a community, especially during this pandemic.",
                "Strengths: I loved our TF, Erich thought the discussions he led in class were thoughtfully prepared, and I appreciated the way Erich brought in visual art for us to analyze. I felt often like the class was an education beyond the syllabus readings, which is a sign of a good seminar space.",
                "Everything was great and the professor and TA were very understanding of the circumstances and student stress during final periods to accomdate."

                "While I, personally, found myself sometimes lacking the critical theoretical lexicon to engage with some of the course material, this course will definitely appeal to any student with strong social science interests and a desire to understand how inequities manifest not just on interpersonal levels, but systemic levels as well.",
                "Yes! A staple ERM course.",
                "Yes! Though the readings are pretty heavy, time spent in class is less detail-oriented and more big-picture synthesizing. Professor Okihiro is fantastic and Erich our TA was also really phenomenal. Loved getting to know both of them. I also love the flexibility of the final project, and spent a lot of time this semester diving into what I saw as a passion project.",
                "I absolutely would. You learn so much from the course material, the teaching fellow, your peers, and professor Okihiro. I cannot recommend it enough!",
                "This course is a gem for any student interested in learning about imperialism. Expect to think deeply and write critically.",
                "I would, yes, especially if you haven't taken Third World Studies with Professor Okihiro yet. If you're ER&M or AMST, I can't think of many other classes that would in-depth unpack the processes (e.g. economics) and logics of imperialism\/late-stage capitalism. But if you already have a background (whether through self-study) in these areas, maybe not? I also will say that there's a heavier reading load than in most other seminars for ER&M but it's technically a senior seminar. Also, Okihiro's TFs are always a huge asset to his classes, and I'm sure you will get a lot (including critiques of the syllabus material) from the TF.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Okihiro is a great teacher and his approach to studying colonialism and empire is eye-opening.",
                "Yes! Professor Okihiro has a wealth of knowledge in the field and the class is incredibly important to ethnic studies and  our current understanding of Global North and Global South countries."
