Professor Caplan helped me hone my craft through consistent, thoughtful feedback and I am a significantly better writer than at the beginning of 120. The readings were also interesting, teaching me about a wider range of topics than most other writing classes.",
                "This course teaches you the joy of writing. There is a precision involved with English 120 (especially taken with Lincoln Caplan). He will scrutinize every word choice. Linc values, and will teach you to value both concision and clarity.",

He taught me the value of reading closely and, most importantly, doing a considerable amount of thinking before beginning to write.",
                "A lot was learned in this class, but chief among all was self-sufficiency. The writing process naturally led to lots of self-discovery due to the topics of each essay, and as a result of this, I believe one of the most valuable takeaways from this class is a near-complete understanding of one's own writing process.",

This may be because readings were due on the same day; perhaps use a couple of these days to close read for craft instead of requiring long readings on top of a heavy week of writing?",
                "Strength: Lincoln's feedback is deep, thoughtful, and critical. The workshops in the class were great. You get inspired by your classmates' writings. You also get a chance to hear other views on your essay. Most of the reading with exemplary in both their substance and prose.\r\n\r\nWeakness: This is a difficult course. There will be times when you disagree (if only at first) with Linc's feedback. Don't be afraid to ask Linc to clarify.",
                "Strength: engaging readings\r\nWeakness: discussions went flat sometimes, could have less readings as most of the time you wouldn't get through all of them.",
                "I really liked the assigned readings, and thought they were almost all very valuable reads. Each essay implemented tools that we could learn from and apply to our own writing. I also liked the actual essay prompts. \r\n\r\nI dont think the actual structure of the class had any weaknesses.",

Whether or not you consider writing a strength of yours, I think this is an excellent course to spend your time on.",
                "Absolutely. For anyone who needs to write in any style other than technical manuals, this course curriculum is instrumental. Additionally, Professor Caplan couldn't have done a better job of presenting the information and providing valuable feedback.",
                "I would recommend it so much, I nearly think it should be mandatory. I love personal writing, and I think this is the perfect course for anyone who either needs an interesting writing credit or wants to devote school time to learning and sharing about themselves.",
                "Yes; great way to improve writing skills, interesting readings",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend English 120. No matter your major, the skills you learn are useful in all writing contexts. You get to read meaningful stories, but also learn how writing mechanics make the story even more masterful."
