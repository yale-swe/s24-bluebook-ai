                "Strengths: Very fun, informative, and interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings weren't very useful and overdrawn. Final seems to be a bit daunting and not totally related to work we've done throughout the semester.",
                "Professor Rubin is very passionate about the subject. \r\n\r\nIt would be helpful for the course to be organized by the works tested on the final, rather than a general history course. By focusing on each work and putting them on a timeline, it would make the works more memorable and make studying for the final easier. Also, the syllabus and the readings on Canvas were organized differently, so I sometimes did not know which schedule I was supposed to follow.",
                "Lecture was good. It was a little hard to know what exactly we were supposed to be learning throughout the semester. Readings were boring.",
                "Strengths: We covered so much ground, and I definitely know way more about architecture and urbanism than I ever thought I could\/would. Professor Rubin also did a wonderful job of connecting abstract topics to concrete examples as well as connecting themes back to the Elm City. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it felt like the course was jumping around a bit too much and it was difficult to follow intellectual threads. But perhaps that is the cost of taking a survey course that covers so much information.",
                "Very hard to connect the topics throughout the lectures together and was often lost on what exactly to take notes on and to focus on understanding. Instructor was fairly interesting with the lectures, but hard to understand what was really important to take from course.",
                "strengths: exciting, topical to current issues, engaging, thought-provoking, prioritizes quality of reflection over quantity of work\r\n\r\nweaknesses: slides looked very similar (very little variation in slideshow each lecture)",
                "The strengths was the very knowledgeable and passionate professor. I could have benefited from a shorter class time (especially on zoom), more structured lectures, and a greater emphasis on what we should be taking away from the course.",
                "Strengths: Fascinating material, interesting commentary\r\nWeaknesses: You don't really know what to focus on in lecture that will end up being relevant for the final",
                "The class had an excellent balance of broader themes and specific examples, the readings were interesting and relevant (albeit a bit long sometimes), and it was easy to take things away from the class and them to the world around you. Professor Rubin was a highlight as well: super energetic and passionate, but not in an intimidating way--his excitement is infectious. The lectures could feel a bit disjointed at times, and a bit like drinking from a firehose at others, but they were usually very interesting with powerful overarching themes.",
                "This course provided engaging lectures and engaging sections, no weaknesses stuck out.",
                "good survey course on American architecture. the lectures were a bit all over the place sometimes, but elihu is a great lecturer nonetheless.",
                "Strengths: solid intro survey to architecture and urbanism; Prof. Rubin and the TFs are super knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the subject matter; assignments are interesting and challenge you.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Relatively small thing, but class never gets out on timeit usually ends about five minutes over, sometimes less but sometimes more. It's frustrating and feels disrespectful to our time (I could never schedule anything at 12:30 for example, or had to miss actual course content if I needed to\/wanted to leave class at its actual end time).",
                "Professor Rubin has a wonderful energy that makes this course quite enjoyable. I also like the kinds of research we do.",
                "better organization would be helpful? maybe a couple key takeaways listed out at the end of every lecture?",
                "It was hard to follow the sequence of the lectures and understand the big picture. We talked about a lot of buildings and it would've been helpful\/more engaging to know which ones were the most important for the final exam as the class went on. At many times it felt like there were so many topics being discussed that made it hard to follow and as such less interesting.",
                "Just wish we could have walked around New Haven as a class.",
                "Prof. Rubin is amazing, definitely the biggest strength. But also the material and readings are so interesting and the teaching fellows are highly engaged.",
                "Strengths: Both of the major assignments are very open to exploring both different buildings and urban patterns, among many other things. It was definitely easier to think about what to write for these assignments. Loved the emphasis on New Haven patterns and buildings, it was very interactive and allowed the class to learn more about New Haven and its history + current state. \r\nI'd probably say that one weakness of the course was the long readings; however, the readings themselves were all pretty relevant to the lectures and content, and also helped a lot with the final exam. There were a few readings however that seemed a bit long and strayed away from what was being taught. The readings were overall very interesting and again helpful for the class assignments!",
                "strengths: wonderful professor, incredible TA, interesting content \r\n\r\nweakness: the lectures could have had a little more structure - the study guide that came at the end of the final felt like a very big leap of content and I think if we had been given the study guide at the beginning of the semester, we would have been more prepared\/received more clarity for the course. However, I loved Elihu's teaching style.",
                "Strengths: This is a fine architecture course for people who have no experience in the field. You get exposure to a variety of architectural forms and styles.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a bit disorganized. Readings were also very long, and some were not weaved as well into the lectures as they could have been.",
                "This is a very well constructed and well taught course.",
                "I thought this class was great!! loved the structure of lectures and I thought the assignments were clear without being restrictive -- what was expected of us was very straightforward but we were still able to use them to explore topics we were interested in. I think the readings were a litttttle long and so that got overwhelming at times, but other than that a really really great class.",
                "This course aims to be accessible to people with no background in urban studies and architecture yet there is a large disconnect for people without these backgrounds who aren't super \"wordly\" and know a lot about cities on their own. That being said, the teaching staff is super passionate, helpful and also really kind and understanding. It would be beneficial if less buildings were mentioned in lecture because it was so hard for me to follow at the beginning when a new building would mentioned for only 20 seconds and then we would move on.",
                "I thought it was great!",
                "n\/a",
                "The course is really well taught and covers a lot of material. Professor Rubin is very passionate about the material. However sometimes we went on tangents and it was unclear how some things were connected with the theme of the week. Overall taking the class is a fun journey through architectural history",
                "Given how much of the course material manifested in New Haven, it could have been engaging to have optional walking tour components. But I understand how this is difficult with COVID.",
                "Strengths: I love this course. I love the assignments. I love the emphasis on New Haven. I love the availability of the professor and entire teaching staff. Extremely well-thought out & great level of care and compassion from entire staff. This course was able to curate a small group feel in a 150+ lecture course occurring virtually. \r\nWeaknesses: readings could have been emphasized\/focused on more throughout the course, but not a huge deal.",
                "Very accessible and interesting content",
                "Lectures were often kind of tough to follow. Elihu is very interesting and easy to listen to, but often the class can be all over the place. I think that the broad trends covered were great, but I don't have that much of an understanding of more precise architecture.",
                "Strengths: highly engaging lectures, the professor speaks with passion and captivates students with his love for the material. Course material is strongly located in New Haven which makes the ideas we are learning about very accessible visually and intellectually. The assignments were interesting to write and allowed us to explore our own interests within the course material. Received a high level of feedback after turning in work.\r\nWeaknesses: none.  This was the best course I've ever taken at Yale!",
                "The course was interesting, but it was very hard at times to get important points out of lecture.",
                "Strengths: Great lecturer, Professor Rubin was very ecstatic about the material every lecture and cared about his student's learning. It was clear that the concepts he taught us in the class were important but even more so, the appreciate for buildings and urbanism was the fundamental idea that the class was built on.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures felt disorganized and was hard to take notes on. At the end of the semester and finals period, I felt like I learned concepts and understood the class, but it definitely did not feel that way throughout the semester. The class jumps from one thing to the next during lecture and its hard to really gain anything out of one class or know what you're suppose to learn.  By the end of it though, it does seem to come together.",
                "This material is fascinating.  The only weakness is that it's a lot to absorb in one semester.  I had one course in which the professor gave a lot of reading material, but designated ONE with an asterisk to focus our attention on that article or essay.  I think this would be great way to help students who are getting used to heavy reading loads feel like they could keep up with the reading.",
                "All strengths! Awesome professor, great class material, memorable lectures, clear effort to create engagement, amazing TAs.",
                "Strengths were the workload. Nothing too intense, but the assignments were interesting. Professor Rubin was also great! Weaknesses were the little amount of assignments, because they weighed so much of your grade and were stressful at times.",
                "I enjoyed the sections of this course, it was nice to have a week where you were responsible for presenting something from that week's readings\/topics.",
                "strengths- super interesting \r\nweaknesses- the lectures often went over the time and a lot of stuff at the end of them was rushed",
                "The course was interesting and definitely didn't assume architectural background, and Prof Rubin was very enthusiastic. The main weakness was that the lectures were a bit disorganized and confusing to follow.",
                "Lectures were interesting and PowerPoints very well made. Professor Rubin and the TFs held reviews and info sessions throughout the semester for exams and assignments that were very helpful.",
                "Strengths: Fast paced and well understood, engaging course material\r\nWeaknesses: The class would be better in person.",
                "Professor Rubin is great. My TF was fantastic. The course can really be whatever you make it, which I think is great."

                "This course was perfectly geared towards learning in the pandemic",
                "Nothing. PLEASE Keep it virtual. Virtual classes are the best",
                "I really liked that Prof Rubin switched up the scenery in later lectures by going around campus.",
                "The course would have been similar online or in person, since it's a large lecture with a discussion section.",
                "Glad to have live Zoom lecture rather than recorded.",
                "virtual lectures went pretty well, except professor Rubin often had technical difficulties. I believe he should have made the default of the zoom meeting mute all because we often had to stop the lecture so that he could tell someone to mute themselves. Virtual lecture still allowed for engagement",
                "The course took the best possible advantage of online learning by facilitating and encouraging student discussion.",
                "elihu did a great job of keeping his energy high during the lectures. nice slides.",
                "It was excellent.",
                "mostly successful!\r\nElihu did try to move to different buildings and have his lectures from there - however, the service wasn't too good in those parts. I appreciate the gesture but I think it was not as effective as the lectures given from home logistically.",
                "Recorded lecture format",
                "virtual lecture and section were fine",
                "honestly I thought this class did a great job!! still engaging and accessible even during covid",
                "it was difficult when the professor would forget to record parts of the lecture",
                "I thought it was great!",
                "n\/a",
                "When it got warmer we were able to meet in person (socially distanced) outside which was really nice.",
                "I thought that the class was fine virtually. Although it would definitely be better to be able to do walking tours in the future.",
                "Discussion posts were ok in making sure students engaged with the material but I never read other people's so it was never really discussion",
                "Highly successful - engaging lectures that made remote learning interesting and easy. However, the course may have been limiting to students who were not in the New Haven area this semester, as a lot of what was discussed in lecture was about the city and one of the assignments was about New Haven buildings. While students had the option to write about other cities, they may have felt slightly limited and alienated from the course material due to their physical distance from New Haven. This is, however, certainly not the instructor's fault, and I believe that the instructor and TFs did everything in their power to make this course as accessible as possible.",
                "Professor Rubin was great about transitioning the class to a virtual format. It was a well taught class and was intriguing despite not having the opportunity to explore New Haven as one would during a non-virtual semester.",
                "Professor Rubin got people to participate (in a huge lecture no less) by asking pointed questions and asking students to respond in the chat.  It was effective.",
                "I thought the professor did a great job in relation to this",
                "discussion section worked well over zoom",
                "It was hard to pay attention during lecture, partly due to the virtual format and partly due to the disorganized quality of the lectures. I wish we had gotten to do an in-person walking tour toward the end of the semester, which was something mentioned but never ended up happening.",
                "Professor Rubin encouraged participation in lectures and talked about the things we said. TF info sessions were very helpful.",
                "Succeeded: Great teaching fellows and teacher.\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to be fully engaged online when lectures are recorded.",
                "It was sometimes hard to pay attention to a lecture available only on zoom, and I think professor Rubin really missed being able to physically show us different sites in New Haven."

                "Great course, would recommend it for anyone interested in urban architecture!",
                "Yeah, I would, especially if you're a STEM person looking to pick up a HU credit. Just if you do, be respectful to the professor and the TA's. They are extremely extremely passionate about the material, and you should really try to do the readings\/go to class, no matter how much it may seem.",
                "Definitely. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Extremely interesting, and an easy humanities credit. I'm a STEM major, and this is my favorite class in a long time.",
                "I don't really know what specifically I was supposed to learn in the class, though I guess I would have learned something if I'd been interested enough to do the readings.",
                "Yes! If you know what you are getting into -- a survey course of American architecture and urbanism that covers a lot of ground -- then I think you will enjoy this course. It's also a nice 5th course that challenges your mind without being overly strenuous in terms of workload.",
                "If you are very into humanities and find learning about niche topics in history, then this is the course for you; otherwise, I may suggest taking this course for credit else you may find yourself scrambling to study all the material necessary to do well on the final.",
                "Yes! this is an excellent course that gives the student a more wholistic understanding of social interactions, cultural beliefs and their shift seen throughout time, and how both of these come together within the built environment",
                "Yes, I would recommend. The lectures are mostly interesting, the class has very few assignments, and the TAs are typically pretty lenient with grading.",
                "Yeah it's interesting and delves into important issues",
                "I would recommend this course if you want to learn about Architecture and if you are good at self studying.",
                "I would definitely recommend it if the subject matter is of interest. Prof Rubin is an amazing speaker and it is amazing to hear his valuable insights.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Rubin is one of the most passionate, dynamic profs I've had at Yale, and his lectures are fascinating and genuinely enjoyable. The projects\/papers are interesting too. This class is a gem!",
                "Yes. This is one of the few classes I have taken where I can say that I look at the world differently because of it. Even if you are not an architectural or urban studies student (I'm an engineering major), this class has so much to teach you about the built spaces around you. I know that this all probably sounds clich, but it is really true. Taking this class gives you the tools to understand how our structures and society are irrevocably intertwined, along with  an understanding of how read the landscapes about you. Workload wise, there isn't too too much: ~100 pages of reading per week, a discussion section, and weekly blog posts are the regular assignments, and the larger projects are very manageable. The class has lots of support and available resources, and the people involved are all great. Professor Rubin is incredibly passionate about the material, and it showed each and every lecture. There was a lot of information to take in, and the lectures sometimes felt a bit strained in trying to capture it all, but all in all, would highly recommend the class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this as a course that covers very relevant and engaging material while not having a back-breaking workload.",
                "i would recommend this to a student looking for a broad overview on architecture. for something more in depth, perhaps take a higher level or more specified architecture\/urban studies course.",
                "Yes",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students!",
                "Absolutely. This should be a class that everyone takes at Yale.",
                "Yes, it's so amazing. Not too heavy of a workload.",
                "Yes! Rubin is an amazing lecturer and knows a lot about New Haven, as well as the various buildings and structures that were presented in the course. The assignments are very open to your preference and allow for tons of exploration. Sections were also helpful in terms of preparing for each assignment, and the TAs were excellent in supporting class. 100% recommend this course, as Rubin and the course material are both very interesting and interactive.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn a bit about New Haven's history, explore their surroundings, and gain a solid introduction to chronological urban architecture.",
                "No, not at all. Professor Rubin is not a good lecturer. Most of his lectures are just him rambling. The slides are disorganized, and there is no flow or connection between ideas. I did not learn anything from the lectures. I originally wanted to take this class because I thought I could learn about specific architects and movements in architecture. But instead, the class glosses over everything and didn't teach me anything about the foundations of architecture. I left this class with just a limited knowledge of buzz words in architecture, but no idea how they connect to each other. One of the worst classes I took at Yale. Would not recommend!",
                "Yes - this course is accessible to people who have no experience with architecture. This course is more geared towards understanding the social rather than architectural aspects of the built environment.",
                "Yes, the projects were fun and unique, and learnt a lot about new haven.",
                "yes!!! this is such a great class and a wonderful intro to studying cities. excellent context for anyone eager to learn about architecture or even new haven specifically",
                "Yes.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone worldly who knows a lot about cities and transportation systems or has taken architecture\/urban studies classes before. Otherwise, be prepared for a steep learning curve and needing to meet with your TF a lot. This class is rewarding in the end though-- it is really cool to be able to look at a building and be able to have intellectual things to say about it and to generally understand patterns in American architecture and urbanism. But don't expect this class to be \"easy\" -- while the papers are not hard to do well on, the final is an absolute monster to prepare for since you have to be prepared to see 10 of 150 buildings.",
                "Perhaps a better name for this course would American Urbanism through Architecture, as we focused much more on analytical frameworks and trends in urbanism, using individual buildings as examples. There are a good amount of readings but the assignments are fun and very self-driven, so I think the course is very much a you-get-out-what-you-put-in situation. Take it if you want to be able to look at a building and consider how it relates to its surroundings as well as the society that produced and consumes it. Do not take it if you want to be able to name 10 buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright in order to look cool at your future suburban dinner parties.",
                "Yes, very fun",
                "Yes, the class is very well organized and sets up students to succeed.",
                "yes",
                "If you are interested is architecture and the history of planning in the US you should absolutely take it. You will also learn alot about New Haven.",
                "I had heard really good things about this course, but my experience with it honestly wasn't too great. The lectures were super winded and confusing, and it was hard to articulate what we were actually learning. Elihu kept saying that we needed to focus on \"the big picture,\" but that's kind of hard to see when you're not already an architecture expert and have had no prior exposure to the lofty terms he likes to throw around as though they're common knowledge. I had no idea what we were supposed to be writing down for notes, and it seems like neither did anyone else. We were ELEVEN lectures into the semester and Elihu was still receiving emails from students asking him how they should be taking notes. At that point, I really don't think that's a reflection on the students. Section felt extremely disconnected from what we were learning in lecture, and although we were told that \"the big picture\" is all that mattered, the study guide for the final exam was nothing short of 46 pages of individual buildings and pictures that we need to be ready to discuss. If the study guide had been released at the beginning of the semester, my experience with the class would've been much less frustrating. Don't get me wrong  the material itself was interesting and Elihu is deeply passionate about what he does. He's a cool guy, but this class was NOT structured well for online learning. Based on what people have told me, it's much better in-person.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course as it promotes awareness and worldliness towards the built environment and how we perceive it. While focused on America, the perceptive skills learnt are universally applicable.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! This class is super interesting and definitely changes the way you look at New Haven and other built environments around you. A solid fifth course for sure.",
                "It's a decent HU credit. Studying for the final when it is not open note in the future will be a pain. The assignments are interesting, but feel a bit like busy work. I liked the class but didn't love it. I think there are probably slightly more interesting options out there.",
                "yes only if they are willing to spend a long time preparing for the final exam. the class itself is fine but the final threw me for a loop",
                "Yes! If you think you are not interested in architecture, this course is a must because it discusses the interconnection between architecture and race, economics, politics, and so much more.",
                "To some people yes, but not to myself before taking the course. If you've never taken an architecture course, *please* be aware that this course is not primarily about the analysis of the shape\/form of buildings themselves, but how they fit with the environment. You will not be taught any architectural vocabulary or facts or given any formal knowledge of how to talk about buildings. Discussions suffer because of this. It's nice that this course is open to all students, but discussions were ultimately not grounded in anything, and sometimes felt detached from any academic field. Professor Rubin does a great job crafting lectures that have relevant and unique examples of the concepts he is presenting, and this class would most likely be great if you're looking for an interesting class with low input and low output, and you are interested in American urbanism. Rubin is ambitious with what he covers, and the class sometimes speeds through a long period of time. Ultimately, this course is most certainly interesting and Rubin is the right person to teach it. However, it won't give you any insight on anything technical about architecture.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in how architecture has evolved on time hand in hand with broader social and political movements. It changed how I view and interact with the built environment, encouraging me to think critically about who are the builders and planners, and who are the buildings built for. In thinking about this, you learn about about how the built environment can convert various social inequities.",
                "No",
                "Yes, it is interesting.",
                "Yes! It gave me a real appreciation for buildings and structures that I live around. When I enter a city, I am so much more aware of smaller details and I pay attention to how buildings look instead of just noticing that there is a structure there. \r\n\r\nHowever, be careful when students tell you this is a gut. This is not a gut. Workload is pretty standard and the material is easy to digest, but it is not a cakewalk class; you are expected to engage with the material to learn it, not just listen and get an A.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course.  The material is interesting and there is freedom to pursue one's own path of curiosity in the assignments.",
                "Yes, yes, yes!! By far one of my favorite classes at Yale, ever. Please take it, I love Prof Rubin so much and think he did such an amazing job of drawing connections between social, political, and material culture. The workload is completely doable, too!",
                "Yes! Very engaging material, especially if one is interested in Urban Studies.",
                "Absolutely for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of architecture and urbanization styles in North America",
                "yes, it is really interesting class and could be a good fifth class or credit d class!",
                "I think it depends heavily on your TFunfortunately, my section was not great. But Elihu is a very enthusiastic, if a bit manic, lecturer. You kind of just have to sit back and go along for the ride.",
                "I recommend this course, its a great way to gain a good understanding of the entirety of American architectural history and urbanism.",
                "Yes this course is fascinating and does not require a knowledge of urban studies. Its a gateway to an urban studies major.",
                "Yes! This course turns the built environment into a cultural document worthy of close study. It opens your eyes while you're walking through town or taking the bus. And that's cool."
