                "This course provides a great introduction and foundational understanding to the formal elements of art, which also serves as a vocabulary for students to discuss their work and their classmates' work. Although most of the formal instruction of this course was covered for me already in my 9th grade drawing courses, the insight and feedback provided by Anahita and our TF Jonathan was invaluable. Truly two gifted instructors and artists who always had another comment to make.",
                "I learned how to create a successful composition of art using different elements of formal analysis. I became more aware of color, value space, foreground and background, texture, and line. Most importantly, I learned how to be okay with \"ruining\" work in order to create something new.",
                "I learned how to use formal language for critiques, color theory, and got to experiment with different materials. VR was also an interesting experience!",

                "I developed my abstraction skills. I also pushed myself to create pieces that really challenged myself. I also put a lot more time into each piece which allowed me to grow my art."

                "The weakness of this course was that it was online. I think that greatly impedes the artistic atmosphere of the class and particularly for critiques. I've seen the same thing in my other Zoom art courses: critique engagement is stymied. Aside from that, I think Anahita did her best to move the class along at a good pace, and although some lectures/explanations/etc seemed a little patronizing (particularly as the class was mostly made up of declared art majors) it was quite strong.",
                "A strength of the course was the range of different assignments given to us. I felt like I really improved my ability to work on a blank canvas, and I gained confidence in my artistic style. A weakness is that feedback always seemed vague; I wish we were given more direction as to how and what we could improve upon.",
                "Critiques can be long and tiring, but helpful in getting feedback for your own work and talking about other classmates' work. A strength was the amount of freedom to experiment we had in this class!",
                "The strengths are that we got to try out a bunch of different mediums and were challenged in the way we would normally approach art. The weaknesses were that we didn't have a long term project we could get very invested in.",
                "I really enjoyed the projects and the feedback during and following each project.",
                "The opportunities for feedback were greatly rewarding, and allowed for very valuable moments of exchange of ideas. The instructors, and the students, also always had insightful artist recommendations  according to each students practice this individual direction and inspiration was very valuable. In general, the emphasis on individual development while exchanging ideas and views was a great strength  of the course as it allowed for much development."

                "This course is required for the art major: take it. For non-art majors interested in artistic pursuits/hobbies, take this course with the understanding that art takes time. The workload for an art course is different from your weekly pset or 90-page pdf, if you wait until the last minute on every assignment you will hate this class. If you go in with the understanding that you're gonna set a few hours aside a week to work on your projects, I think it will be a very enjoyable, holistically-approached foundational art course.",

The extremely broad range of mediums and exercises in this course allows for exploration and expression that meets each students level while significantly developing it."
