                "The course requires a lot of time. One thing that could be improved is the presentations. I think it would be better to offer more options than just individual presentations. I'm not sure I learned that much by memorizing my report. Perhaps one option could be to work in a pair to present an interview or skit.",
                "Too much focus on writing characters, not enough on use.",
                "I think the lesson quizzes could be a little easier like they are in 132. However, as 142 is meant to be a continuation, the increased difficulty is understandable. Else, the class is wonderful.",
                "The course was very engaging, but I thought that losing large amounts of points on dictations made it quite annoying. I also think that the homeworks could have been graded a bit looser. I wish that we had more grading on in class participation.",
                "Strengths: lots of Chinese practice, fun presentations on any topic you want, opportunities to interview parents\/grandparents\/international friends about their lived experiences. Weaknesses: compared to 132, there was an increase in the frequency of lessons and assignments per week. Study habits that worked for 132 didn't work as well in 142.",
                "strengths - this course actively tries to engage you with the language and get you to apply it to your everyday life, which is really nice if your goal for learning Chinese is to improve your ability to use it in that context.\r\nweakness - the course calendar isn't set at the beginning of the semester during reading period, and students who are on the fence about taking the class may find that problematic. For committed students, this is also unideal because they may find that the course's workload lessen or grow throughout the semester without warning, and that may not be something they signed up for. It would be nice if the course can include the semester-long plans for the course in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester."

                "I would absolutely recommend this class to any heritage speakers who didnt formally learn Chinese since Sunday school when they were very young. I took 132 and now 142 after taking Spanish in middle\/high school and did very well. I loved going to class everyday!",
                "Yes",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course if you are trying to improve your Chinese proficiency.",
                "Yes, you get great practice practicing Chinese. If you do take it, Ms. Chen is an amazing professor. She has high standards for us but is also accommodating, and she builds a great relationship with the class! Do be aware of the time commitment: 142 is at least as hard as 132 and still 5 times a week!",
                "I would if your goal is to be exposed to more of the nuances in Chinese (especially some of the more formal structures and sayings) that you may not have the opportunity to learn about at home or on your own."
