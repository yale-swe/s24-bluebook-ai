   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about techniques in painting that are specific to Watercolor. While we spent a lot of time looking at prominent watercolorists, the most valuable skill was learning how to handle the medium through trial and error. Specifically, I became much more proficient at painting from life.",
    "I learned a lot about both watercoloring and analyzing works of art in terms of technique and expression. By having to complete two works of art every week, my skills in rendering forms, observation of nature, choosing colors, and overall composition were greatly improved. The many essays completed in this class also contributed to my understanding of others' art and my own.",
    "Watercolor art techniques, methods of analyzing paintings. How to paint!",
    "I gained a lot more painting skills than I had before, both from instruction and being shown examples, as well as just having the freedom to explore painting and actually being forced to paint each week (which I definitely wouldnt have been doing otherwise!)",
    "Learned how to paint properly with watercolors. Learned various new painting techniques. Learned how to write a little better.",
    "I gained technical skills in watercolor and knowledge of watercolor history. Watercoloring both in class and for homework helped my paintings and painting techniques improve considerably. Having to write papers on watercolorists and specific paintings enhanced my knowledge of the medium, and taught me skills about writing on subjects such as art and art history.",
    "Learned lots of watercolor techniques and how to analyze different watercolor styles",
    "I believe to have developed a new way to look at art with this course, that provided many insights not only to the artistic world but also to an artistic mind. I gained knowledge about the artists analyzed in the course and developed many new painting skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were that we were forced to do two paintings a week and sketch on our own. This led me to develop my skills with watercolor. Weaknesses were that the prompts for the papers were broad and somewhat separate from what we were learning about in class.",
    "The strengths of this class were definitely the materials that were given to us in order to facilitate the painting processinstead of having to obtain all of these watercoloring materials ourselves, they were provided and everyone started from an equal level. The weakness of this class could be that students did not engage with each other as much, especially during the lecture portion of the class. It would be fun for students to be encouraged to speak to each other about their essays, the topic of lecture, or during painting time.",
    "I thought it would be more of a studio art class, but there were also mini-lectures involved!",
    "This is a 3 hour long course that could be taught in 2 hours. The class was often split in half, with lecturing in the first half, and watercolor practice in the last half. While this allowed the students to learn a technique and then immediately practice it, listening to an hour and a half of lecture, then an hour and a half of painting, is pretty taxing.",
    "The papers prompts and marking rubrics are sometimes vague and its not clear what youre being assessed on at all. Additionally, the course structure was sometimes a bit unpredictable. Canvas was also not a part of the course at all (so readings, syllabus, assignment prompts etc were printed out).",
    "The painting aspect of the course is very good. \r\n\r\nFor a seminar, there is very little student discussion. The typical class consists of 1.5 hours of art history lecture and 1.5 hours of painting.",
    "I really loved the in-class portion of this course. Every week we went to new locations on Yale's campus and painted. Each location helped us experiment with different skills and subject matters, and it was a fun and engaging class to attend. We also did several museum visits to see archived watercolors, which was an extremely interesting and illuminating part of the class. \r\nFor weaknesses, I think the homework essays were slightly unguided. There was little discussion of them other than on the day they were due, and I never felt like I exactly knew what was expected of me.",
    "Too much of the grade depends on writing when it wasn't really taught\/wasn't the focus of the course",
    "The course definitely provides much space for exploring and improving the artistic skills of painting and drawing. The students have a lot of freedom in the subjects and techniques of their painting, which gives us the opportunity of developing our own style. I greatly enjoyed this and believe the course aided me in discovering my own traits and characteristics as an artist, also stimulating my creative process. However, I do wish there were within the course more moments of specific guidance towards watercolor techniques and the results they create. This was definitely approached when analyzing student artwork and the techniques the artists used, but it would be great if there could be lessons that aimed specifically to teach certain techniques. \r\n\r\nThe course talks about many artists and we definitely got a good sense of their particularities and personal history\/context in history. Perhaps it was not the focus of the course, but the art history aspect could establish itself more in the course if the artists were studied more concretely. This could maybe be done through short readings about every artist seen in class, containing the main characteristics of their work and personal life."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is a lot of fun and your Watercoloring skills will improve.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! With just a basic level of drawing experience, this class was very fun and I looked forward to painting and learning about various artists every week. I also enjoyed the field trips and guest speaker. I think this class would be really fun for anyone even remotely interested in art and it was rewarding to see the classmates' amazing art improve even more each week.",
    "Yes, this class challenges your writing skills while also allowing you to experiment with freely making art.",
    "This course would be fitting for a person who wants to learn more about watercolor. However, keep in mind that there are still writing requirements for the class, so if youre not a strong writer and get frustrated if you dont receive very helpful feedback, then this class might not be for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to others because its a great way to familiarize oneself with art, without an intense workload. The class is very open and not intimidating, which may be a concern to those without art experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, especially if you arent doing any other fine arts classes or just want to try an art class without being an art major, because the pace isnt too bad and neither are the papers, and it makes a nice change from most other classes or subjects. The Professor is really encouraging with his critiques, and finds helpful and positive things to say about every member of the classs artworks, no matter their previous painting experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking to learn how to paint. This course features a few writing assignments, and doesn't have a final exam.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but only as a lighter class to take if they're interested in watercolor or art history. It was not particularly rigorous, but it did provide some interesting skills and bits of knowledge. The essays were slightly frustrating at times, but not a reason to not take the class. It was an enjoyable class to attend weekly.",
    "I didn't like how much writing it involved for a visual art class, so probably not if they're interested in art",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course for students who wish to explore and develop their artistic skills. The course's workload and its challenges are considerable, however, they are pleasurable and present themselves in ways that feel more as space to breathe from the rest of work than pile on it."
