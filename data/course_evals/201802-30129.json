   "comments": [
    "Bettered my French speaking abilities significantly.",
    "My french speaking ability considerably improved, both in formal contexts and informal situations.",
    "My French communication skills greatly developed after taking the course.",
    "I developed my skills in reading, writing, and especially speaking and listening in French.",
    "French speaking and writing and reading",
    "I learned some more specific language structures, grammatical techniques, and idiomatic expression within the French language through the study of short stories, a novel and multiple films.",
    "That I shouldn't have taken French - the department cares nothing about its students and simply focuses on piling as much work as possible onto them. The courseload is manageable if one decides to sacrifice a social life and hopes of experiencing other French sights while maintaining a normal grade within the class. The unwillingness to modify the curriculum in any way or provide additional help to struggling students is absolutely astonishing. When I asked for more help in a certain topic (the conditional tense), I was simply given a page to read out of a workbook that did nothing to help me, and further confused me. Only by pestering the professors did I manage to gain some insight into what I was doing wrong. The test structure, with the garbled and muted audio sections, lends nothing to one's learning and students are not prepared whatsoever for these sections - verbal cues in class and given in normal speed and normal volume levels, while the audio on the test was read at a breakneck pace, and as quietly as possible, and often not repeated. I absolutely hated this course and wish I could go back in time to not only reclaim my summer and pursue an internship or an independent study, but to also recover the crippling cost of the program."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were that the texts were very good.",
    "For course that is taken abroad( that is in Paris) I expected it to focus on learning common slangs and expressions used in everyday French life. However, it focused mostly on complex grammatical constructions.\r\n\r\nThe experience and program lineup were exceptionally planned. It was indeed one of the most memorable experiences of my life",
    "Again, I think one of the greatest strengths is the set up of having three hours of class each day, so that new vocabulary, grammar rules, and material are fresh in your mind. This is only enhanced by being in Paris and staying with a host family, which created the opportunity to practice French throughout the whole day.",
    "vocabulary and fluidity",
    "I believe this course was taugh very well, but I often felt like the amount of work that was required outside of class made it difficult  to explore and make the most of Pars while I was there. I spent a lot of time in my room doing exercises when I could be exploring Paris and talking to locals.",
    "Refer to above statement, it is copied below for reference with some details added.\r\n\r\nThat I shouldn't have taken French - the department cares nothing about its students and simply focuses on piling as much work as possible onto them.

I absolutely hated this course and wish I could go back in time to not only reclaim my summer and pursue an internship or an independent study, but to also recover the crippling cost of the program. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, my host family was hardly present, only appearing after work at 7 PM to make and have a rushed dinner at 8 (I was not allowed to aid with the preparation). I didn't see either my host mother or father in the mornings either and spent a lot of time alone in my room doing textbook work. This course could be improved by listening to the student's feedback and not continuing to push an overloaded and overstuffed (many of the things we learned were a waste of time, with 2-3 45 minute audio listenings for readings every night, on top of grammar work and studying) curriculum onto the students."

   "comments": [
    "Would recommend for a student wanting to speak French fluently.",
    "Absolutely! The friendships formed between peers and with professors is priceless. One gets to visit numerous places with friends, stay with wonderful French families which gives you an in-depth perspective on French life and culture.",
    "Absolutely! Being in Paris was absolutely incredible and I feel that my French speaking skills improved much more quickly because I was practicing all day either in class, during free time, or at meals with my host family.",
    "yes",
    "Yes! It is such a unique experience to study the French language while in Paris, and it something I believe every French student should be able to experience.",
    "Absolutely not. If one is not already a terrific french student or has learned the structure of a similar language, they will absolutely struggle. Once a student is behind the curve, they will only fall farther behind with the rapid and nonstop tests and essays."
