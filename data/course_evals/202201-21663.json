                "This class was a little badly organized and some lectures seemed more like guest lecturer lectures rather than class lectures. Also, many of the learning came from \"reading the book\" which meant that there was not really much guidance on what things to practice for exams. Finally, the allowed time for final exams was based on the time it took the TA to complete the exam + 30 minutes rather than the standard 1.5 multiplicative factor of other classes and the TA himself said that he did not try as hard which meant that the entire class was at a disadvantage against the clock.",
                "The strengths of this course are the amount of feedback that you receive on your homework assignments and exams. The professor meets with you after the first midterm and helps to go over any mistakes and they also are willing to meet after the second midterm as well. Some weaknesses of the course is how the material is presented. Generally, the professor would just go over the lecture notes by projecting them on the screen, but I feel like what could have been more helpful is the professor writing the notes out on the board to keep students more engaged.",
                "STRENGTHS: Shu Hu is actually very nice, and he is trying his best to make an engaging teaching environment. Telling us what pages of the textbook to read was usefull WEAKNESSES: pretty much everything else. I learned basically zero from this class. Lectures and sections are unintelligible, and the homeworks do not relate to the exams at all. the grading scheme makes no sense. The exams (especially the final) were impossible compared to the level of material we went over in class. TBH an absolutely ridiculous combination of confusing teaching structure and way over the top \"real-world\" exam material."

                "No. Didn't learn anything, the stress from trying to figure out what would be on the exams when we couldn't even figure out what was being taught in lecture was way too much. TBH terribly mismanaged course. I know I'm not the only one who thought this, since right before the second exam we were standing outside the class being like \"wait. does anyone understand what's going on? No. Me neither.\" Like this class just needs to be way more formalized towards teaching us the information, and not jumping around so much from idea to idea. Also even when it feels like you're learning, it doesn't relate at all to the exams."
