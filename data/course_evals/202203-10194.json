                "The class discussions were riveting but the texts could be a little more varied!",
                "Strengths: discussion was challenging and thought-provoking, ideas touched on will continue to stay with me, themes were well-developed over the course of the syllabus, came away with a new understanding of the way world literature is shaped by outside forces\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: didnt cover enough of the world. barely any books from Asia, Middle East, South America, etc. reading load was not evenly distributed. basically had to read 150 pages between Tuesday and Thursday. discussions went overtime to the next week, and while valuable, threw the syllabus out of balance, making class a bit less focused since we were basically covering two books each week instead of one.",
                "The discussion was lively and helped me gain new insight into the novels, and I found myself understanding the books differently based on what my peers had to say. However, all we did was write 3 essays and discuss a lot of books, so I found it difficult to stay engaged.",
                "This course was difficult to keep up with. The extensive homework assignments caused me to feel constantly left behind because I rarely was able to finish them. The reading was just far too extensive. However, I was able to learn enough in the class discussions to the point where I was not completely left behind."

I took this as a major requirement and I enjoyed reading some of the texts but it felt a little like checking a box which wasn't my intention starting out with the course. Because the people in my seminar were not the most engaged, I struggled to feel motivated in the class. Professor Iheka felt like an easy grader.",

                "I wouldn't, but just because I'm not a fan of writing essays and doing close readings of essays."
