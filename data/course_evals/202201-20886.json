Overall, my practical skills (in chemistry lab, at least) greatly improved as a result of taking this class.",
                "This course was a great way to further develop a lot of the lab techniques that we had learned in CHEM 222L. Learning how to use a lot of the laboratory equipment, materials, and standard experimental practices is great if you're looking to explore some laboratory work in the future. I also thought that this was a great way to further apply materials learned during lecture, as studying for the quizzes helped you solidify the mechanisms and concepts in each experiment.",

We learned about how to set up reactions, manage lab safety, analyze complex data, and many other skills necessary for a laboratory scientist. We learned analysis methods like H NMR and did classic reactions under delicate conditions (one time we had to keep the temperature of our reaction under 45 degrees to avoid reagent decomposition).",
                "Learned common chemistry lab techniques.",
                "This course was an extremely helpful intro to lab techniques and slightly more complicated procedures. We learned or continued practicing NMR, IR, MP, TLC, reflux procedures, and separatory flask procedures. We also roughly followed Chem 223 lecture concepts. The hands on experience and very organized guidance from Dr. DiMeglio were probably the highlights.",
                "I gained valuable laboratory skills in organic chemistry, particularly in the synthesis of organic compounds. I gained the skill of being able to adapt when an experiment doesn't go according to plan, and I developed critical thinking skills after completing the post-lab assignments and post-lab quizzes.",

                "Well organized.",
                "I really enjoyed that most labs this semester were with partners as it created a more friendly environment where students were collaborating more during lab. It also made the labs go by faster. I also highly enjoyed the music that would play during each lab. No weaknesses to note.",
                "strengths-- lab procedures were very clear and thorough, they made sense and the labs done were pretty informative and paired well with the lectures\r\nweaknesses-- some lab quizzes were unreasonably hard and some questions were a bit unfair in that they didn't really test material that we learned in lab",
                "Strengths: much more elaborate that CHEM 222L, but same level of support. Really lovely follow-on course which it so interesting. No weaknesses.",
                "I thought the course had a fun and relaxed classroom environment, and the material was rigorous but the workload was extremely reasonable. The course complimented the organic chemistry lecture material very well.",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, good teaching\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "The course is very well-organized and well-paced. The labs are engaging and review techniques used in organic synthesis.",
                "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio is awesome! She is always willing to answer questions, she is extremely professional, and she is very receptive to feedback. She is a strength of this course. The labs are also fun and engaging--I quite enjoyed how some experiments discussed material we discussed a week later in lecture; it allowed me to better understand lecture. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt that grading was, at times, very ambiguous and made me very stressed. Canvas turned off the feature where I was able to see the average performance on quizzes and other assignments, so I was often left wondering if I was struggling on a certain assignment or if the collective class was struggling. The quizzes were also significantly more difficult this semester--I think that an extra minute or two would have benefited me greatly.",
                "The continued and varied practice with techniques such as TLC and reflux helped to solidify my skills. An improvement could be to give more time for the lab quizzes, especially those requiring interpretation of spectra since 30 secs - 1 minute is often not enough for me to identify peaks/compound.",
                "i absolutely love orgo lab: this might be my favorite class of my first year. Professor DiMeglio, you are so organized and lovely to talk to and you made this class so wonderful. My TF was also extremely nice and gave such good feedback. Although the 4 hour block is a bit horrid, it wasn't as bad as it could've been in so many ways .",
                "The course was well organized. It was mainly focused around lab work. Pre-lab work made sure students were prepared. However, I feel like the grading was very skewed around learning concepts and pre-lab documents, and less performance/doing stuff in lab which could make the lab time more engaging/feel like a better use of time.",
                "This course is very strong in student investment and made wonderful by Dr. DiMeglio. She is amazing, so kind, and passionate about doing everything she can to improve the student experience.",
                "Strengths: very well organized, weekly quizzes instead of midterms/finals, relevant and important content, the proffesors.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Extremely well organized for student learning. Expectations were extremely clear, as were instructions for each lab.\r\n\r\nquizzes often went beyond lab material, which is frustrating if you don't take this course at the same time as lecture. I understand though that this is an uncommon situation, and think that the level of the quizzes are fair, especially if you're concurrently enrolled in the lecture.",
                "the synthesis we ran is really interesting and helps reinforce concepts learned in the organic chemistry lecture. the staff is really understanding",
                "The course was well-organized for learning and struck a perfect balance between workload and being an environment that promoted learning for understanding.\r\n\r\nThe classes themselves were quite fast-paced, but the TFs were always there to help.",
                "The course was great! However, i do think we could have more of a variety in experiments and techniques.",
                "Strengths: we learned a variety of analytic techniques and carried out a large variety of reactions. Also, the material aligned nicely with what we learned in lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I learned a lot of basic chemistry techniques. Some of the work was a bit repetitive though and the quizzes were unnecessarily difficult.",
                "Very enjoyable. Solid course.",

                "Dr. DiMeglio!",
                "Strengths: The course packet was very helpful and provided clear and detailed direction on how to write EPs and conduct lab procedures. My TF was amazing and made the course very enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of clarity in feedback was definitely a challenge. Additionally, the way that lab quizzes were administered was a major weakness to the course; the disconnect between taking the quiz and seeing results made correcting errors in learning difficult.",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, clear goals and expectations, covers a lot of material but at a good pace, and experiments are fun! Weaknesses: None",
                "The course focuses a lot on formatting, which is important but also takes away from the learning if chemical concepts at times.",
                "Great course, awesome instructors",
                "Dr.DiMeglio and the TAs are amazing. The pre-lab videos are very helpful and the course packet is straightforward and provides useful, interesting background information. There's not excessive busywork, all assignments are vital to understanding the topic without providing useless information. I don't think the course has any weaknesses, it's really an amazing class.",
                "There is insane disparity between how harshly the sections are graded. Its kind of ridiculous. Its so frustrating when you get a 78 on the PLA and your friend gets 96 when you literally said all the same things.",
                "I thought the class was excellently well structured.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, manageable workload, deadlines known ahead of time",
                "This class was very organized. Also, whenever I needed assistance (whether during or outside of class), I would know who to ask for help and generally would receive assistance in a timely manner.",
                "Strengths: I think Prof. DiMeglio is the greatest strength in this course, as she is a consistently-involved professor and mentor to each of her students. Her personality is infectiously positive, and I think that lended towards a great semester. I also think that the course is laid out with great planning, and none of the assignments seemed like \"busy work,\" besides some parts of the EPs, perhaps. I think that there's a good atmosphere in the labs too which always helps.\r\nWeaknesses: I think, as always, there are some inequities among TAs, not only with grading, but with involvement as well. I was fortunate to have a great TA who was on the stricter side with grading, but have heard from other people that their TAs were not as great. It's a good opportunity to work with graduate students who are doing chemistry as a career, so it'd be nice to have some equity.",
                "This was a very well run course. The only thing that I would say is that the experimental procedures seem like a huge time suck which is disproportionate to the amount of credit hours we are given",
                "Very well structured",
                "The class seemed to have a bit of inconsistency in terms of work load; however, the TAs and Dr. D were fantastic at answering questions and trying not to pile on work after spring break.",
                "Strengths: Experiments are a lot of fun. If you enjoy lab work you'll enjoy this. Labs seem to be shorter than Orgo 1 labs. Dr. Dimeglio is a hoot as always. Your enjoyment of the class may be TA dependent but most TAs are great and chill. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: EPs can be tedious. I feel like most of the information in the safety table is not very useful. Quizzes are wack and definitely can be annoying. The fact that the grading could change and you couldn't see the right answers for weeks did not help.",
                "The course is very well organized. Christine DiMeglio is a great instructor and really cares about the students. The labs can be fun and engaging. There are no major weaknesses I can think of.",
                "Strengths: The TAs (at least my TA) and Dr. DiMeglio are extremely supportive. I took a gap year so I remembered almost nothing from first semester lab and was able to do well because they were willing to answer any question no matter how simple, and DiMeglio posted videos for each lab reviewing the techniques. I highly recommend watching the videos before each lab. \r\nWeaknesses: Much like many Yale classes, I felt like the instructors did not clarify (or more importantly, enforce) the line between collaboration and cheating. In place of an in-person final exam like in past years, there were weekly online quizzes and no one made sure people weren't copying each other's answers. Students also frequently \"collaborated\" on all the EPs and post lab assignments, so the class was basically set up so that some people could get through doing almost none of their own work. I was not close with a lot of people in my lab section so I did most assignments on my own, and since the grades were all curved by section, I was essentially competing for a grade against other students who were working in groups and double checking every answer with each other. To address this issue, I think there should be an open-notes in-person exam instead of quizzes, and on assignments where group work is allowed, working with others should be more directly encouraged. That way everyone will have a group to work with so we will all be on the same playing field, and quizzes that are meant to be taken individually will actually be taken individually.",
                "The course is great. The only caveats are that the due dates/times for many assignments dont make much sense (e.g. quizzes must be taken on the lab day between 5pm-12am, they cannot be taken earlier, and theres other interesting things like make up quizzes having to be scheduled by a strict deadline and taken within a very small time window on a specific date at the end of the semester), and that the pre-lab EPs are often tedious while providing minimal new learning (e.g. By the end of the semester, I still do not understand why the melting/boiling point of sodium chloride is important to know)",
                "Strengths  post lab assignments were fair and very interesting (I really enjoyed reading the literature that students were asked to reference when answering questions on the post lab). The EP assignments were also very helpful in preparing for lab and making the work in lab go smoothly. The TAs were stellar for this course as well and always available to answer my questions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  I think this course would benefit from a quiz structure similar to Chem 222L in which students could retake the quiz and receive their highest score rather than an average of their two attempts.",
                "It was organized very well. The quizzes sometimes seemed to punish small mistakes too much since they were multiple choice and each question was worth a lot.",
                "Very organized.",
                "I really enjoyed the courseit was highly organized, very manageable in terms of workload, and complemented lecture really well. I will miss coming to lab every week!",
                "This course was very well organized and highly engaging.",
                "Strengths: the experiments are fun, and the TAs this semester were good. Weaknesses: this class is a nightmare. It is a monumental waste of time, with significant busywork each week. None of the assignments promote learning, they just require you to spend the time and follow precise formatting in order to avoid poor grades. Course materials and communications are riddled with typos and mistakes, which showcases the laziness DiMeglio exhibits during this course.",
                "The biggest strength is Prof. DiMeglio -- she is so wonderful and cares so much about her students. The teaching staff is also really helpful and understanding. I can't think of any specific weaknesses!",
                "The class is incredibly well taught and uses its time wisely. You can tell the teaching team is really all in when it comes to making sure students get the most out of the lab. This is an incredibly strong course and I really cant find any weaknesses.",
                "There is a lot of busy work and while it is not particularly difficult or though provoking, it takes up nearly the same amount of time as the corresponding lecture course. I encourage Yale college to rethink their current stance in half credit lab courses when it comes to the chemical and biological sciences.",
                "Strengths: PLEASE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRE LAB VIDEOS FOR STUDENTS TO PREPARE. I cannot stress enough how helpful those videos are as a student who has found gen chem and less often orgo written procedures lacking in conceptual explanations or clear steps written to benefit the student. The staff and TAs are kind and accessible. Dr. DiMeglio is probably the greatest thing that can happen for a prospective STEM student. \r\nWeaknesses: Im a huge proponent of over explaining in the procedures for the students sake. The more information that you can include about conceptual theory and about the actual procedure, the better. But this wasnt nearly as much of a problem in this lab as it was for gen chem lab.",
                "The strength of this course was the organized structure of the experiments, assignments, and assessments. A weakness of this course was the workload, particularly the amount of time one needs to spend working on preparing for the lab experiments prior to coming to lab.",
                "This lab is great! Prof. DiMeglio and her team were super great and helpful. They really care to teach to students and the information from the course was taught thoroughly.",
                "Well structured, the quizzes were not conducive to learning",
                "Strengths: allows for more practice of skills learned in CHEM 222L, labs and assignments are not overly difficult or time-consuming, instructions and expectations are straightforward\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: labs and the techniques used may begin to feel repetitive, experience in the course tends to vary depending on the TA",
                "I'm going to use this section to say playing music in lab is really appreciated, please keep it up!",
                "A strength of this course is its organization and how all of the content was scheduled far in advance, so no assignments or longer labs came unexpectedly. Another strength of this course is the amount of resources provided and the engagement of both the head professor and the teaching assistant despite the course having a large number of students.",
                "I loved it! Just the right bit of freedom for students to explore the subject",
                "Everything about the course was well done, and any weaknesses are immediately addressed by teaching team. Excellent course.",
                "The strengths of this course include the consistency of work and emphasis on content understanding. The assignments are not too overbearing and the TAs are great at explaining mistakes in experimentation or chemical understanding. I see nothing to be improved, honestly.",
                "In terms of laboratory courses, the course is structured well, and I don't see any particularly urgent changes that need to be made. However, the course can definitely benefit from more partner/group work, even during Orgo 1 Lab (i.e., partner labs should be the default, with individual labs being done only when necessary).",
                "I think that this course was well organized and the course packets adequately prepared me for each lab. The quizzes that were open from 5 pm-12 am on the day of the lab were annoying, particularly because lab often ended before 5 and I had other required activities (section and athletics lift) during the 5 pm-12 am block that limited it to 8 pm-12 am in reality.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized and well-paced. It was helpful that students were reminded of large post-lab assignments so that they could plan in advance and work ahead. \r\nWeaknesses: Due to COVID and university rescheduling, quizzes were made weekly which felt overwhelming. Quizzes every 2 weeks felt more manageable. It was harder that quizzes were graded as an average of two attempts rather than the highest score attempt. Labs felt repetitive with the same synthetic procedures across 3-4 weeks, especially since it was already done in a prior course. (variety like more distillation or extraction techniques would be interesting).",
                "Strength: not too high a workload, quizzes were fair assessment\r\nWeakness: somewhat unclear grading criteria for longer assigments"

                "Yes. Good lab course",
                "I highly enjoy the lab as it is a very friendly and mostly peaceful environment. Labs also often help me understand the reactions and mechanisms of reactions better than in lectures as I see exactly what each reagent or the purpose of each step. The music and working with a partner also make the labs very enjoyable and pass by quickly. The work is also very manageable, making this a great course to take.",
                "yes, it was not bad at all for a lab course",
                "Yes if you're taking orgo! You are much more secure in the lab than first semester, and that enables you to have more fun with the class.",
                "Absolutely! This course was very enjoyable, the teaching assistants were friendly, and you will receive ample feedback and support for assignments.",
                "Yes. It was very similarly structured to fall semester lab, but I found second semester even easier since many of the techniques are the same other than NMR. I didn't watch the videos as much as first semester since it often just showed lab techniques I learned first semester. This lab class followed my first year orgo class pretty well, and it wasn't too much work other than the EPs, weekly quizzes, and 2 post lab assignments.",
                "Yes. This is one of the most engaging and well-taught lab courses at Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The content is engaging and enjoyable. The grading is a little stressful due to the ambiguity (i.e. not knowing what my grade is relative to other students and how the curve will influence my grade).",
                "yes!!! professor dimeglio is truly so kind and the TFs are usually very understanding during lab and with how they grade",
                "It is by far not the worst lab class you will take. The material is interesting. Experiments are fun. And the entire teaching staff cares very deeply about the course and students.",
                "Yes--it definitely helps with understanding material taught in the lectures.",
                "I would most certainly recommend this course to another student! Dr. DiMeglio makes the course feel so supportive and fun!",
                "Yes, the course teaches techniques that will be useful to anyone in a lab. It is also not stressful and very well organized, so you know if you do what you are asked to do you will get a good grade and come out learning everything that you wanted to.",
                "Yes. Most people have to take it, but this is a true half credit lab. Workload is reasonable, and lab time itself is pretty fun. Best of the chem labs by far.",
                "if you like orgo lab 1, it's pretty much the same except it introduces you to nmr, which is pretty essential. it's a great complementary to the lecture, so if you are taking orgo lecture 2, yes",
                "Yes, it is a requirement for chemistry majors and does a great job at highlighting the practical applications of the theory you learn!",
                "I would. It is a great way to get working under a hood experience for labs.",
                "Yes, to anyone taking the concurrent organic chemistry course.",
                "Yes, this was a great course! I recommend to take it at the same time as organic chemistry II, since the material overlaps.",
                "Yes, it's was a good learning experience.",
                "Yes, if you get a good TA its pretty chill and a fun time. Otherwise it probably sucks. I had a great TA and learned a lot while having fun.",
                "Yes, if required for pre-med or the major.",
                "Yes your learn a lot",
                "I would recommend this course to students interested in organic chemistry or the physical sciences.",
                "Yes! This course takes you beyond the textbook and lecture and allows you to learn via hands-on experimentation. It is a very well organized lab and teaches you a lot while also being fun!",
                "Yes, the skills you learn in this class are critical for more advanced courses",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I enjoyed it a lot. Even though it's not required for some bio/chem majors anymore, I still think it was a great class.",
                "No, dont take this class unless you NEED to. Al though I have no idea why you would take this class if youre not a bio/chem major or premed.",
                "Yes. I assume that most students take this class because they have to (major requirements, pre-med requirements, etc.). That said, the course is taught very well, and it always felt manageable.",
                "Yes, this is a helpful course for understanding how organic syntheses work and for learning how to use different techniques in the lab.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student that is interested in improving their laboratory skills. Even if it is not a requirement for their major / to graduate, the class is arguably very helpful for building practical skills and applying knowledge of concepts from the lecture class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but probably only if they need to fulfill it for a major or career-aspiration. It's a great way to get some hands on experience with the concepts that you learn in lecture, and some of the stuff smells pretty good which was always a plus for me. Christine is such a great presence in the lab, and you'll be fortunate to learn chemistry under such a kind professor like her!",
                "Yes I loved orgo lab!",
                "I would. It was a great supplement to the lecture course and it wasn't overly stressful.",
                "Yes, great course to take along with Chem 221 to be able to apply the theoretical knowledge learned in the laboratory setting",
                "Only if they need it for a requirement.",
                "Yes. If you did Orgo 1 lab, this will likely be easier. Overall enjoyable lab. Time commitment isn't huge, but EPs can be annoying and quizzes can be stressful.",
                "If you have to take the lecture course I would take the lab along with it. It reinforces what you learn in lecture and helps you practice and understand certain concepts.",
                "Yes- it compliments the lecture well and the hands-on techniques are fun",
                "Yes, I enjoyed o chem lab more than o chem!",
                "Not really unless youre pre-med or actually like orgo.",
                "Yes  I would absolutely recommend this course to any student in a science major interested into aiming foundational lab techniques. Dr. D is a great Professor and does a wonderful job managing the teaching staff team while making every student feel seen and appreciated.",
                "Yes, organic chemistry lab was an enjoyable experience and you learn a lot of important skills in the process.",
                "yes",
                "If needing to take an Orgo lab, make sure the Christine DiMeglio is your professor. She is absolutely phenomenal.",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any students interested in chemistry.",
                "Absolutely not. I realize that many of you will have to take it, as I did. If you can, try to take it over the summer when someone other than DiMeglio is teaching it.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course!! Prof. DiMeglio sets it up to be relatively stress-free for a lab course, and it is easy to do well if you just try your best!",
                "Absolutely! If they want to learn more about being a laboratory organic chemist, take this class!",
                "It is a necessary course for many and there is no alternative, so yes.",
                "YES. Professor DiMeglio makes this lab incredible. By second semester, most students are feeling more comfortable in the lab setting, but she just provides so much support for us that the course feels very manageable. Part of the experience depends on the standards and teaching skill of your TA, and some are better than others, but by this point in the lab sequence it doesnt make much difference. This is probably the most useful and actually student-centered lab learning experience Ive had at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The experiments and assignments before and after the experiments were engaging, and well organized for student learning. The course content was interesting and the instructor and TFs were very helpful with answering questions and teaching students. It is a very interesting class, even if it is not required for your major or pre-professional track.",
                "Yes, especially if youre taking Orgo II.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. I think that organic chemistry lab is one of the better lab courses offered here, and if you are looking to learn a handful of lab techniques in a class that is low to moderate workload, I would recommend.",
                "Yes! It's really fun, you learn a lot, and I actually made friends because there's so much time to talk to your peers while waiting for reflux to finish. Plus the teaching staff are so amazing and kind!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student taking orgo 2 because it is not too much additional work and the grading is not too harsh either. Even if lab is not required for pre-med or your major, I would still just take lab because you never know if you might need it in the future for some other reason. Also, the professors in this lab are very engaging and supportive, and a bit of the material is the same as orgo 1 so the course is a little less time-consuming (both in preparing for lab and the labs themselves).",
                "Yes! But only if youre taking organic chemistry 2.",
                "I would definitely recommend, as it's one of the better and more relaxing lab classes.",
                "I would recommend this course, since it gives the student a chance to practice chemical techniques in an organized and relatively stress-free environment.",
                "Absolutely--even though this is totally not required for pre-meds, it was an incredibly enjoyable learning experience. I looked forward to attending this class every week.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is looking to get hands-on experience in chemical synthesis, purification, and characterization as this courses extensively touches on techniques related to all three of the aforementioned tenets.",
                "I think this course is usually taken as a requirement of a major or medical school, but I would suggest to take it for those who need it only probably.",
                "Yes, if you are a pre-med or science student, it is an easy lab credit. The course is very manageable if you took CHEM 222L because it is structured in a similar way and building on the same techniques. The workload feels much better and you have a better grasp of the TAs that grade more easily even if CHEM 222L felt harder.",
                "Yes, 223L reinforces orgo lecture content without bearing too great a burden on your schedule. (Also worth taking just to synthesize fragrant banana oil!)"
