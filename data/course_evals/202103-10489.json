                "I learned so much about both educational systems and the skills necessary to be a successful advocate / leader within educational structures.\r\nIn regards to educational systems, this course teaches you about the instructional core (think, what happens inside the classroom between teachers, students and curriculum), the school as a larger institution and the school district as an organizational method. I debated the merits of Charter Schools, the Finnish model of education and the backlash to school equity movements.\r\nIn regards to advocacy and leadership skills, I learned about the importance of framing problems for policy makers and educational leaders. I thought critically about the history of U.S. educational reforms, their political motives and what can be done better for our schools in the future.",
                "First and foremost, this class gives you a number of indispensable frameworks for analyzing education systems all over the world. Dr. Lemons gives you a sense of what things work and what things don't work when it comes to improving education. While you are learning this content, you also learn the case method and how to write an effective memo. These skills are critical for business school/work and anything in policy. This class also features a group project that lasts for most of the semester in which you research a problem that your group identifies within education and you offer possible solutions. This hands-on learning teaches you how to develop a theory of change and apply design-thinking to create your intervention. Plus, you get to present it to a group of really experienced and influential educators/superintendents from around the state!",
                "I learned so much real-world knowledge about how educational improvement actually happens and what strategies we can use to approach the complicated issues in education. The case studies were a fantastic and engaging way to view different snapshots of the education field and talk about themes that extend beyond those examples. I became better at analyzing information, more confident in my knowledge and skills, and I'm inspired to continue this work! Often times the work to improve education can feel disheartening because there is so much to change, but this class did a great job of balancing discussions about what still needs to be done and also providing hope that there are good people working on these issues as well as proven methods that show a lot of promise.",
                "I gained a much more practical and less theoretical understanding of the education system.",
                "Analytical skills particularly in the case study method, leadership, pertinent issues on education policy and practice",
                "I learned how to go through the process of identifying a problem and creating the solution. Working through our semester-long change projects taught me so much about collaboration, leadership, and problem-solving. Since we spent so much time in class talking about how issues in education should be solved, it was so interesting to actually have the chance to try and solve one of these issues ourselves. It taught me so much about how to actually go about the problem-solving process in a real-world context. Truly an amazing learning experience.",
                "Broad sampling of theories that describe/analyze leadership, change, and improvement in education. Opportunity to develop deeper understanding of some of those theories through further assignments. Experience in practical application of these theories through analysis of real-world cases. Some key insights into the nature of change and improvement in education. Experience in analyzing a chosen problem in education, designing an intervention, getting feedback from education experts, and refining the intervention in a semester-long group project.",
                "Insight into education leadership and practice. Effective policy and real world case study analysis and written communication of said analysis. Creating long-term education projects and briefing education experts. In-depth project discussion and revisions based on expert feedback. Insight into the challenges to implementing education policy change in the real world.",
                "This course helped put the various factors involved in education reform into perspective and gave me a more realistic outlook on the process of change within education. The theories we learned about were extremely useful in illustrating current issues. This course also had some of the best group work in my college experience, so you definitely come out of it with greater collaboration skills.",
                "I learned to analyze case studies in education and be self critical and research focused in facing education's biggest challenges",
                "A much greater understanding of the American education system and its many inefficiencies.",

            "comments": [
                "In this course, students are deeply challenged to re-articulate their assumptions about the educational system, which is a rare experience at Yale! The strength of this course is its case-based and project-based pedagogical model. This is an engaging and interactive seminar where you get to know your peers and your professor.",
                "It's clear that Professor Lemons has invested a LOT of time and energy into designing this course. Because of this, it is truly a pleasure to take -- you will never feel like your time is being wasted. In my opinion, the case study model is one of the greatest strengths. We were able to dive into several hotly debated issues (critical race theory, charter schools, etc.) while staying focused on how they show up in the real world.",
                "This course is really interesting and teaches a number of skills not covered in any other class at Yale. Dr. Lemons is really cool, understanding, and knowledgable. The structure of the course, including the long-term project and the case method, make it feel really refreshing and fun. In terms of improvement, I would suggest introducing the memo in a different way. I felt really confused throughout the whole semester about what made a good memo. Often, the memos I thought I would do well on got okay grades and the ones I didn't think so much about got better grades. I think explaining more about what you are looking for and what makes a good memo (versus a bad memo) would be very helpful. It also still feels very unclear about what our final project grade is on  are we being evaluated on our final proposed intervention, on our presentation, or only on what we wrote for our final group reflection paper?",
                "Professor Lemons is a passionate, empathetic, and engaging instructor who has so many insights to offer in this field. The learning in this course becomes increasingly student-driven over the semester, but Lemons's questions and guidance throughout are incredibly valuable. This truly was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nThe group projects are a highlight -- though it is nerve-wracking to present in front of education leaders across the state their feedback is so helpful and this experience helped place the course content into a real-world context (something that rarely happens on this level for Yale courses).",
                "The case study-based nature of this class was definitely a strength, as well as the structure. While it is a 2-hour seminar in the evening, the way Dr. Lemons structures the class makes it move quickly. I also appreciated the discussion in this class. I do think sometimes the discussions could have been more student led.",
                "Really great material -- deeply engaged with and was challenged by everything. Strengths lie in professor, class style, and the projects and assignments, which are all meaningful. Could only be improved with more time to continue the great conversations and work",
                "I was very engaged in each and every class. I liked how the course was based on case studies because it made the material feel relevant and urgent. Even though each class period was almost two hours long, the time always flew by.",
                "Strengths: A major strength of this class is Professor Lemons. He is empathetic and flexible, carefully intentional about creating an environment suited to fulfillingly self-guided student learning, an engaging instructor, and an expert in the content. The semester-long group change project was definitely the best part of the class. Presenting our work-in-progress solution to a panel of education experts and then sitting down with them for a more in-depth conversation afterwards was extremely fulfilling and felt surprisingly low-stakes, since there was no grade attached to the presentation. Further iterating on our project and turning in a (still work-in-progress) final product that we were proud of was incredibly rewarding as well. The classes themselves flew by, despite being 1 hr 50 min at 7:00 on Wednesday nights. Professor Lemons struck a great balance between guiding the conversation at times, but also leaving plenty of room for student direction and discussion - it may have been the first class I've ever taken that truly felt student-led. The cases we studied were interesting, and I really did learn a lot from our conversations about them. The other assignments - the case analysis and weekly case memos - were instructive and were good opportunities to critically apply our knowledge of the material, even if they were also a bit intensive. The self-grade (as awful as the title of the assignment sounds) ended up being a welcome opportunity to reflect on the semester. \r\n\r\nRoom for improvement: First thing - the work for this class felt extremely back-loaded, with the case analysis, final project submission, and self-grade all being due rapid-fire, one after another, the final week of the semester. It's true that the case analysis is available the entire semester, but most students are deadline-driven, and this sequencing of deadlines sets them up for a very stressful end of term. If the case analysis deadline could be a bit sooner (perhaps before November break, or one week after it), this could help alleviate the heavy end of semester workload for this class. Second thing - it is *shocking* that this class is not a writing credit! Expect to write quite a bit for this course: ~20 pages *single-spaced* individually, not including writing for the group project. It would be great if this class could be a writing credit, but I don't know if Yale's criteria for this designation are oddly specific/restrictive.",
                "Only Strengths: The course is extremely well-organized and very cognizant of student need. Ample time is made for discussion. Discussion is engaging and meaningful with the intention of asking hard questions and getting to the heart of issues. Evident readings and case-studies are selected with careful effort. End of year project is an incredible experience I wish more courses would offer. Extremely rewarding to be able to work on something long term so that knowledge throughout the class is able to culminate, and then have the opportunity to present it to experts. Not only this, but then following the presentation to further discuss the policy proposal at length and then be able to modify based on feedback from those with knowledge of real-world implementation and challenges. Incredible class.",
                "Dr. Lemons is an excellent professor and he does a great job organizing this course. Would not change a thing!",
                "Strengths: case studies structure, Dr. Lemons\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes class time felt too short to really get into the weeds of the complex case studies we took on. some of the project deadlines felt too close together and made it tough to actually progress from one to the next",
                "Legitimately no weaknesses. Prof Lemons is a gem, the cases are super interesting, and everyone in class was so lovely"

Be prepared for interactive seminar discussions and a final presentation in front of state educators and educational leaders. These are critical components of the course, but even shy students should not feel afraid to apply. There is so much personal growth that occurs in this class  it's worth the challenge.",
                "Yes! Yes! Yes! This is THE best class I have taken in the Education Studies department with the best seminar conversations.",
                "Absolutely! This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The content is fascinating, the discussions are engaging, and Professor Lemons is a gem. If you are interested in education, you will not regret taking this course!!",
                "Yes, definitely! This is an academic experience that I don't think you can get from any other Yale course. Dr. Lemons totally orients the class around creating the conditions for you to learn. If you are interested in education and/or improving education, then you should definitely take this course to get a sense of what that really means and what it might look like.",
                "Yes absolutely! Anyone interested in education will benefit from this course!!",
                "I would definitely recommend this class; I learned much more in this class than I have in most classes at Yale, largely due to the applicability of what we learned about both education and leadership. This course really pushes students to see the nuance in education and the world and very well might create more questions than answers, but I am leaving it a better thinker and more open-minded than when I entered. I will say this class is a lot of work compared to other classes, with papers, weekly assignments, ongoing group projects, and personal eval. It's worth it, but you have to be prepared going into the class.",
                "Absolutely -- an experience unlike other classes I've had before. Professor was incredibly focused on student learning and growth as well as their wellbeing, and the material was engaging, relevant, and personal.",
                "Yes! The material is important and engaging and Professor Lemons is absolutely amazing. Also, since much of the work was based on a semester-long, group change project, I got to put into practice many important soft skills like collaboration and problem-solving.",
                "If you're interested in education, you need to take this class",
                "Absolutely. This is the best seminar (possibly the best course) I have taken at Yale. The workload is not light, but it's worth it. Professor Lemons is empathetic and flexible and truly cares about helping you submit your best work. I felt as if I was treated like an adult in this class, a feeling I realized I hadn't really had about other courses at Yale before. There is immense room for self-directed learning, the material is engaging, and you will come away from this class having gained valuable theoretical and practical knowledge. Don't let the 7:00pm Wednesday timeslot scare you!\r\n\r\nI will say, though, that a major part of your work throughout the semester will be your group project. My experience with my group was excellent, but other people's mileage may vary. If you're not a fan of group projects, this is something to consider. (But I would really recommend giving it a shot anyway!). Also, expect to do quite a bit of writing (~20 pages *single-spaced*, not including writing for the group project), even though it is not a writing credit. Am I a little salty that it wasn't a writing credit? Sure. Still, I would choose to take the class without hesitation.",
                "Yes! This is an amazing course and one of the few that allows students to be responsive to the New Haven community and to concerns within education. The end of year project is awesome and it was incredibly fulfilling to be able to create something with an impact. Definitely acquired skills in this course that I know I will use in the future professionally.",
                "YES! If you have any interest in education reform at all, this is one of the best classes you could possibly take at Yale!",
                "take it if you're interested in applying leadership theories to education policy",
                "YES YES YES. There is no other Yale class structured in a way that is so centered around creating meaningful learning conditions as opposed to focusing on grades. It was incredibly refreshing and still everyone was successful"
