                "Stregths: Kern was a wonderfil instructor. He was very open and allowed us to take our art in whatever direction we wanted. He created an open and welcoming environment for studentssomething very important for an introductory art class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think we spent too much in-class time just working on our midterm and final projects. The last 6 classes (12 hours of class time) were devoted to working on our final project. While this helped me have no homework for the class during a busy time, I took drawing for a reason. I would've much rather spent that time learning more drawing techniques and practicing in different drawing activities.",
                "The strengths of this course were absolutely Kern and Grant. They were always extremely supportive in class, no matter what a student's ability may be, and gave feedback that was actually constructive. Everyone, for the most part, felt very engaged with the material and it was clear that people cared about the class.",
                "Strengths: covered very foundational drawing techniques through exercises instead of lectures, interesting project prompts\r\nWeaknesses: long meeting times",
                "Strengths only for this class- very low stress in this class thanks to Kern and Grant, along with other classmates. was easy to have productful drawing sessions and conversation.",
                "I certainly enjoyed the emphasis on individual projects in this course over introductory exercises. It was a great way to make the very most of our professors knowledge by asking for the tips and guidance that we individually desired. However, I could see this being frustrating to those who dont know exactly what questions to ask or how to ask them.",
                "It was a great course! I really thought the units were all very instructive and that the artist presentation introduced me to great artists",

I also felt that drawing and the act of creating art was extremely therapeutic, and it was really great to have structured time to create art during the semester. I would especially recommend this class if Kern is teaching ithe is a gem of an instructor and perhaps one of the best professors I have learned from at this university.",
