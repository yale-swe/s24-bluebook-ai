There is no teaching in this class so a lot of the time, it felt like I was learning nothing for 4 hours. I think this class could be shortened to MAX 2 hours and could include much more discussion and teaching about documentary film and how you can express it. I sometimes felt uncomfortable during the class with the heavy amount of nakedness involved in the films we watched.",

If a student is really dedicated to and interested in watching film and gaining exposure to the different types of film out there, as well as showing film, than I do think this class would be good.",
