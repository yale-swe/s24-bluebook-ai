                "Strengths = You do get more access or exposure to other documentary film. \r\nWeaknesses = The class is way way too long for what it needs to be. There is no teaching in this class so a lot of the time, it felt like I was learning nothing for 4 hours. I think this class could be shortened to MAX 2 hours and could include much more discussion and teaching about documentary film and how you can express it. I sometimes felt uncomfortable during the class with the heavy amount of nakedness involved in the films we watched.",
                "I believe the course really forced you to engage with the material individually which was helpful as no person was explaining how exactly to understand the media we were shown.",
                "Loved the films we watched, but it would be great to include more traditional documentaries and classes focused on the technical aspect of film."

                "I would not recommend this course to another student because there are many other classes that would be engaging without having to be in a room doing nothing for 4 hours. If a student is really dedicated to and interested in watching film and gaining exposure to the different types of film out there, as well as showing film, than I do think this class would be good.",
