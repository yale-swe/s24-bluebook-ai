                "The professor tends to use most of the class to speak his mind about the papers assigned. While that was interesting and he was incredibly passionate and knowledgeable, a bit of structure to the discussions would have been nice such as using the powerpoint slides he would post to canvas, rather than just tallking.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of the course and I feel like I have learned many things in a relatively low stakes environment. However, one thing I would complain is the imbalance in the readings that each person had to do for their presentation. I had to read two very dense papers that took me more than 2 full days to go over and then I really struggled to fit everything in my presentation. However, other people had much shorter papers and many times had only one to do. I hope that the next time this course is taught that the professor will make sure that there is a better balance between the readings so that it is fair to everyone. Also, I would have liked to receive more feedback on my papers and presentation.",
                "Strengths: interesting content; professor is very passionate\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: format of class is sometimes not engaging (when almost half of class is student presentations, it is hard to pay attention sometimes at the beginning, especially at 9am!)",
                "Everything was great except maybe for the fact that we had 1 long lecture a week, which can be very exhausting, especially over zoom.",
                "strengths: prof padro is a really great teacher and focuses as much on developing skills (analyzing + critiquing econometric papers) as on teaching content (economics of conflict), which is surprisingly rare at Yale and incredibly helpful -- I'm likely to forget the content I memorized in survey courses, but will continue to use the analytical techniques / modes of thinking that Gerard encouraged us to develop. weakness: zoom was super awkward, though I'd attribute this to senioritis, not to the professor..."
