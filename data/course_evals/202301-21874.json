            "comments": [
                "strengths -- the professors are all lovely and really care about the subject matter. weaknesses -- it's a ton of information and can be really overwhelming. there are also not a lot of readings for the course which makes it somewhat difficult to orient yourself to the different topics that are being presented",
                "The surprise-attack weekly sections were not ideal, but the lectures were engaging and interesting. It also seems unfair to have a final be worth so much when the lecture slides don't have a lot of information on them, which makes studying for the final exam difficult even if you've taken good notes.",
                "Office Hours that started weeks after the semester began was not ideal.",
                "This class was very difficult to follow--by the end of the course, it felt that I was one of the only students in it who was not majoring in a subject that this course was a pre-req for. The numbers continued to dwindle throughout the whole semester, and we were often addressed as being students in the major, despite it being an introductory level class. Furthermore, the difference in instructors varied, as did the difficulty of the class depending on who was teaching. Maybe it is because the TFs came from vastly different specialties, but they did not seem well informed in the subject of the class for the most part. None of them ever showed up to lecture, so much of section often became regurgitating to them what we had learned in lecture so they could (often improperly) answer our questions. Section was also very all over the place--we rarely had assignments, never discussed the reading (which at some points seemed optional and at other points did not), and when people had questions, they were often not answered. I also feel that I was very rarely given reassurance that I was actually completing assignments correctly. \r\n\r\nFinally, the final is 46% of the grade. Is that even allowed? Someone could have straight As and by the time the final came around, still risk failing the class.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- lectures were engaging and has a cohesive narrative that was helpful to my understanding of different topics\r\n- gave me a very specific as well as comprehensive view across the precambrian, Paleozoic, mesozoic, and Cenozoic periods, on the climate, animal life (terrestrial and marine), plant life, and geology/continental dispersal.\r\n- no work outside of class on a regular basis unless to review class notes and to study for exam (EXCEPT for the midterm essay that came out of nowhere).  Low workload meant I could give myself time to really review what I'd learned in class, and that I kept up as long as I went to lectures.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- office hours led by TFs were not the most useful, because they didn't often know what things would be tested on and what was important to know.  I feel like TFs would be much more helpful if they have taken the class before.\r\n- the essay came out of nowhere and was a full on book review.  Though I enjoyed reading my book and writing the essay, we received little guidance about it from professors and TFs.\r\n-  final exam studying was scattered and different TFs were saying confusing things.\r\n- slides uploaded to canvas had no notes - obviously that meant we had to pay extra attention in class, but when I missed something small it was hard to get that info.",
                "Each professor was engaged, interested in their subject matter, and willing to answer questions. The class could better communicate key questions such as HOW did life first emerge, and WHY major progressions throughout the phylogenetic tree occurred, rather than focusing on what specifically happened.",
                "I think the strengths were that there are three different teachers that teacher different sections of the course, which made it more engaging and interesting. However, this makes it so that there is inconsistenty with how difficult or confusing the material can be. One thing to keep in mind is that the final is 46% of your grade, which is incredibly weird.  They made the section grade 9% which makes no sense.  It makes it so that last two sections of the class much more emphasized that the first section, which I did not like.",
                "Lectures very confusing and unstructured.",
                "More continuity with the sections",
                "There are no assignments aside from the midterm essay, which makes the workload less than other classes. However, this means that most of the knowledge is self incentivized. The class itself is extremely interesting, the lectures are dynamic and interesting to listen to; the three lecturers have very different styles, which can be hard to adjust between the switches.",
                "Lots of valuable info but disorganized at times.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it's taught by three professors, and it's a nice opportunity to get to know the professors in EPS",
                "weakness: anjan's part was very hard to follow. he said in the first lecture that he has no recordings, no textbook, and his powerpoint doesn't have much words, so we should pay attention to what he is saying. but for someone who has no background in phylogenetic terms, it is impossible to follow.",
                "Strengths: very interesting content, helps students understand our present moment more deeply, lecturers are good storytellers\r\nWeaknesses: the assignment/grading structure of this class could be greatly improved. Your grade was essentially determined by three factors: a midterm, an essay, and a final. More regular graded assignments (essays, labs, reading responses, worksheets) could have encouraged deeper engagement with the course and a better understanding of its content.",
                "Strengths of the course: I really enjoyed the three-instructor structure of the course and supplementary section meeting with a TF. I loved having three experiences with varying teaching styles that made sense to the content they were teaching, and the support of the TFs was great. The labs of the course and visits to fossils in KGL were also incredibly fascinating, and I anticipate this will only become better as the Peabody museum reopens. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps a little more support with the vertebrate paleontology section of the course would be helpful, or posting lectures as Professor Briggs did. Otherwise, this course was wonderful."

If you are not passionate about rocks and fossils, do not take.",
                "No, I would never recommend this course to another student, even if they were really interested and already well informed in the subject matter, if only because the final is worth 46% of the grade. \r\n\r\nIf the final were changed to a more reasonable percentage, I would still be reluctant to recommend another student take this class. I don't feel I learned much in it, yet at the same time, was constantly challenged by it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone looking to understand more about life.  Though it can get very jargony and technical at times, it has helped me so much to understand evolution.  I took this as my biology credit for EVST BS, and im so thankful I did.",
                "I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in developing a fundamental understanding of the history of life on Earth.",
                "I wouldn't reccomend it if you are not interested in the fossil record or phylogeny and stuff like that. It was difficult to find motivation to go to classes because it was all the way in the Kline Geology lab, and for some reason in the second and third sections of the lecture they did not record.",
                "Yes! I took this course to fulfill a requirement, but ended up enjoying the course as much as any other at Yale. If you are interested in the topics, the lectures are very cool and engaging, and the workload is manageable without feeling onerous.",
                "No, it is not a gut. Would not recommend if not required.",
                "I would recommend this course to those interested in science, even if not on the E&EB or EVST track. It is general enough that those not specialized in a particular science will understand and appreciate the course. But that is not to say that it is an easy or boring class, it is an extremely interesting class that is well fit for those intending on majoring in the subject and those not.",

                "Yes! Absolutely- this course is adaptive and engaging across the three different instructors, and the Professors are not only incredible for their vast amounts of knowledge, but also their bright personalities and desire to see students learn. This course was a great introduction to EPS and facilitates understanding, even for non-majors, providing a great introduction to evolutionary patterns and phenomena. You also get to witness and touch incredible fossils!"
