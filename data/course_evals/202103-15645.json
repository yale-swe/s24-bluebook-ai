                "It helped me revise my calc skills and be prepare me for classes such as econ",
                "I learned how to do basic calculus, such as taking derivatives, integrals, and applying those concepts to problems like related rates and many more. College math is very different from high school math as the classes are MUCH faster-paced, and the course isn't as structured as AP calculus. This forced me to do a lot of learning outside of the classroom with the textbook. However, what my professor did with the Skeleton notes was pretty great.",

It taught me how to utilize all my resources (such as not just my notes but also use the textbook, peer tutoring, the internet, etc.) and it taught me the value of sitting down and setting a daily schedule so that I can take time to study.",

                "This course is quite strong, but I think it could benefit by having more peer tutoring opportunities. Also, offering class skeletons to all students for the entirety of the course would be very beneficial.",
                "The in-class practice and problem sets are not an accurate reflection of the exams. Therefore, practicing for midterms and finals can be hard.",
                "Strengths are the assessment break down, there is a good balance of the weighting of homework, midterms and the final. The course was well taught and it can be improved by having a more comprehensive set of revision materials for the exams.",
                "It covers a wide range of topics but I wish the course went on a more typical path.",
                "Strengths: passionate professor, good outline the units that we had to learn (I loved how closely we followed the textbook).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more high-school type homework, as in more rote practice. I understand the goal of the psets is to make you deeply deeply think about the skills and topics learned in class, but also, rote practice will make students understand the topic more than anything. You can't understand it if you're not good at it. So instead of these insanely long and difficult psets, maybe cut down the psets by a bit, but also assign worksheets or txtbook problems for simple practice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I wish we could get an answer key to the psets after we submit them. I always got feedback on what i did wrong, but never knew what the actual right answer was.",
                "strengths were it was engaging to the whole time.",
                "I think this course went very fast but I liked when my professor Brett gave us paper notes packets to fill out. This really allowed me to pay attention to learning in class rather than writing down notes instead of listening.",
                "Good",
                "This course was very strong in that it was very well taught by professors, peer tutors, and teaching fellows. However, the course was weak in that many students found certain peer tutors to be much more helpful than others, and some students found that Ximera was not the most effective method to engage with the material.",
                "This course required a ability to think on the spot specially when taking Exams",
                "I liked the professor and the class size. One issue I had with the class was the first pset, which was unnecessarily difficult and touched on topics we did not discuss in the class.",
                "This class was not very interesting and the problem sets were hard, and graded very harshly. If you go to office hours you should be okay, but it is still more difficult than it needs to be to get a good problem set grade.",
                "The material was extremely rushed at the end of the semester. The problem sets didn't actually help develop understanding of the material in a way that was effective. They were also graded extremely harshly without clear explanation as to why or how to solve problems correctly. Solutions were never posted after submission and grading so students could see and study how to solve problems. \r\nMore examples should be shown in class to give students the tools needed to tackle the problem sets and Ximera was the way that students learned the material.",
                "Strengths: even if you aren't necessarily a \"math\" person, this course will pique your curiosity. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n - I would have benefitted from more practice problems during class \r\n - the problem sets and exams are graded for extremely minute issues, and graders aren't very forgiving\r\n - the difficulty level of problem set questions is not relevant to exams and topics covered in class",
                "It can be improved by having the professor teach the material instead of simply learning on our own through Ximera.",
                "Strengths: structure is conducive to learning bit by bit, Brett is a great teacher, there is a lot of additional support (peer tutors with office hours, review sessions, TA's, ...)\r\nWeaknesses: feels a lot like a high school class (worksheets, daily home works, weekly Psets, etc), which is helpful to cover the material, but it also allows you to be passive and tune out."

It is well taught yet maintains the difficulty and necessity of self-study that will aid students in transitioning from high school to university life.
