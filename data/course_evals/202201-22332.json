                "In addition to enhancing my ability to analyze and critique music, I feel like I developed a new lens that integrates cultural and social considerations to a greater degree when Im listening to popular music.",
                "While MUSI 207 establishes the initial foundation for analyzing individual pieces of pop music, MUSI 208 is a broader historical and genre-focused look at developments throughout American pop music. Individual pieces are analyzed and discussed to further questions about how genre is engaged with and consumed while placing them in the context of the music industry and music-making methods of the time. It's about looking at the whole picture rather than just a single artist or song at a time-- learning from case studies to interrogate larger trends.",
                "A great (*very* broad) overview of Pop Music from 1960 --> the Present, approached from a theoretical and cultural angle.",
                "- A nuanced understanding of genre, and how it relates to the music industry, racism, politics, and music theory\r\n- Insight on popular music through time, with countless examples of songs that we discussed and analyzed in class\r\n- Knowledge on specific songs, artists, music videos, and genres from assignments and student presentations\r\n- A recap on basic pop theory from MUSI 207, which was applied more in-depth throughout the course"

Discussions and topics were always engaging, the professors are on top of their game, and the whole class is super chill and accommodating. Learning from each other and open discussion is the priority, not assignment deadlines and grades. This class is genuinely one of most fun and interesting classes I've had at Yale.",
                "This was an amazing course, mostly because it allowed me to discover and listen to music I wasn't familiar with, and to engage with that music in a meaningful way with people who were passionate about the subject."

                "So cool to learn about pop music in an academic setting such as this! We were compelled to look at genres that we both we and werent familiar with, so we really were able to cover a lot.",
                "Absolutely! This is one of the most unique academic experiences Ive had.",
                "100% take this class if you are at all interested in the wide world of popular music outside the narrow confines of traditional Western art music. MUSI 207 is already a fun class, but that class is like training wheels for practicing music analysis outside classical music while this is the academically oriented pop music discussion club. The professors are amazing, the workload is extremely manageable (bring an interesting example for class discussion from the relevant decade being discussed), and the class is never stressful.",
                "Yes, absolutely! Especially for students who already have some background and are excited to do deeper dives by themselves.",
                "YES, ABSOLUTELY. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale, and I am so grateful to have took it. Nate and Bronwen are incredible, and the course material is extremely useful for anyone interested in music or the music industry. This course is how I believe all theory courses should be-- not only looking at theoretical components of music, but also analyzing the cultural backdrop of musical works, and being critical about generalizations in music. I had such an excellent time learning in this course, and I really appreciated the assignments (especially the final paper!!), feedback, and presentations throughout the semester. And in a terribly stressful semester of covid scares and global crises, Nate and Bronwen were always so kind, supportive, and accommodating, which I cannot thank them for enough."
