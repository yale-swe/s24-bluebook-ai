Most of the course focuses on research design and methodology like IRBs  thus if your project doesn't involve human subjects and you won't need an IRB, consider takin the independent study option."

    "Offering the independent study course was a godsend this year. While I still wished that I could have been in the classroom with my peers on a biweekly basis, the structure of the peer and mentor feedback was really well paced and enabled a strong finish to my capstone. I think that continuing to offer the independent study option to those that need it is a really good idea for the future.",
    "I did an independent study and had lots of supportit was the perfect combination of private work and help from advisors.",
    "Strengths: small size\r\nWeaknesses: not all the days were productive, which meant that attendance was spotty and student engagement was low. Professor Debs also has unrealistically high expectations for students in the course. Education Studies is NOT a major, thus she should not expect our engagement with the capstone to be equivalent to that of a thesis (unless, of course, you are completing a joint thesis with EDST). One of the more absurd things our semester was doing practice presentations a full MONTH before the official day of Capstone Presentations  stuff like this just makes students overwhelmed and isn't even productive because none of us are ready"

   "comments": [
    "If you're doing it you're doing it, but I will say for folks that consider dropping at the beginning or midpoint of senior year, it's really worth sticking it out. I've found more fulfilling intellectual experiences and better preparation for what I want to do after college in my work on this capstone than I did on my thesis. The preparation and support I've received through the capstone colloquium this year was invaluable.",
    "Yes! If you have a good advisor, this can be a super helpful and useful course to go through.",
    "It's the senior requirement for Education Studies, and arguably probably the most difficult. A few people in my year dropped the program entirely because of the capstone requirement. Professor Debs has high standards for the capstone and treats it as seriously as a thesis in a major  so if you were expecting to have a chill senior year\/senior spring, I would think twice."
