    "I learned elementary Portuguese and was able to make use of what I learned on a daily basis.",
    "I developed the ability to speak, read, and understand Portuguese while learning about Brazilian culture.",

    "Just as well taught as the first part of the course. Only recommendation would be to maybe make us go out more in Rio during class time.",
    "I think it was a well organized course, overwhelmed at times but thats due to the intensive nature of the program.",
    "I think the course built on itself well. We began to move very fast at one point which was due to the short amount of time we had but I think all the different ways we learned - many written exercises, compositions, watching movies and videos, and of course being in Rio de Janeiro - made it manageable and conducive to actually retaining material.",
    "The class only had strengths. It was constantly engaging for students and made learning another language fun.",
    "The course was very strong and well taught. I don't have any suggestions for how to improve it.",
    "The strength was how interactive the course was. The weakness was how much was covered in such little time."

    "I would recommend this to any student who wishes to learn a second romance language.",
    "Yes, I would. It is an amazing course that teaches you another language as well as the culture of a group of people who speak it. There is so much more than just language taught in the course.",
    "Yes, it was excellently taught by the professor."
