As a classical musician, I took away from this class a broader understanding of what music theory is and what its purpose should bebefore, I thought of theory as a statement of this is how music works deep down, but now I view theory as just one way to describe or explain what I hear as I listen.",

                "The organization of the course is great; there was a logical build-up of concepts from simple to more complex, and our toolbox for understanding music expanded throughout the semester. The class size was great for encouraging plenty of participation. The assignments were very painless, often taking less than 30 minutes a week. I wish that the specifics of the course material were more clear from the start, however. Having experience writing and arranging my own music as well as playing a few instruments, I felt that the course was pretty easy and I came away with less new knowledge than I expected. A more advanced course of the same flavor would be wonderful.",
                "Strengths: great and knowledgable professor, reasonable workload and flexibility (weekly assignments were super manageable), goes over student examples, smart and amazing TA (Hallie) who made discussion sections fun and interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None really",
                "Strengths: highly engaging, fun class, good discussion\r\nWeaknesses: minimal feedback on assignments",
                "Classes were fun and I thought the teaching team did a really great job with both the classes and how forgiving they were when it came to deadlines and assignments.\r\nThe only weakness I felt was that I didnt feel like I got that much feedback or direction in general with my assignments.",
                "A strength was the sections - I particularly liked the chord progression worksheet and our analysis based in.",
                "The class was interesting, and I definitely learned more about pop music. The assignments were engaging and fun, it was mainly finding songs we enjoy and doing our own analysis of them. That being said, I wish that we had gone a little bit more in depth into the music theory. We spent a lot of time going over homework assignments, which were good illustrations of examples, but I thought some of that time could've been used to learn more topics.",
                "This course was extremely organized, informative, and fun. I'm grateful for Professor Adam's genuineness and intelligence.",
                "I loved how this course gave us the skills needed to analyze popular music. It is super cool to know listen to a song on the radio and be able to do a brief analysis in my head. I also really enjoyed the format with most material being taught through listening examples in class.",
                "Strengths: the difficulty of the course increased gradually as we gained new skills. Having a TA as well as Professor Adam gave us freedom to ask a bunch of questions.\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of time was spent on listening to songs that were brought in as opposed to learning theory that was directly taught to us."

This class is a fun way to learn concepts deeply useful to any musician. I would say that if you can identify the chord progression of a four chord pop song by ear without much hesitation, this class is likely too easy for you. If you can't, this class is perfect for you.",
                "Yes! Great and fun way to fulfill lessons requirement. If you want to chill and get your credit, you can do that, but Prof. Adam and Hallie are so knowledgable that if you want to learn a ton about pop music, you can learn as much as you want just by talking to them after class.",
                "Yes!",

                "If you're looking for a relatively low workload but interesting class about music theory, I definitely would recommend. If you have a strong background in music theory though, you probably will already know most of what is talked about in this class.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it teaches you the skills in order to be able to analysis and transcribe popular music. We also had very interesting discussions in class about copyright law and originality which were very engaging and fascinating to consider.",
                "Yes! Fun, relaxed course. I was probably at the lower end of music theory comprehension going in, but I still managed to learn a lot from the class and from my classmates."
