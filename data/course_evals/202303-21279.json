                "I fully learned how to write a full historic research paper. Yahaya gave incredible and detailed feedback, encouraged discussion, and wasnt afraid to both facilitate and let us take over discussion. All in all, it led to the opportunity to have a broad yet in-depth understanding of the development/use of Infrastructure (both in Asia and Beyond).",
                "Coming into the course, I had doubts about how interesting learning about \"infrastructure\" could be, because well, it's infrastructure. It's not a word that I associate with an interesting topic. However, I am glad that I tried this course out because it was VERY interesting! As a hisory major who plans to study Japanese history, getting an opportunity to read up on how infrastructure could reflect a country's past with colonialism, a country's present socioeconomic inequalities, and a country's hopeful future in settling territorial disputes or developing economically. To see infrastructure, which is something I take granted for in my daily life, so interconnected with the field of history was eyeopening because it made me view history not as a mere study of the past but as a tool to understand our present world. \r\nAlso, my initial idea of \"infrastructure\" was very limited. That is why I thought it might not be interesting when in reality, infrastructure could be anything from \"environmentally friendly\" urban planning projects in Dubai to military infrastructure in the form of terrain knowledge in Afghanistan. Through the reaidng responses I had to write, I learned to find connections between two seemingly unrealted topics. Only by writing and discussing about the readings was I able to truly understand their implications on the larger field of study. (I also learned to skim in this class because there was quite a lot of reading for every class. It was not unmanagable, but at times, I did have to skim rather than deeply analyze every sentence of the reading.)\r\nAnother important skill I gained was to conduct my own research using the library. We got an opportunity to write a final paper on a topic of our own choice, and through it I learned what kinds of resources the library could provide me with, in particular pretty rare books that I would not be able to find elsewhere.",

                "Strength was CERTAINLY discussion and essay feedback. Discussion was guided but followed where we wanted to take it, and feedback was incredibly insightful. I wasnt a huge fan of the podcast project- I felt like it required a bit more research/front work than we could feasibly fit in a relatively short (about 6min) conversation. I think an option between essay and podcast would be better",
                "Strength: great professor, interesting readings, not too many assignments, decent class discussions\r\nWeakness: this was one of the first times I ever took a two hour seminar, and for those not yet used to long seminars, this might be a bit exhausting at first! That's about it (not really a weakness, I guess)",
                "strengths: readings very diverse in topics (everything from medical to transportation infrastructure) as well as area of origin (i.e economics, polisci, anthro papers) \r\n\r\nweaknesses: the theme of infrastructure is super niche and some people thought it was repetitive but i liked how all the different variations contributed in their own unique way to the big idea"

                "ABSOLUTELY. Especially if you want to improve your ability to write a historical research paper",
                "YES! \r\nInfrastucture might not sound like the most interesting topic, but that is mostly because OUR perception of infrastructure is very limited to our current lifestyle. Once you start doing the readings, you will realize how unique and astonishing infrastructure elsewhere from a different time period could be. In particular, learning about some (unrealistically) ambitious projects was always fascinating to me. In the readings, you will get to learn about individuals who were involved in such projects and their ambitions as well, rather than just about the project itself. Getting to know the stories of these individuals made the class even more fun because in some way, it made me sympathize with these highly ambitious infrastructure projects that did not see a success due to their unrealistic nature. Another great thing about this class is that we got to read critisms about the study of infrastructure. For instance, in one of our very fist classes, we read about the overuse of the term \"flow\" and the way in which the word has started to lose meaning as people throw it around for the sake of it. What's more, this class helped me realize that \"infrastructure\" is a very much physical thing rather than some ambiguous concept. One of the first things people might imagine with infrastructure is the Internet and Wi-Fi connections, which both feel pretty intangible. Well, even those come to us through undersea cables, very much real and tangible,  provided by a very few companies! Isn't that just fascinating?\r\nFurthermore, if you are interested in learning about the history of colonialism, this class would be a great fit for you. As a large part of Asia has a history of colonization, we get many opportunities to read about the ways in which colonialism has left its mark on infrastructure that exists to this day (ex: Indian railways face issues that kind of stem from colonialism!). Even if you are not that into the topic of colonialism, if you plan to study any Asian history, this course is a must take. I study Japanese history, and I came across so many new perspectives that I hadn't come across in other classes solely focused on Japanese history (for instance, the different ways Nagasaki and Hiroshima incorporated their past with atomic bombs into urban redevelopment post war). Asia is enormous and diverse, so the readings truly cover a wide variety of topics. I am sure that if you are even slightly into some form of Asian history, you will enjoy this course!\r\nDr. Yahaya is a very engaging professor and she will participate in discussions herself during class. She is the type of professor who would welcome any questions or confusions and spend time explaining them carefully, rather than telling you to try harder. Really, she's a great professor! The course load is alright. It's one of those classes where you can put as much or as little time into it and still do fairly well. I put in a lot of time into this class, mostly by doing the readings, because I found the toics genuinely fascinating, and I have no regrets. I probably would have come out with a similar grade even if I hadn't put in as much time, but it was still very much worth all the time and effort.",
                "yes! discussions are very engaging and on topics i've never encountered in other history classes before. prof yahaya does a great job always centering people in how she narrates history, even when the topic is so material oriented. makes it all very memorable"
