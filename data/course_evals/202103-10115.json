                "I would say this class is largely an education in the creative process and different modes of creation. Through the sheer volume of projects and careful guidance from the professor I really rethought the ways I explore certain concepts and how I make work. Towards the end of the semester, this is increasingly applied to spatial/architectural work.",
                "Design starting from its fundamentals, very engaging readings and very enriching work",
                "Its hard to verbalize what I learned in this course, but I can say that it is a course that makes you fall in love with your craft.",
                "This course is an introduction to the architectural studio and teaches students a variety of skills, ranging from traditional drafting to woodworking to model making. Above all, this course teaches students to think spatially, and to consider the occupiable world as exisiting in all mediums and places. It is a truly eye-opening, transformative course for those interested in architectural design.",
                "refinement of physical and rhino modeling techniques, architectural drawing, spatial/conceptual thinking at a very elemental scale.",
                "While I learned a lot of technical skills and concepts, Id say that this course in particular taught me how to think visually and create prolifically.",
                "It was a great overview of what a studio class feels like. It completely changed how I interact with the world.",
                "I cultivated my own design aesthetic / process in this course. Studio helped me figure out what excites me (iteration of process or procedures to generate form/rules) and how to transmit that across different media. \r\n\r\nI learned a lot of production skills: I learned how to use the tools in the woodshop, gained familiarity with indesign, photoshop, illustrator, and rhino. I became more comfortable using the printers/plotters in the building. \r\n\r\nI also learned -- perhaps most importantly -- that my friends in this major are truly special humans that have become a dear part of my college experience. I learned what it feels like to have a group of committed learners who all share a space."

            "comments": [
                "Its a great class, no changes. It was formatted really well and was easy to follow and interesting to attend and really fun to explore and experiment with studio learning.",
                "The course requires a lot of work and engagement but that is what makes it what it is.",
                "Strengths include the liberty to work on our projects in a very personal way, instructions were generally guidelines that can be ignored if the creative process led us that way",
                "The best part about this course is the community that forms around it, students, TAs, and professor included. \r\n\r\nThe class is beautifully planned and I can hardly think anything I would change about it. If anything, I would have appreciated a bit more handholding. For instance, I think it would be good if we were required to write down a short rationale for each of our projects in order for us to take a break from making and be forced to reflect on the outcome of our work, which would also be helpful for our future portfolio.",
                "Strengths: this course requires you to create a new project on a weekly basis, which pushes you to create consistently and without hesitation. It can be frustrating to those who like to perfect their work over a long period of time, but such a model is beneficial in that it pushes you outside of your creative comfort zone. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the organization of the assignments/prompts were at times unclear, which left students confused about what was being asked of them. More clarity on work expectations/deliverables would be helpful.",
                "as a result of late nights before reviews, helping each other out with software, open-format crits, field trips and an amazing professor like Trattie, you may become best friends with your studio classmates. Also, having access to your own desk in Rudolph hall and all of its facilities and tools is probably one of the greatest privileges an undergrad at Yale could have.",
                "By far the biggest strength of studio is the people, both your peers youre working alongside and Trattie and the TFs. The studio environment that you all create together is nearly indescribable and different from any other class Ive taken at Yalewhich is why I cant imagine how different and how much weaker this course must be in an all-online format. Other strengths are weaknesses in some ways, I think, particularly the fact that you have an assignment due every week, which forces you to simply create and try to be unselfconscious about what you make (which is a very hard thing to do and certainly not something Ive yet mastered), but at the same time gave me an almost-overwhelming amount of stress and at times made each week feel unending and identical to the last. Lastly, Im not sure if this is a strength or weakness, but you receive no grades throughout the semester, which can be a bit frustrating but is perhaps so to make some larger point about whats important to take away from this class.",
                "I thought that the projects were very interesting and although we didn't get that much feedback on our projects, it was very fun. However, I do feel like more technical classes should be provided (Like how to use Rhino etc)",
                "Strengths: \r\n\r\nEmphasis on trial/error, experimentation: the sheer number of assignments (quite high) and their relatively quick turnaround (7-10 days) made each of them feel like a fun exploratory exercise, instead of a hugely daunting end-all project. Trattie did a great job of making it fun and snappy! \r\n\r\nThe studio space: having a physical space to work with your friends and see what they are doing/thinking about is probably the best part of this major, and this course. I cannot overstate how important the studio space was to us -- if you are taking this course under circumstances that force you to work \"remotely\" or with scheduled studio hours, I am not sure if my experience would be comparable. \r\n\r\nTeaching team: Trattie, Tim and David were all invested in our growth in the most compassionate way. It was a delight working with them!\r\n\r\nField trips!!! We really bonded as a class, and we are indebted to Trattie for facilitating this. It was lovely. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nMaking work emotional: Trattie does a great job of individually talking to us about our work. However, sometimes, her poetic way of speaking / conceptualizing the world seems really burdensome / demanding. It felt really difficult to ALWAYS be thinking about beauty/wonder/earth/life/death/animal/point/plane/space/care/wandering. I felt like there was some weird conflation of ethics and work, which made me feel like if I did not make my best work, then it was not simply a matter of trying again next week, but that it was some emotional crux that I needed to summit. \r\n\r\nWork? I would say the amount of work is particularly onerous, but I also found that it was the source of the best parts of this class ( the rigor, the production, the community). So, I am hesitant to event categorize it as a weakness."

I felt myself--as both a human and an artist--grow tremendously over the course of the semester, and felt that I was the right amount of challenged throughout my time in the studio. This course is not easy by any means, but I believe that anyone who is passionate about architecture/design/art making would benefit greatly from enrolling in this studio.",

I went into the semester trying to juggle too much, and felt like I was drowning as a result, but when I acquiesced and gave myself over to devoting lots of time to my work and spending lots of time actually in Studio, my happiness with this course in particular increased tenfold (although of course, other areas of my life were sacrificed in the process). Only take this if youre truly willing to make that investment.",
                "Yes! yes yes yes.",
                "Yes! I loved this class. It was the best part of my fall term back at school. \r\n\r\nIt is very demanding. -- partially because the demands of the assignment and partially because I felt inspired/motivated/compelled to work because of my peers' commitment. This course was beautiful because of that, but also really hard to balance the rest of my classes/activities/social life with."
