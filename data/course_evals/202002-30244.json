   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I developed problem solving skills that help me approach complex astronomy problems piece by piece.",
    "I learned a lot about science in general, specifically as it pertains to astronomy (as expected). The class was very informative and well-taught. I learned about the origins of our universe, the present, and the future.",
    "I think the most important thing I've gained from this course is a better appreciation for the sciences. This course has allowed me an awareness and better understanding of the world we live in, how it was created, and the magnitude of the universe of which we are just a tiny speckle in the dust. I think that, while I'm not particularly incredibly passionate enough about the subject to pursue it further, I found it extremely informative, interesting, and invaluable, and I think that the lessons I learned in this class are something that I can always take with me going forward.",
    "I learned the key equations needed for astronomy and a solid survey of the foundations of the universe.",
    "Fun facts and some quantitative skills related to planets, stars, and space in general.",
    "I really liked the problem solving mindset that I had to step into when learning about the methods ancients used to calculate certain things like the circumference of the Earth, distances to stars, etc. It's cool to kind of step back in time and try to solve a problem using only the info that these ancients had.",
    "I learned about how stars and planets form, how distance go stars and planets are measured, where fundamental elements come from, and about black holes.",
    "I had some trouble with the mathematical aspects of this course; I took it because I needed to fulfill my last QR requirement, and I hadn't taken a QR-based class in a few years! So, I was a bit rusty when it came to the math. However, I definitely internalized most of the concepts we learned in the class; I relied on the textbook a lot because I am more of a visual learner and I was able to understand better when reading more slowly and taking notes on my own. I've also always been fascinated by astrology and practice it myself, but I wanted to understand more about its counterpart, astronomy. I don't think that astronomy invalidates astrology, or vice versa; rather, I found the two disciplines to be complementary. I think now I have a baseline understanding of astronomical ideas and principles, and although I will not be continuing in the astronomy department at Yale, I am really grateful that I took this course. I found it to be a great balance of math, science, and even a bit of language (learning about the Latin roots behind many of the terms we use in astronomy, which I loved as someone who enjoys English and other language courses).",
    "Math skills, critical thinking skills",
    "While the name of this course is \"Planets and Stars,\" it goes beyond that and gives students a chance to explore the cool things astronomers have discovered. It is a great course that sparked my curiosity and made me want to learn more about each of the topics discovered. I am not an Astronomy major, so I may not dive much deeper into astronomy during my college years, but I definitely know much nore about the Universe than I knew before.",
    "I learned a lot about the formation and explosions of stars. I now know a lot more about the solar system as well as how to perform certain calculations in astronomy.",
    "I learned a lot about the rotation and orbits of planets and how stars are formed!",
    "I have always been intrigued by space and Planets and Stars brought a better elementary understanding. I enjoyed the course material and highly recommend."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course effectively taught the basic elements of astronomy. I cant really think of any weaknesses.",
    "Overall the course was great, but there are two minor weaknesses: 1) I can think of is that the lectures required you to be in the panopto system (since lecture viewing is tracked for participation) and that doesn't allow you to navigate between tabs to take notes or anything else. 2) Discussion section wasn't recorded and only offered on one night a week, which didn't work for many people taking other courses such as myself",
    "For an online class, this course went above and beyond my expectations. Obviously there are difficulties in maintaining a class online, but I felt as if it was run very smoothly. Furthermore, the professor (and TA) were always available for help, and more than that, always willing to help. Their enthusiasm for the subject matter AND for sharing\/teaching it was a big part of why I found this subject matter so interesting.",
    "This is a great course! Professor Faison's recorded lectures are very well done and the problem sets aid learning.",
    "Moves a bit too quickly in the summer format for my liking, but overall was engaging.",
    "This course is the best online course I have taken because it was so well prepared for the online format. Prof. Faison clearly put a ton of work into filming lessons in advance. I like how there was a flipped classroom; in class, we would work together to solve problems that we had learned about in the videos before class. When classes have to be online, the flipped classroom is ideal, and Prof. Faison did a great job with that. Another strength is how organized the course was. I really appreciated how everything was organized into detailed modules far in advance; this gave me the ability to work at my own pace and work ahead when I had to do that because of my work schedule.",
    "Watching the videoes before class is extremely helpful, I think theyre very well done. The PSETS can be a bit difficult, but they definitely align well with the videoes and readings. If you struggle with math\/dont have a very strong background, and need time to process material, this course can be difficult. Because as a summer session course, things progress extremely quickly, and so that was something that was hard for me.\r\n\r\nThis course is also time consuming, and being online, somewhat impersonal, so the instructor\/TA I felt like were somewhat removed from the students.",
    "Great course!",
    "This course is very well organized and covers a lot of interesting topics in astronomy. Professor Faison put a lot of effort in preparing the lectures and lecture materials. The only weakness was the TA, who was not nearly as enthusiastic about the course as our professor.",
    "Strengths - I enjoyed the observational activity. The course was interesting and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeakness - There is a lot of content in this course and we go through material very quickly.",
    "The class was very well designed to be an online course: the lectures were recorded online which was really great for learning. Dr. Faison is also a great professor and created many opportunities to engage in the material. However, I did think some of class time wasn't used efficiently and we talked about unrelated material to the course.",
    "Strengths included the amount of resources the professor made available to enhance the course. Ease and speed of response to questions and\/or problem areas I encountered, availability of discussion group, and timeliness of getting PSets graded."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The course was fun, interesting, and not very difficult.",
    "Yes. Great course, interesting material, amazing professor\/ta.",
    "I absolutely would. I think that this course might be a little too slow spread out over 14 weeks, at least in my opinion, but at the same time I understand that some students are just not nearly as interested in sciences as I am. I found the course extremely invaluable, and what I learned in this course is something that I can always think about and share with others. Even if not directly applicable to whatever I want to do or whatever I want to study, it's knowledge that is invaluable to have and share. And on top of that, it's just interesting and fun.",
    "Yes! I took this for a QR credit and it was doable, engaging, and a fun thing to do over the summer.",
    "No no no no no. It is definitely not a gut, nor is it anywhere close to easy or even average difficulty. This class is basically astrophysics. Do not do it to yourself please I would not wish this on anyone unless you have a genuine interest in astronomy and\/or a VERY strong math and physics background.",
    "Yes, it's a good way to get a science credit. The material is interesting even if you aren't a huge science person, and the skills are not too advanced.",
    "Yes. Online classes usually suck, but this class is actually very well suited to being online.",
    "Yes, if youre looking for a science credit. Its not an easy science credit, but it is mostly straightforward, and mostly doable. Michael Faison is an okay guy, he really loved astronomy and is generally good at explaining things.",
    "Absolutely, especially for non-STEM students who are looking to fulfill a QR requirement, like myself. I think this was the best QR-based class I could have taken.",
    "Yes! Great class.",
    "I would recommed this course to literally everyone, not just students. So many people listen to NASA's announcements and discoveries without knowing how any of those discoveries were made. I think everone should get a chance to learn the basics of our Solar System, at least, and the rest of the Universe, if possible.",
    "Yes! I think it is so important to learn about the solar system and the world around us.",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone needing to fulfill a SC requirement or anyone interested in astronomy! I am very far from a STEM major but I genuinely enjoyed this class. The math in the homework was very doable.",
    "Highly recommend - engaging subject, extremely knowledgeable and passionate professor, very organized course materials, and ample assistance from online materials, to discussion sessions."
