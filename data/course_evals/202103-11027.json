Weaknesses - very assessment-heavy, depressing content (suicide, abandonment, death, murder, abuse) which is fine to read about but a warning would have been nice (I eventually had to resort to looking up wikipedia synopses before reading books to be prepared)",
                "The strength of this section is certainly Mme Koizim's teaching. She cares very strongly for her students, and being in her section has undoubtedly helped me achieve a better grade on the course than I would have gotten otherwise. There is perhaps a slightly excessive workload for this class, but in general the work is still interesting and helps develop security with the language.",
                "I believe one strengths of this course is the level of interaction that occurs between the professors and the students. Each student can expect to have a high level of interaction with the professor, and I feel this level of interaction benefited me greatly. Every day in class, I was always able to interact with the professor regarding any questions I had about the course material. One of the weaknesses of this class is that the class does meet everyday, and therefore has a very significant workload.",
                "This subject is really well structured to build on concepts, and you do genuinely feel like your French is improving. My only recommendation would be to increase the emphasis on spoken French, in addition to reading, writing and listening."

FREN 130 was such a formative experience for my first semester, especially with Mme Koizim (she's retiring after next semester though :( ) I had taken 3 years off from French before going into this class and was super worried about that affecting my performance, but she was so flexible and accomodating that after the first few weeks I really didn't have any problems integrating into L3.",
