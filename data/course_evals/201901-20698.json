    "I learned about the basic fundamentals of macroeconomics. Apart from the theoretical learnings of the course, I also felt that I learnt how to apply some of the learnings into the real world.

    "A lot about the world economically.  How the economy actually works and what impacts it.",
    "This course helped me tremendously in applying concepts learned in class to real world occurrences and to policy problems in the country and in New Haven.",
    "This is the first course I have taken with sections outside of the main lecture. The material in these sections (often formula) was critical to success on problem sets and tests, often even more important than the theory explained in lecture. It established a routine for me, a freshman, of going to sections regularly and on time.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "THE GRADING IS SO HARSH COMPARED TO MICRO! But the material is (for the most part) much easier- and a lot of the one mark questions ask about very precise facts. Like I really don't think forgetting who China's main exporting partners are or forgetting that the US grows specifically at 2% means you don't understand Macroeconomics but hey, those are the easy questions so why complain",
    "Strengths: Prof. Tsyvinski is a great lecturer. He's really funny, and is clearly a very bright guy. His slides make sense. They cover a good amount of material, and it feels more relevant to everyday life than microeconomics.",
    "The professor is an amazing strength and Piazza was a great idea to help with homework.",
    "The main strength of the course was Aleh, he found a way to make many of the topics of macroeconomics much more lively than they otherwise would be through his skillful lecturing. A weakness of the course might be the slow pacing, which could potentially be improved without too much detriment to the amount of information students can learn.",
    "I thought it was great. The lecture was great and the sections help people improve their skills and ask questions 1 on 1.",
    "Hawkins is amazing, and Tsyvinski is a very entertaining, engaging, and fun lecturer!",
    "The class was very well taught. Lectures sometimes seemed very long, but that's mainly due to the nature of the course and class time. The two sets of problem sets (online and on paper) were very beneficial to my learning. I found it very helpful to receive immediate feedback on Canvas and it reinforced the important principles of each lecture. Section was also very useful.",
    "I would have preferred to take the seminar course; I wish more sections were offered. \r\n\r\nStrength: There were ample TF and peer tutor office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course had explicitly covered the math behind the economics. For example, marginal products of labor and capital were presented as mysterious equations although they could easily have been explained as partial derivatives.",
    "More study groups to work on problems with other people",
    "This course was taught well and was extremely organized. Sections helped the most to clarify content.",
    "Lectures are uninteresting and there is little incentive to go. Section was definitely more helpful at getting down concepts.",
    "Strengths: good, funny lecturer",
    "The strengths of the course were the lectures. The lecture slides were well made, easy to read, and directly related to the material on the exams. A weakness of  the course  were the review sessions leading up to the exams. Usually there were several review sessions (on the order of 5-6) but often times only 1 or 2 of them were helpful. I think that having a plan -- and doing actual problems rather than walking in and asking to take questions -- would be useful in making the review sessions more productive in the future.",
    "Some multiple choice questions were just impossibly hard for a student whose knowledge is within the course.",
    "One strength to this course is that it forces you to consider the real world and how different policies can affect the economy. One weakness was that the lectures were sometimes hard to follow.",
    "The class is well structured and the problem sets were helpful in applying our knowledge from lectures to the questions. A weakness of this course is that I wish there would have been more practice problems in the sections of trade and calculating GDP.",
    "Strengths were that lectures were very straightforward and easy to follow. It was very nice how lectures were posted online.",
    "This course is strong in that the lecture contains ample information, but I believe that sections could be structured differently to better focus on the skillful application of material taught in lecture.",
    "Strengths: learning reinforcement through section, good organization\r\nWeaknesses: poor pset support, lack of textbook relevance\r\n\r\n Instructors waited to loo late to form pset groups via online surveys. This is something that should've been done at the beginning of the semester. Since lectures are packed with so many people, it's hard to form relationships with your peers. I felt extremely isolated in this regard and couldn't form a study group on my own.\r\n\r\nInstructors did a poor job outlining which textbook sections were relevant and which were not. I found myself confused many times throughout the semester when the chapters in the textbook were very dissimilar to the lectures. Students who read the textbook should not end up more confused than students who don't read the textbook.",
    "I think the subject matter is interesting, and am very interested in the macroeconomic theory that it explores, but feel that a more theoretical focus, and less of a practical one, would make the course more engaging and intellectually stimulating. An example could be that instead of purely focusing on how to calculate the growth of a stock, more of a focus on the theories of how the stock market works (Schiller vs. Keynes vs. Chicago).",
    "This course gives us a wide range of topics- definitely one of its strengths- however it was a large amount of information in each lecture to understand in just 75 minutes.",
    "Strengths: Excellent organization and teaching, great office hours and peer tutor hours\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "The course is very well structured and sections are very useful. Lectures can be a little dry at times, especially when there are a lot of Math formulas. Dr. Hawkins was truly amazing and the best section professor I have had at Yale so far.",
    "Strong in terms of its overview style\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, Dr. Hawkins posts so much helpful material on Canvas that it can sometimes be overwhelming, this isn't so much a weakness per se as something that I felt I could never keep up with\r\nMoreover, section should be more thorough in my opinion; I found myself not going because it was kind of useless",
    "The course needs a much stronger and more coherent curriculum.  I think it is an issue that the lecturer is not the same person as the course director because Aleh really had no reason to try to teach us in a way that we would build a strong conceptual foundation.  As a result, the problem sets were often thrown together with all of Aleh's random tangents (one of them had a whole question asking us to research how blockchain technology on a basic level which has nothing to do with econ), and I had little interest in the class.  They try all these things to try and make people come to lecture and it would really be easiest to just teach an engaging curriculum for people interested in the macroeconomy.",
    "This course was engaging since the professor engaged with the students during lecture. The office hours during the week are also very helpful.",
    "The course is very organized thanks to Dr. Hawkins.",
    "Strengths: Class sections were very helpful in learning the material \r\nWeakness: traditional lecture style may not be for everyone",
    "dont teach boring subjects like money; less weight on the final exam",
    "This course was organized meticulously. I dont think anything could be done to improve it.",
    "Weakness: Lectures are quite boring",
    "A strength is that important information was highlighted clearly and presented well. A weakness was that sometimes we moved through lecture slides quickly and it didn't give very much time to understand the information.",
    "Strength: Tsyvinski is a homie and a good teacher. 10\/10 would recommend.\r\nWeakness: It's an intro econ class  'nuff said",
    "The lectures can sometimes drag, but other than that, I really liked the lecturer and the course director. Very well run course.",
    "It is a good intro course but the models were quite basic.",
    "This course is organized very well and the lectures are fairly engaging, but I wish we did more example problems in class.",
    "Strengths of this course are the instructors, both professor Tsyvinski and Hawkins are knowledgable and passionate about the topic. They are both excellent at presenting the material in a relevant way. The biggest weakness of this course are the sections. I found that the sections were too focused on elaborating on the material or introducing new material instead of helping to reinforce the material taught in lecture.",
    "The lectures were excellent. I have no complaints.",
    "Lectures were very good and engaging. However sometimes the problems on the problem set didn't line up with the material in the lectures.",
    "Weakness: TOO MUCH INFORMATION ALREADY WRITTEN ON THE SLIDE \r\nI guess thats helpful if you dont go to lecture but then it means he goes to fast in lecture, not getting our pset grades back sooner online\r\nStrength: Aleh is super entertaining",
    "Strengths - Aleh is a great lecturer, Pset help was accessible\r\nWeaknesses - Lecture could get dry at times",
    "Strengths; lecturer was engaging",
    "You get what you put into the course. Some of the lectures are dry, but if you go to section the information will be clearer.",
    "Prof. Tsyvinski is a great lecturer! Really fun, clear, and engaging. I had Dr. Hawkins as my section leader which was very helpful, as he taught the material in a very straightforward fashion. Take advantage of the CTL's peer tutors for PSets. In the future, PSets should be due on Wednesday so that students seek out TFs rather than peer tutors, who have much less training although they are still helpful, for help completing them.",
    "The class was effective in piquing interest in macroeconomics. The class could be improved if the wording on psets was a bit more clear.",
    "Sections were helpful, psets were helpful for reinforcing concepts, info on slides was overwhelming sometimes and made it hard to know what was most important to write down",
    "Amazing resources for tutorials, extensive office hours and review sessions \r\nDr. Hawkins is the most helpful professor I've had at Yale and incredibly intelligent and available\r\nThe material is difficult but they make it approachable\r\nInteresting",
    "The strength of the course is the interdisciplinary nature of the lectures and the material. The weakness is the sometimes unorganized presentation of lectures and material.",
    "The strengths are that the discussion sections and psets do prepare you well for exams, and I never walked into an exam feeling like we hadnt learned enough to take it. The course is pretty easy, and I think one major weakness is the approach students take to the course. After every exam, my peers would hope that everyone else failed so they would have an edge due to the curved scale for econ, which is a very unfortunate and not learning-centric approach to a class. Another weakness is there were many times where I felt squashed when trying to ask questions. I think the instructors need to learn how to answer questions better without making students feel like they do not want to help them or that their questions are invalid.",
    "Great lecture teachings, but slides too long.",
    "Strengths: the quizzes, Tsyvinskis engaging lectures, Dr. Hawkins patience during section, and the use of piazza all facilitated learning in this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none.",
    "Strength: class was well structured \r\n\r\nWeakness: curve on exams can be bad when everyone does well",
    "The strengths are definitely the sections, they helped clarify a lot of the concepts that were learned. The weaknesses would probably be the speed. There are times where the sheer amount of information in a lecture was difficult to take in, especially when the professor was moving on rather quickly.",
    "I think a general strength of the course is the material (I think it lends itself well to interesting lectures) and Prof. Tsyvinski is a great lecturer. A weakness for the course, though, was the problem sets. They were long and tedious and I learned very little from them because they were structured too heavily on applications of the material, when I hadn't even practiced the material itself other than in section. Additionally, I see a weakness as the class' focus on big data. Although big data is a great tool for lectures and economics in general, I think it is important to also teach macroeconomic theory first absent big data, especially when data can complicate the material.",
    "This course was taught in a very organized way. The lectures were very informative and easy to follow and section solidified my understanding of what was introduced in class. The problem sets were also very organized and allowed one to practice relevant skills taught in the course. Being completely honest, this was one of the most organized and effective courses I have taken thus far. \r\n\r\nAs an aside, it would be extremely beneficial if Econ 115 (microeconomics lecture) could be taught and organized in such a way that Econ 116 was. It made a remarkable difference in my learning and engagement with the course.",
    "I loved the professor! He made the class interesting and light-hearted.",
    "Strengths: P sets and tests were not overly hard, if you went to class and section all questions were fair \r\nWeaknesses: None really",
    "The lectures are extremely interesting and important to go to. If you go to lectures youll be fine without further looking over concepts outside of the lectures. The material also builds upon the previous lessons and the psets are based on everything discussed in lecture or section.",
    "Strength: Prof Tsyvinski makes lectures fun and engaging. Office hours are helpful. Lecture slides are useful. \r\nWeaknesses: Not all lecture material is too relevant. Not a lot of practice material.",
    "Psets are a good length and actually help you learn the material.",
    "A well taught and structured class, it gets the job done.",
    "Strengths: the study guides provided, online pset quizzes, overall organization and Piazza!\r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the long answer paper psets were confusing",
    "Tsyvinski is an awesome lecturer who makes it easy to pay attention and stay engaged.",
    "Strengths were the TFs especially Dr. Hawkins. The lectures could sometimes be boring but a lot of the times Professor Tsyvinski made them interesting with statistics or his jokes.",
    "It does not burden students with unnecessary work. The material also makes sense and is practical to know, although I must admit, I don't find economics all that interesting.",
    "Weakness: Too large. Sections are useless. \r\nStrengths: plenty of material to practice and study for exams",
    "Strengths are the lecturer and organization of the course material. Weaknesses are emphasis on knowing details about economic history rather than trends and overall wording of slides and questions",
    "Strengths: well taught\r\nWeaknesses: study groups should be assigned at the beginning of the semester",
    "Strengths are the sections. They gave me a strong understanding of the course material.",
    "The course is well taught and well structured. The course director, Dr. Hawkins, is very accommodating and helpful. The use of Piazza is very helpful to always stay on top of things if you ever have any questions. Lectures are engaging and they utilized a guest lecture this semester which was great.",
    "The course is well taught in lecture and quite interesting. Though, many of the questions asked on homework problems and tests were poorly worded and more time was spent trying to figure out if a problem was a trick question or not then on actually demonstrating our knowledge of the material. There were lots of resources available to the class, which would be good in theory, but there were vast discrepancies in the competency of TAs, making it harder for those placed into certain sections.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Tsyvinski and Dr. Hawkins are amazing. Also got to learn some applicable material to real-life\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "Obviously the lecture is very big but I thought the discussion sections were very helpful. All the information was super organized and there lots of extra help available.",
    "Strengths: problem set quiz, frequent office hours, exam review sessions, section \r\nWeaknesses: aleh moves through slides very fast, too much material to learn for exam",
    "Lectures were usually engaging, and Professor Tsvinsky is a very entertaining teacher. Discussion sections were a good mixture of topic reviews and example questions. \r\n\r\nHowever, I sometimes felt that some of the lecture material was excessively covered, like information regarding bitcoin, the Chinese economy, or global warming. Certain parts felt over-discussed, while other more theoretical sections were sometimes overlooked.",
    "The professor was phenomenal. It was a very well organized class, the Psets were constructive, and section was helpful.",
    "It was very organized and I really appreciated Dr. Hawkins' and the TAs' vigilant upkeep with course content. The review sessions before each exam were super helpful as well.",
    "A strength is that the course provides a lot of support in the form of TF office hours and sections. A weakness would be the way content is presented to the class which is often not very engaging.",
    "Strengths are that it is interesting but the weakness is that it is a lot of memorisation.",
    "Very well structured, great lecturer.",
    "The strengths are that you learn the basic material - I'd say some of the weaknesses are just some of the test questions can be somewhat petty, in that they'll ask about a random fact about British wheat prices in 1850, which featured on one lecture slide. (Most of the questions are conceptual or model-based, but I did find these types of questions annoying). Aside from that, I thought the class was good.",
    "This is by far the most organized course I have ever taken at Yale. Literally. I have taken about 15 courses. Every course should be modeled about this course. Everything is just so extremely organized and instructions extremely clear. This is what a Yale course should look like. Dr Hawkins is very very extremely organized. Yale should hire him to hold training sessions for other TFs on how to organize a course and make sure that everything is clear. The only weakness with this course is that there aren't enough practice materials available to adequately prepare you for the exams. Some students, like myself, require an adequate amount of practice over and over to understand some concepts. With very few resources to prepare, this was a bit of a challenge. If we could have at least 6 practice finals, for instance, that would be great.",
    "Strengths: the subject matter is all very important.\r\nWeaknesses: the course covers too much, forcing the professor to have to rush through material during lecture. Students arent able to learn much from lecture as much as a result. I felt that if he focused on answering students questions and spending more Time teaching us important foundational information, we would learn more. Jay Emerson who teaches intro stats (stats 100) has a lecture style I find the most helpful in any QR class Ive ever taken. He expects us to read through the material in the textbook every week, and then focuses in lecture on further clarifying what the information means and why it matters and how its all connected. \r\n\r\nAlso, the TAs should all be good at teaching. Some TAs would go on and on during section talking about some minor detail mentioned in class rather than focusing on getting us to understand the bigger picture. Students didnt go to section as a result.\r\nMy TA was William Hawkins who is AMAZING at teaching and helping us understand why the material we learn matters and how its all connected. Every TA should learn from him. I also think he should be the lecturer, not Aleh Tsyvinski",
    "The course was very organized. The problem sets were consistent throughout the semester, and the midterm and final exams were also reasonable because students were able to access past examinations papers. There were very little surprises in terms of evaluations.",
    "It takes awhile to get a response from anyone on the teaching staff.",
    "The professor is engaging but the number of slides in each lecture can be overhwelming",
    "Strengths include Piazza, Aleh Tsyvinski as an instructor, and use of gradescope\r\nOnly weakness was the TFs",
    "Strengths: multiple components of problem sets (quizzes with unlimited tries were very helpful and productive while being low-stress), good organization (clear syllabus with accessible links, immediate posting of relevant material, constant updates), slides were very helpful and had almost all necessary info\r\nWeaknesses: timing of midterms, my TF wasn't great",
    "The giant lecture becomes long and boring and is hard to follow along. Tests were difficult and required much application. The grade distribution also seemed a little harsh. The teaching style and professor however was great.",
    "The lecture was amazing, and Aleh is very funny, but also really good at explaining things. I also really appreciated my section with Prof Hawkins, and all of the TAs that helped me through problem sets.",
    "What to review for each test was very clear. Course did a good job tying lecture topics to real-world events in a way that made it more relevant and interesting than micro was. P-sets being in two parts was a useful way of practicing the concepts and skills.\r\nP-set handing back could be improved in terms of timeliness.",
    "Professor Tsyvinski was a fabulous professor and William Hawkins was an excellent resource and course director. They made the concepts engaging and more easy to understand. The structure of the 2 midterm exams and 2 weekly problem sets was effective in solidifying topics in my mind and allowing me to have continuous application.",
    "I really liked the setup of the course. I'm a senior and the course was one of the most organized I've taken at Yale. Piazza was very helpful and response time was prompt. I liked the easy availability of files like practice tests, problem sets, and answers. The CANVAS quizzes were great ways to refresh your memory of the lecture, and then try again, and to ease you into the problem sets. I believe that there should be a scanning option for problem sets, as I was sick one day and could not manually submit.",
    "Its a very practical course that provides students with a solid understanding of the language and base theory behind macroeconomics. I feel I can now interpret more of the news and legislative action taken to address contemporary economic policy because of the language I gained exposure to in this course. The only weakness is that I wish there was more theory to learn; we got bogged down in a lot of data and all at times during which I was hoping to know more of the theoretical backing of present models.",
    "Prof. T is really good and really engaging. Section is not very helpful because we just go over problems and no further insight is given in order to truly understand concepts being applied.",
    "It had strengths in knowledge about macroeconomics. Its weakness was too much information.",
    "Strenghts: Professor Tsyvinski, many interesting topics, very useful skills, relevant information, very organized course\r\nWeaknesses: some topics were less interesting, my section was not helpful at all, not always enough problems to practice with",
    "Awesome lectures\r\nWould be happy to hear more about blockchain and modern economics",
    "The PSETs are unclearly worded and frankly useless for learning. Please give next year's class PSETs that make some sense.",
    "I thought the lectures were very fun and liked when real world examples were used to exemplify certain topics like trade. I also thought the sections were really helpful in clarifying the topics.",
    "Weaknesses - introductory economics courses are too big which makes students feel less interested or connected with the subject\r\nStrengths - discussing relevant topics like the financial systems, cryptocurrency and climate change",
    "The course was well structured, the content was very informative.",
    "This course was great! I appreciated how relevant the information seemed to current economic trends and events. I guess I wish the course wasn't on so harsh a curve. I feel like it pits students against each other which might discourage student from less privileged backgrounds who have never been exposed to this information before and therefore makes them work on an uneven playing field.",
    "There was a lot of help from the course TF, office hours, and piazza website. It would be nice if we are assigned a study group to work on things together.",
    "Strength: lots of resources\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its a lecture, so typical lecture weaknesses (a lot of people, hard to pay attention, etc.)",
    "The strengths are the organization of the course. The weakness is the lack of quantitative analysis. I wish we learned more math. I feel most of the intuition into how the economy functions could have been learned through required readings.",
    "The course is taught incredibly well, and facilitates students developing deeper interests in economics in many areas. The only thing that could have been improved is the feedback provided on psets.",
    "The actual lectures were always very engaging and Professor Tsyvinski never failed to show some sort of charisma. Nevertheless, I feel that the sections could have been more engaging and challenging.",
    "Strengths: very clear exam study guides",
    "I thought this course had a lot of excess material which was kind of unnecessary and filled my brain up with nonsense.",
    "One of my favorite courses at Yale. I wish the tests had more math involved\/graphs, so that the grades would be more dispersed.",
    "This course was very well taught, both in lecture and my section with Dr Hawkins. It was very engaging, and brought in lots of real world examples to tie in to the course. The only weakness I would mention would be that the psets could have been graded based on completion, which would have perhaps increased engagement as supposed to just attending office hours for the answers.",
    "My strength was participation in section, while my weaknesses were missing a few classes and not reading the textbook to catch up on what I missed.",
    "Really thought section was good at filling in gaps, but I found that lecture could sometimes linger on specific points a bit too long.",
    "Weakness is defiantly how focused on the United States this course is. Feels very weird",
    "The class moves quite quickly and a lot of material is covered in a short period of time.",
    "The lectures were more interesting than the intro micro lectures due to prof Tsyvinski's personality and his real world examples. (His life hacks and factoids are legendary )",
    "This course was much better than the Introductory Microeconomics class. I found the lectures to be more engaging and the PSETS\/Exams to be much clearer and better written. The lecture slides were also higher quality, and the topic of macroeconomics was more interesting to me in general. However, as with many introductory classes at Yale, this class is unable to resolve the issues and lower the barriers between student and instructor, and I found myself once again relying on self-studying in order to do well. One time it was a nice day outside and I felt absolutely no reservations about skipping class to go enjoy the weather with my friends."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Its one of those classes where the powerpoint is so good you could genuinely just skip the lectures and go to section instead",
    "I would recommend the course to Econ majors and to people that want a basic introduction to macroeconomics. Prof. Tsyvinski is greatengaging, funny, and his lectures make sense. I enjoyed coming to macro far more than micro. If you're not interested in economics, though, the material may seem a bit dry. The psets took me around 2 hours per week to do (very manageable). I also found the sections to be helpful.",
    "I don't enjoy economics very much so I wouldn't but if they enjoyed econ then yes I would.",
    "Yes, it is a relatively manageable introductory econ course that could potentially interest people who are not econ or global majors.",
    "Yes, it is extremely helpful",
    "Yes! Great organization and teaching by Hawkins and Prof Tsyvinski",
    "Yes, if your major requires it. It's interesting but I don't know if it would be worth it if not for a distributional requirement.",
    "It's not the most engaging course, but as far as I can tell it's a reasonable introduction to economics, and obviously is required for the major.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, its a great introduction in macroeconomics.",
    "This course is wonderful and provides the basic knowledge needed to understand the economy. It is worthwhile.",
    "It's a rec for Econ. Otherwise no.",
    "Yes. The material itself isn't anything special but I would recommend any course that Prof. Tsyvinski teaches. Top notch professor!",
    "Yes, it is a very good introduction to macroeconomics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to someone else because I thought that the information taught was incredibly interesting and that the ways in which you can learn were very easy to comprehend. The lecture slides are well made and easy to read and the textbook in concise and easy to read as well.",
    "I really enjoyed a lot of the topics, and definitely recommend it if you are interested in any oublic policy or economics, or even just learning things about the world or money.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is genuinely interested in economics and is seriously considering the major. I would not recommend the course to someone who wants to take it simply for the credit.",
    "Yes, I would because it is interesting and the professor was engaging during class.",
    "Yes. I really enjoyed taking this course and felt that I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend that students take this lecture course only if they are unable to get into an intro macro seminar.",
    "If you enjoyed micro, I would recommend it, it's an engaging and interesting economics class. Learned a lot about how the economy actually works and why the government and Central Bank do the things they do.",
    "Yes. I think its a very well designed course that is a really good introduction to macroeconomics.",
    "Yes, this course helped me understand the economic interactions between different agents in society from a much better perspective.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student but perhaps with the caveat that he or she might want to consider the seminar instead.",
    "If you want to study econ, yes.  Otherwise, definitely not.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student since it teaches the basics of macroeconomics in an interesting and easy-to-understand manner.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to work hard, students are competing for good grades.",
    "Lecture style classes are not for everyone, but Tsyvinski is a very likeable professor.",
    "yes, great foundation",
    "I think this course is really wonderful, and a great addition to anyones liberal arts education, whether you want to be an Econ major or not",
    "Not really. I guess if you are an economics major, go for it. But otherwise, there are so many better classes to pursue.",
    "Yes, it's interesting and is a good base of knowledge that everyone would benefit from having.",
    "Yes",
    "If someone is interested in an introduction to economics on a broader scale, this is a great course.",
    "If you are a prospective econ major and have never done any macro, yes.",
    "Yes, the lectures were enjoyable and the material was reasonably interesting. I found both professors to be excellent teachers who area always receptive to questions or comments. I would encourage this course to both prospective Econ majors as well as any students looking to gain a better understanding of how economics work on a global scale.",
    "Yes. I loved the course.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, if said person is interested in economics, they need to take this course to understand the basic concepts which they can build off of in subsequent courses.",
    "Not just good for potential Econ, global affairs, EPE and similar majors, but honestly good for everyone because learning about budget constraints is really fundamental. Its frustrating, for example, when people dont get that the US just doesnt have money to pay for everything.",
    "Yes, I believe that the course is fundamental for students who want to continue studying economics in the future.",
    "Yes I believe the material taught in intro macro is fundamental for success in several fields",
    "If you want a fundamental understanding of macro, take this course. Its more theoretical than micro.",
    "Yes! Good for basic understanding. Will be helpful for anyone, even if you have no interest in any other economics courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I learned important things about the economy.",
    "Yes, I think it is good to have some knowledge and background in econ and it is a good base to take any other econ related courses in the future",
    "yes! A great introductory course! It was well structured, the information was applicable to the real world, it was challenging but not unnecessarily... definitely take this course even as non-econ major",
    "Yes. I believe that it is a very useful course to help understand elements of our world and economy.",
    "Yes! Its a great class to dip your toes into macroeconomics and start to think about the world in a completely different way. The class is exciting and interesting, and while it doesnt make as much sense at the end because its not super well connected, its a really good course to learn a little more about how the economics of our modern world work.",
    "Yes; it provides strong foundational understanding of macroeconomic theory that is useful in further study.",
    "I would recommend this course to any person interested in macroeconomics, regardless of if it was required for a major. Some people will tell you not to take the lecture version of the class. If its being taught by Prof. Tsyvinski, dont listen to them. Take it, it will be worth it.",
    "If you have to for the major, then yes",
    "Yes",
    "I would, but only if they are considering a major in economics or related subjects.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course was recently overhauled and is extremely organized and effective at giving one a solid grasp on macroeconomic concepts. The problem sets are relevant and solidly learning from class and the exams are very fair. I would recommend going to section as well as it was also very beneficial.",
    "Yes it is a great intro to economics course. I enjoyed it far more than introductory  microeconomics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, this course was very insightful to learn about the more common and daily aspects of economics compared to other courses. The lessons are more intuitive and the content is not hard to digest during lectures. It is more interesting because it explains concepts of economics that appear in daily news.",
    "I would if they were looking for an intro macro course. No complaints.",
    "Yes",
    "Only for a major requirement. Better off just taking a trade or finance course out of interest.",
    "If you plan on doing econ or anything related to it then yes. An interesting course. Also Prof Tsyvinski is a great lecturer and is fun and engaging. They just revamped the course and it is really well structured.",
    "Yes. This course is not too difficult and the lecture format is nice. Sections are helpful.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who either want to major in economics or are interested in seeing if they might want to major in econ. I would strongly reccomend taking it with Dr. Hawkins.",
    "Yeah, for the usefulness associated with knowing the material, the work and effort demanded by the course is not unreasonably high.",
    "Yes, I think the information is important to know and the class is well taught",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend. I think that this is a good introductory course into macroeconomics.",
    "Absolutely, for any student going into economics or just looking to do an introductory course for fun, this class is well taught, engaging, and interesting.",
    "I would, but would strongly recommend they pick which TA they have for section carefully.",
    "Yes, most people have this as a requirement but its also a good course for anybody to learn more about economics",
    "Yes if they wanted to major in economics.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I think every student should take intro Econ courses to gain a basic grasp of very important topics, regardless of the major you are pursuing.",
    "If you are interested in macroeconomics, yes.",
    "Yes, as a good introduction to macroeconomic thinking. If you want to learn how things like externalities, wages, etc. should be considered on a market-wide level,  you'll like this class.",
    "Everyone who wants to study economics and haven't before would have to take the introductory macroeconomics course anyway; I would recommend although with slight changes in the way it is taught.",
    "It is a requirement but the professor is really great",
    "Yes. Definitely if it's taught by Tsyvinsky.",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn a good amount of material, the workload is really quite manageable, and it's altogether interesting. It won't take up too much of your time and the material is interesting (at least if you find econ as a subject interesting then you'll like it).",
    "Yes! Take it. Workload is very low. One pset a week which took me about an hour a week to complete.",
    "This course is very well organized and the TFs\/the head instructor is very proactive about helping and giving students materials to study.",
    "Yes, but only if the student is interested in economics because the class is very challenging and unless you have a TA that teaches well (both in section and at office hours) you will have to teach yourself the material, since the lectures arent very helpful,",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who wish to establish a solid foundation of macroeconomic analysis. I am unsure if this class is representative of other higher level economics courses, but students can definitely get the feel of what macroeconomics in general looks like.",
    "Yes, its pretty interesting and not too hard",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it because it applies to the real world",
    "Yes, it was not difficult but still interesting and handled genuinely useful material",
    "Yes; it provided a good foundation for thinking about macroeconomics",
    "Yes, it is very useful to learn what this class teaches.",
    "Yes! Great prof at TAs and lots of office hours",
    "I would highly recommend this course. You learn a lot, there is potential to do well, and the professors care about you.",
    "Probably would not recommend it unless you're taking it for your major. It's not actively bad, but you can find a better class.",
    "Yes, this course is wonderful specifically because of Professor Tsyvinksi and William Hawkins. The information and basic curriculum of the class is pretty standard to anything you will get in an intro macro class, but it was overall engaging and enjoyable because of Professor Tsyvinski and William Hawkins engaging, applicable, and very accessible teaching styles.",
    "Yes. You'll really enjoy Professor Tsyvinski's \"lifehacks\" sprinkled amongst vital economic knowledge that everyone should know, like how the Fed works and how to predict a bull or bear economic cycle. We also learn to apply our knowledge to other majors. In the last lecture, Professor Tsyvinski taught us how to price carbon emissions depending on the severity the carbon cycle and how much we value the future.",
    "Yes, you need it for the major and its actually pretty useful for your day to day lives. Macro doesnt go too far beyond the basics so you really get to understand what real world economists and academics mean when formulating policy or in academic literature. You learn a lot and Aleh is awesome.",
    "Yes. I think the topics touched upon are very relevant, work load is not too big so it is easy to balance this class with others.",
    "Yes, it taught me much about the economy as a whole.",
    "Yes, the class is not only useful, but Professor Tsyvinski also presents the information in really interesting ways that make it feel relevant and applicable to our lives. The class is definitely worth it!",
    "Yes! My favorite course!",
    "Take the seminar lmao",
    "Yeah, I think this a great way to see if youre interested in macroeconomics, even if you already took ap macro, this is a good refresher.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if they are keen on improving the foundations of their macroeconomic knowledge.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! This was a great introduction to macroeconomics, something I had never learned about before. The lecturer and team (William Hawkins, etc.) clearly worked very hard to make it an enjoyable and valuable class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I think it is a Yale staple",
    "I would say to try to avoid this course if you have any background in macroeconomics or have a strong math background. That being said you will still be missing a lot of interesting understanding into economic functioning and would need to replace this with some kind of literature.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Yes. It manages to teach the fundamentals of macro economics in an engaging way and one that makes you aware of your surroundings.",
    "If they arent an Econ major then maybe not.  This course wasnt easy and I dont know why youd take it if you werent majoring in Econ.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and engaging, and I genuinely feel like a more educated and prepared citizen after taking it.",
    "It was a good basic introduction to Macroeconomics, but I think I would tell a friend to start with an intermediate level class but prepare thoroughly by watching videos and reading some intro macro texts ahead of time.",
    "Yep. A good way to be introduced to macro.",
    "Yes. I think its overall a good course, even for non econ majors teaches so many fundamental things.",
    "Only if you need it as a prerequisite.",
    "If you're already interested in microeconomics and\/or it is a requirement for your major then yes.",
    "I would still recommend the seminar version of this class to another student, but less so than for Microeconomics."
