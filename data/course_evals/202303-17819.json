This helped me make so much progress on my research project without needing to worry about taking another course just to reach the necessary Yale College credits for enrollment. \r\nWeaknesses: I ended up spending around 25-30 hours in lab every week...it would have been nice if there were an option for a 2-credit MCDB 474 course, or an option to petition for it to count as a 2-credit course. In fact, my PI thought that I was signed up for a 2 credit course based on how much time I was spending in lab. It would also be nice if there was a mini-symposium for MCDB 474 students to present their work and see what other students were doing with their semester.",
