    "JavaScript and node.js",
    "I learned how to Google well",
    "I learned a lot about frontend web development, the different kinds of javascript libraries\/frameworks available, and more about Web Design.",
    "How to make websites (frontend and backend)!",
    "I learned the beginnings of web development: how to make a website, how to make a server, how to use APIs... I also learned a little about graphics through my final project which got me interested in graphics now.",
    "I learned about useful applications of web development! I learned how to use Vue!",
    "I learned more about web development, servers, and especially Vue. I improved my collaboration skills through the final project and was able to create a functional website that involved the digital humanities.",
    "I learned a lot of JavaScript, how to build and connect in an Express Server, and how to connect them together with VueJS. I also had the opportunity to build a web app with my peers as a final project and that was a fun experience.",
    "I learned about web development as well as different topics in digital humanities.",
    "Basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, VueJS, Node.JS. We weren't really taught these skills, we were expected to pick it up on our own or ask questions during class. We didn't have much of a formal lecture.",
    "Learned basic web development -- pretty much exactly what the course claimed it'd teach, it taught.",
    "Web development tools such as making API calls and setting up servers.",
    "Knowledge of Vue (web dev framework) and basic web development concepts. For the final project the learning is self-driven, so you can explore other languages, like React, if youre interested as well.",
    "I learned how to build websites and the different technology involved.",
    "We learned how to make a webpage using HTML, interacting with an API. We then learned how to create a server using Node.js\/Express with authentication to host that HTML webpage. Finally we learned Vue.js to create a more dynamic and pretty site. Our final project built on these skills while allowing our group to focus on areas of interest, namely music + mobile app development.",
    "Good professor, could be better at teachig certain subjects",
    "Learned JavaScript and some HTML\r\nVue framework to build front end of a website and bootstrap vue component\r\nBuild a server using node.js\r\nProduce a final product with a group",
    "You will learn about web development, front-end and backend.  The first three psets teach you this and then you will use the second half of the semester to develop a cool web based project."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness -- not very structured learning. It was hard to get started a lot of the time because we didn't always have class examples to work off of. \r\nWeakness -- the final project group selection could definitely be improved. There should've been a page where you could see what project everyone was doing, and where people could request for more group members or request to join a group.",
    "Strengths - project based course\r\nWeaknesses - I can't tell if Prof. Brown actually wants to teach us anything",
    "I enjoyed this course, but it felt a little too hands-off for me. The professor rarely actually taught us anything in class and when he did it was rarely the kinds of technical knowledge we needed to actually create websites.",
    "The psets are well facilitated to learn the skills needed to make a final project. I really enjoyed the structure of the class - we started with a quick lesson or briefing on what we should be doing followed by  time to work on assignments with TAs and the professor floating around to answer questions. To me, this is great for a CS course like this. The best way to learn these types of things is just to do it, and giving us time to do so in class helped me a lot.",
    "I wish we had met more with TAs earlier on in class... It would have been interesting to have a few TA-led sections instead of lecture a few times. The final project was a great way to learn something new and collaborate to make a multifaceted project!",
    "I enjoyed learning from hands on projects a lot. We could use a few more lectures\/walkthroughs but overall the independent nature of this course worked well for me.",
    "Strengths: There were only 3 homeworks, and we had 2 weeks or more to do each of them. This gave us plenty of chances to get help in class or at office hours. Homework 3 prepared us well for our final project. The final project was a great chance to work on a team and getting to present the projects at the CS50 fair was fun. Benedict Brown and the TAs were usually helpful and friendly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Benedict Brown did not teach us very much, and the class was almost entirely self-taught. The homeworks could be frustrating because we were not really taught the skills needed to complete them. I did not like the flipped classroom model because my group ended up just showing up to class and working on other homework the whole time, since it can be hard to work on a CS project in 1 hour intervals.",
    "Strengths - I'm super interested in web apps \/ front-end design so this was the PERFECT course for me (and for you too if that's what you're passionate about). Also, it's great to contextualize your work so the Humanities aspect really helped because it added meaning to your work. There are only 3 problem sets in the entire course (2 weeks for each) and 1 project so the workload was not overwhelming. This is a really really chill class. Take it if you're interested in sharpening your JS skills. I'm so glad I took this class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Can be a little bit disorganized, especially if the class size continues to expand. There's not much structure when it comes time to do your final project so make sure you have a good group and can self-regulate the deadlines.",
    "I gained a good understanding of web dev as well as the different technologies \/ programming languages involved. I also appreciate the amount of time that was dedicated to the final project since it allowed for more substantive work. One way the class could be improved is, during the first half of the semester, I wish we had more class time devoted to learning the different web dev topics. I also quite liked the class when we had a discussion about digital humanities, so it might be nice to have more of those.",
    "This class doesn't have much structure. If you are looking to learn a wide range of web development tools and fundamentals of web development, you won't really gain that from this course. The course relies on you putting in all of the effort by researching the topics you want to learn, rather than following a strict curriculum. I think this course would be vastly improved if students were taught a wide range of web-development topics, skills, and strategies in a more formal lecture setting. The professor doesn't really teach during lecture, he mostly walked around class answering the questions of individual students or groups. Also this course only had 3 assignments and a final project. The first three assignments essentially asked you to build the same website and improve upon it. This course didn't really focus on back-end development or front-end development, but mostly on how to use API's with and without a framework. If you are interested in full-stack development, the only chance you will get to do serious front-end and back-end work will be during the final project.",
    "Strengths: has you build actual usable web apps\r\nWeaknesses: not much teaching (not a super huge weakness, just only take this class if you're pretty self-directed)",
    "The skills we learned are very useful and the final project was fun.",
    "Strengths - the class built up to making a cool website using the Harvard database (which was really fun to learn how to play with) and also allowed time for an independent project. I liked that the majority of the class was spent on our own projects, but that we got some introductory assignemnts as well. Also, love that the final project is in a group! Few Yale CS classes are project-based like this, and I really appreciated the course format. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - some of the frameworks used don't seem up to date with the \"coolest\" tools coming out. Would have been cool to have the option use React instead of Vue on the psets, for example, and to learn Typescript (maybe make this a 376 option in the future? )",
    "I liked that there the professor gave us time in class to work on our problem sets so that we could get help from our TA's. I didn't like that this course did not dive very deep into the digital humanities aspect or into the different web development technologies today.",
    "Strengths: very chill, get to work on problem sets and project during class time, not much work outside of class. You're own your own pretty much with learning the content, but Benedict and the TAs are great resources if you get stuck, have a bug, or want more instruction. Most of the class took cs376 instead of 276, because in 276 section was required (where material was probably taught). I, and most others, opted to basically self teach the content of the class, as it was honestly probably easier that way.",
    "TAs are great, the class content can be improved",
    "Strengths: class was well organized in terms of psets, deadlines, and expectations for what the pset wanted you to do. \r\nWeaknesses: throwing a bunch of tutorials at students is not perhaps the best way to teach them how to build a website. You really need to learn everything yourself.",
    "The course is structured well and the first three psets give you a great crash course into web development if you have no prior experience. Some people had a bit of experience so they seemed to manage it a bit more. Maybe adjust some of the requirements for people with prior experience."

   "comments": [
    "If you like independent work, then yes. You just show up to class and work on your psets.",
    "Yes, if you want to do your own project. No otherwise",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they're already somewhat familiar with web development (HTML, CSS, some Javascript) and are looking to test out their skills. This doesn't feel like a super friendly environment for total beginner's if you're not able to put in a large portion of time yourself",
    "I would definitely recommend this if you are willing to put in the work. The three psets build on one project, and it's satisfying to see your website get better and better while learning new skills along the way. The finals projects students made at the end where awesome, and I loved to be able to put my new skills to work.  Great class if you want to learn web development. One of the only classes I've taken where I've made something \"practical.\"",
    "It's a pretty good class, definitely what you make of it.",
    "Yes! Especially if there is a humanities project youve always wanted to work on!",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn something about webdev and Vue, but dont expect it to provide you with all the skills you would actually need for industry. It definitely only gives you a shallow introduction to these topics. I would only take this class if you have friends also taking it so you have people to do the final project with you and help you when you get stuck on the homework. This class ultimately has very little to do with the digital humanities, so dont base your decision on that aspect.",
    "Yes!!! Take this course if you're interested in sharpening your JavaScript skills \/ want to build a project with friends \/ just want to learn more about the world of digital humanities. This is probably one of my favorite CS electives after my 4 years here at Yale! It's also a super duper chill class and very rewarding :)",
    "Only if you learn well on your own without much input from the teacher",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. As someone who had never done web dev before, I thought it was a great introduction to the topic. In addition, I liked being able to work on a final project that was very open-ended and thus could easily be tailored to one's interests.",
    "I would not recommend this course if you are serious about learning web-development skills. Only very basic topics are covered at a very abstract level. The class is not really difficult per se, but you will need to invest a decent amount of time into the final project, assuming you want to present something that is worthy of putting on your CV or resume. If your ok with creating a basically static HTML\/CSS page that incorporates external API's then this class will teach you how to do that. If you want to learn about how to write efficient, durable, scalable code for business applications, you will need to look elsewhere. You will not learn how to create beautiful sites, only sites that are just barely functional. This class is basically a free period as the professor gave only about 3 lectures the whole semester and the 3 main assignments can be completed in under an hour. I would only recommend this class if your schedule is wildly heavy and intense but you need another CS elective for the major.",
    "Yes, I learned very useful skills in this class.",
    "Yes! If you're a CS major or not, you can learn a lot about web development in this class!",
    "I would recommend it to a student only if they had no prior experience with web development.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course as an easy, chill CS elective where you get to learn very valuable skills -- HTML, hosting a server with Node.js\/Express, and Vue.js -- without putting in much time at all. It's a no-stress class, and was my 5th class while taking 323. There's no midterm and no final, no weekly readings or anything. There are only 3 problem sets, where you're given 2 weeks for each, and then a final project where you're given the second half of the class. Virtually all class time is spent working on problem sets and then the final project. There is also basically no instruction (unless you want it) -- Benedict and the TAs are great resources if you need help, but it's a pretty independent class which I liked. The grading scheme is also super generous.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but only if you want to do some self-learning and are okay with that. Do psets with friends, schedule your own times for when to progress through the psets, etc. You really do learn a decent amount of readily applicable web dev skills, but you also literally get as much out of it as you put in. There arent lectures to passively absorb knowledge from.",
    "Yes. Great introduction to web development and the digital humanities."
