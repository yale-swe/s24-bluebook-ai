    "This course greatly expanded my knowledge of terrorism, as you might expect. However the course aproaches the subject from so many different angles that the simple name \"terrorism\" doesn't do the course justice. The course covers myriad topics from social and economic issues to domestic security to religion and more.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about the overall landscape of Terrorism and the overall intricacies of the topic. Defining terrorism was the most interesting because it incorporated a much more in depth analysis and understanding of the topic as a whole. Having guest speakers in the class was one of my favorites because it allows you to speak personally with others on this topic.",
    "A great class that teaches different perspectives on a contentious topic.",
    "Over the course of the semester, you'll be introduced to a host of extremist ideologies that have bubbled up across the globe in recent years. There is a significant focus, however, on the conflict in Northern Ireland, White Nationalism, and Islamist extremism in the Middle East. You will study each strain extensively, and proceed to investigate traditional components of the radicalization (and deradicalization) process   social marginalization, economic gaps, education gaps, etc. What truly causes terrorism?",
    "Learned how terrorism is studied in an academic setting, read a lot of the research that revolves around it and had the chance to develop my analytical skills in interpreting various data.",
    "This course uses a lot of quantitive political science research to look at a pertinent current political issue. Professor Weir will push students to think critically about issues involving terrorism and help you develop a more in-depth understanding on the topic.",
    "Overview of major terrorist events with a focus on Northern Ireland",
    "Through this course, I gained an understanding of: the definition of terrorism, when its appropriate to deem an act of vioelnce as terrorism, the history of terrorism in Northern Ireland, the ways in which factors such as economics\/religion\/education affect terrorism, various counter terrorism strategies, and the intricacies of peace processes.",
    "This course expanded my understanding of terrorism as a phenomenon and deepened my way of thinking about political and revolutionary reform.",
    "We learned about the difficulty of defining what terrorism is and why that matters. We went through the various potential causes of terrorism, and how that knowledge can inform our response to terrorism.",
    "Proficient info and ways to analyze terrorism."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - great Professor with so much insight on the topic. Huge help when it came writing papers. Tremendous resource. Excellent connections with others that have personal experiences.",
    "It's a phenomenal course, and Professor Weir is exceedingly adept at leading you through the material. There is a heavy focus on reading, and she will not hesitate to call out students who state things at odds with items on the syllabus. So don't take this course if you tend to ramble your way through class discussions after not looking at the homework materials. Also, she tends to reward students who are witty or clever while they debate. And boy do you debate. With a title like \"Terrorism,\" the class draws an interesting crowd. You will likely have a healthy population of both interventionist Neocons and plenty of radical leftists. If you're not good at defending your ideological position, don't take the class.",
    "The discussions could be guided better, there could be more and clearer feedback, and there could be more accountability for doing the readings, as most people would clearly skim or completely ignore them.",
    "N\/A",
    "Very knowledgeable professor, not very easy to contact",
    "I absolutely loved the content of the course but, at time, I found myself hoping to hear more from Professor Weir. I also would have appreciated receiving feedback on my performance throughout the course",
    "This course had many strengths, including the breadth of organizations it covered, the usurpation of common understandings of terror, and the focus on statistical versus sentimental truths. Some of the lessons could have had more grounding in historical cases of terror.",
    "I thought a big strength was the amount of speakers we had. We heard from a bunch of people involved in some way with terrorism (fighting it, recovering from it, rebuilding communities, ...), and getting that kind of first hand knowledge was really special. I also really liked how open the whole class as to debating different statements, since a lot of how we define terrorism and understand its workings can get pretty subjective. I would have liked to hear a little more from Prof. Weir - I thought she did a great job of asking us hard questions and eliciting thoughtful answers, but I feel like she has a lot more knowledge to offer.",
    "The course was engaging but generally laid back. Work was very interesting and never a chore. My only critique would be that we got grades evaluated throughout the semester to see where we stand academically."

    "If you can get in to this course you have to take it. Professor Weir has such an extensive knowledge on the issue and brings in incredible guest speakers. The class covers so many topics and Prof Weir encourages students to dive deeper into the discussion and will call you out if you don't back up your points. The class covers many different aspects that relate to terrorism allowing students who have expertise in different areas go all be engaged in the discussions. This has been one of my favorite classes so far.",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting course with a great Professor. You learn so much about terrorism in regards to not just the United States but also internationally. A primary focus was Northern Ireland which was very interesting and insightful.",
    "Yes! Terrorism is a phenomenal course, and Professor Weir is exceedingly adept at leading you through the material. There is a heavy focus on reading, and she will not hesitate to call out students who state things at odds with items on the syllabus. So don't take this seminar if you tend to ramble your way through class discussions after not looking at the homework materials. Also, she tends to reward students who are witty or clever while they debate. And boy do you debate. With a title like \"Terrorism,\" the class draws an interesting crowd. You will likely have a healthy population of both interventionist Neocons and plenty of radical leftists. If you're not good at defending your ideological position, don't take the class. But, to repeat, it's a spectacular seminar and I'd encourage every Yalie to apply. It will make you reconsider most of your previous conceptions of political violence, extremism, the drivers of extremisms, and the most dangerous forms of extremisms that exist today.",
    "Not really. Felt like most of the material could be covered and learned by simply reading a few New York Times articles.",
    "Yes- professor Weir is amazing!",
    "Yes! An absolute fascinating course that addresses one of our societys most prominent challenges.",
    "This is a very good course taught by a professor with an extremely wide and deep knowledge base from whom you will learn lots.",
    "Sure, awesome class on a cool topic with a lot of great speakers",
    "Yes. Great course. Definitely take if you need a plsc seminar. Prof Weir is great."
