    "I got a lot better at carefully interpreting every detail of a piece. I also got a lot better at analyzing music with other instruments in mind, as well as listening carefully to other parts. Finally, my ability to play in a chamber group improved vastly in general, from working in a musical group to breathing together to group practicing methods, I've learned a lot about playing classical music in a group.",
    "More experience performing chamber music, and development of my music performance and interpretation skills",
    "Learned how to work better in a chamber music class.",
    "How to analyze and improve on my chamber music playing, and how to work with a group.",
    "This course helps students not only learn a work of chamber music, but also collaborate more effectively.",
    "I love this class! Its great to be able to play chamber music with such talented musicians.",
    "I've gained much more experience in rehearsing chamber music and learned more about the interpretation of chamber works.",
    "I learned how to run a focused rehearsal, in particular how to discuss musical convictions and make decisions. I became more comfortable in trusting and sharing my own interpretation. The coaching has encouraged me to more thoroughly consider the role of meter and the interconnection of piano and string writing. I also gained technical insight into, possibilities of matching articulation with piano and controlling fine articulation on my own instrument. Most importantly, I think I've strengthened my musical conviction and ensemble playing.",
    "How to rehearse efficiently & effectively (limited amount of rehearsal time), perform in front of peers & mentors, give and receive really good constuctive feedback constantly, group work in a musical setting",
    "I improved my cello playing, ability to communicate musical ideas, performance stamina, and rehearsal efficiency.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the strengths mostly lie in the fact that each group plays a significant piece in its entirety, and in the studio classes. Since each group has to learn such a long piece with multiple movements, they explore a wide range of sounds and music together, which really strengthens individual playing and the group bond. And the studio classes are really well designed; both giving and receiving feedback is helpful to analyzing music on a deeper level than passive listening.\r\n\r\nOne way the course could be improved is by maybe facilitating performance opportunities outside of class (like informal chamber concerts in a common room or something). Of course, this is possible to do within groups as well, but maybe helping to create opportunities would help open up more chances to perform.",
    "As a fan of chamber music, it is a blast to work through an entire piece and prepare it for the concert as well as hearing the work that your peers are doing as well.\r\n\r\nOnly weakness I can think of is that the performance classes often ran overtime.",
    "I don't think the class really has any weakenesses.",
    "The course is very enjoyable, and the pieces are really enjoyable. All the groups are a pleasure to listen to during the classes, even if they do run long. I think the only thing to improve on in the class is having a more diverse repertoire, with more alternative composers (unless specifically requested pieces of course). The players are all very talented and each piece comes together by the final concert, but the concerts themselves are very long and having multiple shorter concerts may be helpful.",
    "The format of the class is excellent  it is so helpful to have coachings, rehearsals, and opportunities to perform in class and hear other groups play.",
    "Great instructors and great class structure to facilitate learning.",
    "I enjoyed that I was able to work with two coaches who not only were talented musicians but also knew how to teach chamber music well.  I can't find any weaknesses!",
    "The strength of this course is the weekly coaching and the coaching faculty. My musical thinking has been challenged in many ways by my coaches. They thoughtfully assessed areas for music growth, both personally and as an ensemble and provided encouragement for tackling those areas.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved by including more performance opportunities outside of studio classes. Because of the length of music to be learned I believe that true performances opportunities prior to the final concert are underutilized, but could be very helpful and enriching to the Yale community.",
    "I really like how it's structured and think this class balances student demands (rehearsal\/coaching times are flexible) while still expecting a high level of musicianship\/performance",
    "This course design is fantastic, because it brings together the most dedicated chamber musicians at Yale college and gives them challenging repertoire along with the faculty resources and rehearsal space from the School of Music to learn it to a very high level. I have no significant criticisms.",
    "Amazing course!",
    "Best part of my musical life at Yale. If you love chamber music, audition! The members of the Omer quartet are fabulous coaches. I would love to hear their comments even more during studio class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Since private lessons only count for limited credits and you can't take them for credit all four years, chamber is a great way to play and perform at a high level. All of the students in the course are highly qualified and have great musical backgrounds, and the repertoire is challenging. There's a pretty significant level of individual commitment as well as commitment to your group and the repertoire you're playing, and you get a lot out of the course both for your own playing and your ability to play in a group.",
    "Yes, if you are a classical musician who enjoys chamber music, I don't see a reason why you wouldn't want to take this class.",
    "Yes, if you love playing chamber music take the class!",
    "For any student who is enthusiastic about playing music with a group, I would highly recommend auditioning.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to another student  its a wonderful and enjoyable way to do serious work in chamber music.",
    "Yes! If you are a musician then yes!!",
    "Yes, it is so rewarding to be able to play with other Yale students who are as passionate for chamber music as you are!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other musicians if they enjoy working in chamber music. It has been a joy to participate in.",
    "Yes! Playing chamber music teaches you things whose applications go beyond music performance.",
    "Yes! Please take",
    "100% percent! This was my favorite course this semester.",
    "Yes! If they would like to pursue intensive chamber music as an undergrad",
    "The best way for musicians to study chamber music at Yale. Fabulous coachings and repertoire."
