                "I learned a lot about Mexican history! Topics included migration patterns, education, detention, love, religion, trans histories, and activism. I learned the importance of analyzing primary sources and centering personal narratives (both in what we read and the papers we wrote). I also learned how to use the Beinecke Library because we went as a class and I now know that it's not as scary as I thought it would be.",
                "This class improved my research skills so much! For each of our papers we were pushed to research in new ways (like using the Beinecke Library or actually looking through the stacks at Sterling) which was so helpful not just for the work we were doing in this class, but in my other classes as well. Additionally, I learned a lot about the obscure Mexican American history you don't learn in high school from the excellent readings that were chosen and from my classmates discussion of the research they were doing.",
                "I learned a lot about different aspects of Mexican-Americans that continue to discriminate this group to this day. Professor Pitti did an amazing job of providing us with books of different themes to explain the multi-dimensional aspects of Mexican-American history.",
                "This course provided a range of opportunities to explore research topics and historical trends in the field of Mexican American history, rather than a broad overview. It also gives you the chance to dive deeply into primary sources, such as archives at the Beinecke, to hone your research skills.",
                "I learned about Mexican American histories and activism through a variety of lenses. I also learned how to conduct primary source research at the Beinecke and how to look for secondary sources in the Stackstwo incredibly valuable experiences."

                "Strengths: very interesting content and readings; amazing/accessible professor; engaging discussions in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes class discussions were a bit unstructured, but were still interesting; because we had a lot of reading for class, it was sometimes hard to digest it all so I would have liked more specific selections to more deeply understand the material",
                "I loved the readings in this course! It was a lot at times but unlike other heavy reading classes, it felt very worthwhile. In class discussions were also great and I learned a lot from the three written assignments throughout the course.",
                "There were a lot of amazing readings that allowed us to gain sources that we could use for our own research and analysis of other texts.",
                "The class and Professor Pitti really engage you to think about the research process and how one goes about building a research question into a larger project, such as a book. It also introduces you to some emerging and new work to the field such as the week on Trans perspectives. I think something this course does fantastically is provides you the tools to learn how one becomes a scholar in the field and hone those skills without making that visible, primary objective to the students. In short, it makes research fun! During the midterm project especially, the process made me think about academia more seriously as it was just such a fun process.",
                "Professor Pitti is undoubtedly the foremost strength of this course, as he masterfully crafted a syllabus covering a wide variety of contexts and fostered an engaging seminar environment. He was also always willing to meet and offer advice on the assignments, and he was truly invested in our success."

                "I highly recommend this course, especially to people who are interested in Mexican history or who have a personal connection. We covered a lot of topics, all of which provided great conversation. While the readings were a bit long sometimes (we read 5 entire books for this class), they were very interesting and insightful. I was very scared about the final paper, but it turned out to be really fun and interesting to write. Professor Pitti is also super kind and accessible!",
                "Yes! It was such an interesting class and despite the workload, I felt like I learned so much.",
                "YES! If Professor Pitti is teaching it take it! He is very supportive and makes sure that you understand how you can improve.",
                "Absolutely. Take any class that you can with Professor Pitti, but, in particular, seize the opportunity to take a research seminar like this with him. Also, this is a subject that receives very little attention in the rest of the History department and ER&M's courses.",
                "Absolutely! Professor Pitti is a wonderful instructor, and this seminar is a great survey of Mexican American histories that allows you to take ownership of your own research."
