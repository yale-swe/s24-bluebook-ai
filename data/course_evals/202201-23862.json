However, I do not feel that I received clear feedback in the course or that we had enough assignments for me to understand how I was doing. We had two papers in the whole course and nothing else, which was nice when I was stressed about my work, but I would have liked more opportunity to engage with the material.",

He has a very distinct teaching style. I really enjoyed the course, but if you are not good at learning in a self-directed way without many structured assignments, you may struggle.",
