I really think \"developing an intuition\" summarizes well what this course has given me: it's taught me that to effectively apply theories to real world data, one need to develop an intuition that brings flexibility to rigid theories and includes approximations.

                "The course is very interesting and engaging, and Professor Ilse puts a lot of effort in the lectures, but the course sometimes progresses too fast, so you have review the material on your own after class, otherwise you cannot build upon the material of past lectures and you start getting confused.",
                "Disorganized lecture slides and some topics are unclear",
                "The abundance of Office Hour slots was greatly appreciated. There was an enormous amount of exterior support (EdBoard, OH, the professor and teaching fellows making themselves available, practice exams, etc). The lectures were clear and to the point. The PSETs were fair assessments of what was covered in class.",
                "Great lectures",
                "The lectures were very well organized and the slides made all of the concepts clear. The TAs were good at making the sections engaging and helpful by working through actual example problems.",
                "The strengths of this course included the hands-on use of Excel in problem sets and the applications of economic theory to real-world situations. Additionally, while the derivations of some models seemed long, the conclusions helped me understand the material further. The midterm exam was difficult, but it was graded fairly leniently in my opinion, which helped.",
                "Strengths: \r\n1. Tackles difficult concepts through repetition.\r\n2. Well-structured slides and lectures that are always posted. \r\n3. Problem sets are helpful (and fun sometimes)!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1. I didn't like the order of the course -- starting with the hardest material was brutal.\r\n2. Sometimes lectures get pretty monotonous.\r\n3. I'm gonna be real, I think almost no one reads the textbook. Just worth taking into account.\r\n4. Pset grading was weird -- sometimes it was for accuracy, sometimes for effort. I worked with friends on some of the psets and occasionally got graded differently for problems we did the same way, and I get the impression grading is pretty inconsistent.",
                "The lectures were great and beneficial. Problem Sets were not very beneficial to learning. It could be improved by implementing a new form of assessment and finding better ways for students to engage with the material.",
                "I believe the professor provided the content in a transparent manner.",
                "Through on review and focus on making sure students understand course material",
                "Strengths: Very well organized, slides are clear and informative, sections are clear and helpful. If you like econ, this should not be an especially difficult course. It is curved to a B+/A- so even a slightly above average student can get an A-.\r\nEight problem sets is a fair amount, and TFs and peer tutors are very helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Even for people who like economics, this isn't an especially fun class. It's a cut and dry intermediate macro course. No surprises and nothing exciting. The course is adapted to the professor's teaching style, but almost all the material is textbook macro material.",
                "I think that a strength is the applications we learned in the real world.",
                "interesting materials and the exams were very reasonable however, the P sets could have a bit better and more relevant questions",
                "Strengths: \r\n-Exams fair \r\n-ED Discussion tool\r\n-Instructor did a great job pacing out assignments PSETs were manageable (due on Saturdays at 10pm after everyone had a chance to go to section and one break week built in) \r\n-Enjoyed when lecture content was connected to real-world examples \r\n\r\nHow to be improved: \r\n-Make sections more active learning (such as econ demonstrations, games, experiments, etc.) to foster a deeper understanding of the topic taught that week as opposed to just a repeat of only the lecture style.",
                "It was clear that lectures were very organized as professor Lindenlaub was able to fit as much content as possible while always finishing class in around 75 minutes. I appreciated that a lot of time was spent discussing the applications of course content in economic history and our current economy as students were able to understand the relevance of the material we had learned. Furthermore, I particularly appreciated the use of Excel in problem sets as Excel is also a great life skill that helps with many jobs and making graphs via Excel really illuminated the real-life application-based nature of this course. That said, because lectures were made to fit as much content as possible in 75 minutes, they occasionally went a bit too fast, and without lecture recordings, it was difficult to clear up confusion without needing to attend office hours. I do also wish there were more resources for this course, as this is one of Yale's largest lectures, yet there are significantly fewer office hours compared to some of my other lecture courses. The professor's office hours were also on Monday morning, which made it difficult for students to attend.",
                "This course was fine. If you're an Econ major, it's not bad, though it can be difficult to remain engaged during the lectures. The lecture slides are generally very good though.",
                "The course content (especially in the second half) was very relevant and interesting. The teaching was also very clear and easy to follow.",
                "I think the teacher covered concepts clearly, made sure to approach the big picture and applications with thorough care. I think the course may have been a little slower paced in the second half but it made up for it in the applicability and interesting nature of the concepts.",
                "Strengths - well-organized. The professor was very fair. Helpful practice exams and the exams reflected what she said was important/emphasized.\r\nWeaknesses - wasn't recorded. Sometimes lecture slides were a bit confusing.",
                "Just writing this evaluation to say Ilse Lindenlaub is an absolute gem of a teacher! She's engaging, clear, thorough, and was an absolute pleasure to have as a professor.",
                "Strengths: The greatest strength of this class is Professor Lindenlaub who makes the material accessible and engaging. The class is incredibly well-structured with slides and section notes available on canvas, frequent office hours and sections, and practice exam material that reflects the level of understanding necessary for the exams. Weaknesses: at the beginning of the class, Professor Lindenlaub took the time to work out derivations during class. This was very helpful, and it would be nice to do this more often.",
                "I liked this class. The content was interesting and the applications very relevant. Lindenlaub is a great professor and her slides were good. While there is a lot of content, section resources and the course organization in general made it easy to find answers quickly.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Lindenlaub is an engaging lecturer, and her slides are excellent. Weaknesses: there was too much of a focus on deriving models, and problem sets were too long.",
                "Great professor, who chose interesting topics and could teach the material well. Great section material that helped students understand the course content and let them practice problems.",
                "The professor did a great job of adapting to student feedback. As she did this, more applications were introduced and the course became interesting on another level.",
                "Strengths - content is interesting, especially the case studies and historical examples. PSETs and section were generally helpful in understanding the material, and preparing for exams. Organization was strong, and PSETs/exams are graded impressively fast. Textbook is also super helpful if you read it. Weaknesses - PSETs ran a little long sometimes. Some concepts are covered fairly broadly (still a survey course, so understandable). You are likely to have seen some of this material before at the intro level.",
                "Professor was weakness, and the explanation of the math was poor. We could derive at some point a workable intuition - but self taught methods - profs methods and lecture slides are not intuitive.",
                "Strength: extremely organized! Prof. Lindenlaub is a great lecturer and you can tell she spends time organizing the course and making sure that the lectures are reflective of what she will test us on. Weakness: this is a relative weakness, but worthwhile mentioning: there is a lot of math in this course! especially in the second half. The professor and the TA's are always there to answer questions and for guidance, but please keep this in mind. You might need to review calc and partial derivatives beforehand if you are not comfortable with them.",
                "I think the course is far too theoretical and the models don't really work. However, I did appreciate the increased use of data and real-world application in the second half of the term (potentially due to my fiery mid-term feedback).",
                "There could be more opportunities to engage with other students throughout the class and work on projects involving modern-day phenomena.",
                "Overall this was a very strong course that was taught very well and was very organized. One of the better run classes I have taken at Yale.",
                "This course spends too long delving into models when frankly its students need a robust understanding of modern Economic policy. The TAs did a great job of grading assignments quickly.",
                "The course is very well organized and the slides are easy to follow. Ilse has a very clear lecturing style, which is helpful since the course can be somewhat challenging. No weaknesses I can think of.",
                "Strengths: it is clear what is being evaluated, professors and TAs who are engaged and want to help; Weaknesses: Psets are sometimes  excessively long and difficult, explanations can be a little unclear, and the nature of the material can be questionable in its application at times",
                "Strength: very clearly organized class structure, great lecturing skills from Professor Lindenlaub, thorough inspection of diverse models in macroeconomics\r\nWeakness: the class is high-pace and there are quite a lof of assumptions for the models",
                "No recorded lectures  makes it hard for a course with such technical work",
                "Great course, great lecturer, and very interesting in my opinion. Strong class.",
                "I think that the strengths were the organization of the course and how it was structured on the syllabus. It was very easy to follow certain topics and",
                "I think the course was well organized and a strength was having a brief overview of previous lectures at the beginning of each class and the Professor going through some or the derivations in class on the white board.",
                "Strengths: Lindenlaub is a great lecturer, TF were very responsive on Ed Discussion, overall organization and communication were good, practice midterm and final were very helpful for the real exams. Weaknesses: content was too focused on math and \"modeling\" economics instead of applications",
                "Strengths: lots of office hours, relevant applications of macroeconomics to banking/pandemic/recession, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures moved quickly, problem sets tested algebraic, rather than conceptual knowledge, no recordings made it hard to review at times, problem sets were arduous, rather than being conceptually challenging. Lack of clarity as to significance of models (each model that we learned in depth seemed to be unsupported, at some level, by data we were also reviewing in class)",
                "Strengths: lectures are very clear (even though it gets fairly mathy at some points), and the TA sections are helpful if you don't keep up with all of the complex models during the lecture. Office hours are helpful for completing p-sets. Exams accurately reflect course content, with a good balance of mathematical modeling and practical intuition/application. Weaknesses: p-sets can sometimes be unclear or difficult to complete without further explanation.",
                "na",
                "Not recording lectures and poor slides put students at an extreme disadvantage to learn because professor has too much pride in that they want students to come to class. Instead, maybe consider that being able to rewatch lecture actually helps students learn. So frustrating and even after feedback halfway through there was no change",
                "Strengths  Prof Lindenlaub is a very clear and behaving professor, probably the best economics one Ive had! The TAs are also super helpful. The exams are very fair in terms of what they test. \r\nWeaknesses  no glaring ones come to mind, the course does move rather fast but after the midterm evaluation Prof slowed it down.",
                "Strengths - great lectures and decent psets\r\nWeaknesses - discussion just a reiteration of lectures, would love to see more problem-solving",
                "The course is very well structured and the professor lectures well. One weakness of the course is feedback on problem sets and exams. I felt like I knew my score but it wasn't very clear to me what I got points off for.",
                "Strength - good curve on exams, concepts can be interesting at times and relevant to the real world\r\nWeakness - hard to engage a class that large",
                "Section was helpful but lectures were not recorded",
                "Strengths: slideshows are very clear and helpful, connection to real world issues is good, goes through all the main macro concepts\r\nWeaknesses: lot of the math felt unnecessary for explaining logical concepts, wish she made lectures more engaging bc it was easy to lose focus",
                "The lecturing wasnt that good imo",
                "Lectures are bad, psets and exams are fine though and easy to prepare for.",
                "Make the lectures more succinct and make clear what material is immediately relevant and what material is secondary.",
                "Lectures could be a little more engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course are that the material was directly correlated to problem sets and tests. There was no weaknesses in this course.",
                "well organized, good stuff",
                "Strengths: Professor Lindenlaub cares about students and clearly knows what she's talking about very well, material is relevant to the real world, fair exams which test material from class AND force you to apply it, well-run and organized (lecture and sections). Weaknesses: Lectures move quickly with important information but are not recorded/transcribed. This made it difficult to clarify misconceptions from lecture or to review what was said; overcrowded Friday office hours",
                "Lectures and slides are very helpful, professor does good job of not doing math problems in class. Sections are very helpful - review difficult material and take student opinion into consideration. Could have more practice material for final exams.\r\n\r\nAttempted to instill intuition, but did so within the frame of a model. I think it would be beneficial to have intuition BEYOND these models. This seems more conducive to innovation and thorough understanding. Could be accomplished by approaching economic problems conceptually before approaching them with concrete equations.",
                "A Strength is that the slides were generally clear. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is that the problem sets were quite lengthy, and clarifying questions at office hours was not always fully possible due to the high demand. It could be improved by perhaps allowing for the pset to be reviewed during office hours.",
                "strengths \r\n-focus on intuition through problem sets, exams and sections helped us actually understand the intuitions which is very useful \r\n-clear structure of the material\r\nweaknesses \r\n- the lectures could have focused more on explaining the intuition and lecture slides should have some notes on that since it was required by psets and exams so much\r\n-the professor could solve the math in real time in class and explain it with more detail",
                "Strengths: I felt like the lectures for this course were fascinating and engaging. I loved the number of real-world applications discussed in the lecture since it made the models we were building feel very useful. There were also helpful office hours for this course.\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets were a bit long and had a lot of unnecessary analysis in my opinion. I understand that long problem sets provide lots of practice with the material, so if making them shorter is not an option, splitting up the problems into more digestible pieces would be nice. Sometimes there would be 4-5 tasks in one subpart of a question, making the problem sets seem very tedious to comb through and complete, so splitting things up and organizing would have made them easier to digest.",
                "Strengths: highly engaging lectures; interesting and relevant problem sets; abundance of support from TFs and peer tutors. Weaknesses: some parts of lectures were often too fast, particularly the handwritten derivations."

                "As a student who only took the class because of the Global Affairs requirement, I was very pleased with how much I learned from the course and the real world implications that can be drawn from what initially appears to be abstract theory. It is a smooth progression from the introductory class, though it does not fit well in the Global major. I would recommend the course, especially with the current instructor.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in international relations, trade and economics",
                "I would recommend this course to others. It is a major requirement for a few majors and not too much work. The problem sets can be knocked out in just 2-4 hours, which isn't too bad, especially if you work with friends. Furthermore, this class felt far more applicable than micro because the models felt more tangible and concrete. The math isn't bad at all, as well.",
                "Not if you don't need to take it, but if it's required for your major, don't stress.",
                "Very interesting content, but only really take the course if you have high interest in macroeconomics or for requirement",

                "No",
                "Yes. Of the Econ sequence, this class seems the most practical and important in understanding macroeconomic trends and markets.",
                "I would.",

                "This is an incredibly useful class. Anyone who wants to understand what is going on in the news and with the government currently should take this class. This gives you a solid understanding of inflation, interest rates, growth, government debt, etc.  all extremely topical.",
                "I would only if you are either an Economics major or highly interested in applications to the real world.",
                "yes it was good",
                "This course teaches valuable concepts that can be applied to real-world economic scenarios, so anybody with literally any interest in economics, especially macroeconomics, should take this course. That said, students should prepare to do involved mathematical derivations for numerous models throughout the course.",
                "If you're an Econ major and you need to take it, it's not bad, but it can be difficult to remain engaged during lectures.",
                "If interested in economics definitely. Unlike some other econ classes here, the content is highly relevant and you're forced to understand the economic intuition behind real events like the great recession and COVID-19 pandemic.",
                "Yes! Much more than intermediate micro. I think these models are truly beneficial to future understanding. I came into these courses expecting to like micro more, but I think macro was covered in such a way that increased my understanding and intrigue for the ideas.",
                "Yes - if it is required for your major. Content was very specific to the econ major so if you're just generally interested in macro maybe ECON 116 is a better option.",
                "Yes! Great way to understand different macroeconomic indicators at a high level.",
                "I would recommend this class to all students, especially if Professor Lindenlaub is teaching. I stayed engaged with the material to the end of the semester, and felt like I was learning crucial ways of thinking about current economic issues.",
                "Yes - it's a good idea to understand the economic models taught in this class, and I enjoyed learning how these models can be applied. I didn't think it was easier than intermediate micro though - there are many derivations and you need good economic intutition.",
                "If you can choose between this course and ECON 121, I would highly recommend 121 instead of this - but if you have to take this course, it is fine. The models we discuss feel contrived and not remotely applicable to real-world, but that's the nature of the class. There was too much of a focus on the mathematical derivations of models (which feels more appropriate for ECON 126), and the problem sets are annoyingly long, but the slides are helpful and the exams are fair.",
                "Yes, get to learn about macroeconomics in more depth which helps understand how the real world economy operates.",
                "With the same professor, I would recommend it. She was very adaptable and made the class very interesting.",
                "Yes - a pretty solid course overall, I would recommend it even if it wasn't a major requirement.",
                "If you need to fill an intermediate level, I understand macro and Fed information is more interesting - I like it too - but micro was also interesting and a better structure. This course gave a few headaches with the unreasonable math and curveballs that did not correlate with our lectures, or they were thrown in for fun, her psets were also too long for weekly deadlines.",
                "Yes! If you are an econ major, you obviously have to take this class (or macro theory), but I honestly would recommend it to anyone who meets the prerqs. The material is extremely interesting, and while it was challenging at times, I definitely walked away from this class with a much better understanding of the economy.",
                "As a required course, it's not bad. I think the content is actually quite interesting. Lecturer and lectures were good. The Psets can be interesting. The textbook is a useful supplement for class, and luckily the syllabus lists corresponding textbook chapters.",
                "Yes, if they are looking to get a more nuanced understanding of the basic macroeconomic theories and concepts along with their mathematical applications and derivations.",
                "Only if required for your major. Intro Macro would suffice if someone is interested in Macro.",
                "Yes, it allows you to better understand the interaction between consumers, government and monetary policy.",
                "I think for a student seeking to fulfill the intermediate economics requirement of the Global Affairs major as it is fairly grounded in policy compared to the alternatives. That said, outside that context I would not recommend this course because it spends too long on models that have little relevance outside of academia.",
                "Yes, even if you arent required to, you learn some cool models about real world phenomena. The content feels applicable and youll learn a lot about the economic background behind some recent world events.",
                "I would recommend. This is a necessary course to understand government policy and economics as a whole. Also professor lindenlaub is amazing.",
                "Generally a requirement, honestly would encourage others to possibly consider 126 (and be thoughtful about which is a better choice); 122 gives an overview to macroeconomics with generally understandable models. The models can quickly lose the simplicity that makes them so powerful, and the problem sets can often quickly become dense and calculation-heavy. Still a good course with lots of caring and engaged TAs",
                "Yes, it is definitely a necessary class for economics majors, preparing the students well for modelling skills and thought procedures, as well as for the overall understanding of the field",
                "Its a requirement",
                "If a student is an Economics major than they must take this class. The material at times didn't feel that interesting but could be necessary if you were interested in Central Banking. I probably wouldn't have taken this class if I was not an Economics major.",
                "I would not recommend this course to anyone who doesn't HAVE to take intermediate macroeconomics, but the reason this course is bad is because of its curriculum and not Lindenlaub. She is a great lecturer, is really good at tying the theory to applications, has super clear slides, and the class is organized very well. Unfortunately, the material in this class is difficult and often frustrating to study. The economic models we learn about are very math-y for no reason and literally summarize the entire economy into one variable; I don't think my understanding of economics improved that much over the semester, although my understanding of how an economy of two people and one good can be modeled by math did. Overall, the content of the class is not great but taking it with Lindenlaub will make it better.",
                "If you have to, or as a prerequisite. As an intermediate economics class, it's not the most enjoyable, but it certainly is useful as you progress through your major or other prerequisites.",
                "Yes, a great introduction to understanding economic modeling and policy decisions.",
                "yes",
                "Yes! With prof Lindenlaub",
                "Yes, its a requirement of the econ major and also more enjoyable than intermediate macro. If you can take it with Prof Lindenlaub you should!",
                "Yes, it is a great way to learn more about fundamental economic concepts, theoretical and applied.",
                "Yes, if you want to pursue economics further.",
                "If you're an Econ major, you have to take it\r\nIf you're Global, I would consider ECON 121 (less math)",
                "This is a fantastic course: Ilse's lectures (particularly the \"whiteboard\" breaks) are fantastic, the teaching team is excellent, and the problem sets and exams are interesting and fair.",
                "Yes if you're interested/have to take macro, it's a good overview, though personally feel like it doesnt add that much beyond intro macro except for the math behind things - wish lectures could have been made more engaging",
                "Yes if they are an Econ major",
                "Yes very good course to help with critical thinking skills.",
                "If you need it for your major.",
                "I would. It is required for the Econ major, and the material is relevant across the economics curriculum.",
                "One of the most relevant economic courses to understand what is going on in the world.",
                "Econ major requirement.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because it helps you understand the equilibrium on a deeper level.",
                "yup gotta understand macro",
                "Yes- it is important to understand the macroeconomy. The material in this course is challenging but I felt like the TF's and Professor Lindenlaub really cared about us and our learning, which I appreciated. I would recommend going into it realizing that each Pset will be challenging, but you'll leave with some valuable insights and a feeling of accomplishment at the end.",
                "Yes, for an economics major or other major requiring the course. Not the best at instilling intuition, so hard to find greater benefits beyond that.",
                "Yes! Most people are in this class because it was a requirement (including myself), but I really enjoyed this class. The lectures are interesting and engaging, and I felt like I understood the world better after taking this class.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to gain an understanding of how economics is connected to virtually every other subject."
