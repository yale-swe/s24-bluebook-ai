Since in this course, I learned about how to apply the history of classicism to interpretative contemporary arts, I can use this skill of critical thinking in future classes.",

I want to use my job to solve issues in the real world and make wise judgements by using my knowledge of the subject area. The ability to think critically and analyse problems will help me approach problems methodically, and my enhanced communication skills will help me persuade colleagues and clients of my views in an effective manner.",
