                "This class was a fantastic introduction to the world of Pasifika studies and the issues facing Pacific communities in a wide range of angles. This class taught me to think critically about the various systems and institutions in place, and consider how we can approach them in a postcolonial midset.",
                "I learned so much about the Pacific during this course. All topics that I have not heard about or learned before. It was invaluable knowledge.",
                "While the content of the class was AMAZING, my biggest takeaway from this course was the academic environment. The professor's teaching style coupled with the emphasis on peer-interactions made the course so enjoyable and accessible.",
                "Through this course, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the Pacific as a whole, as well as develop new perspectives on key issues surrounding the Pacific such as militarization and gendering of Indigenous bodies. Overall, I was able to form my own opinions on such topics, as well dive deeper into areas of interest surrounding the Pacific.",

                "This class was very unique. The reading chosen by Professor Hobart were highly engaging and covered a wide range of topics, allowing us to experience topics in several diverse areas.",
                "This course covers such deeply interesting and emotive topics. It was taught in a way that made us see how interconnected Pacific issues are with so many different regions and issues. I really loved how we were able to pick a topic that we were interested in for the final project.",
                "This class was structured fantastically and the assignments were all very engaging and called upon us to use both critical and creative thinking. I have no constructive comments for this course.",
                "This course was great! The readings were engaging!",
                "This course was overall amazing. The content and readings were very relevant and manageable. The assignments and projects felt intentional and reasonable. I think this course could meet twice a week but only because I wanted more time with the content, professor, and my peers.",
                "The strengths of this course are that it provides students the opportunity to learn about the Pacific through different mediums that many have not yet studied. As well, it exposes students to a variety of issues surrounding the Pacific, and focuses on more than just studying Hawaii.",
                "Strengths: well organized, lots of room for creativity\r\n\r\nOne thing I thought could be improved was the range of the course  I honestly thought it could be larger and we could discuss more ideas.",
                "Strengths: This was a fantastic course. Professor Hobart is kind and always willing to help, the readings and course materials were engaging, the class environment was nice, the assignments were creative. Weaknesses: none!"

The workload is very reasonable and the readings are so good that you actually want to take the time to read and discuss them.",

                "Definitely! This is a rare opportunity to focus on the Pacific at Yale.",
                "Without a doubt, take this course. Professor Hobart is brilliant, fun, and witty. Even though class was at 9:25 in the morning, it was such a joy to be there."
