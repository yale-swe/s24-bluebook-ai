If you've taken 305, this class might seem like an overlap given that you've done Lebesgue measure, but the two courses overlap only near the beginning of the course. Besides the theory of integration is done over abstract measures spaces, and the Lebesgue measure is simply a special case - so I'd think it's worth seeing again. There's also no harm to reinforcing your knowledge either.",
