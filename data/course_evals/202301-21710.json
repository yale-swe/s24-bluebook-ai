                "Basics of pathobiology and applications to certain body systems.",
                "In this course, we explored topics in cell damage\/death, cancer, renal pathology, neurological disease, gastrointestinal disease, and pulmonary disease. Each topic was taught excellently, and I gained an even deeper appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the human body and its molecular underpinnings. I also developed a better clinical intuition. I am a premedical student, and this is the closest I have ever come to applying my knowledge to a medical context. This experience was intriguing, rewarding, and incredibly fulfilling.",

                "Pathobiology topics including basic concepts, neuropathology, renopathology, cardiovascular pathology, respiratory and gastrointestinal pathology. I learned how to evaluate symptoms and observed an autopsy which was a rare opportunity.",
                "The class gave a general overview of various biological systems and possible diseases we may encounter.",
                "This class was so interesting! It was a lot of memorization about the different diseases of each system that was focused on, but following memorization of the hallmarks of the disease, the clinical application questions were interesting and answerable.",
                "I gained learned the molecular and cellular processes of different pathologies during this course and how to critically diagnose human diseases.",
                "This course closely mimicked what I expect medical school courses to be like (as they are taught by med school professors). It taught me how to narrow down potential diagnoses based on the symptoms of a patient. It also helped me learn how to differentiate between different diseases, frame the questions, and understand the workup of diagnosis.",
                "Learned about the pathology of the body systems, and had the opportunity to see how autopsies\/tumor boards were performed.",

                "I loved that this course did separate blocks for different organ systems.",
                "Its an amazing course, but it is incredibly dense. The lectures feel like the professor is just constantly throwing information at you and you kind of just have to absorb it all. Its really interesting stuff, but it does take a LOT of effort to learn it all, especially since this class only has 5 tests that comprise your whole grade.",
                "Strengths: broad survey and team taught. Quite interesting material overall! \r\nWeaknesses: lack of consistency throughout exams. Kidney lectures were quite dry and structured poorly. Did not receive exams.",
                "I deeply appreciated how this course was organized. The 5-block system let us explore a variety of topics without sacrificing depth. The exam structure (1 exam every 4 lectures; curved; non-cumulative) made the high content load manageable and allowed students to focus on each block without worrying about studying all of the other blocks simultaneously. The content itself was fascinating, and the teaching team was excellent.\r\n\r\nThe only change I would make is to simplify the renal disease block. The corresponding exam was easily the most difficult, and many students (myself included) found it difficult to differentiate between all the forms of disease presented. In future years, it would be helpful to simplify the module and present fewer, more distinct diseases.",
                "Strengths: excellent professors, fair exams, interesting and clinically-relevant content compared to most MCDB courses\r\nWeaknesses: never received exams back, some units were better organized than others, somewhat memorization based",
                "Strengths: interesting material and well-organized class with engaging professors.\r\nWeaknesses: exam preparation is solely dependent on slides and TFs, exam content\/degree of detail expected is not always made clear.",
                "The course covered the most important systems of the body and was very clear in teaching objectives and the instructors were all experts in their fields. However, the wide breadth of the course came at the cost of depth which was acknowledged and we did not get into any developmental pathologies.",
                "The class was well organized but because each professor brought his or her own lecture format, there was variance in how well the lecture notes prepared for exams.",
                "A lot of the material was memorization, and in some units with functionally more challenging pathology, the lecturing was not super helpful to learning the material. The way each unit began with structure and functional overview of the system was super helpful, and the disease reviews and treatment courses, with public health impacts at the end was a comprehensive and interesting way to learn.",
                "This was my favorite course this semester! I particularly enjoyed working on the last exam which was a case study. I think adding more of these assignments (can also be done in groups) would be really useful and helps engage the students more.",
                "Strengths: all the content was incredibly engaging and had clear examples, the TAs were also fantastic, opportunity to see an autopsy and tumor board were also unique and very insightful, the order of the blocks were also fantastic and made logical sense\r\nWeaknesses: some of the lectures would go very into depth in anatomy or physiology whereas others don't, so it was a bit difficult to keep up with at times but not a major weakness",
                "All the content was enjoyable, and tests were very fair. However, due to the nature of switching professors after every block, the teaching style wasn't very consistent.",
                "The modules of the course were very interesting and well-structured. It was nice to focus on one topic for a few weeks and be able to dive into it. The exams, however, were pretty detailed and required a lot of memorization to do well",
                "Overall, this is a good course for students interested in medicine or pathology.",
                "Strengths: Block exams, as there was less content to know for each exam. Opportunities outside class, such as autopsies and tumor boards, which put the class content in context; the last exam was great because it forced us to look into the literature and rely on the principles we learned. Weaknesses: Sometimes, the lectures did not go into that much depth (particularly near the beginning), which led to vague questions on the exam that were difficult to answer in the way they wanted.",
                "This course was my favorite STEM course at Yale. It incorporated very interesting course material with engaging lectures. One challenge was the continuous rotation of professors. Each exam was very different depending on the professor that block so it made it very difficult to know how to study and what information to focus on. We also did not receive any guidance on grading which made it hard to know where you stood.",
                "Some professors were very quiet, only read from their notes, never answered questions well and also made lecture recordings furiating to watch by walking away from the mic\r\n\r\nAlso I hate having to be constrained to two sentences answers. For the second exam, we were told that we were writing too much, but we could NEVER GET THE TESTS BACK TO ACTUALLY SEE WHERE WE IMPROVED. Forgive my outburst, but this was extremely frustrating to knownthat we were being told that we were doing something wrong, buy never was able to actually see what we did wrong."

The course material is complex, but they present it manageably.",

                "Yes! if you're interested in clinical medicine this is an awesome class. If you are looking for a good grade, or grade security, perhaps not. there are five exams, all different, and those are entirely responsible for your grade.",
                "I would totally recommend this course to all my friends (even if they are not premed).",
                "This was my favorite class at Yale so far (second semester junior). It was incredibly engaging and thought provoking. It was because of this class that I considered being pre-med again. It's a special class at Yale\/in the MCDB major in that beyond just memorizing different diseases and symptoms, you are actually applying the information that you have learned. You have to piece together information and come to conclusions on your own in a way that challenges you to understand what you are learning about. It also taught content that is very intersectional with other MCDB classes. I highly highly recommend this class.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning about pathophysiology this class will give you a good review of the pathologies of the body.",
                "Yes! Especially if you can credit D it. It was an awesome class and so interesting. Not something most think about when envisioning med school, but was a super helpful supplement",
                "Yes, especially if you have a strong background in biology and an interest in medicine\/pathology.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone considering medicine as a future career. The best part of this course is that all of the professors are physicians, so they are able to contextualize the course content.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in how disease manifests at the molecular and macroscopic levels. I found it to be a course that integrated lots of important concepts from biochemical pathways to larger organ system concepts.",
                "Yes, but I will tell them that although they tell you not to memorize all of the terms, 50% of the quizzes will be pure memorization. For example, during the cancer block, we were told that we did not have to memorize certain genes, lists of cancer hallmarks, etc. The very first question was \"What are all 10 hallmarks of cancer\". Two questions later, \"What is a gene that predisposes one to cancer\""
