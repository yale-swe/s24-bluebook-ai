   "comments": [
    "I learned how to actually write an essay, analyze literature on a deep level, and draw connections between texts.",
    "It introduced me to seminar discussion format, to drawing connections between disparate fields, and to writing good. Less about specifically what we learned than how we engaged with each other's ideas. Good time.",
    "This course has given me a better understanding of the inseparable nature of science and the humanities, and how to use tools from both fields in my own work.",
    "I learned how to think critically, make connections, and most importantly, write better! I also learned a lot about both scientific and philosophical\/humanities concepts.",
    "Improved our writing skills",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for both science and the humanities by taking this course. This course also forced me to consider questions I never thought to ask, and it exposed similarities in the two fields that I did not know existed.",
    "This course primarily taught me how to better organize my writing. I also gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for postmodernist literature.",
    "I learned how to look at the science and the humanities and the intersections between the two with a more open-minded perspective. For instance, we would look at how metaphysical detective fiction was similar to patient diagnosis and other unlikely connections like that.",
    "I developed more knowledge about the connections between the science and humanities. I also developed insights of the quantum theory and the process in which doctors make a diagnosis.",
    "My academic paper writing improved massively. This was largely facilitated by one-on-one meetings with Prof Bilsky that each student was required to complete with each essay submission. I learned to manage a higher volume of reading and make  connections between two seemingly disparate works."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course vastly improved my writing. Before taking this course, I was never taught how to structure essays properly. This course also helped me read texts more closely by drawing deeper interpretations. The course also effectively explored multiple genres of literature and helped me understand the authors' thought processes. However, I think this course was falsely advertised in the course search. The description in the course search implied that this class would have a philosophy slant to it, but in reality it's just an English literature class. In addition, the homework was slightly unbalanced in that we had the same amount of reading due Monday and Wednesday. For reading due Wednesday, we would have only two days to do the reading, but for reading due Monday we would have five days.",
    "Overall great and interesting! Could have been more focused at stages, but that probably would have defeated the purpose of the things. I'm no fan of reading quizzes but of course that's not a reason to end them.",
    "This course was much more focused on the applications of the humanities in STEM fields than vis-versa, but that was probably because most of the class was part of a STEM major. While the class was highly useful and enjoyable, one way to improve could be to add a little more discussion about the applications of STEM in the humanities.",
    "This course was amazing. Prof B is such an engaging and knowledgeable professor and she does her best to guide discussions and help students arrive at conclusions on their own rather than spoon feeding you information, so you really learn how to think, which I appreciate. The readings are amazing and eye opening even if they were a little difficult sometimes, and you receive thorough and detailed feedback on your essays.",
    "The strength of the course definitely sided with mini-class discussions; when the whole class was put into discussions, people would repeat what others had already said and would talk for the sake of talking sometimes. Felt too artificial. Wish we could've done drafts for some of the essays too rather than just submitting the paper without initial feedback.",
    "I think the strength of this course lies in the daily class discussions, which were very insightful and engaging. The only significant weakness I saw was being assigned longer readings when there was less time in between classes to complete them.",
    "Strengths: the professor was very accessible (very eager to meet with students); classroom discussion was enjoyable; required readings were interesting \r\nWeaknesses: some of the worksheets completed in class were repetitive and could have been replaced with more discussion",
    "I felt like this class had a very high workload in terms of the readings, and although the text was mostly very interesting material; for books that were more dry like Quantum, I felt like we could have read shorter sections or skipped certain sections in order to mainly focus on the key ideas we wanted to relate to other novels.",
    "The strengths of this course are the discussions that we have a out the moves that we have read.",
    "Great course. Students looking to fully take advantage of their liberal arts experience should take this class connecting science and humanities can benefit us all and its part of why I can to Yale in the first place. My only critique is class discussion at times felt a little unproductive, but given this is a seminar class it is more the students fault. Sometimes I would exit the class, havent taken notes throughout the class, but still questioning what I learned in the discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was intellectually stimulating and taught me valuable skills for academic writing. I would advise other students to be aware that it is a literature class and not a philosophy class.",
    "Yes! The subject matter is pretty much designed to be broadly compelling at every stage (e.g. skating over quantum mechanics and relativity with just enough to go \"whoa\" but not enough to bore the non-STEM-minded). Lots of interesting discussions. Good time. Dean B is great.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone going into a STEM field (especially medicine) that wants to have a better understanding of their purpose or wants to make sure that they are not completely submerged in pure STEM classes and rhetoric.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in either of the titular concepts (science and the humanities). This class will teach you how to think about the world and certainly informed my current worldview. It was extremely impactful and you will take away a lot from this course.",
    "Yes, this course is fantastic! A lot more philosophy than I was expecting, but it opened up a lot of interesting avenues for discussion",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in the topic, but I would warn others that this is not a philosophy class. This is ultimately a writing course that is focused on literary analysis.",
    "Yes I would. This course is challenging in content but highly rewarding. It helps give context to the liberal arts education that many institutions embrace. More generally, it makes insightful connections between two seemingly disparate realms.",
    "This course encourages you to think critically about literature through new lenses. It creates helpful links between the sciences and humanities.",
    "Yes. I think this course is good for a student who wants to take a intensive writing course and is generally interested in the study of modernist and postmodernist literature.",
    "Yes, I think that the content of the course itself is extremely interesting and important to students, especially those who plan to specialize in a \"humanities\" or \"science\" major. We look at what each field can learn from the other in a cool way, and it's a very student-oriented, discussion-based class, which also makes it pretty fun.",
    "Yes. I thought the readings provided a great topic of discussion and allows a person to look deeper into various novels. It brings up questions that you normally would never think of."
