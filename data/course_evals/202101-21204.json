I came to new conclusions about African Americanness  what it means, who fits the definition, who does not, what benefits does that definition bring? It was interesting to question my previously held beliefs and try to put myself in conversation with other authors.",

The course had a good balance of readings from both the past and the present, so I learned about how African Americanness has changed throughout the nation's history and what the consequences are of having/not having the label of \"African American.\" I learned that the definition of \"African American\" is complex and that we probably will never come to a consensus on what the term means and who it includes and excludes. And I learned about where the term originated.",

                "2 strengths were the amount of discussion and collaboration in the course. We always had opportunities to ask our peers for ways to improve and help each other with our writing and critical thinking. This kept me much more engaged in the course than if I had just been watching a lecture. There were not many weaknesses in the course that I can think of  our readings were interesting and relevant, our coursework was manageable, and Professor Smith was extremely available and helpful to us all.",

                "This course ran smoothly throughout the semester. Professor Smith is amazing.",
                "Strengths - the reading was interesting, the papers were chunked into manageable pieces, the small size of the class lent itself to interesting and engaging conversations, the extra credit\r\nWeaknesses - Seeing no improvement in my grade from the second paper to the third paper (big research paper) was kind of disheartening, as I put in lots of effort to apply the corrections from the second paper. it made me wonder whether my writing actually improved",
                "I thought the texts we read were extremely interesting and thought-provoking. The only weakness I can think of would maybe be to vary what we do in class more  we had the same type of discussion almost every class, occasionally doing different exercises and activities. I enjoy the discussions and have no problem with them, but it could be more interesting/get more people to participate if we did some of those exercises and activities more."

Additionally, while improving your writing, you can engage in fascinating discussions about racial identity, politics, economics, and history with your fellow classmates. It was a great opportunity to get to know my peers better and share a part of myself with them.",

                "Yes, my favorite class at Yale so far. I learned things in this class that I think are actually important to current events at Yale and beyond. I'm not the biggest fan of writing papers, but because the subject material was interesting, writing the papers was not that painful. We talked about very interesting and monumental material, and I'm leaving this class with a newfound interest in Black Studies and also with better writing skills.",
                "Absolutely. The texts we read are not only going to make you a more critical reader and writer, but they will likely bring entirely new insights into your life and make you consider questions you haven't before. African American history isn't taught much in high schools, and so taking this as a first-year or sophomore I think is extremely valuable. I now can't believe how many things I hadn't been aware of due to these gaps in my education. Would definitely recommend if you would like to become a much stronger writer, closer reader, and more knowledgeable and aware human being."
