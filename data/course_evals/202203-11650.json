However, we had an incredible time traveling to Finland over break and it was one of the most unique academic experiences I've had at Yale - definitely travel if you get the chance - and the professor was incredibly supportive and open to feedback throughout.",
                "Strength: Professor. He was great!! Always flexible to student wishes and direction. His list of contacts was extremely helpful and he fostered a great capstone community.",

                "Strengths - the sky is the limit with the capstone. With all the funding and connections Jackson has to offer, you can really dream big. We went to Finland and had a great time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - \r\nIt's so funny because the presentations feel like Yale kids think they have the answers to really pressing world problems... but we don't. \r\n\r\nWe didn't have a client, and I feel that that was a really core part of the Capstone project. The professor had said that we were going to be working for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), but that was really just part of a competition for the DHS, which we ended up deciding not to do, because it could limit what we do with our capstone. \r\n\r\nCommunication with higher ups in Jackson was really difficult - we didn't know how long our presentation had to be until 2 days before."
