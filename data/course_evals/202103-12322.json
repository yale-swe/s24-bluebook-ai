                "Close reading the textbook to further information gained from lectures, general chemistry knowledge.",
                "A basic and general knowledge of chemistry (very entry-level friendly and no background knowledge needed).",
                "Expanded my existing knowledge of general chemistry, while also learning new concepts such as lewis dot structures, thermochemistry, polarity, and intermolecular forces.",
                "Dr. G made me feel poorly about myself. I was at office hours with him and he made a comment to me saying that \"the smart kids just get it faster\". I felt like he was calling me dumb, and I was hurt and frustrated by this. I have not spoken to him about this but I told Josie. I was trying so hard in that class and at the end of the day I just had a hard time and he didn't help me succeed. He said things like \"you aren't thinking correctly\" when we didn't understand a concept instead of trying to find another way to explain it. I hope that next semester is better. I'm upset that this class was intended for students with little chemistry experience, yet it was an extremely difficult class. That makes no sense. \r\n\r\nI have learned more chemistry than I ever did in high school and I am proud of how much knowledge I have gained. This was a very difficult course for me because I only have a small amount of experience with chemistry. I was definitely not ready for it at the beginning but I slowly got caught up to speed. I learned that I should have taken advantage of the extra time available to me because of my ADHD and I will do that starting in the spring.",
                "I developed a working knowledge of entry-level chemistry and strengthened my logical reasoning skills.",
                "I learned the fundamentals of chemistry as well as how to practice and study chemistry. I found the material to be not that challenging, but when it came to test taking, there were always minor details that were important to remember in order to get full credit, and memorization came in handy for some units. It was crucial to practice, and I felt that the homework and discussion section problem sets, Achieve assignments, and review sessions were close to sufficient to be prepared for a test, but it was helpful to practice on my own.",
                "I think this course gave me a good base in chemistry that I will be able to build upon.",
                "I learned the fundamentals of general chemistry.",
                "I further developed not only my knowledge in the basics of chemistry but also understood why things happen the way they do. Dr. G did a great job making sure we were always engaged in class and I never found myself memorizing terms, instead I was always trying to understand why I was doing something in the first place. I found out I actually enjoy chemistry and even when certain topics were challenging I liked trying to solve\/make sense of them.",
                "I learned how to solve complex chemistry problems that included several parts by breaking down the question into small problems. It provided me a solid foundation of chemistry.",
                "I learned basic chemistry",
                "This course is a great introduction to Chemistry. Starting with simple equation balancing at the beginning of the semester to learning the shape and bond angles of molecules at the end, all of the topics we covered were not only important but intriguing.",
                "I was able to get a good overview on basic chem. It was similar to what I had learned in high school but with an extra layer of complexity especially at the end of the semester",
                "While taking this course I have developed a stronger understanding of how to apply and interpret various components of chemistry. My comprehension of scientific questions and theories have also broadened to understand the interdisciplinary applications of chemistry. Lastly, I have learned how to better navigated Science, Technology, and Math at Yale.",
                "I learned how to critically think and approach problems.",
                "I learned how to think critically about the fundamental concepts of chemistry and how they relate to the real world. This class made me realize how ubiquitous chemistry is in our every day lives, which makes the content in the class more meaningful and memorable. As the first science class I have taken at Yale, this class has introduced me to the demanding rigor of science classes at Yale and taught me what it takes to succeed in STEM classes.",

            "comments": [
                "The tests were too short (in time given) for me to accurately demonstrate my knowledge of the questions.",
                "Strengths: clear structure and organization, very helpful homework \r\nWeakness: Time was not managed efficiently during certain periods of the semester which made it seem as if there were times in which more time was dedicated to some chapters and not enough to other chapters.",
                "Strengths: the size of the class was beneficial to my learning because I was able to ask more specific questions. The small size lecture also helped combat the issue of varying high school chemistry knowledge since everyone in the class was put in the class for a reason.\r\nWeaknesses: at times, the pace was a little bit too slow. For instance, we were scheduled to complete chapters 1-10 but did not end up covering all of the concepts in chapter 10 because it was reading period by that time.",
                "One strength is the small class size, it encouraged us to ask questions. Dr. G was also willing to help us during office hours or we could send him an email if we needed help with something. Some weaknesses were the number of experiments that Dr. G showed us. I felt like it was kind of a waste of time because he would rush through the material in order to get to the experiment. This wasn't helpful because I didn't know the material well enough to apply it to the experiment he was showing us, and he also wanted to impress us instead of trying to teach us. It was also frustrating that I didn't have enough time to finish my exams because they were very long compared to the amount of time we were given. I know dr g gave us an extra 10 minutes, but I found myself rushing through each test, and I didn't perform well as a result.",
                "I think that the course content is at an appropriate level for the class. The class could be improved by slowing the pacing slightly and putting more emphasis on working through practice problems in class.",
                "I liked the smaller size class as a opposed to a lecture because I felt comfortable asking questions and I appreciated that my classmates felt the same way because I could learn from their questions. I really enjoyed Dr. Gs demos- a strength was being able to see the science we learned about in real life. There could have been more interaction with peers and engagement, but as the class was pretty short and we also had discussion section for that, I think it was fine. I wish I had more feedback on the homework. Problem set submission stopped being required and I had no feedback on the types of problems that were on the tests, so there were some things that I would get points deducted from just because I never realized I was making a mistake.",
                "The demonstrations in class were helpful especially if you learn by example, but sometimes they prevented us from going in depth on material that required more time. As someone who has never taken chemistry before this class, the small class size was helpful.",
                "I think the course was structured very well in terms of the class time followed by discussions. I do think this course could improve in helping us synthesize the material better.",
                "This course was very engaging and it was clear throughout the semester that Dr. G was very passionate about teaching chemistry. This passion was clearly conveyed through his teaching and experiments\/demonstrations, but there were times we did not finish all the content that needed to be covered.",
                "Strengths of the course were the demos in class, a surplus of review practice including psets, practice problems, the achieve questions, and the extra exam review worksheets. Dr. G was always available to meet one on one and he explained topics in a clear way. Things that could be improved include consolidating what we did on our own and in class. A lot of the times the textbook reading is simply a repeat of what we previously learned and sometimes we don't even go over half the topics in the textbook.",
                "The strengths were definitely the smaller class size since it allowed for more questions to be asked between student and professor. The demos were also so helpful in visualizing the actual chemistry we were studying. A weakness was the fact pace in which new material had to be learned while also studying for a midterm on past material at the same time.",
                "The strengths were the demos, practice problems that weren't for credit, and the access to office hours. Weaknesses were some of the teaching style.",
                "This smaller section is great for the students who didnt have as much chemistry experience in high school. The structure of this class allows the students to ask for help and and get attention much more easily. I hope this smaller section continues to be offered because it is such a great opportunity.",
                "There were a lot of demos which were very fun! I also think that discussion section was a huge helpour TA frequently held review sessions. It was nice that this was a smaller class because there was definitely more collaboration and discussion. Lastly, the slides helped with knowing what would be on tests. Dr. G is very passionate about what hes teaching and that Carries through.",
                "This course does well in exposing student to the introductory components of chemistry and explaining some of the concepts that back rudimentary applications of how matter undergoes chemical change. There are limitations to this course because it is the introductory level or the concepts were not considered important because it could not be shaped into a valid question on exams. The class could be improved by allowing students to applying knowledge in multiple ways such as research projects and exams that allows for a further expansion of knowledge.",
                "My strengths were taking the time to study and go over problems, but my weakness was asking more questions.",
                "Strengths: extremely engaging teaching, content was taught in a clear and thorough manner, excellent demos, abundance of academic support in and out of the classroom\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets should have been made optional at the beginning of the year as we already had achieve work to do",
                "The workload was overwhelming at times. I felt that if the homework was lessened I would have more time to focus on the notes and really learning the material. It could be improved with offering a pre-course review for students who would like to get a head start."
