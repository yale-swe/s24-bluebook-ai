                "Strengths: - Very well organized material, clearly flows and you can see how each week fits in with the previous week\r\n- Weekly discussion posts seem to be optional (about half the class did it the first week and by the end only one person was posting) so that's a strength or a weakness depending on your perspective\r\n- Course is not especially writing intensive until the final paper. The first paper was 5-7 pages, final proposal was 2-3 pages and final paper was 15, so roughly 25 pages total, which is probably average or less than average for a history seminar.\r\n- Professor Peterson gives very good written feedback and is very available for office hours!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some students clearly did not do the reading :( \r\nProfessor Peterson is kind and generous and did not call people out on it, but it meant that each week, about half the class was very actively participating and the other half was staring at their laptop screens",
                "strengths: informed me well about the historical origins of the constitution and therefore gave me a better understanding about the birth of the united states. Because of this, i feel like a more informed aware and active citizen.",
                "Strengths: Highly engaging teaching, very helpful and specific guidance on writing, and excellent syllabus structure",
                "Readings were good length, important parts were sometimes highlighted which was useful. We had good in class discussions, with supplamentary stuff on the projector such as maps or other documents relating to the readings."

                "This was an excellent courses taught by an amazing history professor who is at his best in the seminar mode of instruction. This course had so many \"aha\" momentsif you care at all about American legal history, the U.S. Constitution, or what a \"constitution\" is, this class is for you. You should take this course if you are looking for a history research seminar.",
                "Yes! The professor is incredible and the material is interesting.",
                "Yes - I am not a history major, but I like US history and this was a very manageable class. You do not need to be a history fanatic, and you don't even need to be interested in every single reading. If you've ever wondered where the Constitution's text actually came from and what the authors were thinking and debating when they wrote it (and really their forefathers going back to 1066), take this class. \r\n\r\nAlso, Prof Peterson is clearly very interested in the course material and is actively writing a book on it. So one advantage of this course is you get a professor who loves his job, loves teaching, and is very good at balancing narrative (explaining the history and how A --> B) and class discussion.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind: It's not Con Law with Akhil Amar. It is much more history-based rather than legal interpretation or court cases.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in United States history or politics. Your understanding of the US will grow with your understanding of the constitution's history.",
                "Yes, definitely. Fascinating material and a great professor",
                "This course creates a great foundation for understanding how constitutions are formed and work, specifically the US Constitution which is especially interesting, what actors are involved, how the states argued over certain clauses, etc."
