                "No weaknesses! Only strengths. I love the class. The setup of the course was like a flipped classroom, where we practice more with speaking and listening in class and do grammar at home. This was very helpful. We also learned a lot about Turkish culture with the cultural events. The best language course I have taken at Yale",
                "Nothing it was perfectly structured and changes were made to accommodate the students. Cannot ask for more as a student.",
                "Strengths: During class we practiced reading listening and writing skills. Class was fast paced but she was willing to slow down to write or spell a unfamiliar word. End of week asynchronous quiz was extremely useful in testing our knowledge. Asynchronous decreased the stress factor and let us focus on studying. Loved the cultural showcases we had after every exam. We also had access to a tutor who we could meet up with to get extra help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More structured grammar practice could be useful. Much was provided but a little more would be nice",
                "This course is strong because it encourages several different forms of engagement with the language, from cultural activities to methodical grammar lessons. One way it might be improved is if there was a compiled resource for the grammar rules with examples that students could refer to."
