   "comments": [
    "I learned how to write an essay about personal experiences and views and how to incorporate writing techniques we read into my own essays.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of writing and effective strategies for a variety of essay genres.",
    "I learned how to read deeper into the text and improve my own personal weaknesses with writing.",
    "The readings were very interesting and Prof. Shirkhani has very good insights into them. She also gave copious and excellent draft feedback.",
    "I came into the class comfortable with my own writing, but uncomfortable with my skills in reading and annotating others' writing. This course has turned me into someone who is 100% comfortable doing those things, and it has improved the quality of my own writing as well.",
    "I developed my writing skills and how to write objectively and learn to write by reading and learn to read by writing.",
    "How to write with purpose.",
    "I learned so many essay writing strategies and techniques on how best to get my point across to the reader. What we learn is never overwhelming but by the end of the semester you realize we have a whole arsenal of strategies to choose from.",
    "I gained an immense amount of knowledge and skills in essay writing in this course. I learned how to write a cohesive and coherent essay, which accurately expresses a message or point. I had an enjoyable time writing essays about things of which I am passionate, and learning how to share my thoughts with others in a creative way.",
    "I learned why people say that you become a better writer through reading. We learned how to study how someone writes. Amazing class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Amazing course for learning about writing and  strengthening your skills. I felt like the class would have been better if it was a tad smaller in size, but other than that it was still excellent.",
    "The course is composed of curated texts that are honestly really interesting. But most importantly, it's taught by my favorite teacher here so far, which makes the class so much more enjoyable.",
    "I thought that the discussion in class very seldom became an actual discussion and was most often Prof. Shirkhani individually calling on students and then individually responding to her (albeit excellent) questions. Therefore, quality of class would range widely. However, I found writing the essays and reading the sample essays rewarding. Prof. Shirkhani can tend to be harsh and very opinionated but I think her feedback was productive.",
    "Strengths: the class size is large enough that there are a variety of voices and inputs, but small enough that everyone knows each other's name and, by the end of the course, has a small amount of familiarity with everyone's writing styles. It feels like a community.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I wasn't completely sure of what I was supposed to be \"looking for\" in the assigned readings, but that may just be my own issue and not the course's.",
    "Strengths of this course is that is very engaging. Weakness is that its really easy to get lost in terms that sometimes I didnt understand what was being discussed in a reading and theres not always enough time to throughly have it explained to me.",
    "Very engaging, students were all interested.",
    "Strengths: everything we learn is super helpful and the majority of the readings are really interesting. Weakness: some readings are long and I didnt love them all.",
    "The strength of this course is the vibrant discussion and peer review. I loved reading my fellow students' essays, sending reviews, and discussing them in class. This not only improved my technical writing skills, but also improved content and clarified how my essay would be received by a general audience. Our class was supportive of each other, and I loved taking part in it. Professor Shirkhani was great at guiding class discussion and hearing everyone's point of view.",
    "I loved the pieces we read and the ones we wrote. I think that the writing assignments should be suggestions but not needed to be followed as seriously. Sometimes I found that my teacher cared more about answering the prompt than the piece itself."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!  If you need to take a formal English course or you just haven't written in a while and would like to get back into it, I highly recommend!",
    "If you are interested and confident in writing, definitely. However I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a gut WR, as this course is still a bit of work and it won't be easy if you are not confident in your writing.",
    "If a person wanted to improve your writing and critical thinking skills, I would highly recommend this course. It leaves you with a positive impression on writing if it was initially day thing to you.",
    "I would, but I would warn that the course load was fairly heavy. If we were not writing a new essay one week, we would be revising a draft. I also think your enjoyment of class time would depend pretty heavily on who was in your class. I think it did help my writing and, overall, encourage dme to write more creative non-fiction.",
    "Absolutely; if you feel relatively comfortable with your own writing currently, this course will definitely take it it up a notch for you.",
    "Absolutely. It changed my perspective on creative writing.",
    "Yes, it gives you a good insight into writing.",
    "Yes! Super helpful and important for anyone curious about essay writing or creative nonfiction in general.",
    "Yes! This was a fun and enjoyable course that was intellectually stimulating and filled with interesting content. The freedom in writing topics is both challenging and fun.",
    "Definitely. amazing class and learned a lot"
