                "Strengths: Nabokovs literature is so intellectually stimulating and beautiful. Marijeta is also kind and supportive. Her one on one appointments are very informative and she always makes herself available for her students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its easy to feel lost if you dont come from having read other modernist texts. Proust and Joyce are name dropped so casually and modernism as a topic is explored from day one.",
                "This course is unbelievable for many reasons. Its small size and the weekly reading discussion posts enable the class to grow extremely close, where classmates are learning from each other as much as they are from Professor Bozovic. Further, Professor Bozovic's incredible balance between having slight moments of lecturing (when revealing dazzling points about Nabokov's novels) but then the space she carves out for in-depth, remarkable discussions strikes my ideal classroom balance. The only weakness of this course was that sometimes I felt too much reading was crammed into the semester. I would have preferred to have one less book on the syllabus, so we could have spent more time reading Ada or Ardor (which we almost skipped over).",

                "Definitely! Marijeta will give you incredible feedback and make you grow as a writer.",
                "I would most enthusiastically recommend this course to another student. For anyone interested in Russian Literature, and more particularly, humorous, deceiving, experimental works, this Nabokov class is perfectly curated for them. My appreciation for Vladimir Nabokov skyrocketed in this course, where I learned how literature can be written in radically new ways that then act as a genesis for a next generation for authors. I think everyone should once in their life take a class like this one, which shows how literature can be transformed into different genres of art and media that both destruct art as much as they create it.",
                "Absolutely. Amazing dive into Nabokovs canon and the works he inspired. Wonderful lectures and discussion. Clear and fair feedback.",
                "One of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Marijeta is so kind, engaging, and knowledgeable about her field! All of her critiques were fair and constructive. Nabokov as an author is unlike any Ive ever read before, so so so much fun!",
