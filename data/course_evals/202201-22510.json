                "Strengths:\r\n- I love the subject and the use of classroom discussions as a jumping off point for deeper and richer discussion. I hope there are more disability studies courses at Yale\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-The class was not well organized and it felt like it was trying to market itself as something it wasnt. Its cross listed as American Studies, but the expectations within the class seem to be that people would treat it as an English seminar only and not a multidisciplinary class\r\n-There was often too much reading assigned and the readings themselves were not screen reader accessible which is disappointing for a disability studies class\r\n-The professor was often hostile to the perspetives of students in the class when they differed from his own, often cutting people off or even yelling at them. I noticed this to be a trend, particularly with women in the class.\r\n\r\nOverall: \r\nI value the fact that disability studies is being taught in an interdisciplinary way at Yale, I just wish it were taught by a different professor, who was disabled themselves and more empathetic to students. In a class reading, we talked about radical openness and rejecting rigidity in favor of accessibility and accommodation. Its deeply ironic, and truly unfortunate that this class was not executed with those same principles in mind. Instead of thinking about how his actions of yelling at students during class, interrupting fruitful class discussions, and devaluing peoples experiences might put a damper on classroom participation, Professor Berger blamed students for not engaging in the kinds of discussions that he wanted to have.\r\n\r\nMany people in the class had done outside reading or had independent interest in disability studies for their future careers or life goals, and it was so nice to have a community to explore the topics together, however the syllabus mostly featured white and often privileged perspectives, and the professor was at times unpredictable in the ways that he would react within discussion. This made the classroom feel like a hostile environment for learning. Outside of class, students would chat, text, and email about events/articles they found, and this seemed to be the real learning I did in the course.\r\n\r\nThe assignment expectations were very vague and seemed open ended, but when students turned in their assignments, Professor Berger seemed to be upset that we had not fulfilled that we had not fulfilled expectations we didnt even know he had and asked half the class to do substantial revisions. Since the class is graded based on two assignments and participation, this was particularly frustrating. Additionally, Professor Bergers behavior in office hours and in class towards female students sometimes involved loud outbursts of yelling and saying things that felt completely inappropriate--racially and politically. Theres an obvious power imbalance between teacher and student that was never reckoned with, and it made for an uncomfortable dynamic.",
                "Strengths - foundational texts about disability studies in the syllabus; however, currently the syllabus is set up non-chronologically, but I think it would help students to know at the very beginning of class about disability \"theories\" there are in literature (serves as useful basis for thinking about analytical essays) via reading the foundational texts, and then proceeding chronologically. We never had the opportunity to really think and share and discuss about genetic testing and the future of disability",
