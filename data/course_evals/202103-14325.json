                "I learned how to think! I had never gotten the opportunity to engage so deeply with such important texts.",
                "We read major philosophers from Plato through Aquinas, Major schools of thought covered were Platonism, Aristotelionism, Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Scepticism. I came away with a wealth of foundational knowledge about each schools' most important beliefs and, more importantly, the skills to perform philosophical analysis as a means of evaluating specific arguments",
                "How to write a philosophy paper, how to read/debate philosophy",
                "How to write philosophical analyses, how to read philosophy, how to deconstruct an argument, and how to put different philosophers in conversation.",
                "First of all, I got an introduction to philosophy, which was almost entirely new to me. This class taught me how to write a philosophy paper and develop arguments better. Also, I have a much more reflective view of many of the themes we returned to over the course of the semester. Lastly--and I admit that this is kind of a strange thing to learn--this class showed me how little I really know. Seeing how much more there is to learn, as well as learning to question many of my beliefs, was one of the most interesting insights I had during the course. I've come out of the class as a more curious person.",
                "I learned how to both structure arguments of my own, pick out an argument structure from a difficult text, and to check the argument from soundness and validity.",
                "In this course I learned how to deconstruct arguments, make sense of them, and point out their flaws. I also learned to express my thoughts clearly and logically through writing in a way that I didn't before. I also got a good overview of philosophical schools of thought from classical antiquity and the middle ages. Having to parse through these sometimes difficult texts taught me not only about the philosophies themselves, but also improved my reading comprehension.",
                "I learned how to read texts that were written in a style that I had never read before. I also learned how to develop an argument and how to dismantle others arguments. I learned how to ask questions to classmates and collaborate.",
                "I developed philosophical analysis skills in my writing and in a seminar setting. I learned the steps to evaluating an argument and determining what it is saying and whether or not it is valid to suggest such a conclusion. I learned two fundamental questions that can be used to potentially challenge any philosophical argument which are does this necessitate that and can a further question be asked to expose an infinite regression. In terms of writing I learned the importance of clearly setting forth the argument so that the rest of the analysis can be neatly organized and easy to follow.",
                "I learned a lot about how to evaluate and break down arguments, as well as how to analyze different premises and conclusions. I also developed a greater understanding about the evolution of philosophical thought from Plato and Aristotle to later philosophers, especially as religion and philosophy were synthesized.",
                "How to craft and follow a philosophical argument. The viewpoints of various philosophers and how to refute the arguments they make. Where ideas of justice, piety, nobility, courage, god come from and how we communicate to each other."

                "Strengths -- David is a brilliant professor, and I wish I could have picked his brain for hours on end!\r\nWeaknesses -- the class was often not as organized as it could have been, and the same few students were often recognized to speak first every time",
                "I loved this class. The section discussions were always extremely helpful and interesting, and the lectures were excellent for creating a foundational understanding.",
                "The reading list is fantastic and the papers prompted me to think deeply about philosophical questions and to draw connections between the views of the various schools of thought and philosophers. Reviewing for the final with my other DS friends was when I truly realized how much we'd learned. My only suggestion for improvement would be that we read more philosophers who are women and that some of the section leaders be women. This course, while great, is completely male both in who we are reading and who is leading our collective thinking",
                "Strengths: made me think, great introduction to philosophy, broke down difficult concepts well, definitely improved my critical thought\r\nWeaknesses: due to the curriculum, we moved through everything very quickly. Would have preferred to spend longer on each work",
                "Strengths: lots of attention on Plato and Aristotle, trains students to defend/attack arguments, good overview of major philosophical schools of thought, and strong faculty\r\nWeaknesses: everything after Plato and Aristotle felt somewhat rushed (we spent one week total on Epicurus, Lucretius, Epictetus, and Seneca, for example) and lectures often summarized our readings (which was helpful for finals, but wasn't very engaging after we had just read the books)",
                "The class was intellectually challenging, and the content was really stimulating. David's teaching was definitely the best part of the class. However, doing the readings and simply learning the basics of philosophical analysis felt very motivating as well.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness was that sometimes class discussions could feel a little repetitive. This was not always the case though.",
                "I absolutely loved it! I wish we spent more time on some of the readings though. Overall it was engaging, amazing, and I learned so much.",
                "Its main strength and weakness contradict one another. We cover so much content, which is great, but we also don't spend nearly enough time on some authors to fully absorb them.",
                "If I were to pick one thing, I wish discussions were just a little more focused. Especially during Aristotle, I personally felt lost after certain discussions as I was left wondering what I was supposed to gain.",
                "A strength of this course that matches the other two subjects of Directed Studies is the amount of material covered and breadth of philosophy read. It does not teach every single philosopher before the Renaissance, but it certainly introduces some of the most significant and inspirational ones. The main weakness I can identify is that very little time is given to some of the philosophers, meaning little to no revisiting is done to perhaps see how perspectives have changed about previous thinkers. I also think that the last final weeks of the course crammed in so many philosophers that little worthwhile analysis was actually done. It just seemed like a presentation of their arguments.",
                "The seminar discussions were critical in how this course functioned, and I really enjoyed how different people approached questions with varied frameworks of understanding the problem(s). I quite enjoyed how there was a good mix of puzzling through a particular question as a class, and directly learning about different approaches to understanding the question.",
                "A lot of philosophers are covered and the reading is mostly really interesting. Lecture was also very engaging and worked well with seminar."

                "Yes! This course was easily my favorite I've taken at Yale so far. Excellent material, excellent teaching.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who enjoys thinking about other people's radical ideas and the argumentation behind them. Every school of thought covered has a unique take on the following immense and stimulating questions: what is consciousness, what is the soul, what is a human being, what is happiness, what is the good life, what/who is god, what is existence, what is death, should we fear death, and many more. It's fascinating to wrestle with the questions and the answers provided by astounding thinkers.",
                "Yes. David is extremely prepared for class and the curriculum is very enriching.",
                "Yes. Especially for students interested in philosophy or even just somewhat curious. When authors or Professors reference Plato, for example, I know that I have at least a foundational understanding of his ideas. It's also influenced the way I approach life (the Stoics, for example, had some great pieces of advice). The course makes you think deeply and requires you to evaluate arguments, which is a great skill to have.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student for sure. It was definitely challenging, but exploring big ideas with others in this class was one of the most rewarding experiences I had last semester. It was very engaging.",
                "I would 100 percent recommend this course to another student. Im a much better writer and thinker because of it.",

                "I could certainly recommend this course. It covers a lot of philosophers and a vast amount of philosophical arguments. It s a great overview, and the combination between lecture and seminar is perfect."
