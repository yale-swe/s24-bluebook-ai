                "I gained the framework and knowledge needed to evaluate contemporary European economics, politics, and policies.",
                "Learn a lot about a wide variety of topics crucial to the EU, from its inception to today",

                "The guest lectures in the class were great, as well as the discussions and readings. I feel like we could have spent a little less time on logistics and could have gotten grades back a bit faster.",
                "Strengths: Material and Marnix's teaching; getting to revise the policy memos definitely helped learning; great guest speakers; Weaknesses: we didn't get any indication of our grades until the day of the Cr/D deadline, would have been nice to get a bit more feedback on psets/first policy memo. Also not a huge fan of group work tbh but not a big deal, overall would still recommend this class if the material interests you! Also would suggest maybe adding a weekly canvas post assignment where people post questions/short observations about the readings so that more people stick with the readings.",
                "This seminar was very engaging and there was no shortage of discussion, ever. Professor Amand is the real deal and is an expert on this topic. He was patient and creative, willing to entertain students ideas and re-explain confusing topics. The course does involve a lot of reading which improves your learning tremendously if you do it, but can sometimes be a bit more than manageable. The format of the final oral exam was also pretty intimidating and isnt necessarily a good fit for all types of students. Finally, Professor Amand didnt return any grades through the semester which can be difficult for some students, though he did let everyone know how they were generally doing before the Credit/D deadline. If youre excited to learn about the topic and engage with the class, it will be a fantastic experience.",
                "The instructor was extremely knowledgable, passionate about the subject, and made the material extremely interesting with masterful storytelling. Readings were comprehensive and interesting without being overly burdensome. However, we did not really receive any feedback on our psets or second draft of memos.",
                "S: The professor is an expert in his field. Also really enjoyed the guest lecturers. Discussion in class is great and the final (oral) really makes you understand the topics covered\r\n\r\nW: Not as much feedback on the HW and Memos",
                "This course is awesome! Professor Amand is the best and a huge strength of the course. The only weakness was a bit of a lack of feedback regarding how you were doing in the course."

                "Definitely!",
                "Absolutely. Great class if this subject is of interest to you",
                "Absolutely. This is a very engaging seminar if you are even remotely interested in economics or the EU. I was not well versed in EU politics, history or economics before the class and came away with a much better understanding. However, this class isnt a gut - you have to attend, participate and do the readings.",
                "I would highly recommend it for the instructor alone! The EU will be an increasingly large player in the world, and not enough attention is being paid on the organizational body.",
