   "comments": [
    "I learned about the basis of intro psych: consciousness, social interactions, human cognition, child development, etc.",
    "I learned how to process information quickly, synthesize my notes, and think about general concepts and themes. I was also able to hone my writing skills and work on delivering a concise argument.",
    "I gained a lot of general knowledge about the field of psychology (as expected from an introductory course), including developmental and abnormal psych. We were able to study both how modern media conveys psychology (in popular newspapers and magazines) and how the professional scientific field conveys it (in published journals).",
    "I learned the basics of psychology as a distinct field from other sciences, the ways in which it aligns with both hard and social sciences, and how each of its major subdisciplines functions in the world of both science and everyday life.",
    "I developed a wide range of psychological insights into myself, particularly in decision making and judgement.  I found this class extremely helpful to make clear the biases we all face.",
    "Broad understanding of psychological sciences",
    "I learned the fundamentals of Psychology, and read a lot of psychological research papers.",
    "I learned a broad array of psychological topics and how to apply them to my everyday life.",
    "Good overview of the operations of the mind.",
    "I developed a basic insight to the different areas of psychology.",
    "Basic knowledge of the human brain and how it works. Topics included memory, personality, social psych, abnormal and clinical psych, developmental psych",
    "Great insight to the field of psychology in past discoveries and current applications.",
    "I learned so much in this course, from components of the brain and their function, to heuristics, to evolution, to psychology experiments and methods, as well as relevant connections between psychology and the real world. I have a solid foundation on psychology now and feel very content with what I have taken away from the course.",
    "I learned how to contextualize my scientific knowledge about the brain into a broader course on psychology",
    "I gained a rudimentary understanding of psychology, both in regards to the brain itself and how ones mind forms from the connections and activation of neurons in ones brain. I learned some of the history and terms central to psychology, and some basic ways the human brain works, such as biases, heuristics, and memory.",
    "This class gave a very good introduction to the most important topics in psychology and what a psychology major might expect for future classes. Even though the topics were very broad, we covered a lot of really interesting material within each one.",
    "I think I received a good introduction to computer science.",
    "I learned how to understand understand others thought processes as well as analyze others interactions. I also learned about the modularity of the brain and the different parts that are involved in our behaviors\/abilities. I learned about development and how humans brains mature and learn through experience.",
    "Knowledge: general overall knowledge of psychological concepts. Skills: got better understanding of how to concisely summarize academic findings and make concise arguments based on those findings.",
    "This course was a fantastic one. I learned a huge amount about how the human brain functions. My TF helped me become more concise in my writing and build my confidence when speaking up in class.",
    "General overview of psychology and introduction to psych research design."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Professor Yarrow is an amazing instructor. He makes the class discussion very engaging, despite concerns that the level of discussion wouldn't be as great for an online class.",
    "The strengths of the course are the clear lectures, engaging material, and highly qualified professor and TAs. The weakness of the course is the past, but that is not something that can be changed.",
    "I really liked the lecture \/ online balance of this course, but the flipped style made it difficult to ask questions about the writing assignment or lecture before having to submit the assignment. I think this could be improved by having the writing assignment due the day after the corresponding lecture (not the day before). In addition, my writing assignments were graded weeks after I submitted them, and some of them were never graded at all (although this is the fault of the TA, and not of the general course).",
    "The lectures are highly engaging and effective in communicating the material in a memorable and interesting way, and in-class discussion could be very thought-provoking and engaged. However, it was often too easy for a few loud voices to dominate in-class discussion, and some system to ensure that more voices were heard more often would not have gone amiss.",
    "Its strength is the vast number of applications and examples provided during lectures.  It never felt like I was being told but instead being shown.  I didn't find any particular weaknesses",
    "Prof. Dunham and the TFs were great",
    "This class was amazing - the structure easily facilitated learning and was engaging. It could be improved by more timely feedback on the writing responses.",
    "More feedback on writing assignments.",
    "I thought that the course was very well organized. The only weakness was grading... we received grades in the comments on our assignments but never actually HAD grades entered.",
    "Lots of material and very broad, which can be good and bad",
    "Great pace and straightforward homework. Loved the class",
    "Strengths: enthusiastic and informative professor and TFs, great lectures, very well organized, discussions were insightful, and I felt like the learning environment allowed me to learn challenging concepts and discuss them\/ask questions. The readings were helpful and helped connect many key concepts from the course. \r\n\r\nWeakness: None.",
    "it was online....flipped classroom was good but I felt that we could not discuss adequately as the group was always ~20, limiting discussion.",
    "Lectures were interesting and the response questions were a good way to review. However, I think that section was too freeform and didn't actually help me understand the material more unless I had specific questions. We often went off topic and talked about things that didn't seem directly relevant to the course.",
    "I think this course was a good introduction to psychology but sometimes I feel that the material was not condensed in any way.",
    "A strength of this course was having all of the lectures online and providing us with pset questions in advance to allow us to begin them early. A weakness was that the zoom classes were solely conversation based. I feel if the professor dedicated 20 minutes of the class to do a brief overview of the lectures we had watched that week to highlight the important points, it wouldnt been helpful.",
    "Seminars were a bit odd: it's a lecture course, so I was a bit confused why we had so much time set aside for Q&A in section.",
    "I think some of the course was a little but con using as it jumped around a lot. I assume this cannot be helped as it is an intro course.",
    "The online lecture sections were largely based on student questions, and often times the questions had minimal overlap with the actual course material. The sections should be more lecture driven and less q&a.",

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course because psychology is a field of study that really applies to many disciplines. It may explain human behavior in a social context, as well as the human brain from a science perspective as well as human motivation from the economic perspective.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this to another student if they could only take it in the summer. I really enjoyed the course and would've preferred to take it during the year.",
    "Yes, it was an extremely interesting and well-taught course! Professor Dunham was so engaging, kind, and helpful, and my classmates and I were able to have really interesting discussions during the online portion. In addition, I was able to gain general knowledge about the field of psychology, which is useful even for non-psych majors. Psychology allows us to better understand ourselves, others, and the world around us, and this course has radically changed by worldview and the way I interact with modern events \/ media. This course has given me interesting articles and info to discuss with my friends \/ family outside of the classroom, and the chance to learn from a professor who is incredibly eminent in his field.",
    "This course is a very effective way of learning the content, and the fact that interspersed reading responses allow for synthesis of that content mean that retention and understanding remain high. However, the final can be overly specific, and preparation for it was minimal. Overall, I would recommend to someone interested in the content on a deep level, or in the lecture style, but not someone with a passing interest.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student at yale, particularly those for whom psychology is not a topic they are particularly interested in.  This course is both engaging and beneficial for evaluating your own decision making and views of the world",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who has an interest in learning Psychology. If you don't enjoy the course topic, then learning the material can be difficult (because there is a lot of memorization involved).",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yale student - it is a great introduction of psychology that requires no background knowledge.",
    "Yes. If you are interested in learning about the mind in a fun and lively manner then take this course.",
    "yes",
    "I'd recommend this class to anyone who's never taken psych before. You learn a lot about human experience and nature through the material",
    "Definitely, I loved the course and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes! This course is very insightful and you will learn a lot. Professor Dunham and the TFs are phenomenal. The course has some challenging concepts to learn but once you learn them you will feel enlightened and acquire a solid perspective on the human mind, the history of psychology, experiment methods in psychology, and applications today.",
    "Yes! Professor Dunham is such a great lecturer and makes concepts easy to understand. I would recommend for every Yale student to take intro psych because it's really interesting and useful. It's helped me recognize how biases form, how to study better, the importance of sleep, and a lot of other cool stuff. The readings are also really interesting and informative! Highly highly recommend.",
    "yes, if you're taking psych this is chiil and fine. i wish the lectures were a bit denser and we did more group based discussion, not in front of the entire class (awkward over Zoom)",
    "Yes definitely take this class early on if you are considering majoring in psychology or just generally if the subject interests you. It's not too much work and you get a lot out of it. Just make sure to study in advance for the exam because there are so many different topics covered that it would be hard to cram for it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student but I think it was largely independent learning.",
    "Yes would recommend!  Thought Professor Dunham was great.",
    "Yes I would, I believe the material was incredibly engaging and the way the professor taught it made it easy to understand. His use of experiments and examples\/analogies made the material comprehensible.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a baseline understanding of psych.",
    "Absolutely. It is one of the best viruses i have taken at Yale. In my experience wit wa a much better than CGSC 110.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot of interesting quirks about the human mind."
