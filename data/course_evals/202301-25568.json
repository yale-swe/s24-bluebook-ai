Can't really think of any weaknesses, maybe just that I thought we were gonna discuss institutions like AIIB but never really did."

                "Yes! This is probably my favorite GLBL class I've taken at Yale. You learn a lot about a really relevant topic, and you also engage in your own research which is really exciting. It's not very challenging to do well if you stay engaged with the material, and Prof. Sundquist designs the class in a really fun way. From discussions to debates to simulations, you will not regret taking this class!",
                "YES. You not only learn about which countries borrow from China, why they do, and what unique characteristics Chinese lending has, but also gain a stronger understanding of Chinese government/political system/businesses. The course will also put China in the context of the international system and examine sovereign lending in general, including from the US and other international lenders, and it will look at China pretty objectively. It is a perfect GLBL class that draws equally from economics and political science. James is a great instructor. He's very dedicated to the class and does an amazing job explaining concepts and facilitating class discussions. The workload is the perfect amount that keeps you very engaged with the class and is still manageable. I appreciate that the class isn't just discussing the readings we did (which I find boring and pointless with a lot of seminars) because James brings something more to the class content each time (and he brings us Chinese tea!). Overall this is a very well designed class, and I highly recommend anyone regardless of background to take it."
