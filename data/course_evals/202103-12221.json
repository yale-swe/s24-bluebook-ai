                "This course really helped me develop my discursive and philosophical writing skills. We spent the classes talking about and analyzing different texts, artistic works, and films, but the papers themselves were works of pure philosophy, not analyses of other pieces. This made for a fascinating split, since classes often divide the other way around. Mario was incredibly helpful in developing ideas for papers and structuring them in clear and interesting ways.",
                "This course helped me develop skills in thesis defense. The assignments make you work through difficult and contentious philosophical issues by arguing for your own position.",
                "This course taught me to think critically, to develop my own arguments, and to stop taking for granted the value judgements that I normally make on a whim. I also learned that seminars can be incredibly fun, that there is joy in uncertainty, and so much more.",
                "key debates in aesthetics and intersection between art and morality",
                "This class taught me how to think with a philosophical mind. It was the type of class I always imagined I would one day have but had yet to discover in my Yale experience, because it gave me the chance to learn about philosophy while also applying it to essential questions about art, reality, existence, empathy, aesthetics, and morality. This class not only provided the foundational understanding of important philosophical minds and thinkers but also provided real understanding for ways in which to apply those thinkers to important philosophical issues and problems, and also how to expand and add to this with my own thoughts.",
                "I now have a much better understanding of aesthetic philosophy in general, particularly in regards to the moral applications that can come along with it. I have learned a new way to approach and evaluate art. I feel much more equipped to discuss art and attempt to tease out the ethical implications that might be present.",
                "Philosophical argumentation. Clearer, more logic filled thinking. Insights into the relationship between art and morality.",

                "This course was remarkably engaging, both in terms of the curriculum and the class discussion. Mario is an excellent discussion facilitator, and he really went out of his way to make sure everyone was involved and that the discussion was open, inviting, and interesting. The curriculum itself was clearly designed with care, and each week was a new adventure into interesting philosophical works, controversial films, or contrarian works of fiction. The only weakness was that I wished we'd met more, as I really enjoyed our discussions.",
                "The strengths of the course came from the in-class discussions. It was riveting getting to work through issues with peers and having debates on contentious philosophical issues. Professor Attie Picker also did a great job leading classroom discussion and flagging key questions that we should be thinking about. Another strength was chatting in office hours about papers. I found it really helpful. \r\nThere weren't any significant weaknesses per se, but I would have enjoyed more diversity in paper prompts. Thesis defense is only one type of philosophical essay, and I think it could have been beneficial to consider adding other types of assignments to broaden how we think about art and morality. I also would have like for class discussions to have spent more time talking about the texts. Again, these are not necessarily weaknesses but rather different things that I would've liked to see.",
                "Good discussions, interesting readings, interesting case studies connected to the readings. I think the topic initially felt a little small (we spent the first few weeks on similar topics) and eventually opened up into a lot of interesting questions, some of which we couldn't discuss (due to time). So, I wish we spent fewer weeks on moralism at the beginning because it wouldve allowed us to spend more times on different topics at the end.",
                "Discussion was well-facilitated and the readings and artworks were superbly curated",
                "I learned how to read philosophy and discuss it--how to think philosophically, how to develop my own thoughts. Professor Attie Picker did such a wonderful job in facilitated an engaging, supportive classroom environment, with fascinating readings, inspiring discussions, and truly informative and helpful assignments that allowed me to learn and reach these goals and understandings. I loved doing our homework--since we read such a fascinating mixture of philosophical texts and stories and lectures and plays and scientific studies. We also watched wonderful movies. And the classroom discussion was the perfect balance of getting context and knowledge from Professor Attie Picker while also allowing room for everyone to participate in engage--and I learned a great deal from my classmates. But not in a way where it was just one person talking--Professor Attie Picker did such a great job in creating a classroom environment in which I wanted to participate in it--and I think others felt this way too. The assignment also provided the perfect chance to show what I have learned, while also applying it in an interesting way that allowed me to develop my own thoughts and theories about what we were learning. And what we learned and discussed and the materials we engaged with were just so fascinating--and Professor Attie Picker just did such a wonderful job in choosing the syllabus, leading discussions, and providing support and feedback.",
                "This course thrived in the seminar format. It was incredibly interesting and enriching to discuss the topics of the readings amongst ourselves with guidance from Mario. This course was fascinating and engaging. No weaknesses come to mind, so I will not try to manufacture one. This is an excellent course! One of my favorites at Yale!",
                "I think overall the course was very strong, I like how we looked at different forms of art including dome films maybe include more discussions surrounding music but not much to change!"

                "Yes, no matter s\/he is a novice in the philosophy of art or an experienced art critic. Still, as the course description suggests, having some prior knowledge of how philosophy (especially ethics) works would be beneficial.",
                "Yes -- I cannot emphasize enough how much I would recommend another student take this course another course with Mario. He does a phenomenal job of facilitating lively discussion in the seminar, and this is one of my favorite courses I've ever taken at Yale because of the debates over the texts. Mario encourages people to have a variety of interpretations and perspectives, and push us to take arguments (even those that we don't agree with) at their best. If you are looking for a dynamic, interesting, and engaging class, definitely take this!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think it is quite remarkable in being intellectually stimulating and new material for experienced students of philosophy while also being accessible to students coming into it from other fields, who may never have taken a philosophy course. The discussion was made very accessible, and the curriculum was designed creatively, such that most of the texts and pieces were ones even the philosophy students hadn't encountered, putting us all on the same playing field. We read many scholars and philosophers, but the conversation focused on the substance of the questions of art and morality we were dealing with, and didn't overly focus on the texts themselves, although we read them closely. An amazing class.",
                "Absolutely. Not only is this an interesting topic, but Professor Attie Picker does a great job leading students through tough issues, and you will definitely learn a lot.",
                "I would! I learned so much about art, I learned to challenge the logic behind aesthetic, and I learned to structure my own arguments in a coherent way.",
                "Yes. The topic was really interesting and I enjoyed discussions during class, which were usually lively and fruitful. Mario did a great job making sure everyone understood the arguments, and encouraging everyone to participate.",
                "Yes. If you want to learn about philosophy and learn from important thinkers in a way that goes beyond just reading the texts of those thinkers but really thinking critically about how to apply these philosophies to art and important questions of truth versus fiction, subject versus object, morality, and empathy, then this is the class for you. I recommend this class as essential learning for anyone who wants to go into the art field--and even for people who enjoy engaging with art (from novels to movies to artworks), this class is transformative. It also is just such a fascinating and wonderful class, everyone at Yale should take it --or any class with Professor Attie Picker.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This was one of those rare courses at Yale where I both felt that I was learning a great deal, but also looked forward to and enjoyed being in class. What a success!",
                "Yes, this is a class I will remember forever with material I find myself bringing into everyday conversations"
