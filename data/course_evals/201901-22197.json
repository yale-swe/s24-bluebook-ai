   "comments": [
    "Professor Spiegel made the class very fun and interesting for us. He taught us important organic chemistry concepts and also made several tangents that were actually very biologically relevant and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like was the pace of the course that drastically accelerated in the last three or four lectures. It suffices to say that the material was very backloaded. It would have been better if we had spent less time reviewing general chemistry at the beginning of the course and spread out some of the harder material. I think we could have started learning SN1\/SN2\/E1\/E2 a bit earlier so that we didn't have to cram in epoxides, alcohol oxidation, diol cleavage, tosylation, PBr3, SOCl2 and many, many other reactions in the last three lectures. (Maybe even two). I missed the last lecture by accident and found that I had missed ~a third or even half of the material that was tested on the last midterm.",
    "No complaints--a 9 am class was not too great but the fact that it was only monday and wednesday was great. please keep it this way, not monday wednesday and friday class.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this course despite hearing so many bad things about organic chemistry! However, the professor was very receptive to students. Although lecture was sometimes a little unorganized and confusing, going to section and getting help from the TA really helped to reinforce the material. Taking orgo off sequence and having such a small class also definitely helped to provide each of us with more help and attention from the professor and TA. The course was organized very well with with lectures 2x a week, 3 midterms, and final exam, and weekly psets. The exams and psets were very straightforward and helped students better understand the mechanisms we learned and apply them.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- I really appreciated the MW 9-10:15 time rather than the MWF time, as I felt that the class was much more focused and engaged in a longer lecture\r\n- Material was comprehensive\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The pace starts off slow and ramps up very quickly",
    "strengths: taking this class off sequence is the move because of the small class size it is so much less intimidating.\r\nweakness: Spiegel could be more clear with what he expects us to know rather than saying \"you'll learn through your intuition\"",
    "strengths: small class size, meeting only twice a week, section was very helpful",
    "I think the course was very interesting with the professor and TA dedicated to improving the experience and learning.  The course is very good at focusing on the intuition behind mechanisms\/synthesis instead of pure memorization.  I would encourage the future of the course to provide tougher problem sets\/exams to test\/provoke the student's intuition and further the knowledge gained from the course.",
    "All strengths. Amazing professor and amazing TA. Enjoyed my time in this class very much. It was great that class was on Monday Wednesday and not Friday.",
    "The pace of the class was good and Prof. Spiegel is a clear lecturer. I am not sure that the emphasis on reaction mechanisms was the most helpful portion -- this is a useful problem-solving skill to test on the homework assignments, but I don't know that it is extremely productive to put it on tests, since it just requires simple memorization in that context.",
    "It felt haphazard and disorganized. Topics were introduced without putting them into a context of the course as a whole, and looking back I don't even know what the course as a whole was designed to teach us. As someone who was taking this course not as a major requirement, I was turned off by reactions and topics being presented as \"not very important, but ones I have to teach you.\"",
    "taking this class off sequence is wonderful! The lectures can be occasionally disorganized, but it such a unique opportunity to take an intro stem class is a small setting where it is easy to ask questions throughout lecture",
    "Very helpful TA, course pace felt slightly weird. Overall though seminar structure was more helpful for me than lecture",
    "Strengths: great pace, Professor made himself available for both office hours, review sessions, and questions before and after class. TA was just as willing and enthusiastic about the content. It genuinely felt like a great course.",
    "Strengths: the smaller class size and time put in by our TF. Also, the amount of practice material given.\r\nWeaknesses: office hours were not the most helpful.",
    "Overall, this is a pretty decent course. Spiegel is a very good lecturer, he knows how to hold the class's attention and his method of drawing things up as he goes makes it so that the class feels well paced, despite the fact that it is a 1:15 min class. I'd say the class would benefit from having more opportunities for students to practice material. The problem sets were always good about providing some of this, but not enough, and when the exams came, there was always a bit on confusion as to what would be expected and asked. The material at the end of the course was never explored in a problem set, and, this material was also the hardest of the course. I know I would have really benefited from having more opportunities for practice and feedback before that.",
    "The small class size was a positive. The weaknesses mainly had to do with lectures.",
    "The course lectures and the homework did not teach the material effectively. It could be improved by using Sapling for homework, which allows for faster turnaround and more clear feedback on homework. Additionally, there needs to be more planning put into the lectures. Professor Spiegel often seemed to get lost reading his own notes and would have to pause for a minute to remember what he wanted to write on the board. He often could not answer follow up questions and did not give enough background on topics to make them understandable."

    "I would recommend Orgo I with Professor Spiegel. Professor Spiegel will start you off gently with your toes in the water and by the end of the semester, you will be swimming! You will have learned more than you think. You'll know how to synthesize molecules by working backward with the reactions you learned, and you'll be able to explain why certain reactions happen based on the properties of the starting materials, solvent, etc. It's kind of great. The workload of the class was surprisingly light despite the reputation that organic chemistry is an extremely stressful class. Yet with a light workload, you still get a lot out of the class, which is what makes the class even more awesome. You have to learn organic chemistry if you want any sort of understanding of biology or chemistry, so just take it -- and enjoy the ride!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially those considering taking orgo on sequence. I really enjoyed taking this course despite hearing so many bad things about organic chemistry! However, the professor was very receptive to students and truly wanted us to succeed. Although lecture was sometimes a little unorganized and confusing, going to section and getting help from the TA really helped to reinforce the material. Taking orgo off sequence and having such a small class also definitely helped to provide each of us with more help and attention from the professor and TA. The course was organized very well with with lectures 2x a week, 3 midterms, and final exam, and weekly psets. The exams and psets were very straightforward and helped students better understand the mechanisms we learned and apply them. There were also so many review sessions and practice problems released before exams that was so helpful to understand what kinds of problems would be on the real exam and led to high student success. The TA I had (Dave C.) was amazing and so helpful. He was always open to answering questions and holding review sessions before exams and providing practice problems.",
    "Yes, taking Organic Chemistry off cycle is a very good decision, as you get a smaller class size and it makes learning more fun and intimate.",
    "If you need organic chemistry definitely take it off sequence. If you just want to take it for fun, just don't.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to be challenged and who has a strong background in chemistry.",
    "Yes, the course material is very interesting and the teacher\/Ta encourage an engaged and entertaining environment.",
    "Absolutely. Speigel is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He was great at answering questions in lecture, and even better during office hour. I would go to his office hours every week and he was so engaged and so caring. If I could give him more than five stars, I would.",
    "If you're a biology or chemistry major, it is probably helpful because it provides some of the important content you need to understand the field (and it may be required anyway). Otherwise, the class is probably not worth it.",
    "orgo was so much fun! I really loved learning about all the rxns and would recommend this class to all students with an interest in chem (even if you're not a science major\/premed)",
    "Maybe with a different professor, this class could be insightful and I would have felt like I got something out of it. But with Professor Spiegel, I didn't enjoy coming to lectures, and got more out of the fantastic lecture notes and section by the TF, Dave Caianiello.",
    "If you have to take it, definitely take off sequence!",
    "Yes I think it's worth it",
    "Definitely, 100%. Professor was excellent and made me find a passion for organic chemistry also!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Organic chemistry is one of those classes that you cannot avoid taking for many majors, but taking it off sequence makes it much more intimate and easier to grasp.",
    "Yes. Spiegel is a good lecturer and a very fair and understanding professor. Honestly, the class never felt long, despite it being 9-10:15, and I think this is because it was very well paced and the professor did a good job of keeping everyone on board. The fact that is also Monday, Wednesday is also great for scheduling.",
    "If you need It!",
    "I would tell another student that they should wait to take chemistry 220 in the fall if at all possible. This class was poorly organized, and they would probably benefit from having a different professor. I personally would not recommend any class taught by Professor Spiegel."
