                "Careful, delicate literary and artistic analysis and a huge capacity for empathy in familial/marital/romantic stories!",
                "This course taught me so much. I learned a cannon of literature, art, and movies deeply, and I learned how to analyze text and art in a way I have never before. This course taught me how to read and watch art through a psychoanalytical lens--and showed me how to exhume knowledge about life, human behavior, relationships through art. Also, this course re-enforced for me the value of art, and re-instilled a love of the subject for me. After this class, I will engage with literature, art, and movies in a new way--with greater depth and excitement.",
                "We learned new ways of understanding different types of love through literature and visual arts. Delving into these works in a classroom setting and through the lens of love, marriage, and family was a really insightful and thought-provoking experience.",
                "During this course, I developed my writing and my close textual analysis skills. I also developed my ability to empathize with characters and see a more nuanced perspective on characters actions. I learned about important psychological concepts through the medium of art.",

                "This was an incredible class  one I feel so unbelievably lucky to have been able to take  that gave academic validation to conversations on subjects that are too often deemed overly feminine and frivolous. The books we read were amazing, but it was the care and attention and kindness with which Professor Spitz and Professor Bloch conducted the class that made it the experience it was. I will remember this as one of the highlights of my Yale career.",
                "I was so struck by the power of the arts to reveal psychological nuances and important truths about life. This course taught me a way to dig into the psyche of characters and reflect on relevant issues in my own life. I came out of it with greater empathy for characters/people I do not necessarily agree with and more conscious reflections of my own life and my relationship with those around me.",
                "Paying attention to details both while reading and writing, as well as engaging with different art forms.",

The insights I have gained about love, understanding, power, marital relations and dynamics, are some that I will carry into the rest of my life with me.",

                "My favourite part of the class was Profs. Bloch and Spitz's wonderful teaching style and their love for the works, which they passed on to us. We had some most wonderful discussions and had I even enjoyed writing my papers. Being able to go see Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf as a class was also a huge bonus, and if the class is offered I think it would be great for the students to see a different piece of theatre together (whatever is playing on campus at the time). Speaking of which, please please please continue to teach this class! These are such important subjects to be studied through the lens of the arts as opposed to the social sciences and sciences!",
                "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The syllabus was thrilling and fascinating--and took us on a journey through the course subject in an engaging and fascinating way. There were many works of art and literature on the syllabus, but Professor Handler Spitz and Professor Bloch somehow made it so we were able to take our time to dig into each one. I gleaned literary, psychological, and artistic knowledge. I also felt that class discussions were free-flowing, engaging. They created a safe and warm classroom environment, where everyone had a chance to speak. They also would guide discussions in a way that supported such a wonderful balance of encouraging participation, while also giving us the chance to learn from their brilliant minds.  We also got to go to a play at Yale--and see and value art being put up all around us. I can't think of a better course--or a way to improve it!",
                "This was a wonderful course from its selection of works to the types of discussions we had. I looked forward to every class, and even writing the papers was fun.",
                "This has been one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at Yale. The strengths of the class were the engaging class discussions, the selection of course material, the compelling and thought-provoking essay prompts, and the in-depth and clear feedback on the essays. The course also had a very unique approach to the theme of love and relationships. It gave love and discussion about love a seat at the academic table! \r\n\r\nThere were no weaknesses of this course, except it would have been interesting to take this course with men as well as women.",
                "strengths: lively discussion, amazing reading list, not afraid to talk about emotion in an academic setting",
                "I wouldn't change a thing! An incredible class, and though it was new, the structure and the syllabus both worked well to facilitate meaningful conversations.",
                "This course is by far my favorite this semester. It is well-organized and well-paced to make sure we have enough time to sit down and actually enjoy the books and bring our thoughts to class. I received great guidance and support for papers and extremely detailed feedback from my professors. I also appreciate the fact that my classmates came from very different academic years, majors, geographical locations, and cultural backgrounds. I learned so much for their different perspectives and got to look at the books we read in ways I never could have imagined otherwise.",
                "I cannot imagine a way to improve this course --- it was simply amazing! We engaged with a variety of art forms and readings across different cultures were so engaging.",
                "The strengths of this course are in the simplicity of its layout: come to class having read the assigned readings and be ready to engage in active listening and participating. I actually think this class was perfect as it was!",
                "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I think the only thing that would improve it would be reading all of Anna Karenina. Otherwise, it was perfect!"

                "YES!!!! Beyond yes. It was hands down my favorite course I've ever taken at Yale. It was so engaging, the readings were incredibleit truly made me fall in love with literature again. It also seemed like everyone did the readings, so we could all really lean into the discussions. I always left the class wanting to discuss further with my friends, and I learned so much about myself, life, relationships, and history. It was like an intellectual, non-personal, artistic group therapy session. I seriously cannot recommend this class enough. Professor Bloch and Handler Spitz were incrediblythey care so much about their students and their passion for the works was incredibly inspiring.",
                "Yes! This life will change your life! Prof Spitz and Prof Bloch are also two of the smartest and most caring professors ever.",
                "Definitely. It's my favourite class I've taken at Yale so far. A large part of that needs to be credited to Professors Bloch and Spitz, who are funny, kind, and passionate people individually and even more so together. And the syllabus is a delight as well. There wasn't a ton of diversity in the authors so maybe some additional works that deal with non-white and non-heterosexual love, marriage, and family would make the class even more wonderful (we did read The Ramayana, A Raisin in the Sun, and Fun Home though, which were some of the highlights of the class for me!), but I really enjoyed everything we did read, and Professor Spitz's little art history lectures on some of the days were so interesting and fun to listen to! Sigh. Please take this class. I cannot stress this more. It's just lovely.",
                "Yes--I have been telling everyone! I feel I became not only a more knowledgable academic but also a more informed and aware person after this course. This course provided such an innovative way to look at and engage with art. I saw books as living, breathing entities--and the process of discovering knowledge of the world and history and human behavior through them was a joyful process of discovery. We read so much--and I know so much more about literature and art after this class. And I learned new ways to engage with art and literature, which I will take with me my whole life. And my love and appreciation of art and literature greatly increased. Everyone should take this course!",
                "Absolutely! This is the best course I have taken at Yale. I really appreciated the opportunity to study these topics in an academic light, and I will definitely remember the discussions we had as I go forward reading books featuring love, marriage, and family.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another Yale student. This class not only developed my writing and communication skills but also my emotional intelligence skills and deepened my ability to empathize with other people. I have recommended all the class books to friends and family. It seems as if it would be a true loss is someone did not have the chance to take this course. That being said, I think the course needs to maintain its seminar-style. Perhaps, there could be multiple sections of Love, Marriage, Family seminar classes.",
                "yes! if you want a seminar that is chill and lively in which you read great books and talk about really important and valuable things this is a great class",
                "Absolutely. If you have the opportunity to take this class, you are 1) very lucky and 2) should not miss it. Professor Spitz and Professor Bloch love teaching, and love the books and characters we discuss so deeply that you, too, will fall in love!",
                "I would recommend this course whole-heartedly to another student, whatever their background and major. Please, please, please take this class, you will learn so much as a student and grow so much as a person. Professor Spitz and Professor Bloch are absolutely amazing! They are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about their fields and care deeply about the books we read, the topic we discuss, and most importantly, the students themselves. You will grow so much in whatever course they teach.",
                "This course was marvelous. I only have wonderful things to say; I've never had professors who made me so excited to read and learn about these works. It was a very engaging seminar, and the readings were so moving and interesting and consisted of works I wouldn't have encountered otherwise, but I'm so glad to have been shown. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have engaging, fun conversations about new and interesting works. I will say that enjoying this course definitely requires doing all the readings, and sometimes the reading workload can be a bit heavy. But if you're willing to do the work, you'll get a huge amount out of it.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Both Professor Handler-Spitz and Professor Bloch are amazing and the material was very engaging.",
                "I would 1000% recommend this course to another student because the life lessons you gather through the literature and through the in-class discussions are so great and important: both of these professors teach you that literature is a tool to understand yourself, and the characters can share their wisdom with you.",
                "Yes, this was an unforgettable class. I was always excited to do the reading and to go to class. I think about what we learned all the time."
