                "I certainly became a better writer by taking this course, but I also gained a more thorough understanding of what it means to exist in a place and to describe it. I've become a more observant person, and I've gained a new appreciation for traveling.",
                "I learned how to write about place and space, and, on a larger scale, how to write a nonfiction essay.",
                "- ability to write lucid descriptions about place\r\n- ability to read 'for place'\r\n- general writing practice with weekly and bi-weekly essays",
                "As a writer, I tend toward person- and idea-oriented writing more often than place-oriented writing. ENGL 478 necessitated that I attend to physical description and detailed observationas well as the vantage point of a given readermore than I typically do, which was a welcome challenge.",
                "I developed my ability to write from observation and edit both my own and my peers' work. The assigned readings were useful tools in helping us recognize good writing and dissect not-so-good writing. What we learned from our reading discussions frequently manifested in the work we subsequently produced.",
                "This class focused on writing several kinds of place-focused essays, as well as writing in general. I learned how to describe spaces clearly and engagingly, how to capture the atmosphere and emotion of a physical location through language, and how to notice setting and consider history while writing a nonfiction piece."

                "I enjoyed this course and its format. The writing assignments are well structured and the readings are as well.",
                "It would be nice to have some more structured writing exercises, maybe some in class. The assignments were very broad (childhood, route, travel) and in a workshop-based class devoted to writing as a craft I would have appreciated more specific instructions on subject and style and form (literary nonfiction or journalism or memoir or architectural criticism).",
                "The course is well structured -- you quickly get into the flow (each week there is typically a draft or a final version of an essay due). I felt like I was never completely overwhelmed, but that I always had something to do for the class. The readings were good, although I might have enjoyed more attention spent on the readings Prof. Zarin posted and less on the anthology.",
                "I enjoyed how we were able to write pieces of many different lengths.",
                "strengths:\r\n- lots of practice writing was nice\r\n- readings chosen by Professor Zarin were quite good (exempting the ones in the Best American Traveling Writing book)\r\n- fun seminar environment where you get to know your peers\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n- \"place writing\" often felt like quite a broad term and expectations sometimes felt unclear about what that means\r\n- larger assignments toward the end of the semester felt quite high-stakes and made it difficult to experiment with different types of writing\r\n- workshops in class often did not feel very productive; it was clear that most people had not read the essays beforehand. maybe it would be worth telling people to bring comments written down before, or even submit them on canvas",
                "I appreciated that ENGL 478 was cross-listed with Architecture, and I wonder if a broad overview of architectural vocabulary could be a helpful inclusion in an early class meetingboth for when it appears in assigned\/workshop readings and for our own writing. Class discussions were energetic and thoughtful, as were workshops, and the reading list was varied in a way that allowed for consideration of what a \"place\"and therefore place writingis or could be.",
                "Strengths: well-structured in a way that allows skills to be progressively developed with each assignment, good readings, fantastic instructor, fosters a rich and supportive learning community\r\nWeaknesses: noneI thoroughly enjoyed this class\r\nImprovements: I really enjoyed the explicitly instructional parts of the class (when we talked about structuring devices, words to avoid, etc.), so more of that would make this class even better, in my opinion",
                "I thought the best part of this class was the in-class workshopping and the one-on-one peer editing. The peer editing especially was incredibly helpful in producing more effective and meaningful pieces. I might have appreciated the workshop essays being posted slightly earlier so that we had more time to look over our peers' work before class the next morning."

                "Yes, I enjoyed the class immensely.",

                "I'd recommend ENGL 478 to any student enthusiastic about writing, even ifperhaps especially ifunacquainted with place-writing. The peer-editing system, varied reading list, and Prof. Zarin's feedback made the course rewarding and exciting.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. I found Professor Zarin to be a skilled, knowledgeable, and insightful instructor, and thought that the coursework was scaffolded quite well. There is a pretty consistent level of work requiredstudents are usually either writing or revising what they have written each weekbut I did not find the workload to be overly burdensome. Feedback from peers during one-on-one editing sessions and the workshop are highly valuable. I thought this was a really good class to develop skill in \"writing about place\" for students from a range of disciplinary interests.",
