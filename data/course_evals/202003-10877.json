                "Amazing readings. I would appreciate an extra undergraduate section as I know there is one for graduate students.",
                "Strengths: MDR is excellent at answering questions and acknowledging difficulties and complications as we find them (both in office hours and in seminar); Readings helped to clarify difficult material before seminar, which made seminar discussion a good further exploration and exposure to the topics; Having graduate students who had fairly deep knowledge of Spinoza already was nice because they elevated discussion and made connections which were helpful in clarifying and questioning material; You get out what you put in, as you can get by without doing a lot of work, but there are enough readings and complex ideas that you can dive as deep as you want; I really do think I know a lot more about Spinoza's philosophy; The midterm paper which can be expanded into a final allowed for following-up on ideas and diving deeper into Spinoza's thinking and arguments.\r\nWeaknesses: Often seminar time was a little bit too much of a recap of the readings (both primary and secondary), though this second exposure was helpful both in getting MDR's perspective and in just clarifying the ideas; There were a lot of people in the seminar, though this wasn't actually too much of an issue at all as most rarely talked, so didn't detract from conversation",
                "This course was the most rigorous philosophy course I have taken, and I benefitted a lot from that rigor. The most difficult points in the course were that it was sometimes easy to get lost in the complexity of Spinoza's system and terminology, especially when graduate students jumped into the discussion to debate over certain minutia which required the background understanding to engage with. I would have liked more moments when the course would step back to the broader questions of Spinoza's system, and leave the specific minutia to the end of the seminar, so myself and the other undergraduate students wouldn't get as easily lost.",
                "Strengths: dynamic professor and manageable syllabus; the mix between graduate and undergraduate students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the mix between graduate and undergraduate students\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the grad students enhanced the conversation of the class by virtue of being more advanced in the philosophical training and added an extra layer of complexity to the questions being discussed. While on the other hand, sometimes I felt as an undergrad that the grad students were operating on one level while the undergrads were on a different level. In the future I would recommend that this seminar be divided into two, one for undergrads and one for graduate students.",
                "Honestly, this class had few, if any, real weaknesses. We ran out of time to discuss all of the topics on the syllabus, so if anything, I'd wish to see Spinoza offered as a two-semester seminar.",
                "I found the large presence of graduate students in the class to be a little overwhelming. They would often reference texts outside of the reading, or translations beyond our book, or scholarship not assigned. Overall, although their comments were often quite insightful, I felt a little lost and unable to get a word in. Otherwise I thought the class was a great and a phenomenal way to learn about Spinoza and his system as a whole"

That being said, you really just learn about Spinoza in this course (and a little bit about his surrounding early modern philosophical context), so unless you are ready to get a fairly deep and narrow set of knowledge about this one guy then this probably isn't the course for you.",
                "I would recommend this course only to students who feel very comfortable with their philosophical analysis, as it could be very rigorous and demanding at points, especially in the secondary literature. However, if the students are up to putting in the extra work to really grapple with the questions of Spinoza's system, this course can be incredibly rewarding and illustrate what a complete philosophical system analyzed in depth can look like. I would also recommend future students meet with the Professor for their writing assignments, as he can push them to new levels of analysis and be incredibly helpful.",
                "This class was an amazing introduction to the philosophy of Spinoza. Even as someone with very little experience reading his work, I didn't get lost because Professor Della Rocca gave incredible explanations. It was a pleasure to be in his class.",
                "Indeed, the philosophy of Spinoza is worth studying for anybody interested in the power of reason and who becomes easily disturbed by our species' natural inclination to explain the world through brute facts. This seminar gave me an opportunity to learn about Spinoza ne of the world's leading experts on Spinoza.",
                "Unequivocally. Spinoza was probably the most formative and engaging class I've taken at Yale thus far (and I'd imagine it'll stay that way). Because of the wide scope of the philosophical problems Spinoza interacts with and the diversity of the secondary literature we read, there's probably something most students of philosophy could latch onto in this seminar, whether they're interested in the history or problems of philosophy. Situating narrower philosophical questions in the context of the kinds of cosmological problems Spinoza treats would, I'd imagine, help better orient the interests of most students of philosophy--at least this was my experience. Beyond that, Della Rocca is an outstanding, if daring, instructor, and his seminars could hardly have been better structured."
