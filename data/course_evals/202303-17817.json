I would do more of those.\r\nweaknesses: there were soooo many papers & discussions... I didn't get THAT much from them. Yes, it was useful and interesting to see what was being published in the field, what was cutting edge research. Did we have to spend so long talking about them and analyzing them in depth? Meh... I wish it was more lecture based honestly. The lectures moved quite fast and I loved listening / asking questions. There was even a few times when we finished early - I would have honestly had even more content.",

                "The strength of this course was the teaching team! Professor Wolfswinkel, Professor Jacob, and our TA were all incredible and provided a lot of help throughout the class. They held review sessions, office hours, and meetings to review papers for projects. They were also always available to answer any questions. Also, the class's content was incredibly interesting as well and it was well taught! In terms of weaknesses, the course didn't really have any that I can think of.  The class was very enjoyable and as long as you put in effort into the course, you'll see results."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they enjoy epigenetics and genetics in general! This course is great and you'll learn about epigenetics and its applications. A lot of the lectures cover current research in the field and results that have been found so far. However, please note that this isn't an easy class, so make sure not to take too heavy of a schedule with it. It is very conceptual and relies a lot more on understanding and applying concepts rather than route memorization. As long as you put in the work and effort into understanding the concepts, reaching out for help through office hours, attending lectures, and just enjoying the class then you'll do great!"
