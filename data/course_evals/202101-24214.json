                "The professor clearly didn't care much about the course -- she missed 6 lectures (out of 22) and for many didn't even upload a recorded lecture to replace missing class. In class, she often didn't elaborate on proofs and refused to answer questions about the homework because she hadn't even looked at the homework questions, instead ripping them off from other iterations of the class. For these eight 2-question psets, she only had her grader check one problem, so any mistake (even a small computational mistake) on a single problem on a single pset could utterly tank your grade as this class is 100% psets. Overall, I've taken several bad courses at Yale, but never a course where I felt the instructor cared less about the material or the students.",
                "i guess it was freaky to have 7 homework problems (literally 7 problems, not 7 psets) dictate the whole grade and i hope this will turn out fine (fingers crossed). Strength is in the material, great stuff is being learnt from some of the most classic textbooks in the subject, such as the boyd book and the lunenberger and ye.",
                "none",
                "The strengths of this class are that the grade is only based on PSets and that the professor's notes are neat. The weaknesses of this course stems from the professor's apathy - she frequently cancelled classes for appointments, never gave assignments related to her lectures, and gave a final \"optional\" assignment to implement the simplex method and stochastic gradient descent which nobody wanted to do. Further, only one problem was graded on each PSet, and no solutions were ever provided. This class could be improved by having a professor who teaches content related to what's on her assignments and desires to teach every day.",
                "The homework wasn't too bad, there were no tests--class was relatively laid back. I kind of wished it had covered more content, though.",
                "This course was pretty bad. The first couple weeks had interesting material, but after that it was pretty hard to follow. Zoom lectures were really boring, the material got harder and the psets started diverging from what was taught in class, and by the end of it I had no idea what we were learning. Psets were manageable with the TAs help, but I cant say I learned a lot of stuff that I will remember. There was only 1 hour of office hours once a week, and it was impossible to get help outside of that. The TA was super helpful, but the professor refused to hold office hours herself, simply assigned psets from the previous professor without even reading them, and refused to answer any questions about psets.",
                "While Professor Gilbert's lectures were very clear, I don't feel like I had enough opportunity to practice the material because the problem sets were too short and infrequently assigned (we didn't have homework for around three weeks at the end of the semester). Although I tried to remedy this problem by doing exercises and textbook readings on my own, it was difficult to do so because there was no assigned reading and we jumped around a lot between topics. Also, there were several days where Professor Gilbert canceled lecture or posted lecture notes without a recorded video because she had a scheduling conflict. While this has been a challenging semester because of COVID, and I understand there are ways in which it might have been particularly difficult for instructors, it was a bit disheartening to see this lack of dedication because teaching is ultimately part of a professor's job description, and college courses are still expensive during a pandemic."

On one hand, the material is probably good to know if you're thinking of going into statistics or machine learning, but on the other hand, I don't think I would have gotten anything out of the course that I wouldn't have gotten from the publicly available notes on Professor Spielman's website, since Professor Gilbert followed his notes to a tee (but covered slightly less material). Also, the content overlaps to some extent with the computer science department's algorithms course, so I would probably recommend taking that course instead and learning the convex programming material, which is easier, independently or through Professor Spielman's lecture notes."
