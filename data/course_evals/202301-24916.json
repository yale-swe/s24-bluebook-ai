            "comments": [
                "Strength- very interesting topics and movies to allow people to really discuss themes that are relevant today.\r\nWeakness - sometimes the readings assigned didn't really feel necessary or relevant to the class conversation, so it was hard to motivate to read them all.",
                "Strengths: The class is formatted as a discussion, so you really get to practice your French if you engage. Of course, if there's a ton of people in the class, this is less of an advantage. There are very large and very helpful vocab lists--if you motivate yourself to memorize them, you'll learn a TON. Weaknesses: There's too much reading, and we don't talk about all of it. And some of them can be very dry. Also there's really no accountability/motivating system in place to make you memorize all the vocab--you just need to use the vocab words in your ecritures. The class could benefit from weakly vocab quizzes, for sure.",
                "Strengths: great teacher and subjects, engaging discussions. It's a little annoying to have to memorize a bunch of vocab for the tests (which are all writing), but it's overall a great class.",
                "Strengths: Interesting variety of articles and (for the most part) movies, good class discussions. I thought the grade distribution was quite good as well (participation, two midterms, a midterm oral, final oral, and the \"ecritures\" we do throughout the semester). Professor Sherak was also wonderful and made class really enjoyable.\r\nWeaknesses: I like the reading in the textbook since it provided me with the background I needed to read the more nuanced articles, but I wish we had talked a little bit more about the reading we did in it. Also, sometimes it felt like a lot of, or even too much, reading for one class, considering we couldn't get to it all. Otherwise, no weaknesses.",
                "The professor is amazing and very engaging. There is continual work even though the course is only twice a week which means that the course does not feel jolted but continuous since you are always working on something. The high courseload can be tough but since there is a good mix of assignments (essays, reading, films) the work is not monotonous and remains interesting!"

                "Yes! You get out of this class what you put in. So if you come ready to speak and engage with the materials, you will improve a lot.",
                "It depends. Are you the I-want-to-understand-current-issues-in-France type of French student, or the I-want-to-immerse-myself-in-French-art-and-culture type? If the first, yes take the class. If the second, absolument pas. The class is advertised as a class on culture and media, but really it's about current events. Expect to read zero fiction and zero poetry. Expect to read a lot of articles and summaries of laws. Expect all the movies you watch to be quite obvious in their political content, and geared towards political discussions rather than film analysis. Not a class for les literraires. If you're an I-want-to-get-the-language-credit-out-of-the-way French student, yeah this is probably a good option.",
                "Yes! The topics are really interesting and Prof Sherak is amazing.",
                "Yes! If you want to improve your French speaking, improve your vocabulary, and gain a profound understanding of the social and political issues across France. This class really helped me come into my own with French. Your ability to speak intelligently about many social and political issues will amaze you. I really looked forward to this class every day. Madame Sherak is also wonderful. Would definitely recommend (but be aware that this is a discussion based seminar, so participation is a must!)",
                "Yes definitely! I took this class after FREN 170 and I believe the combination of the two has developed my reading, writing, and conversational skills to an incredible degree. Also, being in a very small class and getting to talk a lot one on one is useful. At the beginning speaking is tought, but by the end of the semester you are able to have a 1 hour conversation for your oral final which makes you feel so proud!"
