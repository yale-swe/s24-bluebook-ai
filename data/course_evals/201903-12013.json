I wouldn't say that I learned much about the subject matter of American Studies, but it was helpful in honing strategies for researching, outlining, and writing a thesis.",

   "comments": [
    "The small group is great in facilitating discussion and actually getting a lot of one-on-one help. Not too many weaknesses. I would just say more productive writing time on our own away from class.",
    "It is useful to have a place for seniors in the major to collaborate and commiserate about their theses, but the course itself often feels less productive than it could be. I think everything we accomplished in first semester could have been done with very brief check-ins every week. The short writing assignments often felt distracting from what I was actually working on. I'm doing a bit of an unorthodox project, so I'm fully ready to believe it's more useful for more traditional students. And Salonee is lovely! But the checking in felt more productive than any actual assigned work for the colloquium.",
    "The course is helpful for senior American Studies majors because it is loosely structured, allowing students to discuss the issues most relevant to their theses.  I have no improvements to propose.",
    "I think the timeline of the AMST intensive thesis gets off to a pretty rollicking start. Every step is due too early, especially the prospectus and lit review. I found myself doing perfunctory tasks badly in order to focus on the actual stuff I had to do. I also think it could be tailored to different projects rather than just the 60 page academic paper. The creative prospect people really need their own class."

    "If they want to write a thesis, it's required! If the department can make it slightly less of a commitment, that would be ideal. But I would recommend writing a thesis, and so I would necessarily recommend this course!",
    "I would recommend this course to American Studies majors. Taking ownership over an independent thesis is an invigorating way to spend senior year.",
    "Yes, I mean they have to take it if they want to do an intensive project."
