    "I learned a lot about all four aspects of the Chinese language (reading, writing, speaking, and listening). All four of those aspects improved drastically in just one semester. In particular, I learned a lot of useful eloquent Chinese expressions and constructs applicable to all aspects of communication in Chinese.",
    "I learned a lot about chinese culture, history and the language.",
    "I learned how to read, write essays, and present topics in more advanced Chinese. I learned about stories of Prof. Sus life and concepts of philosophy. Essay writing.",
    "Increased Chinese vocabulary, reading and writing skills.",
    "Got a lot better at reading and writing Chinese",
    "I have learned and developed my formal Chinese in speaking, listening, and writing. I have also learned a lot about Chinese philosophy, history, and social and cultural issues in our curriculum.",
    "My vocabulary increased significantly and I think I got better at writing essays and giving somewhat formal presentations. My handwriting skills improved a little too. Learned some cultural\/philosophical things about China as well.",
    "Chinese speaking, reading, and writing on everyday topics"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is perfectly paced; fast (as it should be for advanced heritage speakers) but thorough. Assessments and assignments took just the right amount of time and were graded fairly. Class was always interesting and insightful. The sheer amount Su Laoshi knows about not just Chinese language and culture, but the way they intersect is very impressive, and we learn about anything and everything from idioms to daily life to Chinese history and philosophy. I really don't know how the course could be improved; possibly more informal discussions and questions? Although Su Laoshi talks a lot, the value of the course to me lies in his stories and anecdotes; I learn so much even about speaking through listening to him.",
    "The course is well structured, easy to follow and well taught. There is a lot of student engagement and it is a very fun environment. There isn't a lot of feedback on progress.",
    "Professor was very chill and emphasized important words and concepts to learn. There are no weaknesses unless you do not like to sit and listen for 50% of the class.",
    "Strengths: course material was relevant to daily life and generally interesting, excellent additional information from the professor (e.g. Chinese culture, philosophy)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have liked more feedback on how to oral presentations, similar to how the professor gave feedback on essays",
    "Su laoshi is a definite strength he makes your day better \r\n\r\nI wish there was more opportunity for speaking practice",
    "While there were lots of office hours, the course may be improved by having more guided review for the exams. Going into each of the tests, we didn't really know exactly what would be tested.",
    "Strengths: the prof is very fun (great stories as many have mentioned), the grading is not stressful, the textbook is pretty well designed for learning, you get through a good amount of vocab. \r\nWeaknesses: I'm unusual as a 'heritage' speaker because my speaking isn't that good, so I wished this course had more informal speaking opportunities. We don't really talk during the class.",
    "Su wei is a great professor and I enjoyed his anecdotes a lot. Sometimes went off track but I enjoyed the supplemental learning about poems or chinese history even more than the textbook content"

   "comments": [
    "If you have sufficient background in Chinese (if you speak a bit at home, your parents speak at home, and you've taken some formal training up to 700-1000 characters in the past), then the course is the perfect fit to prepare you to take Chinese to the next level. And even if you're a bit behind (for example you haven't taken Chinese in a few years), you will catch up quickly.",
    "Yes! You learn a lot and its a very engaging class.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course if you want to learn more advanced vocabulary along with some very interesting new concepts regarding politics, economics, and culture.",
    "Yes, professor is clearly very passionate about teaching and cares a lot about his students. Not only did I increase my Chinese language skills, I also gained a greater understanding of Chinese culture through Su Laoshi's discussions of Confucianism, Chinese poetry, music, history, etc.",
    "Yes!! It's relatively non stressful but it puts a lot of things (beyond Chinese) in perspective, it was honestly the highlight of my day",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While it is rigorous for those whose Chinese may not be great, you learn really quickly through the work done in class. The discussions are really interesting and are very relevant as they emphasize contemporary issues in modern China.",
    "Yes I'd definitely recommend it. I found that the material was pretty challenging but the grading friendly, so I felt like I was learning without getting super stressed out. The professor is engaging. The material is pretty well-rounded in terms of skills (the only thing that gets short shrift is speaking). \r\nHonestly the dumplings at the end of the year are an independent reason to be in one of his classes... they are so good.",
    "Yes"
