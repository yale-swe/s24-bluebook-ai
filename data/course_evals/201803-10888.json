    "Excellent introduction to labor economics through presenting foundational  models and research papers. Great review of microeconomic ideas and econometrics.",
    "I learned the relevance of math in the study of economics. This class not only explained how to do the math but why it is necessary.",

    "I without a doubt would recommend this class. I am not someone who excelled in the intro and intermediate sequences, so I was nervous taking this class. However, Professor Lindenlaub explain difficult subjects extremely well. She also uses recently published papers to teach us the topics, which is something I found extremely cool. This class changed my opinion on economics. Ive come out of the class with a revived interest in the subject.",
    "Definitely, I would recommend this course to you if you are interested in learning theoretical models of the labor market. It helps us understand the determinants of wages and employment."
