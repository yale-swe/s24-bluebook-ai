    "I learnt so much about how to write, and how to read in order to learn how to write. It's possible to forget the importance of communication and understanding the audience's perspective, as well as the many ways possible to make an argument convincing. The diversity of the texts and styles read were super helpful in extending my understanding.",
    "We examined techniques and styles of cultural critique through a huge range of essays and articles on various topics. There was no particular topic focus besides the general umbrella of cultural critique. For our own pieces (three essays throughout the semester, with the longest being 10-12 pages), we were able to write about anything (the hardest part was picking a topic), using the model pieces as frames for how we developed our writing. I've come out with a better understanding of the nuance involved in creating an unbiased yet persuasive cultural critique -- the subtleties that make a critique powerful are so difficult to master, but incredibly important for not only our writing but the way we speak to one another.",
    "I learned how to think and write in a new and more effectively critical way. I am more confident in my essay writing.",
    "Incredible focus on writing and writing skillsdefinitely a continuation of 120 (in a really good way).",
    "I think I learned how to write and structure a compelling cultural critique",
    "I learned how to write effectively and gained lots of knowledge on how to use grammar\/syntax.",
    "Read some great writers, become better at analyzing and improving your own writing",
    "This class taught me how to write cultural critiques, like essays in the New Yorker. I learned what a cultural narrative is (the stories \/ assumptions we collectively tell ourselves) and how to unpack them and look for contradictions in them, which is a pretty interesting thing to do. I also learned how to write better, purposeful stories, and a bunch of tools that skilled writers use and moves they make to advance a point or question a claim.",
    "I learned what it means to write a cultural critique. It's interesting to learn the sort of \"formula\" for writing a cultural critique, and it's cool to see  this formula in action. It's cool to write almost pseudo-academic papers in a totally read-able, non-academic style."

    "No weaknesses!",
    "Strengths: Overall, it's a really amazing class. It's well paced, the prompts are interesting, the people (at least in my section) were engaged. \r\nWeaknesses: The hardest part is coming up with what to write aboutmaybe more focus in the beginning on where to look\/how to come to these ideas? Not sure on this!",
    "I think that it would be better to be able to talk about all of the pieces that we read",
    "The course material was interesting and engaging, and so was the professor.",
    "Strengths: syllabus of readings, discussions, tons of feedback on drafts \r\nWeakness: not a whole lot of writing practice in class",
    "The readings were well-chosen, and Prof. Shirkhani was always encouraging and super accessible to meet outside of class! I also really appreciated extensive feedback from the workshops and Prof. Shirkhanis comments on essays. For about a month though I was super confused for what I should be looking for when doing readings. Since people come into the class with different backgrounds a handout on like moves to look for and examples of them would be helpful, but I also see why it might be beneficial not to have this so it doesn't limit what people notice.",
    "Mostly strengths! I'd say the only weakness would just be we didn't get to all the readings and wish we knew which piece we'd be focusing on ahead of time."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class -- I can't recommend it or Professor Shirkhani enough!",
    "Yes! This course completely changed the way I read, write, and think about critical essays. Take this class if you read The New Yorker. Take this class if you don't read The New Yorker. Take this class if you want to be a writer. Take this class if you want to be a journalist. Take this class if you want to be neither. Everyone can benefit from this class. Professor Shirkhani has created a wonderful course  I consider this a must-take in the English department.",
    "Yes, absolutely! I took it because I loved 120 and it was a great continuation of that class, but I don't think it's necessary to have taken 120 first if you have a strong writing background otherwise (although it certainly helps, and I think most people in my section had). You get to read incredible essays and talk about them with a really interesting, engaged group of people. You write three essays (which get gradually longer)it's good to start thinking far in advance on what you want to write about, because it can be beyond tough to start writing if you're not in love with or fascinated by the topic. Professor Shirkhani is fantasticshe gives great feedback and will spend a lot of time with you developing your ideas\/writing (we all had draft meetings with her on the last two essays). Take it!",
    "Yes, but I would warn that some classes are for more engaging than others",
    "Yes it was amazing.",
    "Yes. And do the readings - some of them are really good.",
    "I felt like I grew as a writer and became more confident with my writing! I've also learned to observe things that I wouldn't have noticed before. I think if you put in effort then you can get a lot out of it. Professor Shirkhani is very supportive and really cares about everyone in the class (shell stay way past her office hours to help a student, and its crazy how she remembers some comment someone said like 3 months ago). I think it helped me write more clearly and more confidently and Im very glad I had the chance to take this class! \t\r\n\r\nAlso, grading can be harsh (definitely not everyone gets As), I took it credit\/d and was glad not to worry about it.",
    "Take the course! I took this after taking 5 advanced creative writing courses and it was still one of my favorite classes. The readings are great and Professor Shirkhani is fun and engaging and knows her stuff. It's basically ENGL 120, but all focused on the cultural critique."
