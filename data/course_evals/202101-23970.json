                "Professor Hickey is excellent. She was very thoughtful and deliberate with the books she assigned and how we engaged with them, as well as with the assignments. She edited and adapted assignments and the syllabus as the course went along to help combat our fatigue as students while still promoting the things we were interested in and giving us an opportunity to do deeper analysis through essays and creative projects. She fostered and excellent sense of community that led to engaging and thoughtful discussions. The syllabus was diverse and interesting, especially for a broad literature course. I have no complaints, especially for a required foundational course and writing credit.",
                "Professor Hickey is the absolute best. She is the strength of this course and is so encouraging. The discussions she led and deeper thinking she promoted were amazing. No weaknesses at all.",
                "I can't see any weaknesses in this course! It was very well taught, and the subject matter we covered was carefully and thoughtfully curated.",
                "Prof. Hickey!!! She is the absolute best and if you are going to take this class, take it with her!",
                "The course is well done and well adapted to be as engaging As possible over zoom.",
                "Strengths: Professor Hickey is fantastic. She is incredibly kind and supportive. She allows us to direct the discussion to topics that interest us, and she always enriches our conversations with ideas that make us re-consider certain passages and themes. The literature that we read is also super interesting and diverse. The essays were fun to write because we could pick topics that we found interesting and be creative in our approach. Overall, one of my favorite English classes at Yale!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!"

Professor Hickey was an amazing instructor. I loved how she found ways to adapt to our needs while still giving us a vigorous intellectual experience Professor Hickey's class allowed us to indulge in our love for literature and allowed us to explore it in our own ways. 10\/10 would recommend.",
                "Yes definitely!! Professor Hickey is amazing. She is so sweet, supportive, and brilliant as an instructor. Her feedback on essays is always very thorough and helped me improve a lot as a writer. Class discussions were very interesting and thought-provoking. The literature that we read was diverse and introduced me to a wide range of authors, themes, and ideas. Even more importantly, the class genuinely becomes a community and a space where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas and helping each other better understand the texts. A fantastic class that all Yalies should take!"
