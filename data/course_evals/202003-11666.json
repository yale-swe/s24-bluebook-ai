                "The course introduced me to many important thinkers and Professor Siu is amazing at explaining the connections between the readings she chose for that week. However, students did not get many chances to participate and the class seemed more like a small lecture than a seminar at times.",
                "This class has been an eye opener in terms of understanding the intersection between culture and representation. Its strength is that it covers very important issues, and some excellent authors.",
                "Strengths: If you like theory, you will love basically every reading that is assigned. Very few, if any, of the readings felt like a chore. I really enjoyed interacting with the ideas presented in the class.\r\nWeaknesses: The course is a seminar, but feels like a lecture. Since it's so long (and virtual) it is a little difficult to keep focused on the class lecture\/discussion.",
                "Professor Siu is an expert in her field and there is so much to learn from her. I was grateful each week to listen to her lectures and document her insights. She did a great job of circling back to certain concepts she mentioned in various lectures, and I think the readings she foregrounded every week [as opposed to other smaller or, perhaps, less complex readings] were very generative. All the readings were great with such diversity in subject matter. I loved how the professor emphasized meeting with her at least once throughout the semester. That one on one time was very illuminating and underscored just how much we had to learn from Professor Siu. \r\n\r\nI believe this course could improve if the students has more ability to exchange ideas. I'm sure this is a function of Zoom. But I left class sometimes wondering what my more quiet classmates were thinking."
