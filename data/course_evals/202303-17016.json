                "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!!!! Each book is so so special!!! Dean is so special!!! Take this class!!!",
                "This course was an absolutely phenomenal exploration of literature from the Black South. There were incredible thinkers that I knew and read before (Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou) and incredible writers I'd never heard of before like Kiese Laymon, Katori Hall and more. We learned from so many brilliant minds. Through each of these works, we discussed common life experiences for Black Americans in the South and the particularities of each individual author, character, community. \r\n\r\nThis course undoubtedly made me a better reader. I began to think about literature in a new way, finding new meanings. I'd also like to think it made me a better writer, with more control and creativity in my language.",
                "I learned so many new lens through which one can approach texts. I've learned to look at every detail and see them in new ways that I couldn't before. I learned to have a little more fun in my reading too and see the comedy.",
                "I really improved my writing a reading comprehension in this class!",
                "Careful cultural and literary analysis of the Black South, extremely well planned course for thinking and talking about race in literature for people who may not be well versed in doing so.",
                "The dream is the truth; and a mess of the stuff you don't; good by mr wigin tell them im strong tell them im a man; you you!"

                "Dean!!! The books!!!! Take this class!!!!",
                "The class size is perfect to have everyone speak during class and books to be read during class have a variety of topics and genres, great class all around! Fair warning, if you do not like being called on and are not comfortable talking about sex scenes, this might not be your class. You will be called on at some point in the semester to discuss the details of explicit scenes.",
                "I cannot think of a single weakness, so I'll move on to the strengths. The format and pacing of this course was really well done. Presentations at the beginning of every class made sure there was a new perspective\/angle to the book before we began our discussions. Dean Mahurin was incredibly energetic and brought life to every piece. Each discussion was incredibly engaging and exciting.\r\n\r\nIt was really helpful to have our \"weekly musings\" because it kept me engaged in each book. It was always a good opportunity to think about the most striking parts of our reading. I also liked the opportunity to share my thoughts with Dean Mahurin before class.",
                "Strength: THE SYLLABUS. Probably the best syllabus of any course at Yale and especially any English course. There are no duds. Literally none. I laughed. I cried. I felt. This class is awesome. Also Dean is such a huge strength for this course. You can tell how much she loves every text and she makes class so, so, so much fun. I loved going to class every single week.\r\nWeaknesses: TBH none. I wish the musings weren't due right before class because sometimes I like to sit with the texts in my brain or think about something said in class and go from it. I wish I could've had till Wednesday night to do the musings, but that's actually the only thing.",
                "Strength: the book list! Literally an amazing set of books that will have a long lasting effect on you. Also Professor Mahurin! \r\n\r\nWeakness: honesty none I think a week to read a book is fair. I guess maybe Professor Mahurin grades pretty hard but she also leaves great feedback!",
                "Dean Mahurin is such an engaging professor and she was a highlight of the class. She is a hard grader which is tough but she is also very fair and willing to help you work on your writing.",
                "Incredible, brilliant syllabus, one of this classes greatest strengths was the group of students, would have appreciated a little more guidance on writing English papers as a non-English major.",
                "This class is such a joy and privilege. First of all, the books are amazing. I would sit in Starr before and after class and feel so lucky that my 'work' for the day was to read some of my favorite things I've ever read and then talk about them with smart students for an hour. That's a pretty extraordinary life to have. Second, this was one of my favorite classrooms ever. Professor Mahurin brings so much energy and enthusiasm. It is contagious. People were so thoughtful and insightful and willing to share their ideas as we read. I felt like we all came together and became much closer than is normal in Yale classes."

                "As a student who has only taken STEM classes while at Yale, this was a great literature class to take to get right into it and make me read books. In my distributional, I never did all of the readings and hated taking them but this was not the case in this class!",
                "If you have one brain cell, TAKE THIS CLASS!! That's all I have to say.",
                "Absolutely. Every English major should take this course TBH. Like someone make this a foundational course immediately. The syllabus is so important and is full of books everyone should read in their life. Also, class is just such a fun place to be because Dean really makes students feel comfortable and able to have fun with these texts that are kinda heavy sometimes.",
                "Yes! This has by far been my favorite class at Yale. Professor Mahurin creates an energy in class that is so conducive to making friends and getting to know each other that I found myself excited to go to class not just because of the information but the people in the class. Be open to credit\/ding tho this is not a gut class whatsoever but it is an important class!",
                "Absolutely! One of the best courses Ive taken.",
                "100 times over. One of my favorite courses Ive taken at Yale, a phenomenal reading list and engaging teaching style and professor.",
                "Yes. My favorite class in a long time, potentially ever. Move whatever you can to make it fit in your schedule."
