                "A wide range of things - bank regulation, the trajectory of the Chinese economy, USD as global reserve currency, how transitions happen in developing economies, how to make economic forecasts and models, etc. The class is very wide-ranging and Aleh brings in a bunch of fascinating guest speakers whenever they happen to be visiting Yale.",
                "Everything  macro, crises, economic models, climate, politics to name a few",
                "I learnt about Econ, but more about life. It was brilliant.",
                "The speakers were the best part of the course for me. The ability to go back and forth with them and ask questions to really understand their perspective is so much more valuable than just reading economists write articles. In terms of skills, I am not sure how many new skills I gained. I gained some more knowledge of large macroeconomic issues like the US debt and currencies.",
                "I learned how to think on my feet more (prof tsyvinski cold-called a lot), I got better at starting small and building up to something big, I learned more about economic situations that actually apply to my life (as opposed to things that are abstract),",
                "I learned about the global economic system, tax systems and debt, past economic crises, and the impact of climate change on economic models, among other things. This class is quite broad and we talked about new topics with Professor Tsyvinski or guest speakers each week, which was awesome.",
                "'ve gained in-depth knowledge of global economic principles, particularly in areas like international trade, finance, and policy-making. My analytical skills have markedly improved, as I've learned to dissect complex economic situations and understand the intricate interplay of various global factors. This course has also sharpened my critical thinking, especially through engaging discussions on current global economic issues and policies. I've developed a nuanced perspective on how economic decisions impact societies worldwide, which is vital for my professional and academic growth. Additionally, the diverse reading materials have enriched my insights into different economic theories and practices across various cultures and nations.",
                "In terms of material, I learned about important concepts in macroeconomics and the global economy. More importantly, though, I learned how to better engage in discourse, debate, and critical thinking around economics.",
                "I learned about so many fields of economics; a little bit about everything. Also, taught me the skill of forecasting and being able to predict with limited knowledge within a subject."

                "The course is one of the best econ course I've taken at Yale. The biggest strength of the class is the general lack of structure in the weekly seminar. Although this sounds like it'd be a bad thing, it's really nice to have the flexibility to discuss whatever the professor or the students might have on their mind that week. I don't think there are any major weaknesses with the class.",
                "Strengths: discussions were usually very engaging - Aleh cold-calls people but in a non-intimidating way, so everyone is engaged. It felt like there was a real class community which many seminars lack. Aleh is very kind, interesting to talk with one-on-one, and encourages us to explore our interests. Very low workload until the end of the semester. You usually get to sit outside, which is lovely. Some of the guest speakers were phenomenal.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings had very little to do with class\/generally the class felt very unstructured, which is both good and bad. Quality really varied week to week: sometimes we had fascinating discussions about how macroeconomic change happens, and sometimes the lectures felt a little long\/vague (at times it seemed like Aleh was oversimplifying macroeconomic research to the point that it didn't feel accurate\/applicable, and I would've appreciated a little more specificity or real-world grounding). Final essay is long and has unclear guidelines, and there are no grades other than the final.",
                "Incredible class all around. No weaknesses.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone. It was fantastic!!",
                "I absolutely love the cold-calling in seminar. This is one of the few seminars I was in where people were constantly paying attention and engaged for the hour and 50 minute block and this I think is largely because of the cold-calling. It's great and lowers the stakes for everyone's participation. Aleh is hilarious, kind, and really engaging.",
                "This class is incredible - Professor Tsyvinski is a great professor and he really keeps the class engaged. The conversations we had each week were very interesting, and the final paper at the end of the semester was a great way to let us research a topic we were really interested in. The guest speakers that Professor Tsyvinski brought in were also really interesting, and I really enjoed the very conversation-based structure of the class.",
                "Professor Tsyvinski is the biggest strength of this course. He demonstrated remarkable expertise in global economics, effectively conveying complex concepts with clarity and enthusiasm. This approach not only facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject matter but also inspired a genuine interest in the nuances of international economics. The discussions were another highlight, offering a dynamic platform for exchanging diverse perspectives and ideas. These discussions enhanced my ability to think critically about global economic issues, fostering a more comprehensive and multifaceted understanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the final paper was an exceptional component of the course. It presented an amazing opportunity to delve into a topic of personal interest within the realm of global economics. This assignment, guided by Professor Tsyvinski's insights, allowed me to apply the knowledge and analytical skills I acquired throughout the course in a practical, research-oriented manner. By exploring a specific area of global economics that I am passionate about, I was able to deepen my understanding and appreciation of the field, making the learning experience both personally and academically rewarding.\r\n\r\nI do not think this course has any weaknesses.",
                "This course is incredibly unique and offers such a different learning experience than others at Yale. I would keep the same, somewhat unstructured format. It was an excellent experience to just discuss and learn about important concepts, theories, and issues in macroeconomics from a leader in the field. However, I might suggest that class discussions at least touch on the assigned readings so that students can solidify their understanding of them and ask questions.",
                "Strengths was that the course was predominantly run through student discussions. Loved that structure, it gave everyone a chance to speak and add their opinion on the subject."

                "I would highly recommend this course to other students just for the opportunity to listen to and talk with professor Tsyvinski in a smaller setting. He is an incredibly smart guy with really interesting takes, and I really appreciate how much weight he gives to his students' opinions when engaging with them.",
                "Yes -- it's not like any other seminar I've taken and is a very fun and engaging fifth class. Expect a fair bit of neoclassical economic theory (e.g. casual anti-union sentiment), although also some very engaging discussions about inequality.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best academic opportunities one can have at this school.",
                "If you want to learn about life, take this course. It teaches you so much more then just Econ.",
                "Aleh is a great professor who genuinely cares about us. He wants to make class interesting and wants us to learn. Although some people may really like the \"off-the-record\" conversational nature of the class, I think the class would have benefited from a bit more structure. Aleh has a roadmap of where the class is going in his mind when he initially starts, and I think it would be great if he shared this at the beginning. Sometimes I would get so lost as we were off on some tangent imagining someone in the class as a dictator thinking about what resources they would distribute and I could not connect it to what we began class talking about. A bit more signposting and structure just to make sure the learnings are really understood by the students. The readings were completely unrelated to what we talked about in class, so I think linking these could better facilitate learning. E.g.,  when aleh mentions a paper in class or when we have a guest speaker coming on a topic, it would benefit us to have read about it before to ask better questions I think. The Oct 26th class on structural change models was another example of how more signposting would have been beneficial since we aren't using slides or anything in this class (which I think generally works, if the \"lecture\" is more structured). I unfortunately really couldn't tell you what I took away from this class, even reviewing my notes now as I write this review. Something about deciding the point at which you transfer resources to industry rather than agriculture being important. Wasn't sure of the broader implications of this teaching. The Nov 30th class on climate change I also do not know what I took away from. First we started talking about making a climate change model for economics and Aleh starts by saying \"The only thing you need to know is the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Also need the amount that it stays in the atmosphere.\" What does this really mean? I am not sure what a climate change model of economics really was that we were talking about? Are we talking about modeling the economic impacts of climate change? Mathematically modeling how the earth's temperature will warm? Then we moved to talking about how with a few state variables you can predict a probability that general patterns will happen. The conversation was too broad and general for me to be able to apply it to something realistic. Then we finish by talking about Acemoglu and Robinson finding that the climate of countries matter for the institutions they developed. I am not sure how this was related to a climate change model besides the fact that both ideas have the word \"climate.\" I felt this kind of confusion in many classes- not sure how this topic related to what we just talked about and not sure how it is related to what I see in the real world \/ how I could apply these theories. Aleh knows so, so, so much and so my only feedback would be to have more structure and concrete explanation in the lectures.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, the guest speakers were amazing and a real highlight of this course.",
                "YesProf Tsyvinski is wonderful and this class was like no other Ive taken at Yale.",
                "100% yes. This class is by far the best class I've taken at Yale. The topics are interesting, you get to learn and talk about what interests you, and Professor Tsyvinski is extremely knowledgeable and really listens and interacts with his students. If you have a chance to take Global Economy, I definitely recommend you do. It's a class unlike any I've taken at Yale before and I really enjoyed each session.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this class to any fellow student. You know how some courses just click and leave a lasting impact? This is one of them. Getting a spot can be tough, but if you do, it's a no-brainer  you've got to take it. As a last-semester senior, I can honestly say it's been my favorite course. Professor Tsyvinski often brings in some really high-profile guests, like top-notch experts in the field. These guest lectures are not just informative; they're a fantastic opportunity to interact with leaders in economics. It's like getting a front-row seat to the minds shaping global financial policies. The whole course embodies what I think of as the \"Yale Core.\" It's the perfect blend of academic rigor, real-world relevance, and access to thought leaders. As for the final paper, it's a chance to explore your own interests in depth, which is super rewarding. Honestly, it's the ideal class to cap off my time at Yale. So, if you get the chance to enroll, definitely go for it!",
                "Absolutely. Each class session is incredibly interesting, the workload is light, and Professor Tsyvinski is the best of the best. This sort of open, unstructured seminar style of learning is so rare in the economics major. You will learn a lot in this class but mainly through meaningful, guided discussion.",
                "Yes 100% if you like active discussion.",
                "I would recommend this course. The professor is amazing and knowledgable about a lot of subjects allowing you always to learn. The conversations you have with your peer are always something new and interesting that keeps you on your toes."
