                "Not many classes teach students interested in film about the techniques directors actually use in practice and with actors. This class definitely covers that in a way I havent found across film classes at Yale",
                "Film editting, basic history to filmmaking and directing, how to approach film set",
                "Super fascinating course - you read interviews with directors every week and then make your own short films applying the techniques you learned from each one. I ended up learning a lot about how to run my own small improvised film sets and by the end of the course had a wide array of directors I could reference."

                "Great syllabus. Lots of work. But fun.",
                "I think the film assignments every other week were great fun, but the quick turnaround was so, so stressful. I think it would have been nice to have the assignments a little bit sooner, or maybe they could be split up, so we had to shoot the film one week and then edit the next. I had to pull all nighters everytime I had to do it all in one week because of how quick everything was--and there was no way I could get around it because of how fast the assignments were outlined to be.",
                "The wonderfully kind professor and consistent\/well-thought out structure of the course. It's always a bit of work on the shooting weeks but if you plan it right it is very doable in addition to the readings. The professor was constantly giving us live feedback in class on our projects, very helpful \r\nProfessor was very understanding with COVID circumstances and such\r\nOnly improvement I would like to see is perhaps more group exercises to better build a family\/community out of the students, the few that we did were an awesome part of class",
                "Would love to incorporate some female and women of color directors in the syllabus!",
                "overall well designed course; perhaps more flexibility with how students can choose which weeks to submit assignments",
                "The class discussions and the assignments were great. The directors on the syllabus are chosen in a way that challenges the common film school paradigm - not every filmmaker follows the same script-storyboarding-shooting method, and getting to explore alternatives was liberating.",
                "This is a great class for people with no film or on-set experience, and for people interested in learning a lot of approaches. This class covers such a wide range of directors and craft that youll be able to find at least one that you click with  probably more than one. It gave me a much richer appreciation for their works. The readings are very interesting and well-chosen."

                "Absolutely, coming from a background of zero experience, this was a fantastic way to get into film and directing. I had a blast trying out all of these new things. This is a very \"Yale\" course that I think anyone interested should try to take if it's offered again.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Regardless of if you are a film major, this is a brilliant class that gets you making short films every other week. I especially loved that the grading was on the craft and techniques used, not the cinematography, so there was no pressure to have incredibly advanced shots which made the course super accessible.",
                "absolutely, esp those just interested in learning more about the workings behind directing and producing a film",
                "If you love filmmaking but have been disappointed by the theory-heavy nature of Yale film classes, give this one a try. Making a new film every two weeks can be intense, but it's so fun.",
                "This was the best residential college seminar Ive taken, much more useful than any Ive taken in the film and media studies department. This class gives you exactly what you put in  its not difficult to engage with the readings, which are fantastic, and then putting that into practice into your own short film  its a great set-up as long as you are willing to do the work. Additionally, Rachel was very accommodating when I sometimes slipped up and helped me to get back on track."
