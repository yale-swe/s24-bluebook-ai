                "Being new to American Studies, topics such as the constitution, founding fathers and fundamental legal principles were very new to me. Having not studied US History due to being abroad I found myself at a slight disadvantage compared to other students. However, I enjoyed the extra challenge and it helped to orient my learning in an American context. I developed the ability to effectively read texts on legal topics, which I previously had no experience with. I also developed my perception and understanding of law within the broader cultural sense. Leaving this program, I'm very excited and curious to see how my perspective has shifted in an effort to recognize legal concepts within literature, art and daily life.",
                "The history of American law, some branches of the law, and the comparison between different  law systems.",
                "I developed thinking skills, critical skills, analytical skills, and confidence skills.",
                "This course, not only helped me develop and rekindle, my love for law and legal thinking, but it also helped me take a more informed view of the world around me. Professor Linds instruction was not only enlightening, but incredibly unique, offering perspectives and opinions that Ive never heard before. Professor Lind made the class incredibly interesting, and the skills that he taught me, along with the concepts that he introduced, will help me produce better work in the future, while being able to evaluate the communities and World around me in a more effective manner.",
                "During the course I was given an insightful look into the law and what it consists of, not just in the United States but around the world. The course demands a lot of reading and critical analysis of legal texts, which definitely has helped me out.",
                "learn more about the US legal system from basic concepts like pillary",
                "I obtained a basic understanding about what is law and the topics at stake in the law, and also developed the ability to read law-related materials",
                "This class was my introduction to law in general, so I learned about the basics of some law theory regarding the 1st amendment, among other rights. I learned about law in different cultures and how different cultures write different laws to achieve the same purpose. I also learned about legal fictions, positivism, natural law, and more. The class honed my critical thinking and comprehension skills through the readings and lecture.",
                "The knowledge that I develop by taking this course would be understanding the American Law system. The course was a great way to slowing understand how our legal system functions and what aspects are important to note. The skills that I develop would be public speaking and communication because speaking in class as participation has helped with the understanding. The insights that I developed would be the constant debate that occurs in politics and what aspects are important to note when learning about law."

            "comments": [
                "The course was unorganized at times which made it more difficult to schedule and plan my studies accordingly. Having clearer and stricter boundaries concerning lecture and discussion duration would help improve the sense of disorganization. Personally, I would have liked to incorporate more international contexts within the program to highlight different legal theories across the world. Comparing different cultures would sediment the principles of American legal thinking more effectively while also provided non-Western centric perspectives. In terms of strengths, I think the course effectively positions students into a theoretical introduction to law. I hoped to gain an understanding of legal thought at the outset of the course and I feel as though that was effectively communicated.",
                "1. The course mainly focuses on American law, which is a little bit demanding for students without any American history learning experience. There can be more background information about the law system discussed in class.\r\n2. One of the TAs never replies to my email, which wastes me a lot of time waiting.",
                "The strengths are that the readings were talked about well and I was able to understand. I think what needs to be improved is the timeframe for the lessons. I believe that we weren't able to talk about everything in the first 2 lessons and if we would've I could've had more knowledge. But other than that the class was good.",
                "I think this courses core strength comes from its ability to highlight culture, not only a purely statutory lens, but also through a cultural view of the law. This is not only a unique premise for a law class, but one that is expertly taught by Professor Lind, and his teachers assistants. This was a major strength that separated the class from a traditional course on legal thought. This extra level of intellectual stimulation through the exploration of culture was invaluable to me during my my time in the class. I think the class could be improved if there was more group participation from those in the class. While theres not much for the professors or administrators to do about this, maybe more weight in grading can be put on the participation part of the class, that way I could hear more views from more people, which I think will lead to greater learning. However, this is a relatively minor defect in the class, and I think it can be compensated for the future.",
                "The course was extremely well taught and the teaching staff was absolutely terrific. I loved how the course was taught through an objective lens of the law, looking at both sides of every legal argument and giving the students the tools to decide which side is right or wrong. The corse however is very short, lasting only five weeks. The amount of material that has to be covered means that the Professor, through no fault of his own, most probably left out interesting details. These details often make a world of difference, and so it would be remarkably improved if the session lasted six or seven weeks instead of five.",
                "I hope there is more elaboration on some cases or judges mentioned. As an international student, I sometimes found hard to understand.",
                "The strengths are the curriculum and lectures as well as the readings. The teaching was very good and the topics covered were well chosen. I enjoyed and was interested by the readings and dicussions we had. The class may have been a bit more difficult for international students (the readings were complex and, at times, a lacking understanding in the American judicial system may have caused issues), but as I was not one, I did not run into these difficulties.",
                "The strengths of the course would be the communication and participation. Those two were strengths because the course was open to any comments that wanted to be made. Some weaknesses would be lecture and the organization. The lectures were a weaknesses because they were not descriptive so it was hard to understand the main concept of certain topics. Organization would be a weakness because there were times where the professor wanted one thing, but then disregards that matter. That can be improved with a set schedule for the students to follow along with the lectures."

                "I would recommend this course to another American student, or a student with a preliminary understanding of American history and politics. However, I know many of my European friends would struggle with the course's focus on American affairs. Apart from that, I would definitely recommend the program in the context of providing an introduction to legal theory and thinking.",

                "Yes. I believe everyone needs some introduction to legal thought, and the basic premises of the law, and this class did a great job of that. Not only was it interesting and engaging, but the content was made to be very digestible, allowing someone with no prior legal experience to not only understand the material, but participate in the debates that took place in the class. I would also recommend this class purely because it is interesting. Looking at the very essence of law, especially through a cultural lens is, in my opinion, some of the most interesting studies that one can take part in. Thus, I would recommend it to others, who are thinking about a career in the legal realm, or even the realms of politics and public service. I think almost everyone will be well served to take a class like this. And I would recommend it to anyone who asked.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in getting past the steriotypical view of the law that is seen in media and learning the brass tacks of what the law truly is. The course does require a substantial amount of reading each week, not to mention a seven page final essay at the end of the session, and so students wishing to enroll must keep that in mind.",
                "I will. It's a great introduction to the law.",

Before this course I was unsure what I wanted to do in the future because I wanted to be in the political field so this course helped me answer my questions."

Before I took Professor Linds class, I was set on only attending school in an undergraduate capacity, and I was totally closed after the possibility of working abroad. But after taking professor Linds class, not only has my love interest in the law and rekindled, but I also now have an interest to travel and see the world, and study the different legal and political system that exist there. This class, and professor Lind, opened my eyes to a larger world, in both the career and cultural sense, and I want to explore both of them in full.",
