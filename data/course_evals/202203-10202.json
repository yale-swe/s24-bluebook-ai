As someone who had not previously read or written poetry, I immediately enjoyed my introduction to poetry and to listening to popular poets of the past century. I gained insight into how poetry has affected modern life and popular culture to this day.",

                "This course was great because it gave me exposure to a wide variety of poems and poets. I wouldn't change anything about it.",
                "I really enjoyed all of Professor Hammer's lectures!  They were very well designed, and his readings show you so many different parts to the poem that you wouldn't have noticed before.  However, discussion sections were mandatory and sometimes were a struggle to get through.  The breadth of authors and time periods gives you a better sense of the poetry landscape after the 1950s, but at the cost of sitting with a few of the poems more deeply.",
                "The course was well taught my Professor Hammer who was well-prepared coming into each lecture and who presented extremely interesting and grabbing information which engaged the students. I loved the discussion sections where we could speak in more detail in an open and warm environment.",
                "Strengths: discussion sections are chill and very helpful for analyzing the poems for the course, course is not a ton of work and pretty easy (great class to take as a 5th credit, especially because you don't really need to go to lecture), Prof Hammer is very smart and incredibly kind to his students\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes boring and not super necessary to do well in section or on the essays which made it difficult to be motivated to go, and as an English major, I didn't find that this course added much for me intellectually",
                "A strength of this course is Professor Hammer's lectures. It's clear that he's passionate about poetry and really cares about the subject material. Lecture attendance decreased slightly through the semester, but I always found it a great joy to attend lecture and listen to what Professor Hammer had to say. Hearing him talk about poetry helped me learn how to think about poetry and how to read poetry. The TAs were also really supportive and always very responsive and willing to set up times to chat with me about papers (or anything).",
                "This shouldn't be a lecture class. As knowledgeable of a professor as Dr. Hammer is, the course is just boring.",
                "The professor was very well versed in the subject and enthusiastic about class. However, it felt very subjective in the assignments as most were opinion based",
                "Prof. Hammer will discuss the poems in class, and you get to experience and learn how he analyzes poems. Prof. Hammer is an incredibly eloquent speaker and from listening to him, you can learn how to analyze poems and write in the way he speaks.",
                "I think this course had very few weaknesses. One thing I might change was the timing. There was a bit of a long time between the first essay and the second essay and it felt a little rushed to do the second essay so close to the final exam.",
                "This isnt necessarily on the professor, but rather it falls on the TAs. Theres no emphasis on learning how to actually write a poetry analysis, so you are left in the dark when writing the first paper. Additionally, the professor allows rewrites to be up to the TAs discretion, which isnt fair for others in the course.",
                "Maybe it is because I just wasnt too interested in the course material, but the lectures felt a little dry most times.  Some more engaging lectures would benefit the class",
                "Great professor and engaging content.",
                "Strengths: Through writing and bombing the first paper, I better understood how poetry is supposed to be written\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I did not get back the grades for any of the other papers, so I have no idea what my grade will be.\r\n-The lectures were a tad incoherent\r\n-Feedback was unclear. I had to think for a long time and troubleshoot to better understand what poetry is about. Whether I actually understand is still unclear. My grade will be quite revealing.",
                "the sections in this course were its strength and offered time to really dive deeper into the poems we had read. the lectures i felt were too much of a monologue and i didnt get as much from just listening to the professor tell us about poems than i did discussing them",
                "Strengths: TA and Longdon \r\nWeakness: I do not like some o f the poets",
                "Surprisingly, I appreciated having a discussion section; the lectures were interesting, but it was easy to disengage sometimes, so having section gave me the opportunity to be more engaged and explore a selection poems in more detail (especially given all the poetry we read for class). \r\n\r\nI dont like having a final exam; a final paper is a better idea. Though the final exam wouldve been easier if we only had one essay question to answer instead of two; I felt like one of mine was significantly better than the other."

                "Yes, I would recommend the course to another student because it is great to explore different types of poetry and to continue to develop essay writing skills.",
                "Yes!  There is such a wealth of contemporary poets and poems that you don't want to miss out on.  Some of the poems you'll love; others you'll hate; all of them will shape you in one way or another.  You learn to experience a poem--the things that make it confusing, wonderful, or disturbing--about as much as you learn to analyze it.",
                "Yes, this is a great class to take to learn about poetry with or without prior experience, or to fulfill a writing requirement without being overwhelmed with work.",
                "Yes, if you enjoy poetry and are looking for an easy, low stakes class, this is a wonderful course! Lectures are a bit boring, but the course work is really manageable and Prof Hammer is incredibly kind and will make you appreciate poems in a way you never considered before",
                "Totally! Great writing course where you have to write a 4-5 page paper, a 6-8 page paper, and a 1600-word take-home final exam response, which is still good writing but not as much as some other courses. I really enjoyed the class and felt like I gained a great knowledge and perspective on how poetry was influenced by WWII and how it has changed since 1950.",
                "Would highly recommend. Quality teaching and conversations in lectures + discussion sections, and good flexibility with the workload so you can prioritise actually learning in the course.",
                "Not really. Unless you want a total gut and don't feel the need to show up to class, this class will bore you and feel like a waste of time.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in modern poetry.",
                "Definitely yes",
                "Yes, if you have a remote interest in poetry, this is a great class to get exposure to a variety of poets around the world in lecture-form. Each week, Prof. Hammer will discuss the poems in class, and you get to experience and learn how he analyzes poems. Prof. Hammer is an incredibly eloquent speaker and from listening to him, you can learn how to analyze poems and write in the way he speaks. In a way, if you attend lectures, it will significantly help you with writing your own essays and contributing to discussion sections.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed most of the poets we read, however, some poets wrote with many Biblical references (Derek Walcott for example). For me, this was hard to follow/read for the week. \r\n\r\nAs others have said, Prof. Hammer is really caring and it shows: there are lots of resources in this class, including your TF, that help you succeed.",
                "Yes! This course is fantastic and Professor Hammer is a wonderful lecturer. Each of his lectures is like listening to your favorite podcast! If youre on the fence about liking poetry, this class will show you how to love poetry from an accessible starting point. Highly recommend!",
                "It is definitely a great way to get a writing credit done without doing a lot of writing.  For that reason I would definitely recommend it to STEM majors who need to get this credit",
                "yes",
                "Yes!! Professor Hammer is incredible and the TFs are absolute gems.",
                "Yes because the professor and content are very good.",
                "If you have never taken an English class at Yale, I would recommend credit/Ding your first. Poetry analysis is a totally different kind of writing, and you likely do not really understand how to write a good poetry analysis. This class will not teach you this in lectures.",
                "if the student is looking for a course where they can really discuss and analyze poetry then no but if they like a lecture format and a more surface level experience with a lot of poems then yes",
                "Only if youre interested in poetry, I found this class tough because the material was very boring and so I was disengaged. But if you really enjoy poetry and engaging with it as an art object then take this class. If you just need a writing credit may not be the best bang for your buck",
                "Yes",
                "Yes! Take this class!!",
                "Id recommend it. Its one of those courses where you get what you put into it; once I engaged myself more, I appreciated the class more. Even if you know next to nothing about poetry, this class is for you! The papers have fewer constraints than other typical papers, so while that made writing them more difficult, it was a nice challenge."
