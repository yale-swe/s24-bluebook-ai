   "comments": [
    "It really gives one perspective and understanding of the current conflicts in the Middle East, but also just helps one understand the cultures. It also was really great because the course didn't frame things in some neo-colonialist framework and instead actively went against that.",
    "Survey view of Middle Eastern history from Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798 through to the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979. Analytical skills developed through several readings and papers. Readings in the course are varied and really good at facilitating historical skills.",
    "This course helped me develop an understanding of the complex and easily misunderstood history of politics, culture, and ideologies in the Middle East. This course gave me a new respect for and insight into the dynamic history of authoritarianism and religious conflict in the middle east.",
    "I would not describe this course as a simple crash-course on middle eastern history. I think that this course went beyond that. If you do carefully do all the readings and spend some good time with them, you get a pretty solid understanding of the various social, political, economic, and cultural changes swirling around in the middle east between 1800 and 1970. I feel like I've gained a broad understanding of the changes that were occurring in that region, and I've been able to put that understanding to use. At the same time, I've gotten a decent understanding of some more specific events that happened (ad are still happening) in various countries in the middle east. I also appreciate Professor Banko's interrogation of what 'modern' means in the context of Western imperialism."

   "comments": [
    "Course was organised well and the primary sources were really interesting and about intriguing topics. One thing I would fix is that in the first half of the course, the readings were a little disorganised; a lot of times readings for one week felt like they would have applied much better to a different week's topic.",
    "Strengths: great survey course of a huge period (from Napoleon's campaign in Egypt at the end of the 19th century to Saudi Arabian state development in the early-mid 20th century). I love how the course readings challenged the historiography and perspectives laid down by 'older' historians. I found the amount of readings reasonable (and so did all of them throughout the semester).",
    "The readings are astonishingly well-chosen, interesting and useful. The professor is also very approachable.\r\n\r\nI would say, however, that there's no clear single theme thread to the course and that we jumped around a bit and threw in a question of modernity when trying to tie it all together. I'd also point that the take-home exam is not a walk in the park and actually quite time-consuming. You end up writing the equivalent of three five-page papers, with some research done for each response. Perhaps a three-hour exam might be better in the end?",
    "This course had an excellent selection of readings. They offered both a breadth and a depth of insight into every aspect of history in the middle east. That being said, the sheer amount of reading was often difficult to manage. I can't say I would have preferred less reading as without all of it many of the viewpoints would have been presented from only one perspective (which would be a detriment to understanding the complex issues at play). But it was difficult to keep up with the readings. The lectures were easy to take notes on and the sections were enjoyable and helpful.",
    "I appreciated that the professor took care to include readings from historians, thinkers, and writers that were not from the West, and were not invested in (or by) harmful Orientalist discourses. I also appreciated that the professor included primary sources every week; they were very valuable to better understanding the changes occurring in the middle east. \r\nI thought that the lectures were sometimes hard to follow, and could have been organized and presented better. The lectures were always accompanied by power points, which were always packed to the frame with information so that it was hard to follow sometimes. The course begins by throwing a whole lot of information at you: all of that information could be organized better for understanding, I often felt at a loss and confused.",
    "Strengths: it's a survey of modern history in the Middle East. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) This course has an extremely sneaky amount of writing (4 weekly response papers of 5-6 papers each plus a final take home exam of ~15 pages means that you're essentially writing at least 35 pages throughout the semester); 2) the discussion questions for the response papers often made no sense or could not be answered by the week's readings, which defeats the purpose of calling them weekly response papers. I ended up having to carefully choose the few discussion questions which could actually be answered by the week's readings but it was an extremely frustrating process)."

   "comments": [
    "This course has a sneaky amount of writing--4 weekly responses in the format of 5-8 page essay as well as writing 15 pages for final take home exam.  I would much rather write a research paper or have actual essay assignments if I am going to write that much anyway.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. The workload is not that heavy which is nice, but fair and you definitely learn a lot more. Don't go into it thinking you're gonna be some Jack Ryan-like operative in the Middle East after the course. This is the opposite, and if you go into it with that mindset, I hope you'll have changed your mind. If anyone of you works at the CIA after taking this course I will be disappointed.",
    "Yes. You will learn a lot about the period in question (which will shape the way that you see the middle east in the modern day). Professor Banko is amazing and great to talk to in office hours. Lectures are informative and provide a good framework for the readings. The workload is reasonable and this incentivized me to seek out further resources in my own time as to explore areas I personally found interesting.",
    "It's a unique course. The readings are really cool too. If the final becomes a little less time-consuming and the structure of the class a little more coherent, I'd definitely recommend this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in middle east history or the larger history of authoritarianism, colonialism, or religious movements. This is a history course that could be very insightful to students of many other fields. I would not recommend this course for a first-year in the fall term or as a fifth course in general unless you need it or are prepared for the amount of reading. If you need a history course and are interested in political science as well, you'll enjoy this course. Global affairs types will like this as well.",
    "Yes, I would! Take this course if you are interested in getting a pretty good, broad foundation in the history of the middle east from 1800 to around the 1970s. I would caution anyone who decides to take this course to really pay attention to the readings, and to spend some good time with them. They can be a lot, but they're essential to understanding everything. And think critically: the history of the middle east from about the 1800 to 1970s is the history of West's forced intrusion into and underdevelopment of the regions in the middle east. The history this course teaches cannot be studied outside this colonialist, imperialist context.",
    "Not sure. I personally regret choosing this course. While I think I ultimately did well in the class, I felt lost, confused, and frustrated for most of it. Weekly discussion questions often couldn't actually be answered by the week's readings, it is actually IMPOSSIBLE to get an A on a response paper without using outside sources no matter how good your paper is (though this was never communicated until after grades for the first two papers came out), and lectures were sometimes disorganized and unclear. Professor Banko and the TF were very kind, however, and you will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. Professor Banko is a great teacher and helped me numerous times outside of class to talk over the material."
