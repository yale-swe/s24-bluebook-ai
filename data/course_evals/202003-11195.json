                "The strength of this course was the positive energy brought by Zhou Laoshi. The weakness of this course is the impossibility to teach a language class to a large group of students in 50 minutes on Zoom.",
                "Strengths: Zhou Laoshi is an excellent teacher. He is very concerned with the success of all his students and is very involved in making sure everyone has a successful experience in the class. The textbook has really interesting topics which are helpful for having more thoughtful conversations about Chinese society. The homework is consistent and clear. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The Quizlet homework is easy but useless. Like all language classes, class sessions are participation heavy  if you are the kind of student who gets anxious when called on randomly, it will take some getting used to the class format.",
                "I took this course over Zoom, and had very few problems with it. Zhou Laoshi is great, and managed to keep us all engaged through our screens. It could only have been improved had it been in person.",
                "I really enjoyed the discussion format of the course - it allowed me and other students to practice our speaking (as it is hard to outside of class). What I found to be challenging\/what could be changed is the fact that we learn our lesson before we review it, making me spend hours upon hours trying to figure out words I havent learned yet. My suggestion is to first review what we will be learning, then assign homework on it.",
                "Professor Zhou is a wonderful instructor, and I looked forward to every class. The organization in this class is what makes it so strong: Zhou Laoshi prepared a syllabus for each day of class, complete with vocabulary and grammar examples and exercises. The oral presentations were a lot of fun. I think the difficulty with this virtual setting, as well as the size of the class, was the class time we each had to practice the vocabulary and grammar structures. We could only utter a few sentences each in the class period, but with that said Zhou Laoshi was very even in the students he called on. I think a smaller class size, or more breakout rooms, would be helpful to practice further.",

                "The flexibility of the tests were very helpful. However, the lack of speaking time and character writing means that I don't feel like my speaking or writing abilities improved much at all. I also think 12 people is simply too many for an advanced language seminar online. Classes should be 8 maximum and better would be 4-6.",
                "The canvas quizzes and homework assignments are very fair. Although it takes some time getting used to taking timed quizzes, they were good practice and the instructions were explained well. Zhou laoshi and Liang laoshi were also very considerate of our online workload. We only had two major exams instead of the usual three and our final exam was turned into a final essay. \r\n\r\nDuring class time, I think it would be better to have more group activities and breakout rooms. Sometimes it felt like we were spending too long doing review exercises as a class when it would be helpful and fun to do them with our classmates instead",
                "The course worked well over Zoom. It had its challenges, but nothing unexpected. Perhaps having students raise their hands as opposed to cold calling them would have made things more engaging.",
                "I think this course did all it could given COVID. One thing I wish that could have happened is more use of the share screen feature, which could allow the teacher to demonstrate more visually rather than just audibly.",
                "This class went very smoothly as a live virtual seminar, as did weekly tutorial sessions. Breakout rooms were helpful when we had them. The virtual remote format made it difficult to engage as deeply with the class as we could before, and especially out of the classroom for Chinese table lunches, Chinese cultural events and activities (like dumpling-making). Chinese tables still continued virtually, but it would have been fun to have one each or every other week just for our class to engage in Chinese without the formal class setting.",

                "Yes. If you are interested in continuing studying Chinese at Yale, it is well worth it. Most students in the class have already studied Chinese for a few years and have gone on a Light Fellowship. If this is the case for you, it often feels less challenging than the high-intensity environment of the Light Fellowship programs, and thus it feels like you make much slower progress. That said, I think it is important to continuously study the language so you don't lose your gains from the summer. If this is the case for you, Chns 154 is a good choice to help you maintain and improve your Chinese level  especially if you want to learn more about literary Chinese.",
