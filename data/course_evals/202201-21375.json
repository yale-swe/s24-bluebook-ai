                "Telling stories was a great section that taught the importance of narrative in all aspects of society and humanity. The content was very interesting from a philosophical perspective. In terms of the standard Engl 114 skills, they're pretty basic and probably stuff you already have seen. Craig does do a good job explaining them though and your writing will get better purely because the prompts will force you to expand from the AP Lit/Lang essays you might have been writing before. Since the prompts are complicated you'll have to learn to build a complex argument castle, as Craig explains, and you will want to keep the writing as direct as possible to avoid confusion. Craigs feedback is very detailed and helpful.",

The essays force you to really focus on your writing in a way you probably haven't before. Discussions were great near the beginning but sort of tapered off as the semester progressed. Great community feeling in the class.",

                "Yes. If you need a writing credit this is definitely one of your better options. Craig has a great personality. You get great feedback and your writing will improve. The Engl 114 curriculum seems kind of dumb and although they say its very different from the 5 paragraph essays you wrote in high school, its really not. The biggest con is you don't get a lot of flexibility in your writing style and choices.",
