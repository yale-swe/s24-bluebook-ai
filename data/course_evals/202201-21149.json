                "It was an extensive look at the role journalists play in shaping the American viewpoint. We read a lot, and a lot of what we read was fascinating. Analyzing the role of the journalist as an individual agent rather than just a reporter of events was useful, especially from a professional in the industry.",
                "introduced me to the field of conflict journalism and the questions of journalist responsibility and ethics, purpose of journalism, objectivity vs. neutrality, opinion journalism, differential coverage. I also learned a lot about the specific wars/ \"case studies\" we explored every week.",
                "Lots of questions and a few answers about the intersection between media and conflict.",
                "I gained the ability to critically think and analyze articles and other forms of journalism. It made me look past the superficial layer of most articles to find other meanings the journalist might've had.",
                "I learned many, many questions that one can ask about journalism.",
                "How to think about reporting, its impact on different audiences, how to wrangle very difficult question about journalism styles and when they're effective, tackling questions about tradeoffs you have to make as a writer. Really high level insight and ways of thinking about journalism when you take a step back.",
                "I learned a lot about the theories behind journalism and the bigger picture of what it means to make journalism. The course itself felt less about media and conflict as in war and more about the questions of the implications of media in general."

                "Strengths-the format. It's one of those classes that you'll get as much out of as you put in. The conversations, bouncing of Prof Wood, always seem to weave in and out and always left me with more questions after class. I also learned a lot from the perspectives of my classmates. This is a true seminar\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-It's a true seminar. Sometimes it lacked structure and felt a bit drawn out.",
                "Honestly one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. Wish I would've taken it sooner, because I am thinking about writing my senior thesis on a topic within this field. The different case study every week centered around a different topic of discussion made the class super interesting, and I was super engaged all semester.",
                "Strengths: The guest speakers and the professors breadth of experience. Weaknesses: The lack of a comprehensive front to back social studies look at the topic.",
                "Overall, this was an excellent class. If all Yale College seminars were like this I would not be dropping out.\r\n\r\nOften, we only talked about 20 pages of the 200 assigned all class, and I wished I had taken the time to read those 20 more carefully instead of reading the 200 superficially. Therefore, I think this class would benefit from Prof. Wood shortening some of the readings.",
                "Strengths: excellent set of readings, engaging class discussions, awesome guest speakers, well balanced course workload, Professor Wood made himself a mentor and extremely accessible outside of class to answer all kinds of course/industry/life related questions."

                "100%. Professor Wood is fantastic.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in journalism. While the baseline level of interest is necessary, it will likely increase if you take this course. It's rare to take a class from someone who works professionally, at a high level, in the industry you're analyzing.",
                "Yes absolutely! Even if you are not interested in pursuing journalism, which I am not either, it is still a field that you should critically explore, and the readings and writing assignments in the class are great enough to take it for that reason!",
                "Yes, as long as they are very aware that this course is more of a weekly discussion group than a course. The readings are interesting and the topics are important, but most of our meetings ended with \"I don't really know where to go from here,\" as opposed to \"Alright that built on last week and next week we'll build on it more.\"",
                "Yes, the dry title might deter some students, but the course material is very interesting and accessible. Professor Wood also does an incredible job facilitating the discussion and probing us to think more on the things we bring up in class. I have never left a class feeling like I know the answer, and that's a good thing in this course!",
                "Yes. Professor Wood creates an environment where students take the lead in discussion. As a result, as students we are able to ask important questions about war journalism and challenge each other in ways that build up own depth of knowledge.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. Professor Wood is an expert practitioner and an excellent teacher in the Socratic mold.",
                "Yes. not many journalism classes at yale, and this is a very interesting topic. taught very well.",
                "Absolutely. Learned tons. I read the news differently and think about journalism in a different critical way having taken this course. If I ever decide to write journalism and try my hand at reporting, this class has equipped me well to do so.",
                "Yes, but only if they're ready to get into the trenches with the bigger picture questions of journalism."
