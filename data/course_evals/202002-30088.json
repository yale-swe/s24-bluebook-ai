    "Learning about dreams and about people throughout history and their theories about dreams",
    "How to read difficult texts such as Descartes and how to interpret dreams in different ways.",
    "comparing and contrasting different theories, critical thinking, important differentiations in concepts of dreams",
    "Ancient to modern day philosophers' views on dream. How the theory of dreams are explored or critiqued in some films.",
    "I learned about the humanities. Learned the dream analysis and psychological skills. And get some related reading for this course. Improved my understanding of psychology and Humanities.",
    "I learned much about the history of dream interpretations as well as different viewpoints and approaches to the concepts of dreams and selves.",
    "I learn ways thinkers interpret the dream and both how to link dream to reality and how unecessary to mess with dream and reality.",
    "I learned how to interpret dreams and how to think critically about dream theory. It was great for writing without there being too much pressure on formatting or English conventions.",
    "Many different theories of dreams!",
    "how to disect my dreams",
    "A whole hell of a lot. We covered the rudiments of Freudian dream-analysis with a depth that allowed me to analyze and appreciate my own dreams (free therapy, seriously!). We covered different models of the mind, building on and responding to Freud's Ego-Id-Superego model. Within the same course, within a month, we considered metaphysical questions about the relationship between 'dreams' and reality, the line between the two, and even the evolution of answers to those questions across cultures, time - especially before\/after the advent of market capitalism. As part of the course, I began a dream journal. I gained a multi-faceted appreciation for the role of dreams in my own life and in the world around me, one astonishingly deep for a summer course.",
    "I learned a lot about the different theories surrounding dreams and how to respectfully discuss and interpret the dreams of others.",
    "I improved greatly in terms of my skills to go through a great amount of dense reading in the most efficient way possible. It also helped me with reading works critically."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked how we had a protocol each class summarizing what we did the class before. There seemed to be a lot of material we were supposed to get to but ran out of time for.",
    "There was too much reading to fit into the time between classes which is usually just two days, especially since the readings are very difficult.",
    "discussion was a strength, but some of the texts are extremely long and a bit difficult to read. Of course, the short time frame is more to blame than anything, as I'm sure we could have covered everything at a comfortable pace otherwise.",
    "Strength: the assignments gives us opportunity to interpret about our own dream (which was cool), and the films were interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: some readings are very nuanced and difficult to understand",
    "This class was really really well done - especially since it was over Zoom. Prof. North was fun and engaging, and he created in interactive atmosphere which I haven't seen before in an online class. The material was diverse and thought-provoking, and I enjoyed it as an exploration beyond my typical STEM courses. The only problem that we ran into was that we ran out of time. There were many pieces that we didn't have time to engage with at all, and because we were sometimes skipping and sometimes delaying readings, I had a hard time knowing what I needed to do to prepare for lecture. This meant that sometimes I read material that was never touched upon, and other times I didn't read the material that was discussed in the next class. Perhaps trimming the reading list would help with this, and it would allow in depth exploration without pressure to keep moving forward.",
    "I thought the class was very well rounded and enjoyable. I couldnt list any weaknesses. It is very engaging and requires a fair amount of work. The teaching was well rounded and used many different approaches. It also had a wonderful diversity in materials and activities used for the course.",
    "There are a lot meaningful discussion and breakout room which offer students a broader chance to engage and more perspectives in the understanding of philosophical texts.\r\n\r\nWe did not go over all the texts and did not spend enough time on some hard texts near the end of the class because of the lack of time.",
    "too much material over a short period of time. especially films became hard too keep up with over time.",
    "The strengths are that the zoom course was really effective - the professor had all of us unmuted all the time and it made for really engaging discussions. Also, the professor was less concerned with the minutia and moreso with how well we understood overall concepts. There wasnt really any way this course could be better.",
    "Great course on a subject that is shrouded in mystery for most people",
    "Professor North is really passionate about this class and is extremely aware of student needs. The TA's, Peter and Clara, were also amazing, and always happy to give extra help.",
    "more student engagement",
    "I think this course suffered from being compressed - we dropped a few smaller readings because we ran out of time. The course still felt very complete even without them. \r\n\r\nOne unusual strength of this course and the instructor is that they really hit the nail on the head with everything in regards to Zoom and Canvas. Everything was set up to be as engaging and accessible as possible, avoiding many of the usual problems of distance learning.",
    "The course was very interactive and was strong in it's participatory elements and interesting readings and films.  I don't know how this course could be improved.",
    "The course was well thought out. The materials were interesting, and the topic itself was intriguing and unique. The only complaint would be that I wish we  could have cut down the number of works that we went through and spent more time on certain pieces, as they are all works worth examining in great depth."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It was very enjoyable to attend and everything we learned was interesting",
    "No. The classes seemed to drag on and were not very riveting. The texts were not interesting to read and were very difficult and long given the the short time we had to read them.",
    "Yes, it is a very thought-provoking class, and it will definitely challenge you to think of new things with an open mind.",
    "If you are looking for scientific approach to dreams, then you should NOT take this course. Throughout the course, we posed more questions about the dream than we originally had before taking the class. The questions we had to answer were very philosophical and multidimensional. Definitely not a class if you don' t like to navigate through ambiguity and nuances which philosophers and directors intend.",
    "I would like to recommend this course because this course is interesting and nice for students to learn. It can be helpful to learn more skills and improve knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was greatly enjoyable and the course to success was very clear. The teachers and assistants were very engaged and enthusiastic about the materials. It was a wonderful experience!",
    "Yes.\r\n\r\nThis class offer not only the knowledge of dream but also a chance to evaluate ourselves through the class.\r\n\r\nThe discussion in this class is meaningful: there are inspiring ideas and logical analysis in the class discussion.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor North leads very thought-provoking conversations in class and has chosen an excellent array of sources to review.",
    "Take this course!! Really fair grading, fascinating discussion, and a great way to connect with classmates despite the virtual environment.",
    "Absolutely. Intellectually challenging, not overkill workload, interesting content, great professor. Not sure what more you could want.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing. The best class Ive taken in my three years at Yale.",
    "yes",
    "It's a fantastic course, I would recommend it to everyone. It's loosely defined but potent, so no matter where you're coming from, you'll get a lot out of it. You'll get to watch some cool films. You'll learn about yourself and ponder metaphysical questions from a weird and fresh perspective. The one thing that you might want to be wary of is that much of the class (dream-analysis, sharing dreams in class) requires a certain level of openness. You're not obligated to open up, but you will probably get less out of the course.",
    "I would recommend this course because it was the most well-handled and interactive online course I have taken.  It was very engaging and covered a lot of fascinating concepts as well.",
    "Yes. It is a great course if you want to get an introduction to philosophy or humanities."
