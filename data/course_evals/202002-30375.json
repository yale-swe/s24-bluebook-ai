    "I learned the remaining verb tenses that we didn't do in 110, and learned more nuances of the language.",
    "More complex grammar including the subjunctive, si impersonale, infinite verb constructions, etc. \r\n\r\nNew vocabulary including the workplace, arts, the city, and nature.\r\n\r\nConversation practice.",
    "I learned a lot of Italian.",
    "More complex grammar topics than L1, such as subjunctive and future tenses.",
    "Learned Italian grammar",
    "I learned so much Italian and feel confident in my skills. I learned more about Italian culture, history, regions,etc. What I learned went way beyond just the language and grammar. I am very happy with this course. I truly learned so much and had fun at the same time!!"

   "comments": [
    "I think it would've been helpful to work a bit more cumulatively, instead of just working chapter by chapter and moving on once the test is done. Doing a cumulative exam would've been helpful to actually make us go back and review what we learned earlier.",
    "Strengths: engaging professors, great textbook with a lot of practice and activities, other activities like movies and culture discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough time to discuss culture and practice conversation because we moved very quickly with the material. A lot of work to study each night before class.",
    "Strengths: Excellent, dedicated professors. Smaller class was helpful to get enough speaking time in, especially on Zoom. Breakout rooms were used well. I liked the 10 minute break in the middle of the class--two hours would've been too long. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Zoom fatigue. Also class went very quickly, but this is to be expected in such a fast paced summer course.",
    "Strengths-Professors!! They really want you to learn.",
    "No weaknesses at all. This class had only strengths. The Professors really cared about the students and that made a huge impact on the course. Since the class was small, I really got to know everyone and made friends along the way!! By far the best Zoom course I have ever taken as it was so engaging, fun, interactive, and challenging. If you are willing to put the work in for this course, you will feel so accomplished and proud of yourself at the end!"

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this to any student who wants to continue to learn the language, and especially to those who don't have experience in other similar languages, because the pace is pretty slow and very clear.",
    "Yes! It is engaging, fun, the professors are amazing, and Italian culture is wonderful!",
    "Absolutely! I genuinely enjoyed taking this class every day. Try to get Anna Marra as a professor--she is fantastic and incredibly dedicated. You learn a LOT, so you need to put time in. But assessments are graded fairly and they understand that you are learning a huge amount in a short amount of time.",
    "YES! The professors are fantastics, and they focus more on learning than on grades.",
    "Yes. It's a good way to do your language req.",
    "YES. I think its important to understand that this class is intensive and will have a higher workload due to the nature of the course being only five weeks long. However, if you are willing to commit and put in the work, you will be very happy with the end result in terms of knowledge! If you work hard and study, the grading will reflect that. I always knew of my academic standing in the course as I was constantly getting feedback on my assignments in a timely manner (had amazing graders who really worked hard to get to know us and help us improve!). The Professors alone are worth taking this class. They are so sweet, fun, come up with amazing exercises, and create such a wonderful learning environment. I was never scared about speaking up in class or saying a wrong answer because they made sure to listen and use it as a chance to learn rather than make a student feel less confident. That was incredible! Also I ran into wifi\/power issues during an assignment and the Professors were understanding and made what would have been a very stressful situation not stressful. The class was so engaging even while being on Zoom. Even though I was not able to go to Siena for the study abroad program, I am so glad I still decided to take the course remotely. I truly have developed a love for the Italian language and culture! AMAZING PROFESSORS, AMAZING CLASS!!!! Yale is very lucky to have Professoressa Anna and Megan!!"
