It was helpful to think through design, specifically relationship between content and form, from the perspective of graphic design. I gained skill in working across multiple media with design and knowledge of graphic design history.",
                "LEARNED SO MUCH! Developed my own style, design ethos, new design tools (digital and hand), theory background, self-descipline",
                "I developed a really critical eye at the finer details of design, and gained a strong understanding on the principles of good design. This course is a great example of one that teaches the rules before advocating for breaking them, and had some very intriguing readings.",
                "I learned more about my design process, different graphic design techniques, and how to incorporate feedback into revisions.",
                "I gained a better understanding of my own process as well as methods to approach design challenges. Seeing, discussing, and critiquing others' works honed my ability to analyze designs as well."

                "Weekly prompts are great, good amount of readings and exciting with guests and archive visits. \r\n\r\nIf anything, it would be helpful to talk about the idea of developing a personal design language at the beginning of the course so the students know this underlying objective and can work towards it more determined. It will help to think across and more holistically about the individual assignments and exercises.",
                "Strengths - intense, tons of improvement from class, mix of generation and refinement of material , each project was interesting and dynamic, well-designed \r\nWeaknesses- very very high workload (maybe offering one week free pass or something in case a student has a tough week? Really tough to catch up if something goes wrong)",
                "Definitely an intensive crash course into design! Taught me a lot in a short period of time, definitely made me a better designer, but the workload is VERY heavy and four hours on a Friday is intense.",
                "The course was really well-organized and engaging. I do wish that there was more instruction regarding different programs such as Photoshop and InDesign.",
                "The diversity of projects was super interesting and fruitful, but because there were so many projects, several felt a bit rushed. While I loved exploring so many different strategies, having more time to bring each project up to a higher standard would have been more satisfying."

                "Yes, but be prepared to work really really hard!",
                "Yes, but please be mindful of the workload. I would consider myself a really fast designer, but this class was still a lot to handle. The weekly assignments are pretty brutal, but intensely rewarding if done properly and revised.",
                "Yes! Pamela was super sweet, and the assignments were extremely engaging. From reading about process, I also feel like I developed a better understanding for what my process looks like and tools I can incorporate. I would just warn that the amount\/intensity of assignments really pick up towards the second half of the semester, so really make sure you are able to manage your time well.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in furthering their design skills, even if you're not an art major!",
