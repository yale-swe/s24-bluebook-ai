                "i learned more about poetry analysis and NOT TO USE MIXED METAPHORS and really focusing on writing concisely, writing a thesis, supporting that thesis. it was hard, and poetry can be intimidating sometimes though, but i really appreciated when prof north broke things down",
                "I had never taken a class on poetry, and I learn a lot. I learned that I love poetry. I learned that poetry takes a lot of effort to read properly. I learn about the history of literary movements, especially Romanticism and what it really meant to these authors.",
                "We honed our skills in the close reading of poetry as well as learning a little about the craft of it.",
                "I definitely learned a lot by our close reading of the text. We really spent time going into the minutiae of the language, sometimes even spending a whole class on a handful of lines. I liked being able to spend time meditating on how a single word can change the entire meaning of the poem, or even reveal different layers of depth."

                "i loved how prof north broke things down and we took time to read the poems aloud in class so even if i hadn't done all the reading, i could learn and orient myself, but he def graded essays more harshly than i expected which i think had two effects 1) pain. he's very particular about language, mixed metaphors, clear thesises, etc. and that can feel overwhelming to ppl new to poetry\/yale english 2) it pushed me to try harder, work harder, write better and hopefully do better with my analysis and writing so that I could write more clearly. he's also just generally a kind australian man, but his office hours can get a lil busy cuz he's ADUS of english",
                "I think the real strength of this course is the intense and long time we spend on few lines. We'd spend the entire hour and 15 minutes on 13 lines, and I loved it. Learning how to really read and analyze metaphors and follow logic and interpret is amazing. I talked to someone in the class who didn't enjoy that, so I could see why they didn't like this class as much as I did.",
                "The class was extremely engaging, however, there were times we could not get to the poems that we read beforehand. I don't think this is a bad thing because I liked how much time we spent on individual poems.",
                "Strengths: I really liked how the course was geared towards class discussion, the class felt so student led and everyone was really engaged and offered such great insights. I liked how we started the class every day by having each person check in and say what's on their mind, it was good for getting to know each other and be comfortable with each other, and made the class dynamics a lot better. The professor did a really good job of making everyone feel heard and comfortable as well.\r\nWeaknesses: I'd say that the biggest weakness was the lack of diversity in the syllabus. I was really disappointed that in our entire semester, we spent a SINGLE class on a non-white poet, and (1) it was only because she was visiting Yale and going to speak here and (2) we didn't even talk about one of her majority of poems that addressed race. I understand that all of the poets we talked about were very influential and very poets, but I really hope that future classes might better address how poetry navigates spaces of inequality, told from the actual perspective of minorities."

Taking a poetry class like this helped me appreciate and understand poetry so much more. Like I really couldn't understand so much poetry, and I feel like I can now.",

                "Yes, in general I loved spending so much time really diving into the poetry itself and having such great conversations every class. I felt like I learned a lot just by slowing down and focusing on close reading rather than speeding through large chunks of text at a time or feeling obligated to cover many poems in one sitting."
