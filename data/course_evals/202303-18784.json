I cannot stress this enough but there were not enough peer tutors to support the overwhelming number of students who needed help. In addition, group coaching was not a resource I was made aware of early enough to meaningfully impact my grade. It helped me understand concepts to a deeper level, but by the time I got the help I needed, the semester was basically over. I think these resources we have should be made more visible earlier on.",

                "There is plenty of help if you are struggling with anything. The topics are pretty interesting as you are able to see how many of the formulas are derived and how they apply to real life. Topics are adequately explained, and I found the online tutorials very useful.",
                "Strengths: lots of support available in the form of office hours and review sessions\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes topics felt like they were taught in a roundabout way\/more complicated than the topic actually is, had to look for other resources to learn from"
