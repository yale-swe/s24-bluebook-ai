    "One of the biggest strengths was that we took time out of class to evaluate and cover everybody's projects. It was incredibly collaborative within the classroom, and the professor was very good at curating conversations within the classroom.",
    "The strengths of this course were the syllabus and Professor Reed.",
    "Strengths: Incredibly knowledgeable professor, engaging and diverse readings, most course flexibility I have ever seen in a class at Yale\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only once a week, classmates could make it through without reading so we did not get to deeply engage with some texts as I would have liked",
    "Great course, amazing to be in a class with your major, glad AfAm does this."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Even if you're aren't an AFAM major there's a lot that someone could derive from this class.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student who is interested in African American Studies, even those who don't major in it.",
    "Yes, even if you are outside the major. I just found the material incredibly helpful for understanding the evolution of some debates in the African American Studies field, and I really enjoyed a small seminar with everyone that was similarly interested in these topics."
