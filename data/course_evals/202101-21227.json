                "Strengths: Interesting material (at least for me). Shiller is obviously super knowledgeable and would take about current events which I really appreciated and found interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: So disorganized. The most disorganized course I have ever taken. Professor Shiller sometimes didn't know how to work Zoom. He won a Nobel Prize, he can't work Zoom? Even worse, lecture would end early sometimes because his laptop died. Unfortunately, the situation is only worsened by the TFs. They do not know what they are doing either, so there are multiple layers of disorganization that lead to confusion. There is so unified section each week, the TFs review what they want.",
                "Strengths: Material was very interesting and relevant. Felt as though the workload was very manageable\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures covered very little of the math that was present on psets and exams, meaning almost all of the graded material came from section which was quite odd.",
                "Professor Shiller is obviously a very knowledgable man when it comes to the Finance world, but he's a terrible professor at teaching the subject of financial markets.",
                "cool class.",
                "Very clear explanations with recorded lectures made learning material easy.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shiller's domain knowledge and stories\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture was fairly dry, and included lots of historical details but less mathematical\/conceptual explanation",
                "Extremely difficult course to sit through. Brutal lectures",
                "The content is interesting a d important",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Enough practice\/TA guidance on quantitative aspects of the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Truly the worst professor-led lectures that I have watched. They were often completely irrelevant to course topics. We started with 60+ students attending zoom lectures. At the end, we were in the teens. None of my other classes saw this drastic of a dip in student participation. More time spent on random historical facts and personal anecdotes (irrelevant to financial market topics) than on quality content.\r\n- Unreasonable grading time for exams. Second midterm took over a month to return to students. First midterm also took far longer than standard for an Economics midterm\r\n\r\nHow to improve:\r\n- have a different professor teach this course\r\n- lecture about relevant materials\r\n- actually care\r\n- significantly reduce the history section of the course. students did not sign up for a history course or to listen to the professor talk about how often a term was used over history--completely useless\r\n- respect students' time. show up to lectures on time \r\n- choose TAs who want to teach",
                "The strengths of this class is listening to Shiller's anecdotes, and experience, which is very cool. The weakness is that while the tangents can be super interesting, it is never clear from his lecture and from his slides, which topics are covered in the exam \/ related to the course.",
                "great content, but low engagement. very few people came to lectures",
                "It's a good course. Professor Shiller is great. Maybe the reading requirements for Fabozzi textbook should be clearler. The textbook is way too much to read.",

                "The course was a recorded lecture and while this was very suitable for students, not many people would end up going to lecture. This was rather unfortunate and while I felt that the recordings were easier to take notes on, I would liked to have seen some degree of mandatory attendance, even if it was just for the professor.",

The professor's lectures were so terrible that I literally understood less after lecture than I did before, which I also know was true of my friends. The class was poorly structured - problem sets were unhelpful, and no solutions were ever uploaded for practice exams which makes literally no sense.

                "Yes an interesting class and not terribly difficult.",
                "NO! Absolutely not. Do not take this course under ANY circumstances. I do not care if you want \"clout\" from taking a course taught by a Nobel Prize winner. This is the worst taught class that I have ever taken--and that includes all of high school and middle school. I don't doubt that Professor Shiller is brilliant, but he is an AWFUL professor. His lectures have nothing to do financial markets. I saw more newspaper clippings and niche historical facts than actual economics\/financial markets topics. So many irrelevant slides with some random Google Ngram. 80+% of students gave up and stopped going to live lectures. \r\n\r\nThis basically was a self-taught course. The Fabozzi textbook actually talks about financial markets unlike Professor Shiller's lectures. Yale should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a low quality course. There is no way that the teaching team and Economics Department are oblivious to these glaring issues. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Worst taught class ever. Extremely low quality learning environment. Nice professor, but can't (or don't care to) teach. ZERO REDEEMING QUALITIES. Yale needs to get rid of this course or completely overhaul it. It is actively ruining Yale's reputation as an academic institution.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about finance from a broad perspective or anyone who wanted an introduction to ideas, methods, and institutions related to finance (on a more theoretical approach). If you are someone who is serious about pursuing a career in finance, then you should take ECON 251 instead as it is a lot more math heavy.",
