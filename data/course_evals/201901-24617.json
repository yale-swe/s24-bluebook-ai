    "Phenomenally enlightening course on the complex intersectionality that black women poets embody today in America. And in general, a huge push to look at experimental poetry (and by extension, \"non-experimental\" poetry) in a new light.",
    "I learned about how to read work by Black American Woman Poets and to think about experimental poetics.",
    "I learned how to think critically about race, gender, and identity both as they relate to literature and in general. This class taught me an amazing amount about how to think critically and differently about issues.",
    "My ability to analyze poetry and think deeply about important, big concepts improved dramatically with this course.",
    "Learned so much about contemporary black female poets!! Learned how to analyze poetry in a major way.",
    "A great exploration in to a fairly new and exciting field of experimental black poetry.",
    "I learned to read poetry critically and place things in context"

   "comments": [
    "The course was really excellent but I found a lot of the poetry really hard to access; I wonder if there's a way to introduce each book more comprehensively before sending us off to read it? It's frustrating to read for several hours and not get much out of it.",
    "People seemed a little nervous at first to participate for fear of saying something wrong, but loosened up as the semester went on.",
    "This course is great; Maryam and Professor Rankine were a great team.",
    "This class only has strengths! It teaches students a completely new system of thinking, has really interesting material, and is engaging.",
    "The class was really successful with two professors leading it. The organization of the class made it easy to follow with a new poet or book of poetry to focus on each week.",
    "Loved the two professors, loved the material, loved everything tbh",
    "Very well structured. The balance of Professor Rankine with an equally brilliant Graduate student made for a fantastic course that was very honest.",
    "Strength is the diversity of readings and discussion in class. Class could be improved by more feedback during the semester on how we are engaging with our reading in the reading responses."

    "Yes definitely!",
    "Yes definitely!! Take this class! It's fantastic and very student-focused, while still being extremely well-organized and planned for clarity and structure. I couldn't recommend it more!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in poetry. It is so important to study the poetry that people are producing right now and by centering on the work of only black women we were able to specify and focus our discussion.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Professor Rankine is AMAZING and really cares about her students learning and is so brilliant. Maryam is also the GOAT.",
    "YES.",
