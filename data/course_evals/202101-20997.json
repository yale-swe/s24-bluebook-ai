                "The course is really bad. It's only strength is the small class size. The teacher uses a terrible text book, that he doesn't follow. The text book uses it's own set of formulas, and the teacher says not to use them, and provides a different set of formulas, thus making the textbook almost completely useless. The teacher explains problems terribly, thus putting the student in a tough position, because they don't understand how to solve problems like the textbook or the teacher. I would also say, this course is too math heavy. It's intro economics, I still have no idea how the market works! Instead of trying to understand the market through math concepts, why don't we just focus on economic theory's and gain a strong understanding of them. Also, there are only 4 homework assignments. These are long problem sets, however, you can get a max of 10 points on each problem set. Thus, these problem sets to very little for your grade, putting heavy emphasis on the midterm and final. I think this class would be much better if it had smaller problem sets worth more points, thus promoting a better understand of the subject. Several smaller tests focused on specific concepts we learned in class would also be more beneficial.",
                "Tolga was great. He definitely seems to care about us, and was more than willing to further explain things and go over things again when asked. He was also giving out seemingly good life advise throughout the class, based on what he was talking about that day.",
                "i liked how straight forward it was, very clear",
                "The material for this course can be dense and challenging, but a strength of this course is that Professor Koker breaks it down in a way that is approachable. Having access to recorded lectures (both from the current semester and past recorded lectures), was immensely helpful because it allowed me to take more time with difficult concepts. Professor Koker also included links to supplementary materials that were really useful for studying. Overall, Professor Koker's experience and organization of this class was its greatest strength. I can't think of an area of the course that I found particularly weak."
