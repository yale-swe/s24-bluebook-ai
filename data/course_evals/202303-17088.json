                "Strengths: I appreciated the journal club-based format of the class. It was also nice that the class was so small, as it created a really friendly environment. I also felt like there were an adequate number of problem sets and assignments throughout the semester, though I would have much preferred only a final paper/project, and not a final exam as well. \r\nWeaknesses: The constant format of 60 minutes of presenting a paper followed by 50 minutes of Professor Mak lecturing got a little repetitive at times and made the class difficult to sit through for 110 minutes. Maybe a five minute break between the paper presentation and Professor Mak's presentation would be helpful? Problem set grades were also released very slowly and made it difficult to know how we were doing throughout the semester.",
                "i liked the weekly assignments and readings - there was a good mix of topics",
                "Strengths: Amazing course material and Dr. Mak is a fantastic professor who is supportive of students. The presentation format allowed everyone to dive deeply into the papers they chose.\r\nWeaknesses: The reading responses were not always the best way to assess learning. Some other way to test our knowledge of the papers would have been good.",
                "The course is an interesting set up, I enjoyed how the students would lead lectures and then the professor would follow up after.  The matlab was interesting and fairly easy to use. It could be improved with a bit more continuity between weeks, but overall good course.",
                "This is a great course",
                "The class is oriented around student driven discovery and reading, which encourage the study of subjects based on personal interests."

I felt like the first class was more chemical / molecular-focused, whereas the rest of the semester was very much focused on biophysics, which is great so long as that is what a student is interested in! Professor Mak is also a great resource!",
