    "We covered several canonical, famous works of political literature and philosophy, which provided a well rounded education in the politics of emotion across geographies and time.",
    "- close reading \r\n-broad understanding of poltical philosophy \r\n-historical and emotional reflection of political sensibilities",
    "I learned to read from an eclectic range of writers and topics, and to draw connections between them.",
    "A deeper understanding of what we mean by politics and a more nuanced understanding of how our emotional lives impact our public lives.",
    "This class pushed me to think much more carefully and critically about how I conceive of emotions, culture, and their political valences  through a dizzying array of genres, from poetry to the philosophy of history to theories of aesthetics. Being able to work with Profs. North and Oskian was an absolute joy; their dedication to their students, and their willingness to meet one on one to discuss our work, proved enormously helpful  and I always appreciated the rigor with which they pushed me to undertake my work. Overall, a wonderful and highly engaging course.",
    "a framework to think about emotions, a foundational aspect of human behavior. very helpful course to make one a stronger thinker and writer"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "While classroom discussion was fruitful, it was often difficult to cover the extensive amount of reading in one sitting\/discussion, which sometimes made reading the material feel futile. Additionally, the course deadlines were not adhered to, and occasional late online postings of the week's readings made it inefficient to complete work for this seminar on time.",
    "I really enjoyed having two professors in this course. The back and forth was stimulating, and it really justified the interesting and unique structure of the syllabus.",
    "I think it was a good course with a strong syllabus, but felt that the conversations in class lacked cohesion. It was difficult to link the literature concepts with the political ones and felt discouraged to contribtue to class discussion. I think if you are a humanities major you have a major advantage.",
    "This was the first time the course was taught, so there were some kinks that needed to be worked out, but it's certainly worth reworking for future semesters. I would have appreciated the readings and essay topics to be posted sooner so I could plan my schedule more easily.\r\n\r\nMore generally, the readings were all individually interesting, but the various weeks were somewhat disconnected. Perhaps having the essays require more synthesis across weeks rather than asking for five pages on a single text. I also wouldn't have minded if the course zoned in on a very specific topic and explored that with more depth. The interdisciplinary aspect of it was great, though.",
    "The course had potential in the ideas it wanted to focus on, but failed in its execution. The professors did not collaborate well, nor did they create a good interdisciplinary discussion. Instead we would switch between disciplines without integrating or rigorously doing either English or political philosophy. Professors were supportive but egregiously unresponsive to emails. They ended up continuously pushing deadlines due to ill-planning which made it hard to plan for the course.",
    "Strengths: the readings were great.\r\nWeaknesses: co-teaching a seminar is tough, as is leading an interdisciplinary discussion. At times, discussion felt a little uninspired.",
    "The reading was at times dense. The paper topics were excellent. The discussions could have used much more structure; they felt long and rambling. Id rather have had them broken up into more engaging and interactive components.",
    "One of this course's greatest strengths was the tight focus of its reading load  even though it was a once-a-week seminar, we never read more than around 80 pages for any given class, which allowed us to go much, much more in-depth on any particular reading in class than I'm ordinarily used to. If this course had a weakness, I'd say it was mainly in scheduling  we couldn't stick to the schedule that had been planned at the beginning of the semester for our three essays, which meant that the last two got pushed back significantly. Although this definitely gave us more time to work on them, it also threw a little bit of a wrench into the works near semester's end, and I felt a little adrift on my last essay.",
    "The co-teaching format works very well. Joe and Giulia offer two perspectives that are dissimilar but also coherent. The course itself has a strong narrative as well, starting from theorizing, to sensibility, to case studies. It has a rhythm that is never too overbearing, but balanced and ultimately rewarding"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but it is a lot of work, so make sure you're genuinely interested before signing up.",
    "Definitely worth taking the class!",
    "I did not like this course. I took it because it was required for my major. The discussions were at once undirected and stifling.",
    "Engaging humanities course with a relatively light work load.",
    "If you have an interest in the topics it covers, absolutely.",
    "Im neutral. I think the course has a lot of potential but needs more structure.",
    "Absolutely. I'd never taken a co-taught course before this one, and Profs. North and Oskian played to each other's strengths so, so well. They each had their own areas of expertise, which were highlighted as we progressed through the course, but even when they were speaking about a field that they hadn't studied as intensively, the degree of respect and intellectual passion they showed for each other's work was palpable. Also, the readings are a smorgasbord of incredible texts  from classics of 18th-century philosophy, to the work of the man who coined the term \"close reading,\" to the poetry of Audre Lorde  all of it worth your time, and all connecting to each other in eye-opening, resonant ways.",
    "Solid seminar, especially for the humanities student. The materials that the course offers is very applicable in many disciplines, and offers a great framework to think about literature, political institutions, history, etc. Vert intellectually rewarding."
