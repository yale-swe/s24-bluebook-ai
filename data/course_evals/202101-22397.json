We learned about current topics of detecting nuclear testing by certain countries, induced seismicity, discussed what role science plays into the entire discussion of risks and how scientists should present their information.

                "Maureen is the best Professor ever!",
                "you cover a ton of different geoscience techniques which are distilled down to basic scientific concepts. you go through material really fast, and there is a lot of peer to peer learning which i really liked. no weaknesses on my end - sometimes the material got a bit dry and technical (in my case i was looking for a good, memorable but not gutty SC credit to take) but it's better than other SC credits i've taken before.",
                "Maureen is a wonderful professor who is excellent at explaining concepts to non-stem majors. The assignments are rewarding and I learned useful skills, like how to read scientific papers.",
                "This course was amazing. The assignments varied enough to keep everything interesting and the organization was great.",
                "The main strengths of the course like with Maureen. She truly is a gem of a professor incredibly kind, engaging, and supportive of her students. Especially given the fact that this semester was really challenging on us for a number of reasons, Maureen was so accommodating and really went out of her way to make the semester as manageable and enjoyable for us as possible. In terms of the course, I think it offers a nice change of structure from many other science courses. Being taught as a seminar, with discussion and participation a big part of classes, makes the course especially engaging for non-STEM majors like me. Additionally, the course is really accessible to students of all science backgrounds, which I also loved because it meant I got to be in class with students from all different majors.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Long is an absolute gem\r\n- Readings can be hard but incredibly helpful in improving your ability to read complicated information and evaluate it\r\n- Presenting a case study and writing a paper will make you deeply knowledgeable about a topic you may have never heard of before; it is super fun to dive that deep into the unfamiliar and it also very empowering to learn that you can understand complicated information if you break it down using the techniques you learn in the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Class is very very focused on student presentations -- this is nice but occasionally tiring, sometimes would have preffered to hear more of the professor's/TA's input on the topic",
                "I think a strength and weakness is the structure of the class. We would always start with the case study and then go into discussion -- I feel like it might've been beneficial if there was more fluidity in the discussion because it felt somewhat like a Q&A between the presenter and Maureen vs. the rest of the class. Though, I also appreciated the organization of the class -- it was well prepared for and all of the information for the class was easily accessible.",
                "The course lets students engage closely with a particular topic that they chose for their presentation. I also liked that the term paper was due at the 3/4th point in the semester instead of the end because it lessened my workload at the end of the semester.",
                "Strengths: grading is fair and expectations are clear. Instructor is very approachable and the subject is not difficult to understand for non-stem majors. \r\nWeaknesses: felt that some case studies were inherently treated with higher importance so balancing can perhaps be more considered.",
                "it's really an excellent course. sometimes it would be nice to take things a little slower, but that's really it."

Take this class if you can get a seat, you won't regret it!",

Do not take this class if you want to skim them - you will learning nothing. Come ready to engage in the material and you will have a very joyous learning experience.",
                "Yes, Maureen is a super nice professor: she's super understanding and supportive of her students. You definitely learn about a lot of interesting case studies and it's an experience to take a science class that's not in the traditional lecture style. If you take it any other year, you will probably have a more hands-on experience and go see mass specs in labs and such.",
