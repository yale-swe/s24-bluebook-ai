                "A strength of the course is how engaging the material it is. A weakness of the course is the specific way it is difficult and a lack of learning objectives. The homework is frustrating as I do not feel like I would be able to do it without going to the professor for help or seeing how he does it in class. While I ultimately am able to complete the homework, I do not feel like I am reinforcing the skills we learn in class. I think the problems outside of class would be more rewarding if they more directly aligned with their lectures and if the lectures had explicit learning goals. We learn a lot each class, but I am not sure where I should be prioritizing my focus. Saying at the beginning of class \"Today, we will learn how to correct for the Gibbs paradox and how to use the Sterling approximation\" would be beneficial. Otherwise, I am unsure what I should take away from the class. I often wonder if I should be focused on the math or the concept. In the most recent classes, I really appreciate how the professor asked if we had any questions on the previous lecture before and that he would review a simple scenario/formula when introducing a complex mathematical tool (e.g. taylor series, geometric series, sterling aprox) before using it for a derivation.",
                "Any question--from one on the subject-specific concepts to math--were all viable. It was a really welcoming environment.",
                "The strengths of the course are that the material is reviewed several times, and the classes are led by student questions. The weaknesses of the course are that it lacks a coherent structure, which can make the material very hard to follow. The in-class derivations are difficult to follow, and a lot of steps are skipped over without much explanation. The homeworks are also very difficult, take a long time, and no feedback is given, so it is hard to know if you are keeping up with the course.",
                "More structured lectures",
                "no feedback was given on work",
                "it was very informational but the content and lectures were a little too all over the place for my full understanding of many concepts",
                "The strength is the absolute brilliance of Prof. Batista, who gave all lectures without ever looking at his notes and deriving all things on a chalkboard. This is, without exaggeration, an exceptional professor from whom you can learn a lot and he always takes great care of ensuring everyone who wants to understand the concepts does so (as such, he responds to every question asked)."
