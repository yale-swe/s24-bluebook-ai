                "Need less professors teaching it. Need to not let anyone have over 70 slides for a 50 minute class",
                "Strengths: all lectures were recorded which made it easy this semester to stay on track during isolation, and also rewatch difficult content.\r\nWeaknesses: many of the exam questions were confusing or asked questions about extremely specific lecture topics.",
                "I thought it was really cool how this course brought in experts from a wide variety of fields to teach lectures. I also liked reading the scientific papers, though I wish the journal clubs were something you could opt into as an MCDB major rather than being required. Another weakness was that the exams, although open-note and open-book, were super specific and required you to remember one of many lines from one of many slides from one of many lectures, all of which were taught very differently from each other. After the first exam, I felt a lot of pressure to write down every single thing the lecturer mentioned, which made it harder to tease out what was important to know from what wasn't.",
                "The course introduces a lot of varied topics and so students wishing to learn a lot in a short amount of time will greatly benefit from this. However, the lectures being taught by different people each time means you are really rolling a dice when it comes to the lecturer's engagement with students and the course.",
                "I think there should be more to this class than just the exams",
                "Strengths: several excellent lecturers that were passionate about their work; introduction to new, presently unpublished work in the field; fair exam; no p-sets and low weekly workload \r\nWeaknesses: some lecturers were not strong-- fortunately the teaching team helped decipher relevant content from an over 250 slide presentation for 50 minutes",
                "The class material was so interesting and it was great to get many perspectives with various profs.",
                "I really enjoyed the variety of professors as they all were passionate about there chosen area. The only problem was it caused there to be some confusing overlap of concepts.",
                "Strengths: lectures were interesting and showed what doctors actually do in the field + their research interests, professors helpful\r\nNot really a weakness, but sometimes lots of little details in lectures, so having open-book midterms was helpful",
                "The tests were challenging because the teachers submitted questions with varying levels of detail.",
                "I like how we had many different professors each one talking about their expertise and what they are passionate about. However, some people were not suitable for teaching; they were just physicians, which decreased the quality of the lecture.",
                "Strengths--I think the content of this course is super interesting, and I'm glad I learned it!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--the fact that each class is taught by a different lecturer makes the course feel a bit disjointed. Sometimes the quality of the lecture is not great, and sometimes the material overlaps with a different lecture. Some of the professors are truly fantastic though!!!",
                "Really good class love that each section is taught by a different professor",
                "A strength was that every lecturer was an expert in their field. A weakness was that the vast quantity of lecturers made it hard as there were so many different teaching styles you had to adapt to. Therefore, the amount of lecturers was a strength and weakness.",
                "Strengths: wide overview of many topics involved with reproduction, ethics of reproduction, new technologies. \r\nWeaknesses: each lecture is taught by a different professor. The quality ranges substantially.",
                "I loved this class! I liked that each lecture was taught by a different expert on the topic it provided a greater depth to the lecture content that I think helped me learn the material better. I also liked that the class met 3x a week because we got to cover a large number of topics in reproductive bio. I also feel like I got a thorough introduction to repro bio without getting bogged down in too many tiny details I also learned a lot that is applicable/relevant to my own reproductive life and I can actually relay the information I learned to non-science friends really useful and interesting class!",
                "The strengths of this course was all of the different professors and research you got exposed to. The exams were also very fair. The weaknesses was that some of the lectures were better than others but overall every lecture exposed you to interesting and current research.",
                "Each class is taught by a different professor, which can make it difficult when studying for the exams. Content is emphasized differently by each professor so it is difficult to anticipate what concepts are important.",
                "Guest lecturers. While some were amazing and very engaged and fun, there were others who should not have been teaching at all. I think it also made it very difficult to streamline what information we were supposed to learn, as many different lecturers had different styles of teaching. There was some info from slides that we were supposed to know and then some spoken, but with the different teaching styles, it became much more difficult to know what we were supposed to know. \r\n\r\n3 midterm exams as the final grade. There is nothing fun about that, and it creates a bunch of unnecessary stress for the class in the way that this would be the only grades for the class with no other methods and methodology for grades if we are only relying on a curve. Since this information was not discussed outside of those lectures, it was much more difficult to understand things. \r\n\r\nI do think having the lectures recorded was a smart decision; it made it much easier to go back and retake notes."

It made it hard to know what to expect on exams, since different professors like to ask different styles of questions, and a lot of information overlapped but it was hard to distinguish things...if that makes sense.",
                "No, the exams are deceptively difficult and it was hard to stay engaged with the class and its content throughout the semester.",

                "I would recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in the biology that goes into preparing for reproduction/childbirth. While some lectures are very technical, I feel like even non-MCDB majors could learn a lot from this class.",
                "Yes, this is a good MCDB class to take",
                "Biology of Reproduction runs like a medical school course. As someone interested in learning about the reproductive system holistically from a variety of talented professors, I would recommend the course. I found it to be an excellent break from the very cell-level bio classes MCDB majors are required to take. However, this class has a tendency to be a bit disjointed from lecture to lecture. If you are willing to take the extra time to rectify minor differences between information presented by lecturers, it is certainly worth it.",
                "If you need it for a prereq yes",
                "Yes, the professors and TAs really care about student learning and were eager to teach.",
                "I would I really enjoyed and thought this course content was very important to real life.",
                "Yes, I learned so much about reproductive biology that I didn't know before. I think it's a class for not just those interested in med school / working in the reproductive health space but also for all, because knowing how your reproductive system actually works and ethics/law issues associated with the assisted reproductive technologies we can use today is really essential.",
                "Yes this was a super interesting course for those interested in reproductive bio.",
                "Depends on what you're looking for! It's very low workload, and it's interesting, but I don't feel I was intellectually challenged in the course, and the lectures can feel a bit disconnected because each class is taught by a different professor.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody that has an interest in this topic.",
                "yes, especially as an upperclassman -- nice to hear from different doctors if you're premed especially even if you're not planning on going into the specific field",
                "It's a medium workload biology credit, which is good for the major. It was nice that the lectures were recorded, so I really only thought about this course in the few days leading up to each of the 3 exams.",
                "Yes! Very interesting, great connections to faculty, and very doable workload.",
                "Yes! Very little work each week -you just read one paper if you are an MCDB major for a very low-key discussion section each week other than that there are three multiple choice exams for the class and thats it if you are looking for a low-stress, straightforward biology class (but you still learn a lot!) this is a great class for you!",
                "Yes!!!! MCDB 250 was the best science course I've taken at Yale so far. All of the lectures were super interesting and I feel a lot more knowledgeable about the human body as a whole.",
                "Relative to other MCDB classes this course is good. You should know that all of your grade is dependent on the three exams, which can be incredibly unpredictable.",
                "Yes, because it was a very good course and all of the professors had great strategies to promote learning and to help the students engage and stay focus and motivated.",
                "I think that some of the content was very good but the class itself was not well made. I would not recommend the class to another student based on the information and the lack of information that could be obtained as a result of my experience in the course."
