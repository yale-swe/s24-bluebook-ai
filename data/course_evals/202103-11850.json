                "They give hard Psets, no curves.",
                "Great course to learn interesting topics in math. Weakness: some problem sets were long and the problems very difficult compared to what learned in class.",
                "The course is very well organized. The units learned in class correspond to the textbook which is very clear and helpful. I felt like there was always support if I needed it (office hours and peer tutors). The content was interesting, and I enjoyed how much real-life application it had.",
                "The Ximeras were very useful to understanding the content and reviewing on days without class",
                "Strengths:\r\nI liked how every class was structured, as it went through the material we needed to learn in a very direct and straightforward manner. All the concepts were taught in a nice and clear manner. I also really liked the textbook we sometimes used, as it explained topics very well and provided great examples that I could work through and understand.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI would liked slightly more interactive activities in the class. I felt like I didn't get to know my classmates well enough, only the few of them that sat next to me in classes. During class, there is rarely any time to talk to one another, and although we do discuss some math questions at times with our \"neighbors\", we rarely get to talk to another for more than a minute. I would have liked to have more worksheets, which give us a chance to work with classmates as well.",
                "The resources provided for this course were very helpful to understanding the material outside of class. I enjoyed having many options, such as peer tutoring and office hours, where I could work closely with others and ask specific questions to clarify the concepts learnt in class. In addition, the review sessions held before each exam were useful for reviewing pertinent material.",
                "The variety of professors is extreme and makes all the difference about the students' success in the class.",
                "In class we didnt work enough on problem\r\nSets.\r\nThe office hours were really useful",
                "The instructors were very helpful, the structure was easy to follow and there was a lot of review help. The peer tutoring sessions were great too.",
                "The class does well at teaching calculus 1 and introducing students to college-level work. No weaknesses.",
                "More instruction on the problems we will see on the exams and problem sets instead of the basics on each problem and not getting to what we actually need to know.",
                "Overall, there was a very clear structure to the class and it was very well paced. The review sessions hosted by teachers and the transparency regarding which topics would appear on the midterm exams was very well appreciated by students. The exam difficulty was also very balanced in my opinion, and was manageable if one put in considerable time to study and know the material well. I generally felt that putting the hours and effort into the class that I did yielded returns in terms of class performance (which doesn't happen for all classes) -- I think that's great because the class challenged me to work hard and rewarded that hard work appropriately.\r\n\r\nOne strength and perhaps a slight weakness(?) of this course would be the p-set assignments; while the peer tutoring system offered immense support and was very helpful, the level of difficulty on some of the p-sets was such that for me personally, there was absolutely no way to ever complete one without seeing a peer tutor and asking for help. This reliance on peer tutoring could easily handicap students if we did not have great peer tutors (which we luckily did) that did not know how to assist us with the p-sets.",

                "One strength was organization. There was a pattern for classes and assignments that I could easily follow. Another strength is the availability of peer tutors throughout the week. \r\n\r\nOne weakness would be the psets. They often don't correlate with testing material.",
                "The strengths of this course are that ximera is extremely helpful- especially the example videos. The weaknesses are that the psets are extremely tough and legnthy and without the help of peer review sessions would have been very difficult to do on my own. It would be super helpful to do some review in class.",
                "This course benefits from being taken by so many students and that calculus at this level is taken by so many students across the globe, meaning there are plentiful resources within the university and online (e.g. Khan Academy and the like). On the same token, given that there are so many students, the course doesnt have much individualized attention. Not that I think it is feasible to really have in-depth one-on-ones, but I think it would have been beneficial to collect general, anonymous feedback once in a while from the class to see if a majority of the class understands a topic or would like simpler examples (as the ones done in class are sometimes difficult to follow).",

                "I would recommend to a student if they need this as a prereq. Even if they placed in a higher math course level, they should still take this class because it allows you to study calculus from the beginning in a more theoretical manner that allows you to truly understand what calculus is.",
                "Yes, I think the skills and knowledge acquired during this course are extremely needed. The ximeras are also extremely helpful for those who are struggling with the material.",
                "Yes; I feel like this course teaches foundational skills which are used in a myriad of fields. That being said, I would say that there is a large element of independence, following up on your own, and using resources outside of class that is necessary in order to fully understand course material."
