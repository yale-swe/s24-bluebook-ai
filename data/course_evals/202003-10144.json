                "You get a relatively comprehensive overview of the genre of ancient comedy, its characters, plot devices, and more. As with any L5 course, it was a great review of grammar, as well!",
                "I learned how to read early Latin, compare and contrast two works of literature, and understand Latin on a stylistic (in addition to semantic) level, and, most importantly, understand the distinctive features of Classical comedy.",
                "I learned to translate and understand  significant amounts of Latin text at a level of volume and difficulty that I had never done on my own before.",
                "I have read in detail two Ancient Roman comedies, the Menaechmi of Plautus and the Hecyra of Terence, in addition to several other plays in translation. This breadth of reading has shown the relationship that comedies share across time and place, informing my reading of other Classical works.",
                "By reading 2 whole plays in latin (a large part of the course's homework) it was inevitable that we would get better at the independent process of figuring out the Latin for ourselves and interpreting before contributing to class discussions. \r\n\r\nContributing in Zoom classes was also a central aspect towards our learning which included both speaking, sharing ideas (especially effective in Breakout Rooms), and listening attentively to classmates (who would often enhance our learning just as much as Prof Solodow for their rich and diverse comments)."

            "comments": [
                "The syllabus is pretty broad and covers multiple authors in some capacity, but centers around the two plays we read in Latin. I think that this was a pretty perfect format to introduce someone to the genre of comedy--the syllabus itself was a strength of the course. Prof. Solodow is also a fantastic teacher and a great asset to his students.",
                "Strengths: We read around 9 comedies during the course, which was not as much work as it seems because we read most of the works in translation. However, we did read two plays entirely in Latin (Menaechmi and Hecyra), so we got to explore Latin vocabulary, style, syntax on an advanced level. Breakout rooms were a great opportunity to work in small groups and get to know our classmates.\r\n\r\nImprovements:",
                "One weakness in this course is the pacing of the works in translation. Whereas we would have weeks to read the plays in Latin (around 100 lines due every class period), each assigned play in translation was due within one class period, which sometimes made it difficult to read them in time (especially the Beaumarchais). One strength of this course is the collaboration we are allowed\/encouraged to embrace in preparing and discussing the Latin plays and the English translations.",
                "The choice of texts (both in original and in translation), the thoroughness + rigour of the homework preparations we had to undergo, and the instructor's insightful lectures and willingness to open up to class discussion made the course a joy to partake in. On the latter point, given how diverse our class was (ranging from Freshman to Seniors) the class-discussions and the breakout room exercises made for particularly enriching discussions and invaluable learning. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I would have like to see more pre-recorded lectures outside of class that we could watch beforehand(?), but I understand that this was limited by the professor's desire for us to do most of the research and preparation for ourselves and entertain these conversations in class in real-time. Attendance in-person and synchronously made the class work particularly effectively too."

                "I don't think Prof. Solodow could have done better with the virtual format--the breakout rooms were more often than not a success, and I really enjoyed the way that he conducted discussions in this class. The online quizzes worked just fine, and the oral exams were incredibly fair and a good reflection of what a test under regular circumstances would have been like.",
                "Successes: Having the midterm and finals be oral was a great decision. It made the whole experience less stressful and avoided the difficulties of proctoring an exam over zoom. Also, Prof Solodow held an extra, optional translating session once a week where we could go over any questions on the Latin we had.",
                "The discussion of both Latin grammar and the literature itself  during class in break-out rooms and with Professor Solodow were very good for engaging the class. Prof. Solodow's extra translation review session was also very helpful.",
                "The Breakout Rooms were particularly effective as an opportunity for us the students to do more talking and express our own thoughts about the course content. Perhaps the professor could have 'floated' between zoom rooms to listen to our discussions and add his own opinions rather than just when we reconvened in the main room?"

                "Yes. It was interesting, fair, and led by a kind and knowledgable prof--that's all you need, I think.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The plays we read are witty, suspenseful, and, of course, funny. The Latin of Roman Comedy is often conversational, informal, and earthy, an interesting contrast to the Latin we read in high school.",
                "I think this course is very good for improving one's ability to understand Latin in the context of interesting texts, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in that.",
                "Latin 437 is a good course for someone who is possibly interested in majoring in Classics or who wants to experience \"archaic\" or \"non-Classical\" Latin for the first time. Plautus and Terence are a good introduction to this era of the language and its fun oddities. Comedy is a fascinating genre, and Latin 437 offers a good introduction to its roots and a survey of its evolution into the modern period.",
                "Yes, if that student has already a very strong degree of existing Latin knowledge - the course requires students to have a very strong grounding in Latin to be successful in the course since the course puts a keen emphasis on careful and intricate independent preparation ahead of class sessions - interested students should be willing to dedicate hours towards studying, deciphering, and interpreting the Latin independently before coming to class. As an international student who had studied Classics in the UK for 5 years, this was still an intensive course but enormously rewarding for all the material covered.",
                "Certainly.  Professor Solodow is an excellent instructor with a nuanced understanding of the texts, and is skilled at drawing attention to the artfulness of the various playwrights studied."
