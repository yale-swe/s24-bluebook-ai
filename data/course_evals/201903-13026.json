    "strengths: types of essays we read, engaging discussions, interesting writing assignments, small class size lends itself to individualized teaching, helpful feedback; weaknesses: as soon as you turn in a final draft you pretty much have to start the next essay",
    "Strengths: Incredible experience because there were only 8 students and one very dedicated professor, had great class discussions, meetings on essays, and meaningful essay prompts.\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "",
    "Strengths: becoming a stronger writer. My professor was always willing to help.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the pieces we read could have been better selected.",
    "I love the discussion based classroom structure and a majority of the readings were very interesting and applicable to my own writing. Another major strength of the class is the small size so that everyone has a chance to workshop their writings. Some of the readings were long and convoluted and it was hard to follow along, especially when there wasn't a lot of context surrounding work. Overall a great class!",
    "Not too much reading, easy to engage in class, lots of feedback given"
