                "Professor Crew's class will teach you how to think critically and analytically about primary source publications. Class discussions focus on fostering student abilities both to interpret scientific data, and critique it when necessary. The class is organized so that each week covers a different signaling pathway. By the end of the course, your understanding of cell signaling will improve significantly. I have noticed that my understanding of network cross-talk and regulation of cell signaling has improved as a result. I feel better able to design experiments to study cell signaling.",
                "How to read primary literature, how to understand a variety of experiments, controls, how to design experiments and write a grant proposal",
                "This class is a great opportunity to learn how to think critically about papers. I had never approached reading scientific papers in this way before, and it definitely changes how I approach research. You also learn many new techniques and their theory, which is helpful for future experimental design.",
                "This course offered great insights into the workings of scientific writing and reading. It allowed me to understand how to better approach reading scientific articles and extracting information from them, but also how to critically approach the evidence presented in them. It helped formulate better and stronger scientific thinking, and taught me the importance of scientific literature in informing scientific ideas and experiment building."

                "Great class! My one critique is that sometimes \"action items\" took up a lot of class discussion time, which took away time from paper discussions. I like that by the end of the course, paper discussions shifted to more big picture discussion of the results and their implications. This shift could have occurred earlier in the course.",
                "Strengths: learned a lot about signaling pathways and the seminal experiments involved in discovering them, learned about scientific experiments and how to evaluate the experiments, got to know my classmates well\r\nWeaknesses: could have used some more guidance with the final grant proposal",
                "The course material is challenging and you learn a lot in the course itself. I really enjoyed the final project but wish there was more feedback along the way or it could relate more to our current research (but understand legal concerns here). The conversation about the papers is always interesting and you definitely get much better at reading papers. I also really enjoyed the action items because it exposed me to a lot of new concepts and methods. I do wish that we could have discussed more good papers since many of them were pretty flawed, or discussed the logic more beyond the figures. But overall, I think it was well-structured.",
                "This course is well structured to allow students to be at the center of discussions and the learning process. It requires a lot of self-directed learning, but at the same time offers an opportunity to evaluate evidence and scientific writing in ways that made me a better science student. I learned how to think about scientific literature critically, and how to engage with it deeply and constructively. I appreciated the class discussions, and the fact that we were able to formulate opinions on the papers we were reading. I appreciated the breadth of pathways that were covered in the course, and the opportunities we had to read papers within different fields of cell biology. I would have appreciated a bit more feedback incorporation in the class. It would have been nice to have received a bit more guidance and clearer directions on the final assignment, as well as more feedback on our approaches for the discussion in class. Sometimes, I felt like I didn't really know where I stood in the class and whether the work I was doing met the standards and expectations of Professor Crews. It would have also been nice to have some papers in the course that were well structured and genuinely good instead of mostly getting papers that were flawed, so as to get a better idea of what a good paper accomplishes. The name-card system for speaking felt somewhat impersonal, and seemed to make the class feel colder and more distant than necessary. I feel like having discussion happen more organically, and approaching paper discussions in a less interrogatory way can help a lot with fostering  better learning in the class."

I think that students need to have good time management skills and keep watch over nerves. Sometimes my anxiety got in the way of participating too much, but its very important to in order to get a lot out of the class.",

Professor Crews is a world-class scientist, and being able to get exposed to his ideas is a great opportunity. If you are interested in cell biology, then consider this class, as you will not regret taking it!"
