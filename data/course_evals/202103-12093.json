We also did a broad survey of the evolution of typography through history by researching and presenting on a notable typographer\/typeface."

                "The professor said the class readings were optional\/only supplementary, but when I actually started to read them I learned much more about the field than actually going to class. The actual class consisted of showing up with pictures and staring at them, really. Each class was a crit, and when it is two hours a class, twice weekly, that quickly becomes like pulling teeth. If we'd actively made things in class, focused on new developments in the field, even if we'd been assigned any of those supplementary readings I think things would have gone smoother\/felt more grounded\/the class would be less \"show up, hear opinions and leave\".\r\n\r\nThe assignments felt poorly organized; the rational for this was that as graphic artists, overlapping responsibilities are something we'd have to get used to....but we're college students. Overlapping responsibilities are all we have.",
                "Strengths: course goes through a gamut of exercises\r\nWeaknesses: was very Euro-centric, little to no information on other modes of typography or typesetting; even out of European design, seemed very German-centric and most crits given were entirely from that perspective, not many hands-on exercises in class (Alice just kind of talks at you a lot) which made it boring a lot of the time\r\nthe guest critic wasn't very helpful\r\nIt was fine, just think the course should be relabeled \"Western Typography\" or something to be more accurate for students when selecting courses",
                "This is such a great course! You get a lot of one-on-one critiques, which helps to determine where your work needs improvement.",
                "critique was insightful and helpful",
                "I think some of the auxiliary assignments (drawing letterforms and lines) were a lot of work that would be great to have been optional. It was great that the submission timeline for them were flexible but I feel like I didn't get much out of them. Otherwise, I really loved the assignments.",
                "Strengths: good project design and timelines, professor was very helpful and easy to reach about any questions\r\nWeaknesses: crits often went over and weren't very constructive, mostly things that students liked with professor feedback at the end",
                "Strengths: great professor and TA, helpful critiques, practical assignments\r\nWeaknesses: too many little assignments peppered in between the main projects"
