    "It was interesting, but the classes tended to feel a little long. I wish it were bigger so more people could contribute to the conversation. That being said, we had a lovely bunch and I enjoyed hearing everyone's thoughts. I think the reading responses were a little unnecessary though. It's really important to have this type of South Asian Studies course, and I am glad I got to take it.",
    "The strength of the course lies in it's structure where the instructor and students actively engage in the discussions through weekly class presentations. Through sharing about our final essays we also got constructive feedback from one another on ways in which we can enhance our essay.",
    "The comparison between past India and modern day India was very interesting, though the way we tended to do it was by going back and forth per week. I think maybe a couple thematic classes where the readings are split between historical and modern India would lead to more active comparisons and discussions between the two periods and any continuity that can be pointed out with them."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "I will definitely recommend this course as it  provides an interesting approach to understanding the source of conflict in the Indian region. This course is multifaceted as it goes in depth to understanding the religious tenets to identity and touches on the core complication of learning what it takes to defining the self.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is very broad, but well-organized that you walk away with a good outline of events in your mind as well as specific details of particular events and figures. Because it deals with history and modern events, there is a lot there that interests a wider range of people for more fruitful discussions. In the same vein, the breadth allows you to have a much wider range for your essay topics, meaning you can really pick something your interested in to write about."
