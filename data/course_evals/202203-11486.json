                "I learned a lot about the book industry and what makes a good book, both objectively and subjectively. I learned what drives a good fiction novel, from dialogue to conflict to motivation. And I learned so many other small but important details about creating a book, like what goes into a good blurb and cover.",

But also given the feedback and support we receive I think it is worth it, because by the end of the class you have a completed short story and the first 25 pages of a novel, which is unreal.",
                "The course made a quite obscure industry much more transparent and hopefully achievable. I did feel like the class dynamics excluded some people while prioritizing those who were more outgoing.",
                "Strengths: amazing and warm classroom community makes class fun, chill, and exciting each week, complete freedom for the final and super helpful working with a revision partner, really cool guest speakers who talked about useful things in the industry, Professor Friedland is awesome and really appreciates connecting to students and answering their questions, very unique and cool experience overall for a class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough mini writing assignments with feedback, I wish there had been more opportunities for workshopping during class, I think one of the novels we read didn't really tie into our classwork and I think our time could have been better used writing and reading\/sharing each other's work",
                "I thought it was an excellent course and have no suggestions",
                "I loved that the class was just as much writing-focused as it was focused on the world of publishing and writing. However, I feel that the feedback for our writing was not thorough enough."

                "Absolutely! I could not visualize life as a writer before taking this course. Now I have insight into the field, the craft, and even concrete networking connections.",
                "Yes I would, if you are an aspiring career novelist this course really helps to clarify how you might go about working towards that through tangible steps. Even if you're not an aspiring career novelist, this course is super interesting, and pushes you to write fun and meaningful things.",
                "Yes absolutely!! If you're at all interested in creative writing or the novel-writing industry, this class is perfect. By far my favorite course of the semester, and Professor Friedland is a super awesome and caring professor. For the final, you'll have complete freedom to write 25 pages as a start to a novel, and getting to work one-on-one with a revision partner for this was really useful. One of my favorite parts of the course were the guest speakers who came in and talked in detail about their experiences in the industry. The classroom vibes were super comfortable and friendly, and this was in large part due to Professor Friedland setting up the course in such an approachable way and everyone in the course really loving creative writing. Prof Friedland was always excited to answer our questions and tailor discussions to what interested us most, and her feedback on our writing was smart and informative. I wish there had been more opportunities for workshopping during class, but I still always looked forward to coming to class each week because our discussions were consistently fun and chill. If you're willing to put in the work for the writing, this is a really wonderful and refreshing course!",
                "Absolutely, but only to someone interested in creative writing",
                "Yes, this course provided me with the opportunity to form some amazing connections and taught me a lot!",
                "Yes, definitely! It is a great class to practice your writing and to learn about the business side of novel-writing!"
