    "You will learn multiple tenses and grammar points in this class; it is challenging to keep up with them all, but it ensures you have a large knowledge base for both reading, writing, and speaking. Writing skills increased greatly, and listening skills heightened dramatically, as the course is taught completely in Spanish. The rigor of everyday learning means you will become more accustomed to speaking in Spanish in everyday life, but this also leaves a bit of pressure in ensuring you are both keeping up with the content and progressing as a learner.",
    "new Spanish grammar skills and a better ability to write in Spanish",
    "I improved my Spanish writing, reading, and speaking skills.",
    "Spanish reading, writing, listening, and speaking abilities.",
    "Spanish grammar, vocabulary, and speech and writing skills\/experience.",
    "I really improved my overall grammar understanding.",
    "My existing spanish skills were boosted tremendously and I developed new, difficult concepts to a comfortable degree of proficiency.  Overall, my Spanish improved greatly over the period of a single semester.",
    "I learned a lot of Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and syntax."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n- Course is very well-organized\r\n- Syllabus makes keeping up with the work manageable\r\n- Writings ensure you get a second chance\r\n- All assessments have plenty of review material and are well-outlined in the syllabus\r\n- Tons of extra practice given\r\n- Lots of detailed descriptions of every assignment and assessment so you're never questioning the content of an exam\r\n- Always listening to Spanish being spoken\r\n- Frequent speaking of Spanish in-class\r\n- Lots of working with partners\r\n- Course packet created by the department is extremely well-crafted and useful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Meets everyday, which aids in learning but adds pressure\r\n- Speaking time is frequent but speaking skills should be practiced better\r\n- Some texts are difficult to read--while this is useful in learning, it occasionally becomes too hard to be able to do properly\r\n- Textbook is useful, but it is not used as much as it probably should for the price you pay for it\r\n- There is a lot of focus on grammar and concepts, which is useful, but I would like to see more practical explanations and applications of the language (i.e. help us learn how to generically speak Spanish instead of trying to perfect the tenses\/grammar used every time we talk; it's good to be accurate, but sometimes makes our speaking worse when we focus too much on incorporating all the right material\/tenses\/etc.)",
    "Strengths: Challenging material and many opportunity to speak\r\nWeaknesses: Frequency of assessments disrupted the class flow",
    "This was definitely my most difficult course, especially as a first-year whose high school had a pretty poor Spanish program. However, the difficulty made me realize how important it is to spend so much time on Spanish, and I improved A LOT. I thought the content was really engaging and diverse, and I had a lot of fun in class.",
    "I think this course is very strong because it has a huge emphasis on practice.",
    "The course is great at taking each individuals needs into account and developing spanish with a personal approach. Attending the class daily ensures that every student is constantly working on their spanish.",
    "The major strength of this course was the multi-faceted approach to teaching Spanish that incorporated visual, auditory, written, and oral components."

    "If you are genuinely interested in Spanish and wish to become fluent in it--and have experience with it--then yes. Take the course and you will be more well-off than before. Your skills will increase and you will become a better Spanish student overall. If you are not interested in Spanish but need a language requirement and have prior experience with Spanish, it's also a good idea to take the course to reinforce what you know. Keep in mind that there are other options though.",
    "Yes--it is definitely a good and well-structured course to review a foundation in Spanish and begin building to more advanced levels, though in my experience you will definitely not feel anything close to fluent when leaving this course",
    "Yes. I saw improvements in my overall Spanish language skills.",
    "Generally speaking, language courses at Yale are great. They are time-consuming and demanding, but this is the right way to acquire different languages.",
    "Yes! It is difficult but rewarding.",
    "Yes I would because I think grammar is very important to speaking Spanish more fluently.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is willing and excited about improving their spanish. It forces each student to grow and expand their knowledge in an accepting environment.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wished to gain proficiency in Spanish."
