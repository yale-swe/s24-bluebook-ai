                "French conversation, vocabulary, reading, and grammar skills",
                "The course was not only instructive and informative as a review of all French grammar from L1 through L4, a wonderful refresher after a summer away from French (or a good catch-up course for first-year students entering with high school French), but the texts and course curricula covered a diverse array of topics relevant to the wider Francophone world. We read more contemporary French plays like Art by Yasmina Reza, we read Francophone literature like Maryse Cond's Le Coeur  rire et  pleurer, which explored French Guadalupe and the relationship between France and its overseas departments. We also watched movies and listened to songs, which discussed timely themes like the plight of migrants and a globalizing France.",
                "French! My oral and written skills definitely improved throughout the semester just from the amount of exposure I got to the language.",
                "I learned and practiced various grammar topics, like future, conditional, imperfect, pass compos, and subjunctive tenses. We also read various short stories and books, and practiced essay writing. We also learned a large amount of vocab.",

The workload can be high at times, but that's just part of the course.",
                "Strengths - small class size, engaging professor, diverse range of texts studied\r\nWeaknesses - despite class size, it was sometimes difficult to practice speaking enough",
                "This course is very helpful as is. I appreciated everything about it.",
                "Strengths: extremely interactive class time, classmates were really invested in discussion and learning the language. Weaknesses: no big ones honestly! The workload is not too bad but you do have to do all the homework and having class three times a week really adds up.",
                "I would say the vocab requirements were both a strength and a weakness. It was difficult to memorize so much vocabulary for each test, but at the same time it's really helpful to know more words for speaking and writing.",
                "I think that this is an intense course -- it gives a lot of work and expects a lot from its students. There are strengths and weaknesses in that: on the one hand, it is really difficult; on the other, you learn a lot",
                "strengths: engaging material, every class day was packed with activities and reviews, very well organized \r\nweaknesses: fast-paced - didn't get to go through books in depth- \r\nmaybe cut down on readings so we can slowly enjoy each piece",
                "The course is very well designed and organized, and the expectations are clear. The homework exercises, readings, and assignments all seem worthwhile and are engaging. One weakness is that there is not much opportunity to practice speaking since the class time is reduced from L4.",
                "The course is very fast paced. I just wish there was more of an emphasis on speaking.",
                "I think the syllabus was really well put together! Its a lot of work so it wasnt something I always *enjoyed* but thats okay. I made good progress and Mme. Schneider and the seminar format really facilitated that well."

She has high expectations of you, but is extremely understanding of all the stress we have going on in our lives. I honestly really loved coming to class everyday.",
                "Yes, if interested in learning French / continuing your studies from high school and/or previous Yale French courses. Not solely for a language credit.",
                "Yes, it is an excellent refresher course both for students who learned French at Yale and for those entering Yale with a level of high-school French, but who wish to review the grammar and syntax before embarking on higher-level courses.",
                "Yes! It's a great survey of interesting literature and your French skills will improve.",
                "If you want to continue doing French, then this is a good class to take. It's helpful for building a foundation with grammar and vocab. As with every other French class at Yale, for some reason almost every book and movie that we studied was very depressing, so prepare yourself for that. It's also a bit difficult to really talk about some of the complex issues (like immigration, race, etc), because the main focus is learning the language, so discussions feel a bit shallow sometimes.",
                "Yes, because it really helped me improve my French. However, it was also really difficult and gave a lot of work",
                "if you seriously want to improve your french as a non-native speaker, YES, a thousand times YES. I've taken french L1-L4 and I feel like this class greatly improved what I had previously learned. The professor encourages everyone to speak the same amount so you will bet you will get called on if you don't participate. For some, that might be intimidating but I found it exhilarating.",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone looking to take their french skills to the next level. In offering a lot of grammar review, it would also be appropriate for people who haven't taken french in a while.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student seeking to learn about French grammar.",
                "Yes, but its definitely a lot of work and you do need to work on your French every day to make the kind of progress it wants/needs you to. Take it if you genuinely enjoy the French language!"
