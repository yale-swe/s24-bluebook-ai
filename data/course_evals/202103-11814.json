There might be many script classes, but this class is very specific to TV that you learn lot each class. The professor treats each class as an opportunity for us to casually talk about TV, and these conversations are surprisingly informative.\r\nThe only weakness is that the feedback for assignments isn't very clear. Even if all the comments are positive, you still end up with a mediocre grade every time...",

The scripts we read are all varied and interesting and lend themselves to great discussion. \r\nI wished we spent a little more time in class sharing ideas and workshopping with one another as a whole rather than in breakout groups. I think it would be helpful as a group to discuss script problems we're having, and I also felt a bit isolated from those I didn't small group with as I didn't get to hear much about what they were working on.",

It felt very informal, like I was a part of a book club that met every week and I was able to learn and discuss with my peers while still remaining on task. I think some sort of incentive to work outside of the classroom wouldve been good to maintain interaction with the material.",
                "It was interesting to read a wide variety of scripts and to take our own projects through the various stages of script development. I think starting our projects earlier in the semester would be good so that we could have time to write a full pilot by the end of the semester.",
