                "I learned how to do quantitative analysis and actually apply it in a paper. I also go to see the literature on religion on politics which was often surprising and interesting.",
                "I think my biggest take away from this course was learning how to write a real political science paper. Throughout the semester, we read political science papers and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments and methodology. These discussions then translated into supporting our final paper projects. Professor Baldwin did a fantastic job of breaking down the final paper into smaller, achievable chunks, and the result was that by the end of the semester, I had a paper that I was really proud of.",
                "In this class I gained knowledge on different governing styles and how they are influenced by religions. I primarily gained knowledge on the interconnectedness of church and state in various countries and how religion is used as an explanation for governing by academics.",
                "my first actual poli sci seminar - focused heavily on research methods and reading experiment-based papers",
                "I gained a really great understanding of how religion interacts with politics. I also was able to cement some of my understandings of statistical methods and research designs. The readings were all engaging and manageable and I found them to give me a good understanding of how religion and politics interact in the United States and around the world. The final research paper intimidated me at first, but it was a wonderful opportunity to do some real data analysis. Professor Baldwin \r\nmeets you where you are in terms of your stats ability, and will help you produce great work dealing with complicated data, even if you have a little to no stats background.",
                "I learnt a lot of about how religion affects politics worldwide.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Baldwin is spectacular and compassionate, and by stretching finals out over the entire semester, it makes conducting independent, original research much more achievable. \r\nWeaknesses: it often felt to me like we didn't have enough time to get through all of the papers during the discussion portion of the class. The reading load itself was manageable, but the discussion could have been reformatted to save time for student contributions. Also, stats isn't a prereq, but there are a few papers for which a stats background is helpful.",
                "The broad scope of this class is both a strength and a weakness. There is exposure to many different levels of interactions between religion and politics, but that prevents the class from diving deep into any particular topic. However, students have the opportunity to dive deep into a topic they are interested in through their research paper.",
                "No weaknesses. Strengths are the amount of help Prof Baldwin provides for her students on the paper, the readings, the disccussions, and small assignments, pretty much everything.",
                "Got lots of really great and specific feedback on my assignments which helped me improve my work over the course of the semester. Incredible course, no weaknesses.",
                "Strengths of the course include the topic reports and workshops. I really enjoyed thinking about the final paper early in the semester and appreciate this as an alternative to a classic 7 page final paper. \r\nA weakness of the course is that the course title is too broad for what is actually studied in the class. While a comparative approach (the world) is helpful at times, focusing on one specific religion or country/continent/geographical area would have been more focused and easy to follow. Additionally, this class was difficult to follow without any background in statistics, which should either be less focal in class discussion or a prerequisite to the course. While the class is heavily discussion based, it would have been helpful to discuss in small groups or partners at some points in order to hear more from all students rather than hearing from the same ones each class.",
                "think there could have been more discussions that went beyond paper methods and more contextualization within current events (opportunity to do this was with the final paper). but, otherwise, its a really good class to get basics of social science research & Prof. Baldwin stages out the work in a really thoughtful way",
                "I think the major strength of this course is that it doesnt deal in normative terms with religion and politics. It is a very empirical analysis, and while normative questions often arose in seminar discussions, the research papers that Professor Baldwin selected very rarely commented normatively on the authors findings. As such, the questions addressed in class were less like: is evangelicalism in the United States, a good or bad thing? But rather, more like: we see this correlation between being evangelical, and holding a certain political view, what are the strengths and weaknesses in the methodology that led this researcher to this conclusion? I found this to be a real strength because the class, by its nature, attracted people with very different beliefs and views. The way Professor Baldwin has structured this course has allowed those diversity of views to have really fruitful conversations in a way that was engaging and interesting to everyone there, and didnt alienate anyone. I also think the fact that the final research paper was always on our radar helped a lot because we could think about topics and methods in the context of the research papers we were reading. The only slight weakness I can think of is the classes at times became formulaic with a discussion of each paper we read for that day being led by a different person. Each class have the same essential structure, which at times, stifled the comparisons between the works that we were reading. Perhaps there could be 10 minutes or so set aside, devoted to comparing and contrasting papers.",
                "It was a lot of discussion based. It was very open to students opinion.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professor, very interesting content, very engaging class discussion\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of!"

                "Absolutely! I actually don't think you have to come in with an established interest in religion--you learn over the course of the semester how religion matters to political and social institutions in a way that may not have been obvious before.",
                "This course was fantastic, and I'd recommend it to anyone who has a serious interest in the subject matter. Professor Baldwin is one of the best lecturers and discussion leaders I have had at Yale. The classes were always well-organized and engaging. The final paper was an intriguing exercise for sure.",
                "Yes, great way to learn about a very salient topic. Very interesting readings and discussions.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the most helpful and interesting courses I took at Yale, definitely should take it without a doubt.",
                "Absolutely!!! This course was my favorite this semester and was by far one of the best political science courses I have taken at Yale. This course is strongly based on empirical questions about how religion and politics impact each other and learning about how to design research that answers these questions. Definitely not a political philosophy course, so take it if you are interested in learning how to do research. Having a background in statistics / research design was helpful, but lots of people in the course didn't have that and they were totally fine.",
                "I would only recommend this course to a political science or EP&E major with a background in statistics. The readings are dense and difficult to follow without knowledge of different governing types, general world political history, etc.",
                "yes if interested in social science research - less ethics / application based",
                "Yes, and Ill be honest, I am a religious student and I sometimes I am hesitant to wade into classes that discuss religion at Yale. But this class truly does an excellent job of it. I think whether you are an electoral politics, enthusiast, a religious studies major, philosophy major, or hold any religious beliefs,  you will be able to get a lot out of this class, without feeling even a touch of alienation.",
                "Yes! Professor Baldwin is amazing and the course is very intellectually stimulating!",
                "I definitely would. This course is a model for what a Yale seminar should be. The readings can be difficult but are always fascinating, and you can tell that they're chosen with great care. They often speak to each other in fascinating ways, too, so you can watch the authors clash and come to your own conclusions about whose theories are better supported by the evidence. And class discussion is somehow both intellectually stimulating and low stakes: everyone makes the most insightful points, but you never feel worried that you'll be judged if you make a misstep or that you have to carefully craft your points to impress the professor. Professor Baldwin also takes an active role in the discussion, never monopolizing the conversation, but always willing to provide context for the readings or jump in to correct a misconception. The assignments are interesting and open-ended, Professor Baldwin is very accessible, and the grading is fair. Overall I would highly recommend taking this classyou'll be really happy you did!"
