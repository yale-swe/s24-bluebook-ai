As a South-Asian myself, it was super cool to learn a bit about South-Asian history. You also get to read a ton of plays which have South-Asian characters or are focused around South-Asian stories, which is super awesome.",
                "In this course, I was able to do an in-depth analysis on the South Asian-American diaspora and how those two identities were able to relate with drama. I learned a lot about the lack of POC-base within the theater scene and how we can counter these issues.",
                "I gained a better understanding of south asian culture and theatre as well as the barriers many south asians had to overcome to portray their art",

Maybe students can work on some project with a guest speaker, like workshoping a play that the class is working on.",
                "Strengths: Knowledge of professor, manageable workload, exciting conversations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "The strength starts with Professor Stokes' experience, warmness, and ability to facilitate discussion. All the readings were extremely interesting, and they were not too intensive.",
                "The strengths are that the course is very engaging, informative, and makes learning fun but I genuinely can't find a single weakness because it was a wonderful class",
                "Really appreciated the lighter workload in comparison to other classes and the discussions we had in class that were largely based on what we found compelling\/wanted to talk about in relation to what we had read\/watched\/learned.",
                "Strengths - gives the attention and representation that South Asians and South Asian Americans in theater and media need.",
                "This class is one of those that almost doesn't feel like work, and whose workload is very manageable. For me at least, the content was really interesting and things I don't think I would otherwise ever have had the chance to read and learn about. Overall, it's really great with only two downsides. First, the 9:00 am class time was a bit of a struggle at points. Second, it did get a little bit more disorganized towards the latter half of the semester. There were some points where reading wasn't posted until a day before, but all of those times it was a really easy, 1-hr assignment.",
                "The course is very strong I think it will improve with age just by trial and error the readings weree good.",
                "The strengths of this course are that a lot of the learning comes from reading really interesting works and having thoughtful (and not stressful) discussions on those works. I felt this was an effective way to learn. Also, Professor Stokes tailors the class to the students' interests, so everyone feels welcomed and interested.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this class is that a lot of time is spend on developing a historical background of South Asian immigration and South Asian involvement in the US. I wish more time could have been devoted to reading contemporary works (although a substantial period of time is spent doing this, I wish there would be more). I also wish more time could have been devoted to the performance part of this class (more opportunities for acting)."

                "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Stokes is a gem of a person and getting to learn a lot about the South Asian-American identity was an awesome experience!",
                "Yes I would! It's wonderful and if you want to develop close friendships and a genuine bond with your professor while simultaneously fulfilling your passion for south asian theatre then this class is it!",
                "Yes yes yes! Please take this class, especially if you are South Asian (also take it if you're not because it is very fascinating either way) so that you not only gain knowledge of South Asian American history in relation to theater and entertainment in the U.S. but you also take a fun class with a great professor!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to others, especially if you identify as south asian (but even if you don't, it's still a great course). The first two weeks of the course are just spent discussing South Asian-American history, which is the first time I've ever had the opportunity to learn about a lot of that information. Afterwards, we spent a lot of time discussing plays and dissecting movies, and then the last few weeks of class were just Q&As with the playwrights whose work we had a chance to read. The final project, which I'm not sure would be repeated other years, but this year was a public reading of a new play by a senior, was so great! Getting to work with classmates on a creative project, while being directed by Professor Stokes and presenting the reading to a public audience, was so much fun!",
                "Yes I would Dr. Stokes introduces us to many different concepts and information in an engaging way",
                "Yes! Its a great, relaxing course, and the material is super interesting. If you are interested in hearing from South-Asian American voices, this is definitely a good course for you!",
                "Yes, it covers topics from many different areas of study at Yale and is engaging."
