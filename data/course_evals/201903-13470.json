    "No longer taught collaterally with Military History of the West",
    "I don't feel like I got a ton out of this class and I kindof wish there was more we could have learned. The official PowerPoints sometimes seemed like relations of the readings.",
    "Strengths: Helpful and applicable information was taught. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\/areas of improvement: More classroom discussions would be beneficial to the course; the tests\/quizzes were somewhat subjective with the \"correct answers\"; tying the lessons we were learning to real-life anecdotes would be helpful.",
    "The course moves at a reasonable pace and the content follows an ordered, logical progression that makes learning easier. Sometimes, the content is very dry or abstract (usually because it is truncated due to time limitations) but the general principles taught are clear and applicable",
    "The course was well taught and organized based off of the material AFROTC provides."

    "Being that this class is required for ROTC cadets, not sure this is applicable, but the class is an excellent introduction to leadership principles and how to apply oneself in different leadership models",
    "Yes -- it's required of all AFROTC cadets, and the material is interesting and helpful for life in the Air Force"
