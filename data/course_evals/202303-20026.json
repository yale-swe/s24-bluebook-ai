I learned new approaches to writing, how to make an academic piece more compelling, how to think critically about subjects and make awesome comparisons across them. And, lne of the most important insights I developed while in this class was the notion that I have to question everything, and think thoroughly about them... A textbook is not the supreme authority. Context is everything.",
                "I gained an appreciating for architecture, not only in the time period we covered, but in general as well. I have been much more aware of the architecture around me, of its visual histories, and how it interacts with the world. Through the weekly sketchbooks, I also greatly improved my architectural sketching skills. Overall, I learned to look at architecture in new ways.",

I've acquired the skills to dissect architectural designs, focusing on specific terms, techniques, and the historical context that has influenced this field. My newfound appreciation for the artisanship embedded in pre-1750 architecture will be forever embedded into how I observe the world around me (especially on my travels). \r\n\r\nMoreover, I now possess a global outlook on architecture, recognizing how diverse techniques have shaped its evolution across the world.

            "comments": [
                "I think a big strength of the course is in the lecture (professor Dugdale is an incredible lecturer), and he is clearly very concerned with us learning the technical stuff as much as the cool stuff. I think a little bit more emphasis however is needed with the technical terms. The overall thing with this class is that the scope is too big for the amount of time we have in lecture which is obviously not the professor's fault. He does a great job given the time he has, since he invites us to reflect and answer questions that compell us to \"fill in the blanks\" by ourselves.",
                "Professor Dugdale is incredibly passionate and made the monologue-style lectures very entertaining. I often felt that I was learning more philosophy than architecture, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. The course could've used clearer direction in some of the assignments, especially with the sketchbook. It felt a little odd to have our notes for the class be graded, but I felt that I got significantly better at drawing throughout the course. The grading is decently harsh but we received a lot of clear feedback on everything we submitted, even the weekly summations of the lectures. There also was not that much overall volume of work, it was just a few little assignments every week.",
                "The course is very well structured and the work load is very reasonable and is effective to learning the course material. The material covered in lectures is highly interesting, and the readings supplemented them very well.",
                "Strengths- very fun sections",
                "I think the lectures were the strength of the class. The textbook was its weakness. I appreciate the necessity for having a baseline understanding in order to more richly engage with the lectures, however I think the textbook was a dry monotonous read that could've been better found in shorter better written readings. Moreover, I think it needs to be more clear what architecture prior to 1750 we are talking about. I found it alarming to create a survey course that could possibly cover all architecture prior to 1750it will always miss out important often overlooked voices and design.",
                "Overall it is a well rounded course, however one weakness may be the sections. They need to be more consciously and consistently developed so that the entire session is engaging and productive, so that material that was glossed over in lecture or in readings may be more deeply discussed.",
                "The journal assignments each week were definitely a strength, also encouraged a deep study in the readings that were assigned. Weaknesses were probably the contact being predominantly centered around Europe and very little constant was on Latin America and Africa.",
                "Strengths: Prof Dugdale's sheer dedication to the course, exciting theatrical monologue-style lectures, abstract \"limitless\" discussions about architecture (i.e., the architecture of narrative, the body, the nation, consumerism, etc.), invigorating/surprising/unconventional assignments, keeping a sketchbook, guest lectures and the Beinecke trip. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook, albeit comprehensive, appears rote in comparison to lectures, sections, and other readings. I also wish we had spent more time on African Architecture; the time spent on Europe/Asia eclipsed our discussion of it.",
                "Lecture was always so well delivered- the theatrics, use of lighting, and color were all reasons why I truly loved this class. \r\n\r\nThe course was very organized, and I had very little trouble accessing the professor or TA for answering any questions I had about the material or assignments. Only struggle that I had was crafting a sketchbook for each of the lectures. As someone not in the architecture major and not from an artistic background, I had a hard time understanding which parts of the architecture that we read about were worth sketching, and which techniques to employ while sketching to make the process more efficient. If there were a sketching workshop or section dedicated to creating a sketch, it would have greatly aided that process.",
                "The textbook was disappointing. I was upset to see the Americas and Africa together in one chapter.",
                "I think a strength of this course was the discussion section. A weakness would be the weekly drawings which I do think helped improve my learning and we also did not discuss them often.",
                "There needs to be an expansion within the curriculum on indigenous architecture. The curriculum needs to be recalibrated to shift from the Western perspective it privileges.",
                "Strengths: the structure/nature of the weekly discussion section where we could elaborate on the lectures and readings; the sketchbook requirement which was a (mostly fun) practice in medium and material; and the timely detailed feedback we received for each assignment. Another strength of the course was how Prof Dugdale structured lectures to be focused on certain periods, while also acknowledging connections to other periods and regions we had studied (or would study in upcoming weeks). Other architecture history surveys have a hard time teaching about global histories without becoming too Western-focused, but I felt that this course avoided this problem for the most part. \r\nWeaknesses: I think that, sometimes, expectations were a bit unclear. Particularly around the midterm and final papers, we weren't always sure what was required of us regarding writing style (formal as opposed to informal) and citations (not all of us had used footnotes as much as we did in this course before). This could be improved by discussing in section, or uploading the correct conventions.",
                "Honestly, and I never say this, but I think some reading quizzes/ assessments to actually force you to do the readings would have been good for me in the long run. There wasn't so much incentive to do the readings since there weren't any tests. The weekly summations were really a helpful way for me to reflect on the week and good motivation to go to class.",
                "Strength would have to be the weekly summations. Though it was tedious I think it really helped me retain the topics we learned and analyze the content on my own."

                "Yes, if you're willing to do the readings and put time into it. Otherwise it's probably not worth it, as attendance at lectures is effectively required. It can feel tedious to be doing the sketchbook + summations every week if you're not interested.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It expands your world view and will make you look at architecture with different eyes and with a higher appreciation for its art and history, and its impact on our lives. The assignments were all relevant to the course material and interesting to do.",

                "Yes - anyone who is interested in historical architecture, or just plans to travel through Europe/Asia/Egypt/South America with a greater appreciation for their history should take the course.",

Students without similar backgrounds would also benefit from this course, in that I don't think the terminology would be too much of a learning gap. Anyone interested in this course should be ready for a more theoretical/intellectual focus, where the lectures and assignments provide questions more often than concrete answers.",
