                "I ultimately learned a lot conceptually, but the course could be more organized. I would like if we had printed syllabi detailing the plan for each week, so students know what to expect and how to prepare.",
                "I felt like overall it was a great survey of different art techniques and mediums and I loved having in class work time! Anahita also is really helpful in providing feedback.",
                "Strengths:\r\nWonderful opportunity to develop introductory skills in a variety of different media. Many opportunities for artistic choice and freedom with direct support and feedback from instructor. Important instruction of introductory principles of art, which were used to help ease students into the critique-structure of the Yale School of Art.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nHighly disorganized and no clear syllabus. The course would have benefited greatly from a bit more structure and better communication about assignment deadlines.",
                "Anahita is an amazing professor who really wants you to learn through experimentation and exploring your own interests.",
                "Lots of personal time for projects and sweet feedback from teacher and classmates, but sometimes confusing course schedule.",
                "A major weakness of the course is the lack of a serious environment. Often the art major is treated a supplementary course of study rather than a subject matter worth pursuing as a career. I found the lack of engagement of peers and the professor almost humorous at times. Visual Thinking would benefit from having a structured syllabus that overviews various techniques that students could then apply in their own practices. There also needs to be an understanding that critique is not just a time for praise. I often feel unable to express honest feedback because I am worried that I will hurt peoples feelings. However, when students put in little effort I don't see it as productive to pretend that the work it fantastic. Art is about iteration we need to support a culture in the classroom of constructive criticism and intentionality."

The workload was extremely manageable and is great to add on as a fifth class. The course also provides a great opportunity for art students to refresh their foundational skills and vocabulary, which I deeply appreciated.",
