                "Strengths: Very interactive, during every class break out rooms via Zoom were used to discuss problems assigned in class. Weaknesses: It would be nice to have practiced a little bit more the application of Math 120 during the lectures instead of only focusing on the main idea of each chapter.",
                "I did not like this class one bit. There were many weaknesses in the assistance in understanding concepts and the live lectures were nothing more than a regurgitation of the assigned textbook reading and videos.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- recorded lectures were very straightforward and very good\/understandable\r\n- exams seemed fair to me\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- sometimes it was unclear (at least to me) what resources allowed on PSETs, and it might be nice to clearly establish that before the class begins\r\n- some of the PSETs seemed overly computational, to the point where I felt that it was overshadowing my experience of actually gaining practice with the concepts",
                "The point of this course is to get people through Calculus III and it did that well. John Hall is a great teacher while of course the graduate students are less advanced.",
                "The strengths were the responsiveness of the instructor and the abundance of resources for preparing for midterms, as well as the several peer tutor office hours. Perhaps one weakness was the frequent algebra mistakes that made some content slightly hard to follow.",
                "This course successfully got through a lot of material in a short amount of time, but I would have appreciated more step-by-step help during live lectures. I was confused for about half of each class, so didn't really enjoy class.",
                "The review sessions, Ximera, and all of the recorded lectures and practice exams were extremely helpful. Maybe one more practice exam could be added but other than that the umbrella course was structured very well. Also more initial steering\/guidance for the project would be helpful, since project topics were comprised mostly of more difficult mathematics.",
                "I think it was nice to have the lectures before and then a review of what we should have learned from the videos in class. However, with easier subjects, it could be a little redundant to sit through a class about something we already knew."

Because some people understood the lesson really well and others didn't, almost no conversation happened, and I didn't learn much from these breakout room sessions. I think working those problems with the entire class would have been better.",
