                "A good overview of biochemistry concepts",
                "The course is split into two parts: the first is a review of many molecular biology topics covered in earlier courses (like DNA replication, thermodynamics, RNA processing, etc.) with more detail and the latter half covers metabolism (cellular energetics, fatty acid metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, etc.). All prior classes lead up to biochemistry (in my opinion) since this course brings a organic chemistry perspective to many of the biological processes that are taught at a more superficial level in other courses. I feel like in this class in particular, the connections between medicine and science began to make more sense since we learned about many of the chemical errors or abnormalities that translate to diseases and illnesses found in humans.",
                "Insight into biochemical properties of life processes",

            "comments": [
                "Well organized and detailed lectures. Without more academic-check throughout and only the exams, constantly studying for an exam rather than more practice with questions",
                "Strengths: The TAs were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: It was a bit tough making the switch between the content taught by the two different professors. I also would have benefitted from the recordings of the lectures to be posted before the exams to review.",
                "The grade is entirely based on the four exams. It's really nice that they aren't cumulative, that there is no final, and that the exams are relatively easy and fair, but it's really daunting to have no other performance metric matter other than exams. Also, grade stats weren't publicized enough. I like when we get curve data in premed classes.",
                "Siggi's teaching was the strength and Breaker's was the weakness. Having Siggi teach the entire course would improve it.",
                "This course is tough because it is taught by two different people. After settling in for the first half of the semester, there was an abrupt shift to a different teaching style and exam style, and it was tough to adjust for me personally. I think the content is really interesting, but the class could be organized in a better way to better facilitate student learning.",
                "Weakness: The course is only 4 exams with no supplemental work to ensure you know the material.",
                "It was difficult to only have our grades be based on exams. Discussion sections were incredibly helpful in digesting the large amount of material.",
                "The class was taught really well. Both lecturers Dr. Nauchtergaele and Dr. Breaker were engaging and very knowledgeable and I was never concerned if I had any questions since they would answer succinctly. Although the exams were reasonable, my only complaint would be that they only provided class averages for 1 of the 4 exams so it was really hard to track how well I was doing throughout the semester. However, this didn't really affect me much since I thought they lectured well enough for me to not be worried about not understanding the concepts taught in class.",
                "Strengths: lectures all build on each other, no psets or required sections, exams are all fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the lectures felt a bit boring",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe information is presented in a clear manner and the lecture schedule allows for learning to occur without being overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nNone",
                "I think this course would be a lot less stressful if it weren't purely exam scores. The thought that doing poorly on one exam could significantly change my grade was a constant stress! I also wonder if it could be helpful to have practice psets?",
                "Strengths: both lecturers were very strong in explaining in detail concepts. Professor Nachtergaele in particular I appreciated how well crafted her lectures was, and I was surprised every time that she finished her slides at the exact time. I also thought the structure of the course was very fair.",
                "Slides were often super disorganized, which did not facilitate student learning at all",
                "The strength of this course in the first semester was the straightforwardness of the lectures and exams with Professor Nachtergaele. A weakness was the second half of the semester with Professor Breaker. The lecture slides are filled with slides with more information than tested in the course which makes it hard to follow along in class. This made it harder to know the depth at which we would be tested for the exams. I would've appreciated more straightforward slides and answer keys for the provided review materials so we could go into the exams more prepared.",
                "Strength: low workload week to week except for exam weeks, generous curve (50% of students get an A\/A-), Professor Nachtergale. Weaknesses: second half of the course, co-teaching. Siggy was an amazing professor, and it's always refreshing to have a female STEM professor at Yale. Her lectures were incredibly well-organized, and she made it very clear what was going to be on the exam. She also came from a background where biochemistry didn't come easily for her (she would say this herself in lecture), and I think it really allowed her explain things clearly without overcomplicating things. Professor Breaker was incredibly sweet and kind, but just a terrible lecturer in comparison. His lectures were disorganized",
                "Prof. Nachtergaele was the greatest strength of this course. She was a clear, dedicated, and kind instructor and made me feel confident in my abilities to learn the material. Prof. Breaker was a different story. I appreciated his enthusiasm for the material, but it often felt like he was just \"talking through\" slides rather than teaching the material on them. Overall, though, they were both effective instructors and I enjoyed the material.",
                "Prof Nachtergaele and Prof Breaker are both really good instructors, but it was definitely an adjustment when the class transitioned to Prof Breaker. He has a different teaching style and his exams are formatted differently so this was a learning curve, but overall I really enjoyed learning the content of this class. The second half of the class, however, felt rushed at times, especially the last unit of the class.",
                "The strengths were the 50 min lectures. It could be improved if the last lecture before the exam was not covered as heavily on the exam, as we did not have enough time to study it.",
                "The lack of problem sets and graded participation was stressful, but ultimately provided me with more time to focus on understanding the material. Spreading the lectures out into three shorter lectures a week instead of two longer ones helped me absorb information. The greatest strength of the course are the TAs. Their discussion sections were essential to my understanding of the content, and they were very helpful and willing to meet individually to go over content and exam questions. The office hours held by Professor Nachtergaele and Professor Breaker were invaluable. Both professors were also happy to clarify quick points right after lecture and both held review sessions prior to the exams.",
                "The professors were good lecturers and always using helpful visual aids and slides. \r\n\r\nA weakness would be theres a lot of content taught in a short period of time. Especially in the second half of the course, its a lot more to memorize than the first half. \r\n\r\nThe only assessments are the 4 exams so its hard to see how your understanding of the material is progressing.",
                "Strengths: incredible teaching team, really solid lectures, and extremely well-written and fair exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the four exams is hard to keep up with, more practice problems in lectures would be useful for studying.",
                "Strengths: The Professors and TA's. Professors Nachtergaele and Breaker are two wonderful professors who are dedicated to helping their students. While The first half, taught by Professor Nachtergaele, was dedicated towards making biochemistry as accessible as possible -- she would consistently hold office hours every week, and I really appreciated how much additional instruction there was be in preparation for midterms. Professor Breaker's half was very technical and detail oriented, but this is just a function of the material -- cellular respiration is just a challenging topic to learn in any context. Though engaging with the material could be challenging, Professor Breaker's passion for the content really shined through -- during some office hours, we would just talk about other scientific developments in related fields, and I really appreciated his enthusiasm throughout the course. The TA's were also very helpful, and they always did their very best to help us understand the material, often going well over the scheduled 1 hour time limit, just to help us.\r\nWeaknesses: The difficulty of the exams picks up throughout the semester, which caught many individuals by surprise. In particular, the units on cellular respiration and biosynthesis were particularly demanding, but the TA's and Professors Breaker & Nachtergaele helped us make it through.",
                "Strengths: lecture organization, engaging and passionate professors, feedback clarity.\r\nWeaknesses: office hours availability (they were not always accessible to students who may have needed the help), last-minute scheduling for review sessions.",
                "It would be great if there were psets or some way to assess our learning in addition to just exams.",
                "Strengths: non-recorded lectures helped force attendance -- lenient policy for requesting recordings are available. Professor office hours were very helpful. Sections were nice to have.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: test-based and curved course is not ideal -- problem sets or weekly quizzes could make the course more manageable and caters to not great test-takers. Prof. Breaker's lectures were a bit harder to follow. Little flexibility when it comes to taking exams\/make-up exams, even with Dean's Excuses."

                "You are probably taking this class because you have to. It's not hard, just annoying at times. The Siggi part of the course was amazing and I had a clear idea of what I was learning and supposed to know the whole time. The Breaker part was not great. He spends every lecture reading out each step of reaction mechanisms (which we can do by reading the mechanism ourselves) and not offering much insight beyond that. Also, there are errors in nearly every one of his slides and he'll spend so long talking about why there are errors and the problems with the artist, but it's like, just choose new slides without errors or redraw the reaction with ChemDraw.",
                "Not as it is currently organized, but I know many people don't have a choice (like me). The material is really interesting and I was so fascinated to learn it, but it was often presented in poor ways in the second half of the semester.",

                "I would take the MBB biochemistry class if you can.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Again, it ties a lot of biology concepts together and adds a chemical perspective to biology that explains why many of the otherwise unintuitive concepts in biology occur. It also made use of my orgo knowledge so in that respect it was a culmination of all of what I had learned in biology and chemistry in the semesters leading up to this class.",

                "I would! It's a pretty great introduction to broad categories of biochemistry. The two halves of the semester, at least with these two professors, are pretty different, but they're both great perspectives on biochemistry and I deeply enjoyed getting to learn from them! The tests were a little difficult during Breaker's half of the semester, but still doable without a lot of memorization  although if you want an A on them you have to memorize basically everything.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are pre-med. However, if you want your grade to include more assessments than just 4 exams and get practice through psets, I would recommend the other version of this course.",
                "Definitely take this one if you are just trying to check off a pre med requirement over the other biochemistry course. It does a good job of covering the breadth and depth that you will see on the MCAT (from someone who already took the MCAT before taking this course)",
                "Only if you're premed\/MCDB major. It's a fine class, but there are more interesting bio classes out there.",
                "Yes! This class gives a really good foundation of biochemistry concepts and is suitable for anyone who wants to go into the sciences.",
                "Yes. This course gave a good overview of biochemistry, but was not focused on memorizing the details, but just understanding the big themes.",
                "Yes. The lack of problem sets and graded participation was stressful, but ultimately provided me with more time to focus on understanding the material. The TAs were great and their discussion sections really helped me understand class content.",
                "Yes I would recommend this class if you need to take biochemistry. The material isnt excessively complicated but there is a lot of it to learn and memorize. Definitely be prepared for independent study, since there are no problem sets or assessments besides the midterms.",
                "I wouldn't recommend it necessarily, because at the end of the day it is a hard prereq course most of us are taking because we have to. However, this was the most well-done premed prereq I have taken at Yale. Exceptional job! Students should not be afraid to take this class. Put in the effort and the grade will follow.",
                "Aside from those who are taking this course to fulfill a requirement, I would recommend this course to those who want to better stand how organic chemistry and biology combine to explain some of the most fundamental reactions that enable cells, ourselves, and all life on Earth to exist. Anyone who enjoyed organic chemistry and biology is also likely to enjoy this course as well.",

                "I would recommend this course only if it's required -- the course could be made more equitable if tests were not the only thing grades depended on. The class also seemed to be quite harder this semester compared to some past terms."
