   "comments": [
    "We learned how economic processes engage with social dynamics and that neither can truly be divested from the other. We mainly dealt with one economic sociologist named Zelizer, who theorized about relational packages, but also used a variety of other sociological theories to help us understand the economic realm.",
    "I learned so much about economic sociology, which is a field I hadn't had a chance to study before. I think my analytical and writing skills improved.",
    "I learned so much! It was fascinating to think about the subtle ways that social relationships shape our interactions with money. I've learned to think more carefully about every economic transaction I make, and the social implications of it.",
    "This class nuanced my thinking on the different social aspects that go into our financial transactions.",
    "I learned about the intersection between sociology and economics! Most people in the class were also low-income students who had to make difficult decisions for our families on a daily basis and to learn alongside them was a blessing. We learned about quantifying intimacy such as sex work and how much a life is worth. It was also interesting to see Professor O'Brien's own research.",
    "In this course, you explore how the social significance of money changes by the relational package of an interaction changes (social ties, medium of interaction, etc). This course is essentially looking at different social relationships and seeing the different role money plays in all of them",
    "It was a great class! I learned a lot about the intersection of sociology and economics.",
    "This course taught me a lot about how we as humans imbue economic processes with genuine social meaning. I got very familiar with the literature within economic sociology and how it exists as a counterpoint to neoclassical economic theory. On a less academic level, I learned how to articulate and analyze certain social-economic phenomena that are super normal or mundane but loaded with meaning."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: It's a different sort of course that takes a truly sociological approach to interpersonal economic relationships. I think I didn't really know what to expect when signing up for this course, but I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think sometimes the readings tend to lean a bit heavily on Zelizer's theories alone.",
    "Strengths: Professor O'Brien was so great!! He was so energetic and that made class time really engaging. Assignments were fun\/creative which was cool.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the reading felt a little redundant which was fine but a little frustrating when there was a lot of it.",
    "Really liked the material and Professor O'Brien was hilarious! I would have liked classes to be more discussion-based rather than recapping the readings. I especially liked talking about the material in terms of our own experiences or things we had read about\/etc.",
    "The environment encouraged you to really learn and engage with the material.",
    "The course was good in that seminars had genuinely interesting conversations not just about the readings, but also about other  topics very relevant to everyday life.",
    "The professor was very engaging and discussions were so much fun to attend. The readings were a lot at times but Professor O'Brien fixed it mid-way through.",
    "I think this is a pretty good course--especially considering that this is Professor O'Brien's first course. It was interesting to learn about the theory of relational packaging and the differing roles money plays in it. Nonetheless, I don't think we spoke nearly about the systematic nature of money. There wasn't really a full class on race or class--both of which I think are probably two of the most important things to look at when considering social meaning of money. Professor O'Brien will be teaching an entirely separate course on poverty, but I think he needs more of those elements in this course in addition to his other course.",
    "The syllabus was organized well in that each unit let us approach a new major dimension of economic life using the conceptual tools that we built up in the first few weeks of the course. I also think the seminar style was a great way to work out our ideas among each other. What was also helpful was that a lot of the subjects we talked about werent strictly academic, but were about economic subjects that we can all relate to as people. The only weakness Id say would be that I wouldve liked to get feedback on our weekly responses.",
    "Interesting material, but repetitive at parts.",
    "This was the first time this class was taught and I thought it was great! The professor is very open and excited to get feedback on ways the make the class more fun and engaging for everyone. His excitement about the topic is contagious."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I wanted to take a course on the economy but I didn't want to take one in the econ department. I liked that this course made me think about the way we interact in economic processes differently. I was entertained and engaged, and I'm someone who thinks that economics is fake, so I think basically everyone else would enjoy this.",
    "Yes!! I would definitely recommend this course and any course that Prof. O'Brien teaches. He makes class so engaging and fun.",
    "YES! Loved this class :)",
    "Yes, professor O'Brien is passionate and interesting. His course is extremely relevant and I find myself referencing it in my conversations as well as in my personal transactions.",
    "Definitely. This course is a prime example of applying sociology to everyday life to change the way we think about things we do all the time.",
    "Yes! For Professor O'Brien!",
    "I would recommend this course if you (like me) hate economics and want a more social view of it. This course is a decent Socy course about money--which doesn't really exist on at Yale.",
    "Yes most definitely very fun and very interactive",
    "I definitely would recommend to anyone interested in sociology in general or anyone curious about how economics is affected by emotions, relationships, etc.",
    "Yes! This class is very interesting and the topics lead to really engaging and fun class discussions. The professor's enthusiasm about the topic is contagious and makes me excited to go to class and do the readings."
