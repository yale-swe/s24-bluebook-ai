Having never taken an economics class, this was my first exposure to any kind of economic theory and calculations. I am now able to make calculations about competitive markets, monopolies, oligopolies, as well as answer theoretical questions about public goods, game theory, and other economic concepts. I do feel adequately prepared in some sense for Macroeconomics.",

                "The pacing was fine, and the grading was ok. The math concepts were often overcomplicated and poorly explained. While technically a seminar, the class felt more like a lecture.",

                "A small class can promote personalization, but it can also make it difficult to find resources to be successful in the class. I work best in highly collaborative environments, and the lack of people to collaborate with in this class made it insanely difficult for me to get through the semester. Classmates I had in other Econ 110 sections were on almost completely different lessons, and the classmates I had in Econ 115 (the course we are supposed to mirror) seemed to have much more straightforward lectures and problem sets. Having only about 9 people to be able to turn to for help was difficult. Maria is a very available professor, but her help is not always the most useful.",
                "I dont think the course was taught very well, because it felt like just going through slides of multiple different topics each class and not fully comprehending what was being taught to me. However, the professor is understanding and encourages students to ask questions when were confused.",

                "Unfortunately I am unable to recommend this course at this time. While I believe the instructor cared about educating the students, the lectures were often unengaging, and the lessons unapproachable. Unfortunately, while a brilliant economist, this instructor was a very inept educator. This instructor also did not provide helpful feedback. In instances where I planned meetings to discuss grades and exams outside of class, the instructor agreed to meet but did not show until 45 minutes late. When the instructor arrived, she offered little meaningful content assistance, and merely told me to work harder. Concepts that I had already learned in AP Micro somehow were made confusing again, but not because of increased depth of analysis. I deeply wish I had taken 115, the lecture instead. It seems that I will finish the class with an A, but unfortunately it feels more in spite of the instruction than because of it. I wish the instructor well, but would highly dissuade students interested in seriously learning microeconomic principles from taking this class.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Even though the course was definitely challenging, I still enjoyed it because I learned a lot of new material and benefitted from the small, seminar-style learning environment.",
                "I think that the instructors of this course are crucial to the success of the student, and if the instructor is not the right fit for the student it can be a very difficult semester. Also, the absence of TA's, peer tutors, or other resources that would be offered in the Econ lecture made it significantly harder to be collaborative on work for this course. Because of the discrepancy between the way the Econ 110 professors teach, I would say I would not recommend this course to another student because it makes it much more difficult to find success.",
                "I wouldnt recommend this course to another student because it is very draining and can deter you from the field of Economics. However, if youre willing to take on a difficult class, it would just require a lot of time and studying.",
                "Yes, it's an important prerequisite for many majors.",
                "No. Take lecture",
                "Yes I would, if they enjoy a more intimate learning space for classes this is perfect"
