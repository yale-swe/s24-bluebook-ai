    "I practiced Russian more and more, reviewing the material we learned from last year and taking it to more of an advanced level.",
    "I learned A LOT about Russian grammar, vocabulary, and culture.",
    "I learned some Russian so that was good. Learning Russian was really cool",
    "This course delved deeper into topics learned in levels one and two of Russian, and also explored new grammatical structures, especially with verbs of motion. It also gave students a good sense of Russian culture, and we read more advanced material than lower level Russian classes.",
    "The course focused on reviewing material from L1-L2, including cases and other grammatical constructions. We also did some reading exercises in class.",
    "Intermediate level Russian with a focus on developing speaking."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths--Amazing professor and TA, really care and you have many opportunities to get help!\r\nWeaknesses--The number of people in the class. The class was slightly too big for such a hard language, you could go a day without saying anything or just getting to say one sentence.",
    "The course was very efficient in teaching Russian. The only weakness I can think of is that sometimes the home-works were just busy work.",
    "The strengths of the course is how committed Irina is to teaching. A weakness is how hard it is although that does make learning Russian more successful",
    "I loved the small class size, and it really made the course approachable. Students who learn best by speaking had the opportunity to do so because of how small the class was, while students who learn best by listening\/doing exercises excelled as well. The class was really flexible, and between the textbook, daily lessons, office hours, and extracurricular activities there were opportunities for everyone to learn their own way. I also liked how the exams were written as opposed to typed as was the case in levels one and two.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness of the course is that it met every day, and by the end it felt like a bit of a marathon. I feel like if there were a few days off sprinkled in, where we could watch a Russian cartoon or movie or something, just to break up the sameness of every lecture, that might make the class a little more approachable.",
    "Irina has a clear passion for teaching Russian, which makes the class enjoyable. However, the pace of the course felt very slow, and the expectations of students felt too low, which made it difficult to stay motivated.",
    "Irina Andreevna Dolgova is one of the most caring people I have ever met. She personally makes sure her students are engaged and even scheduled weekly one-on-one speaking sessions for us. I cannot think of how to improve the class."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. Irina is such a great professor and she truly cares, she is what every Yale professor should strive to be!",
    "Yes, you will actually learn a lot!",
    "Yes, but like youre only taking it if you want to learn Russian.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, just because the whole Russian\/Slavic department at Yale has been great. This L3 course felt like a great continuation of the stuff from L1 and L2, and it was really fun seeing a lot of the same faces while taking this class, while also meeting some new people I had no idea were interested in Russian.",
    "I would only recommend this class if someone is truly interested in learning Russian. If they are interested, this course has my highest recommendation."
