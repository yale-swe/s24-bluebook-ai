Rather than merely understanding the economy as the relationship between producers and consumers, I now understand large-scale economic trends, such as inflation and GDP. I'm particularly excited to apply this knowledge when reading about current events and global markets.",
                "I refined my note taking skills and was able to find what worked best for me. In this class, it was printing out the slides and taking notes directly on them while watching the lecture videos. I also learned a lot about the interconnectedness of the world due to Professor Amand's global perspective on the material.",
                "I have learned a great deal about macroeconomics and the function of the Federal Reserve in financial crises.",
                "This class was a mind-blowing crash course in incredibly important concepts to anyone who wants to understand how the modern world actually works. The explanations of growth, banking, and the nature of money we learned in this class were fascinating and highly applicable to the real world, whether you're a policy advisor to a Congressperson or a small-time investors trying to stay afloat in chaotic times.",
                "Overview of macroeconomics -- what economic models are, how GDP is calculated, comparing GDP across time and countries, whether GDP is a good measure, nominal vs. real terms, inflation, the Solow growth model, banks and balance sheets, what money is, recessions, the IS-MP-Phillips curves, the AS-AD model, monetary and fiscal policy, long-run vs short-run, and a bit on the coronarecession.",
                "I developed a foundational understanding of important macroeconomic concepts that affect our lives everyday. These range from how the banking system works to interest rates and role of the central bank.",

                "I hated how the lectures were split up.",
                "I enjoyed the synchronous zoom classes because they provided a venue to ask questions and actively engage with the material. The online lectures were very informative. I found the readings quite interesting and would have enjoyed spending more time discussing the articles as well as current events.",
                "Strengths - I liked that the psets were low stakes and were not graded for accuracy. I liked using Ed Discussion. I liked that we got to see how the economic concepts we learned in class actually apply in the real world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like we did not have time to cover all of the material that was presented in the video lectures during class time, or at least touch on all of the topics presented, which was unfortunate. I felt like the material on the IS\/MP and AS\/AD models was just tossed into the curriculum at the end, and it should have had more time devoted to it as these concepts was the hardest out of all the entire class for me.",
                "I think Professor Amand was excellent and structured the course very coherently. Each topic was explained very clearly and the course was overall easy to follow. I did feel like the second half was a bit more challenging and content-heavy than the first, so perhaps it could be improved by shifting a bit more of the learning to pre-midterm.",
                "Strengths -- the class is very well organized and builds a strong foundation for understanding macroeconomics. The prerecorded lectures are well instructed, and the live lectures provided good reinforcement for understanding the material. The quizzes before each class were low-stakes and very helpful for trying to put everything from lecture together. There's ample opportunity to receive help outside of class. Professor Amand is very knowledgeable and makes his expectations clear. The PSETs are very similar to the exams in terms of style, so there aren't any unpleasant surprises.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- the pacing of the class is a bit strange, and it felt like there was a lot of material crammed after the midterm (or at least the material was a bit tougher to process than the material in the first half for me).",
                "Amand is great",
                "It was very helpful when the Professor pulled in outside sources or examples to highlight a concept that we were learning. This helped contextualize what we were learning and add more depth as we were able to leave the textbook. It would be helpful to have a more organized breakdown-maybe via text-of the concepts that we are learning each class. Sometimes it was unclear what was important and what was random information.",
                "This was a very great course with a great professor. I think that the strengths are that it was well organized and very engaging.",
                "Very good that there aren't numbers",
                "Strengths: Prof Amand is excellent - the lectures were very engaging and everything covered was relevant. I also loved how structured the lectures were. I was never confused about where we were in the course. I also loved how the problem sets were graded on completion instead of accuracy. It took away a lot of unnecessary stress, and I learned the same amount as I would've learned if correctness was emphasised rather than effort. The exams and problem sets were also very reasonable and comprised (almost entirely) what we had learned in class. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had briefly gone over the FRED database in class - it would have made some problem set questions easier.",
                "Lots of asynchronous lectures can be hard to focus through (though 2x speed makes it bearable). I feel it was about as good as it could have been given the challenging Zoom format.",
                "Prof very good at explaining the concepts",
                "A strength was how relevant the things we learned were to understanding the current economy and how the professor related the concepts we learned to the current pandemic. A weakness would be the lack of practice tests and not really knowing how the test will be formatted beforehand."

He is extremely knowledgeable and does an excellent job making the topics you cover seem relevant. He is also really kind and willing to help you if you need. The material is interesting and so are the lectures.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they are motivated to put in the work to keep up with the quick pace of a YSS course. With no background in macroeconomics, I feel like this course teaches it very well and I now feel comfortable to go on and take more difficult Econ classes.",
                "Highly recommend this or another introductory macroeconomics class to anyone who wants to be prepared for adult life.",
                "Yes, the material is interesting and the professor is good. I'm not an econ major, but I think understanding the concepts introduced in macro is important for understanding things like recessions and inflation, which can deeply impact our lives.",

                "Yes, definitely. You'll learn more about how the economy as a whole works, and many common concepts like GDP and the banking system will start making sense.",
                "Yes, I think it was interesting and applicable to the real world (I feel it will help me understand and interpret news and government actions in the future).",
                "Yes, if you are interested in economics or international relations",
                "I would! Very relevant course and the professor is great. The content moves super fast but we get a lot of practice through problem sets.",
