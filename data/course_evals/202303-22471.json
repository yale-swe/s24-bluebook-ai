                "Strengths: I appreciate that the reading assignments were generally not very long, which meant that in many class sessions we were actually able to get through all of the assigned reading, something which I've found to be quite rare in classics. Professor Dillon also provided us with a very useful classics resources masterdoc at the beginning of the semester with access to things like obscure dictionaries; this was very helpful for reading the text and will also continue to be helpful throughout the rest of my studies in classics. I also liked that we read the Greek out loud before we translated things, this was very helpful for feeling the general inflection of the original language."

                "I would recommend this class to any student of Greek who is interested in learning about Greek history from the ancient perspective while improving their own understanding of Greek in the process. Plutarch is admittedly not the most exciting prose author, but the story of Alexander the Great is a very interesting one, and the prose is challenging enough to help develop your Greek without being demoralizing."
