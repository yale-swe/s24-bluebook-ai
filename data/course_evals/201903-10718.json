   "comments": [
    "Philosophical Analysis, Writing a Philosophy Paper, Critiquing a Philosophical Argument",
    "I learned how to write, how to think critically, and how to think quickly during discussions.",
    "This course introduced me to a new way of thinking about the \"big\" ideas in philosophy.",
    "Before entering this course, I had little understanding of what philosophy was. I had heard the word philosophical thrown around, but it was always in the context of sweeping, over-exaggerated and overly romantic claims about life. Leaving the course, Ive come to realize that such gross generalizations cannot begin to touch the complexity, depth, and breadth of experience, discourse, and thought that philosophy offers. In this course, I learned how to take even the smallest of phrases, statements, or claims and dissect them, probing for truths I had previously not considered. I learned how to view issues or definitions from various angles, and I became comfortable with constructing arguments of my own.\r\n\r\nSome may say that philosophy is easy. However, I must disagree. It is more than possible to step far beyond the realm of relevance, for the conversation to become too removed from the initial discussion. To stay within a certain philosophical vein is challenging. It requires determination, and this course taught me how to be resilient and persistent in my discourse, analysis, and argumentation. \r\n\r\nLastly, I learned how to be comfortable with ambiguity, with talking about virtue or ignorance or art or infinity or God for hours and never reaching a conclusion. Where other disciplines may require a neatly wrapped solution, philosophy does not. Loose ends are encouraged; we are meant to tug on them and find even more things to discuss. In that light, this course has taught me to lean into difficult areas of discussion and to embrace the sheer mass of things that I do not know.",
    "This course aided me in learning critical thinking skills and learning how to develop an argument both orally and on paper. Besides the actual knowledge gained of philosophys history, the writing component and logic component were extremely important to what I gained from this course.",
    "I was exposed to the world of philosophical inquiry. I learned how to analyze philosophical arguments, read philosophy texts, and how to critique philosophers. I had no idea what philosophy really looked like, and this course exposed me to the wonderful world of philosophy.",
    "This course was transformative for my thinking. It granted me a space to read wonderful philosophical texts and engage critically and seriously with my  classmates. I can not even begin to list the insights I have gained from the course or the extent to which it shaped my thinking. I can have conversations now that I never could have had before this course.",
    "I certainly developed my writing and critical thinking skills.",
    "This course introduced me to Philosophy and the style of essay that is expected in such a course. Moreover, along with the other Directed Studies programs, I learned how to produce essays under a significant time constraint. Also, I benefited from interacting with original texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A bit more time spent on Eastern philosophers would be nice, otherwise a great course",
    "I wish we could have spent more time on certain books, but there is only so much time. The course itself is extremely engaging.",
    "I really enjoyed the way that this course was taught. I can best describe it as a guided seminar but it allowed for a lot of freedom\r\nin our class discussions.",
    "This course is strongest in its selection of reading material, organization of instruction, and opportunity for profound conversation and personal essay work. The chronological progression from Plato and Aristotle to the Epicureans, Stoics, Sceptics, Christians, and so on provided me with an all-encompassing view of early, foundational philosophy, which I can apply to other philosophical thought and discussion as my studies progress. The combination of seminars and lectures promotes both personal exploration and recognition of long-considered analyses and facts, presented by experts. We are provided with good examples of philosophical inquiry and understanding, and we are then free to attempt it for ourselves. This manifests in the seminars and essays,  and the opportunity to condense all lecture and seminar experiences into a personal relationship with and interpretation of a text is incredibly valuable. \r\n\r\nThe course has two weaknesses, one of which the faculty cannot control. With the sheer amount of material that we cover, I can only say that I wish for more time to consider each philosopher and his work. However, some texts could be given an entire semester on their own, so it is understandable that instructors must be strict in their allotment of time for each text. The second weakness, however, is more easily addressed. I feel that there are not enough visual representations of arguments in this course, and I think that including different diagrams and charts would facilitate a greater understanding of the texts that we are reading. For a lot of us, this material is completely new, and visual representations often allow us to understand complex concepts much more quickly and effectively.",
    "I think that strength of any DS course, which is the pure volume of the reading, also becomes it weakness because what you gain in breadth you sacrifice in depth. That can be a hard thing to reconcile.",
    "The strength is the way the seminar is run by Professor Winkler. We are able to engage with each other and the ideas of the text directly. While we often strayed beyond the text, those hours of philosophical discussion were some of my favorite of the semester. Talking with others and having your ideas listened to by such an amazing professor was a treat and made me feel like I was actually learning philosophy.",
    "Strengths: The material is very interesting, and Kenneth Winkler is fantastic.\r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus had us move too quickly through certain texts that our class really enjoyed.",
    "The conversation in class and the guidance from the instructor were excellent.  There are no clear weaknesses to me about the course.",
    "It could simply be improved by providing more room for quick re-caps about the very complex lectures.",
    "I think that course is brilliant and certainly challenging. One suggestion I might offer would be to contextualise philosophers and explain or suggest why reading their texts might be valuable."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's a great introduction to western philosophy",
    "I would highly recommend this course because it challenged me and improved my philosophical thinking immensely.",
    "Definitely. There's a lot of reading, but as long as you stay on top of the course work, it's great.",
    "I would undoubtedly recommend this course to another student, even if they were not a humanities major. Philosophical thought has applications to many different disciplines as it requires attention to detail and the ability to internalize concepts in order to create your own. The exposure to life philosophies is also important and beneficial, especially during this phase of life in which people are attempting to shape and determine their paths and development of self.",
    "Yes, but only in the context of recommending DS to a certain type of student. There are definitely students for whom DS is not the right option.",
    "Yes, take this class if you want to study philosophy and love every moment of it.",
    "Yes",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to other students. Ever since Reading Period started, I have been giving a lot of thought to the teachers I have had in the past and I mean this very seriously: I have never had a better teacher than Kenneth Winkler. He masterfully controlled the classroom discussion and stepped in at the right moments to explain concepts our class was having difficulty grasping. He is humble, kind, and understanding. He is a great philosopher, instructor, and person. Many DS students take his First-Order Logic course during their sophomore years either because they had him in section or because they heard about him from other DS students. If you have the opportunity to have him in section, dont pass it up. Youll only regret NOT taking his class.",
    "I would certainty recommend this course to another student. The course follows a powerful trajectory through western philosophy that deepens your understanding of how thinkers respond to one another and form new thought.",
    "Yes, I would. I think the professors expertise makes it possible for students to grasp philosophical concepts very easily.",
    "I would, but I would warn them about the heavy workload."
