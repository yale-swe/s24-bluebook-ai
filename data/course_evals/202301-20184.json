                "Strengths: professor, TA, lecture schedule. I really enjoyed the every-other-lecture field trips where we got to engage with primary sources from libraries around Yale. Yale has a great inventory of these items!",
                "Strengths: The opportunity to go to either the Beinecke or Medical Historical Library every week was truly amazing. It was so exciting to get to hold and learn from tangible pieces of history, and it really gave the lessons weight. Professor Dal Prete is a very passionate professor and lecturer, which really made the course content shine. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of this class meant that the experience was heavily influenced by our TA, who in this case, was very weak. The discussion sections did not really add much to my understanding of or engagement with the material. A well facilitated discussion in section could have done wonders, but unfortunately, they very rarely occurred.",
                "If you want to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Scientific Revolution and its implications you should definitely take this class!",
                "While each individual lesson was interesting, it was difficult to trace a clear through line and understand the main takeaways from each lesson.",
                "The weekly responses got a bit redundant and repetitive, especially because the prompts didnt really prompt much, but it was really cool material to learn about",
                "The course had a lot of very interesting lectures, discussion sections, and library trips. It was also a good balance between interesting details and broader themes. Sometimes it felt like certain library visits were not essential to understanding material",
                "all strengths, Professor Dal Prete and Emily did a great job of making it accessible and engaging. Its a fair workload with lots of opportunities to do well."

This course also clears up many misconceptionsone major one in particular being the historical relationship between religion and science.\r\n\r\nYou also get to go on cool field trips to the beinecke and other library collections every week, its really amazing.",

If the structure of the class stays the same, they will be grading everything and they will be your main point of contact, so if they arent good, it will hurt your experience in the class (which it did for me, unfortunately).",
