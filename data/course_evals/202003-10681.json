                "One weakness of the course is the lack of structure during lectures and course organization on canvas. I think in order to improve the structure of lectures it's better to have a daily set of notes that can be looked at on canvas after the class If something was confusing in class. The current method is a student says something wrong at the beginning of class and the lecture becomes an impromptu speech afterward. That transition from casual conversation to formal lecture is also very fluid and can be confusing. I am not sure what kind of training can be done for canvas, it just seems that all my other classes are able to utilize the organization of canvas to make it very easy for their students to use.",
                "The professors don't tell you very far in advance when your exams are or what subject matter your exams will be on. The course itself doesn't feel the most organized, but Swapna ji is very flexible and will work with you.",
                "This is an awesome course. The material we go over is explained very well by Swapnaji and Chitraji, and the topics we learned about outside of grammar (i.e. Durga Puja, migrant workers, climate change, etc.) were interesting. I absolutely loved the skit and magaizne projects -- I had so much fun making my magazine and seeing how much my written Hindi and Hindi grammar had improved. A weakness might be that the assignments\/material was not laid out from the beginning, but I understand how that might be hard given that we spent more\/less time on certain topics than expected.",
                "As the course progressed, it felt more structured and transition into various grammar structures made sense. Initially, it was a bit looser. I think it would be nice to work on vocabulary more. There is a lot of attention to teaching, and I appreciate that.",
                "The Professor of this class is definitely its greatest strength. Her support and teaching and kindness was amazing."
