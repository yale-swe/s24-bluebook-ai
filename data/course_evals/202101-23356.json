I also wish Joe had listened to students more about aspects of the course/been more present during project periods; the TA's really took up the role that he typically has and made this a great experience. Also the class information was posted basically two days before shopping period which meant that most people didn't know that this class was going to happen -- I would NOT have seen it if I didn't happen to look right before classes started. But overall a wonderful experience and will definitely be better when it's back in person!",

I was very disappointed to find that the famous Bluetooth speaker making project had been cancelled and replaced with simply CAD-ing the speaker. This class would have been much better in-person. The TAs were absolutely fantastic! They were much more involved in our projects than Joe was.",

There is a lot of guidance and resources to have a fun time learning. Because this semester was virtual,  we didn't get to build the speaker project which was sad. We also didn't get to work at the CEID."
