            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Proofs make the material more intuitive, and they helped expand my mathematical thinking. Weaknesses: I wish we could have spent more time with calculations applying the things that we proved. Also, lectures were sometimes confusing, and I found myself turning to the internet more often than not to explain a concept.",
                "Prof. Landesberg is an excellent lecturer; his explanations are clear and unambiguous, and he makes sure to thoroughly answer students' questions. The peer tutors were extremely helpful for problem sets (especially near the beginning of the semester when we were all adjusting to proof-writing). One weakness would be the TA sessions; the TA's explanations were unclear and not helpful for me personally, so I stopped attending mid-way through the semester. I would also like to have seen a bit of a greater emphasis on applications of linear algebra. Also, while the pace allowed for a thorough and rigorous curriculum, if we had moved through the earlier topics a bit more quickly, we might have been able to cover more of the material that Or was hoping to. Overall, though, this is a very solid introduction to proof-based math and to linear algebra.",
                "Strengths: learned how to write and approach proofs, Or is nice\r\nWeaknesses: the TA sessions that were optional covered material on the exams so it felt forced to be attending multiple zooms outside of the learning class period",
                "One strength is that you do learn a lot from this course if you put in the effort and it will be beneficial for you for future math\/science classes. One weakness is that learning the material is extremely difficult and takes a lot of time. Since this was my first proof-based math class, I felt like I was thrown into a pool and had to figure out everything on the spot with little guidance. While I did eventually figure things out, it was a bit too late for the midterm.",
                "Strengths: The class was very flexible and it was clear that the professor wanted people in the class to succeed. The psets and the peer tutors were also good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were sometimes a bit dry and grading was sometimes slow",
                "Strengths: PSETs were very helpful",
                "Strengths: professor seemed really engaged and cared about the material, first half\/three quarters of the course was thorough and in-depth.\r\nWeaknesses: We ran out of time so the last bit of the course was not proved as rigorously as the first part. I found it to be harder to understand because it we went through the material quicker than at the beginning of the class.  \r\n\r\nI think spending a little more time on the connection between the material taught in a more applications based lin alg class and the material we were taught in the first part of class would be appreciated. The last bit of class moved a bit fast and I think this could help slow it down. I think the stuff at the very beginning could be moved through a little quicker.",
                "Strengths: material is difficult but problem set grading is very generous, which is nice in that it allows you to collaborate with classmates and learn difficult concepts, but the course is still manageable because grading is so forgiving. Weaknesses: I wish there had been more visual intuition building and examples given for the concepts we learned. The final exam structure was quite miserable in that we had to memorize all the content from class (the whole exam was closed note), which to my understanding is not usually how proof-based math classes hold exams.",
                "This course was very comprehensive overall, and it was enlightening at times with respect to subjects I've learned about previously in math. All in all it was very interesting. At the same time, I sometimes felt unmotivated in what we were learning, as if I didn't really see any practical purpose to what we were doing. Perhaps a few more concrete examples or further discussion of applications would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths: The ULAs and TA were all very nice and helpful, and the overall material itself was interesting; Weakness: The instructor.",
                "I think the course was structured pretty well. The pace was very slow at first, which was extremely helpful for students new to proof writing, and picked up in the latter half of the semester as we became more comfortable with proof writing.",
                "It was what it needed to be. My only issue was that the midterm (32 hour take-home) and final (3.5 hour proctored closed book) were not in the same format, which created a lot of stress. Additionally, it was pretty easy to make it in this course by just doing the psets and learning the material there without paying much attention in lecture or TA sessions.",
                "I thought the psets were really well designed as the problems were fun to solve while also requiring me to fully understand that week's material. There is of course a tension present in this course given the large amount of possible material and the level of rigor of the from first principles approach. After the midterm, we shifted more towards covering more material at a lower level of rigor, which at the time felt like the course was rushing, but could have also been a planned progression.",
                "Strengths: The peer mentors (Max and Charlotte) basically carried this course. They were an absolute godsend.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets often took 10+ hours. The were very hard to complete on your own or even with classmates a lot of the time, making it absolutely necessary to show up to peer mentoring.",
                "I think the course content was very well taught and everything was highly connected throughout which made ideas much easier to understand and build upon. I think one thing that could have helped is more activity-style\/interactive content during lectures.",
                "The problem sets were interesting, useful, and engaging.\r\n\r\nLecture was not that interesting."

                "Yes, a lot of majors require linear algebra, and this class is a good way to satisfy that requirement. If you don't need it for anything beyond this course, though, I don't know if it's worth taking.",
                "Yes, it's a solid introduction to proof-based math, and Or is an excellent lecturer. However, know that if you're more interested in the applications of linear algebra, this might not be the right course for you (while we did cover some computational material, I personally would have preferred to see a bit more).",
                "I mean yes if you are need it for an applied math\/ math major and need that since of proof learning, but otherwise it is quite challenging. it was a nice community because we are all struggling so we struggle together and develop cool friendships with all the other 225 folks, though the course was challenging, but once ideas come together, it is very rewarding.",
                "I would only recommend this to someone that is planning on majoring in something math related or is willing to put in the time to learn proof writing. You do not actually learn many applications of the topics so it is not directly helpful for someone majoring in science, but I'm sure the foundation would help at one point. If you just want to use math as a tool for other classes, I think MATH 222 would be a better option.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about linear algebra or would like an introduction to proof writing",
                "Absolutely! This course covers very interesting material and is a great introduction to proof-based\/higher-level mathematics.",
                "I would recommend this class. I thought it was extremely well taught by Or and was a great introduction to proof writing. I am not going to be a math major but I still enjoyed the puzzle solving and intellectual challenge in this course. There was also always lots of help you could get with problem sets on concepts through the peer tutors or Or himself. It is a lot of work though, the problem sets are weekly and difficult (I would set aside at least 10hrs for them), but I honestly think the work is worth it.",
                "maybe. this was my first proof-based math class so it's hard to say. i think that 222 might be better for linear algebra skills (for computer science and physics) and for a intro to proof-based math, 244 and 255 may be better. I think it might be better with a different professor",
                "If you are interested in the theory behind linear algebra and matrix theory (meaning less computational practice), and you are willing to challenge yourself, then yes. If you want a course more focused on computational strategies (i.e. techniques to compute determinant, rank, kernel of a matrix, etc.) then perhaps a different course is better. Math 225 is heavy on theory, which is interesting but at simultaneously challenging and mundane at times.",
                "Never. Take the course with a better instructor. I hear that Pat, who taught 230, will be doing it next year so take the class with him. The instructor for this semester had total apathy towards teaching and helping students. You would be better served by watching publically available videos from other schools on the material and reading the textbook in your own time. Class time was spent literally transcribing and regurgitating the textbook with minimal further input or explanation from the instructor.  There was little to no feedback if any. The only saving grace was the ULAs and TA.",
                "No",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student who wants to get a more rigorous education in linear algebra than the application based class but is new to proofs. This class was geared towards this type of student, and was very approachable.",
                "Yes, this was an interesting introduction to linear algebra and proof writing. It wasn't terribly difficult but was certainly challenging.",
                "Yes! This is a great introduction to pure math and a pretty good intro to proof writing.",
                "Fun psets in this class.",
                "If you are considering taking this course, keep in mind that this is primarily a PROOF based class. You will spend a large portion of the course learning how to write proofs and how to think logically and concisely. We didn't get to \"actual\" linear algebra concepts (i.e. matrix operations) until about halfway through the semester. For this reason, we definitely did not end up learning as many computational linear algebra techniques as people who took math 222. In fact, many key computational topics were introduced in somewhat of a rushed manner at the end of the semester, forcing me to self-learn and practice them on my own. So, if you want to learn linear algebra for APPLICATION purposes, 100% take math 222. You might not understand the theory behind what you're doing, but you will become much more capable at solving practical problems. On the other hand, if you want an in-depth survey of matrix THEORY and a robust introduction to proof writing, coupled with some basic linear algebra, then by all means take math 225. It will be a steep learning curve (after the midterm I considered dropping the course), but it all worked out in the end and I am actually amazing by how much I have grown in terms of proof writing and mathematical thinking.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who wants to delve into math, especially proof-based math. It can take a bit to grasp the ideas behind the content because they aren't particularly conducive to visualization or things that you would see in, say, your daily life, but the course is very good for building the foundational proof skills that will be useful later on.",
                "Yes. It is a good class to learn linear algebra deeply without the monstrous workload of the more intense linear algebra classes. I got a good introduction to the subject through it."
