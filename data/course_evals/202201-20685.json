It felt very redundant after taking 285. Between class time, and the time spent in lab (going in for extra time as well as the time needed for the final experiment), this course should be 1 credit.",
                "The course is very well organized and designed.",
                "I thought that waiting until the end to grade anything was weird. Otherwise, perfect workload. Maybe bump it up to 1 course credit.",
                "The labs are fun, you do learn about the instruments but most of the lab stuff are done by TAs for you. The short lab reports aren't too bad but they're uneven in workload, and it's never really clear how in-depth you need to go. Having group lab reports has its ups and downs; properly splitting the workload is a challenge at times. In-class lectures are okay, a bit on the challenging side though, particularly if you haven't taken 285. The entire class has only two graded assignments: the final presentation and the final report, so it's pretty stressful by the time finals comes around.",
                "WAYYYYYYY too much work on the back end for a 0.5 credit course. I mean WAYYYYYYYYY too much. Needs better equipment!!!! This is not the professors fault, this lies on Yales shoulders."

Prof Amit is kinda polarizing, you'll either like him or won't, but by the end of the course, you'll be pretty great at writing lab reports using published literature, and you'll know a good bit of experiment-backed materials science knowledge.",
