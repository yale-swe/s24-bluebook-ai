I got an introduction to Critical Race Theory, I learned about reformist and abolitionist approaches to policing, mass incarceration, etc., and I learned how to think beyond a framework of rights to freedom, sovereignty, and power.",
                "Truly INCREDIBLE course. The best course BY FAR I have taken at Yale--PLEASE take this class, it does an incredible job of providing history and context to topics that are incredibly relevant to understanding our world today. Prof HoSang is truly amazing, and I cannot recommend him more highly. I only wish I had taken this class earlier during my time at Yale. If you are reading this, you should add this course to your schedule immediately--you won't regret it.",
                "Learned about the racial history of America and how the law has been involved in systemic racism",
                "i didnt learn anything i didnt already know as a black woman",
                "So much that it'd be hard to spend time trying to recount all of it, but definitely included critical thinking and broader intersectional analysis",
                "I learned how to read legal scholarly writings, how to be concise in creating arguments, and how to think critically about societal issues.",
                "a better understanding of liberalism, racial formation, colorblindness, what whiteness means, the prison abolition movement, sovereignty, and how to envision a new type of freedom",

                "Having not taken a political science course before, this class was a thorough introduction to topics very important to todays world. No class I had ever taken before compared to what this course taught me. I learned well through the different formats: HoSang's insightful lectures, renowned guest speakers, and an interactive section leader. Huge shoutout to Gregory Briker. He was very accommodating and always quick to respond. He always made me feel comfortable sharing my opinions in section. Greg always gave very thorough feedback on all my assignments that help facilitate my growth in the class.",
                "A critical and generative understanding of liberal antiracism, collective struggle for liberation and abolition within a context that pushes students to reflect on their positionality, community and work.",
                "I learned how to read various types of texts, films, and media in the methods of and towards the guiding questions of CRT. Beyond the excellent content that speaks for itself--I feel that I really learned and engaged with the goals, topics, and readings on the syllabus--I learned a great amount about scholarly approaches to law, history, cultural history, and related fields. \r\n\r\nThe assessment structure of this class was incredible: I worked really hard on and learned from the assingments, and felt that they were all worthwhile. It's a fantastic format (3 synthetic papers; mine had \"theses\" in a way, but others didn't as much, with some other papers) other classes should follow.",
                "I learned SO much about the criminal legal system, American history, social justice movements, reproductive rights, etc.",
                "This course not only gave me the foundational knowledge and vocabulary in order to talk about race in the United States, but also how to organize and form the coalitions necessary to work on dismantling the institutions and systems of power and oppression.",
                "Learned a lot of ways to think about race and racism, and how it is expressed in everyday American society.",
                "This course transformed my understanding of race and racialization in the United States, Critical Race Theory and its applications, intersectionality, abolition, reproductive justice, and American liberalism.",
                "RPL was an excellent exercise in synthesizing academic theory and real-world praxis. It brought together so many disciplines related to racial justice in the United States in a way that forced you to develop a multi-faceted understanding of the overarching issues in each unit, including sovereignty, the criminal legal system, critical race theory, and more.",
                "skills to evaluate systems and institutions to see their underlying oppression and how that relates to our material reality in society.",

                "This course taught me the fundamentals of Critical Race Theory and to see race in a different way than I ever have before. I learned much more about how the law creates inequity and the way that settler-colonialism and racial capitalism organize our society.",
                "Great for developing a better and more critical understanding of CRT which within itself is a crucial insight into how to think about everyday things + broader political histories. Learned a lot about how the law in the United States has created race and subjugated it.",
                "This has been the best course I have taken at Yale and it has reaffirmed my determination to involved with the law.",
                "So much. An expanded understanding of race, critical race theory, intersectionality, the criminal justice system, power of the prosecutor, colorblindness, federal Indian law, queerness and heteronormativity, unions, the power of language, disproportionate effects of race, and many more topics. Skills to change and improve my future.",
                "This course is a great foundation course! It's one of those courses everyone at Yale should take.",
                "I learned a lot about the the ways that race and U.S. political institutions co-constitute one another, and about the scholars and movements who are working to challenge institutional racism. It was helpful to practice synthesizing lots of different types of sources, both in class and in assignments.",
                "I learned how to reassess historical and current events through a critical lens, using new ideas to assess how state and economic actions harm marginalized groups.",
                "I developed literacy with critical race theory and a better ability to apply theoretical concepts on my own terms.",
                "I learned about critical race theory and abolition. I was exposed to a variety of readings by important figures in the field. Overall, I came away with a better vocabulary for and understanding of race in America.",
                "Through this course, I learned about Critical Race Theory and the fundamental way race is built into the structures of our society to create and sustain forms of oppression and grant power. I develop my ability to synthesize texts into papers, and the course taught me how to think more broadly about ways towards reform.",
                "This course provided students with new lens to view the institutions and norms that make up the U.S. experience, especially regarding the way that race, politics and the law affect one another. Students learned how to more carefully evaluate the history of this nation, including moments that had been largely deemed to be successes and advancements towards progress. The course also provided tangible steps to take towards a more equitable society, with key insights from scholars of justice and freedom.",
                "A survey of the scholarship surrounding race and political issues. Looking at law through the lens of critical race theory, outside of the \"neutral perch\" of law and government we had previously assumed.",
                "I gained insight into relevant current events and learned about the basis for a variety of social movements, issues like CRT, and Yales connection to a lot of these big problems.",
                "I learned about Critical Race Theory, racialization, internationalism, unions and more in a really accessible way. I came away from this class with theoretical approaches and also practical takeaways.",
                "This class has an incredible syllabus that provides a Critical Race Theory framework for analyzing law and politics. The readings are very insightful, and the assignments teach you how to synthesize ideas in order to create a larger argument. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing this class is and how much you learn from it!!",
                "I thought this was an excellent course. The lectures, readings, and discussions we had completely transformed my view of law and justice in America provided me with an expansive working knowledge of various political and race theorists and introduced me to American history in a way that I have never had before.",
                "We learned about Critical Race Theory, intersectionality, the carceral system, reproductive justice through the lens of race, indigenous rights, etc... It was great to be able to learn about such a wide array of topics through a legal lens and through engagement with lots of guest speakers!",
                "I gained an understanding of Critical Race Theory, the history and complexities of policing\/prisons in America, and ideas of freedom beyond US liberalism, all in the context of race and racial formation. My mind was opened to abolitionist theory and practice, which I am forever grateful for.",
                "Gained an understanding of critical race theory and how theories leading up to CRT and coming out of it have influenced modern political movements and organizing efforts around the country. Saw how race has impacted American law and society throughout history, and gained a vocabulary to discuss these issues.",
                "Applying academic theories and ideas on race to contemporary political and cultural issues. Learning how to use what we have learned to make change in the world while giving us room to form our own ideas and opinions.",
                "This course opens up your eyes to the multifaceted ways in which society works with a framework of hierarchies. Through a critical race theory perspective, this class sets up the foundation for many of CRTs scholars and gives you the tools to critically analyze current structures of power. A very insightful course that changes your perspective on the way you see certain things in society.",
                "I learned how to engage in a critical analysis of race and power.",
                "This class completely made me rethink how I interpret the world. I gained strong analytical skills.",
                "By taking this course, I developed a better vocabulary for analyzing United States history and politics in light of the deep-rooted racial and economic equality that persists in the country. I learned to draw connections between different forms of oppression and how to weave together different philosophies and scholarly works to imagine remedies to these forms of oppression.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about the history of different ideas like Critical Race Theory and Intersectionality, but also how to use them in practice. The assignments challenged us to actually utilize the skills we had learned rather than just thinking about them, which made me more confident in how much I had learned.",
                "I learned so much in this course. Our most in depth learning was about prison abolition, critical race theory, and sovereignty.",
                "I really appreciated this courses breadth in addressing the ways the concepts of race are relevant to so many political issues we face today, from reproductive rights, to gentrification, and more. The ways the readings, lectures, and guest speakers put into concrete terms phenomena that appear at first to have a more abstract connections to race was incredibly enlightening, and the emphasis on collective action through a diverse set of contributions in addressing these issues notably expanded my understanding of how issues of race need to be tackled.",
                "I learned a working knowledge of critical race theory and how to apply it, as well as a general understanding and ability to use legal arguments and other academic papers to interrogate societal and interpersonal relationships, especially regarding race in the United States.",
                "This course fundamentally changed how I view the concept of race and racial relations in the US. I learned about so many concepts and so much historical foundation that will continue to inform my discourse on race and the law.",
                "- A comprehensive understanding of critical race theory and its themes, including intersectionality, racial formation, etc.\r\n- Information and background on important federal cases that impact racial formation, institutional racism, harm towards indigenous people, and reproductive justice\r\n- Knowledge from a plethora of incredible outside speakers on their experiences",
                "Synthesizing a lot if ideas and using academic\/legal writing to make claims. Understanding things like abolition, freedom, rights, etc. In a different way",
                "I learned to really interrogate my presumptions and worldview through this class. I also learned to write much better and connect my thoughts much more clearly through my writing.",
                "This course definitely broadened the way I think about social action, organizing, and minority plights in general. The approach to analysis was extremely holistic, so it discouraged an easy solution to problems discussed which was great. The course also had a lot of guest speakers so I gained a lot of practical knowledge about working in various aspects of the law or organizing work.",
                "This course completely changed the way I think about the law in the US. There are so many assumptions that everybody makes about the law that Professor HoSang does such an amazing job of deconstructing and uncovering them as assumptions that don't have to be assumed. Too often I hear people saying that the way our world is either is good or is bad, but Professor HoSang starts from the beginning and talks about how race, politics, and the law in the US were constructed, what the latent assumptions in that model are, what is good about it (and who it benefits) and what is not (and who is harmed).",
                "Within this course, I have been inspired to apply the concept of mutuality, kinship and the power of the collective to my organizing and day-to-day interactions. It reaffirmed my valuing of the power of stories and truth-telling and belief in the looming harm of the preserved fiction of race. I was especially moved by our study of non-hierarchical collective organizations like the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA) and the Asian Immigrant Women Advocates (AIWA) in Southern and Northern California. The course informed my understanding of the urgent need to reject hierarchy in all its forms. It also pushed me to reject the piecemeal process of incremental legal reform that fuels the myth of racial progress in the U.S. with the idea that laws can outlaw discrimination and that a post-racial contemporary society is on the horizon. With this move beyond rights-based, law-expansionist freedom, I feel a deep commitment to the collective, to arm-and-arm freedom and bold reimaginings of what that may look like based on the branches of our predecessors."

                "This was a great course! Lecture was super engaging, the guest speakers were so open to answering our questions, and the readings were so interesting and worthwhile. Professor HoSang was also incredibly available. The few things I might change would be to have a clearer idea of what a synthesis paper is since that is such a large component of the class and perhaps find a way to engage with some of the longer readings that didn't correspond to a guest speaker to help digest and understand them a bit better. But overall I loved this course!",
                "Amazing course--I have no notes for its improvement.",
                "Strengths: the readings were very interesting; lectures were engaging especially because Professor HoSang asked us to discuss questions with each other; synthesis papers were a good way to put the readings together and digest the content; I appreciated how the final paper was a short reflection paper and not a super lengthy assignment; guest speakers were really interesting!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were lengthy, which meant that in discussion section we oftentimes didn't get to all of it (I would've liked shorter more focused readings); even though the lectures were interesting, sometimes they were packed with a lot of information which made it hard to keep up\/digest the information",
                "strengths: easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, should be mandatory for all students. Professor is passionate, the lectures are fascinating, the readings are important and the assignments are simple and helpful\r\nweaknesses: the last unit is a bit dry",
                "Professor HoSang is an incredible lecturer who is not only knowledgable but passionate about the subject. The course was very well organized and the assignments were both fair and helpful. The main issue with the course was the amount of guest speakers, who tended to interrupt the track of learning for the sake of career q&a's. As the amount of guest speakers picked up, I found that I was learning less and less about each concept.",
                "Just an overall amazing course. Maybe grading could be improved in the sense that the synthesis papers seemed to really be wanting students to say one particular thing and then was graded for the accuracy of that, but having more open ended prompts might be a better way to engage students of varying levels of agreement with what the course teaches (for reference, I very much appreciated everything I enjoyed and agreed with it, but maybe other students were not as liberal in some subjects of the course)",
                "Guest speakers were one of my favorite aspects of the class - you have the opportunity to learn from some really amazing, incredibly smart and influential people. I think guest lectures could be a more effective way of learning rather than all guest conversations, so we could learn about their ideas in their own format entirely.",
                "I loved the course. I believe that there should have been other creative ways to summarize the unit other than the synthetic papers but the course was amazing. Also, I would suggest that the reading load would be lighter.",
                "Covered a breadth of topics, brought in speakers who gave us unique perspectives and reinforced our readings\/lectures, honestly a great class.",
                "Strengths: Wide range of topics covered that represented many identities, extremely valuable information, amazing guest speakers\r\nWeakness: none",
                "Great material and great instructors. The guest speakers they are able to bring are a huge strength and an inspiring way of learning. The only thing I would change is adding more to the lecture slides or even posting the slides\/lecture. Professor Hosang provided many insights verbally, and sometimes it is easier to see things written for me rather than hear.",
                "Great lectures!! Awesome guest speakers",
                "I note that this class in some ways showed the \"private school edge\" more than others. I noticed this in how people, regardless of class year, found the readigns either impenetrable and too much, or quite easy if very very engaging. This type of fluency then translated it seemed into understanding how to integrate texts and theory into the synthetic papers and what they were looking for. I wonder if in a future version of this lecture, the department could do either\r\n(1) hire undergrad teaching assistants to lead a reading group (not in place of section but for anyone who wants to delve furhter for any reason into what the readings say in a more blow by blow manner)\r\n(2) having a dedicated set of tutors at the Poorvu center (DS does this with tutors who were in the program and now are writing partners) who can give a presentation, hold office hours fo rthe class, etc.\r\n\r\nThe class is so wonderful; I just noticed this weird split and was wondering if these methods might help with it.",
                "I loved the readings, speakers, Prof HoSang's lectures and the questions we were asked to engage with for our papers.",
                "A large strength of this course was Professor HoSang's engaging lectures, as well as the large number of guest speakers, and variety in course material. I also loved the discussion sections where we were allowed to put in practice the organizing method of collaboration and coalition building through sharing our ideas.",
                "Awesome course!! Basically all strengths. Lecture is well thought out, readings are interesting, and the class strikes a good balance of having enough assignments to keep you engaged, but not a huge workload.",
                "The lectures were very engaging, the guest speakers were wonderful, section conversations were great, and the readings were incredibly impactful. I only wish there was more discussion (both positive and negative) of other career paths beyond law school.",
                "This course is very centered around student learning. It is never about regurgitating information, but rather, is always about finding critical ways to think about pressing social topics. From guest speakers to viewing art, class is never a traditional lecture. In breaking tradition, this course allows for students to become innovative in making large scale social change.",
                "The speakers and lectures were absolutely the strength of this course. HoSang is a very engaging lecturer who is very well connected by his time in academia and professional experience, meaning that we had the opportunity to hear from some very interesting speakers very often throughout the course. The course was however very reading heavy, often having to read the entire novel of the speaker we were hearing from, which while provided important context to the course disincentivized many students from completing them and therefore hurt course engagement particularly during section.",
                "I think the strengths are definitely the material and the lectures themselves, the only weakness I'd say is that some of the readings are impossibly long. the lectures also summarized many of the readings, which de-incentivized reading them.",
                "Strengths:\r\nWe are so lucky to have a class like this at Yale, especially as CRT and robust education about race are coming under attack in schools across the United States. First, Professor HoSang is a fantastic instructor and put together great lectures and a fantastic syllabus. I learned a lot from the readings (for students interested in this class, the time that you put into the readings will largely determine how much you get out of them). Second, the guest speakers in this class were AMAZING -- it was a great, great gift to hear from so many amazing people. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI think that some concepts in the course still seem a bit abstract to me, including how \"markets\" and \"capitalism\" play driving roles in racial subordination. I think that I still wonder what exactly \"markets\" and \"capitalism\" mean, and how, in concrete terms, a society without markets or capitalism would achieve different, more equal outcomes. Generally, I felt that the course presumed that we all had some agreement about what these terms meant, but it often seemed like we were discussing these ideas in the abstract.",
                "Strengths: Professor HoSang's lectures are fantastic and the course's assignments are super manageable so the emphasis was shifted from the grade to the act of learning, and the speakers were often incredible\r\nWeaknesses: Too many readings, section often felt unstructured and unhelpful, and while the first two units felt very cohesive, it felt like the last unit was kind of all over the place thematically",
                "Strengths -- assignments are useful for checking in with yourself about what you've learned and how to think through these frameworks and their histories, great lectures + guest speakers, TFs were very good, very interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- recorded lectures would greatly improve the course (they are only made available to you if you missed the class, but I like to rewatch lectures even if I went to class to retouch on topics I might have not understood well), guest speakers were great but I wish there was more time for lecturing & talking about the readings in-class, readings were very long some weeks",
                "Strengths include the multimedia presentations. No weaknesses.",
                "Strength - This class was very very well done. The lectures and sections were incredibly powerful and amazing. Best strength was Kenny Reams giving a lecture and reading poetry by phone. \r\nWeakness - Possibly the third section of the class. Very interesting stuff, but a little rushed and the central idea was less clear",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed that the course was broken up into three units and three synthesis papers. I think the papers make sense as assignments for the course. I enjoyed Professor Ho Sangs teaching style as well. I was engaged in lecture and I appreciated him the videos, songs, guest speakers, etc. \r\nWeaknesses: too much reading to the point it became difficult to engage with them, discussion sections felt tense at times (hyperintellectual and not accessible for me as someone who comes from a low income underprivileged background). It felt isolating at times not feeling able to partake in discussions of issues that directly affect me and not the people who often spoke.",
                "I really loved this class but I wish lecture recordings were available. There is a heavy reading load at the beginning of the semester. This is def not a gut",
                "Strengths: great lectures and syllabus, reasonable and generative homework assignments, good sections (I liked that each student presented at least once), and great guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been nice to have a more immediate and direct way to share information amongst the class about relevant protests and events happening on campus; I think this direct line of communication would help us put the concepts we learned about into practice.",
                "The lecture is great! Professor HoSang is an engaging lecturer and has amazing content each week. The speakers were a huge plus. Yet, the readings are too much and too difficult to follow, making it difficult to connect all of them to class content, he lectures too quickly to grasp everything, and the third section of the course did not flow well.",
                "Weaknesses: too much reading to keep up with\r\nStrengths: excellent lectures, incorporation of art",
                "The lectures are very engaging and the abolition unit was particularly good, in my opinion. The guest speakers were also amazing.\r\n\r\nSome of the topics felt like they could have been explored in more depth. For example, the lecture on indigeneity was s but surface level. Perhaps this could be remedied by inviting guest lecturers, not just speakers who are interviewed.",
                "This course was structured really well in a way that improved my learning of the material - I liked how we started more theoretical and then moved into one arena, namely policing and incarceration, in which CRT directly applies, and then moved more broad by focusing on how to think of reform. I really appreciated and relied on a section as a means to better understand and work through the complicated ideas. That being said, the class time focused on both unpacking the texts and going through historical examples as well was crucial to my understanding of the material. I loved how we would start the class with music or some form of art.",
                "The primary strength of this course is Professor HoSang, he brings with him extensive academic and professional experience related to the course material. and this helps students better understand the course concepts. Additionally, there was a great selection of course reading materials that provided excellent insights. The guest lecturers were also phenomenal - every presenter brought a unique perspective to share with the class and they were truly excellent.",
                "Prof HoSang is a great lecturer and made the course very engaging. Sometimes, it felt like there was so much information that we were speeding through it and didn't have time to take it in. But overall, the course was well organized, and the structure of the assignments was never overwhelming. I was sometimes a little frustrated with the prompts for the papers, they felt vague and impossible.",
                "Strengths- Prof HoSang is very engaging and passionate about the material, his lectures tend to be very helpful in terms of framing the readings\/concepts of that week. The guest speakers in the class are also incredibly relevant and helpful to hear from \r\n\r\nWeaknesses sometimes very long readings will be assigned that we dont get to cover in class or in section and its difficult to grapple with and understand that info when theres no guidance on it; would prefer to either get the important sections of some of these readings or discuss them a little further",
                "I really appreciated this class. Professor HoSang is wonderfully fit for the class. He is super kind and passionate and happy to connect with you outside the class. Lots of readings, which is u fortunate sometimes when I wasnt able to read the longer ones to completion.",
                "The biggest strengths are the incredible professor (Professor HoSang is the BEST!!) and the amazing syllabus. This class is a must take!! The only weakness is that you end up writing five papers for the course (plus the short ungraded but mandatory essay at the beginning). Even though the papers are fairly short, it is a significant amount of work.",
                "This class was well organized, the lectures were fantastic, and the reading and writing assignments were very reasonable.",
                "The material is incredibly strong, the guest speakers who come in are great, and the care Professor HoSang and the TFs put into teaching the material truly makes the class. At times the readings are quite long, so I'd definitely recommend skimming!",
                "Strengths: incredible material and content with a brilliant lecturer\r\nWeakness: sometimes the incorporation of certain materials (like art pieces) didn't make sense, also three essays due at the end was rough",
                "I really loved taking the course and many of the issues that we discussed and insights that I gained will stick with me for years. Lectures really helped break down the dense readings and the intricacies of the issues that we were tackling, and used a lot of varying media to make ideas clear. I liked the synthesis paper assignments as they improved my writing skills while also helping me engage with the course content and think about how these different theories and ideas interacted with one another. HoSang and his TFs were very passionate about these issues, and their energy and positivity influenced the rest of the class in a way that few other lectures or courses have been able to do for me. The only weaknesses I can pinpoint are that the readings tended to be on the longer side, which was an obstacle to student engagement with them, but since they were each so important, I wish we were able to engage with them for a longer period of time or make them more manageable. Second, there was a spotlight on black communities and especially black women in the class, which was super important and eye-opening, but I wish that we could have spent the same amount of time discussing issues and theory as they related to other minority communities in America, especially Indigenous, Latino\/a, and AAPI communities.",
                "Strengths: Professor HoSang was an amazing lecturer. Class felt very engaging and the guest speakers who were brought in were amazing. Readings also varied and brought interesting perspectives. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings were way too long, would've been better to read a selection from the assigned reading instead of the whole thing. Additionally, the last unit of the course felt very disorganized and didn't seem to have the flow of the first two units. It almost attempted to talk about other marginalized groups all lumped into one unit.",
                "Professor HoSang is a wonderful professor and explained complex concepts in an accessible way. The lecture notes and guest lectures were very helpful and insightful.",
                "Strengths: engaging, interesting\r\nWeaknesses: poor organization of the third unit, too much emphasis on law",
                "The lectures in this course are very useful and engaging. The sections, facilitated by a different student each week, are very helpful for processing the information covered in readings and lectures. The reading can be overwhelming from time to time.",
                "I didnt see many weaknesses in this course. The variety in lecture was a strength. We had speakers both in person and digitally, from other states and Yale, and whose books we read in class. It provided new insights with each class and allowed student participation to change and be meaningful in different ways.",
                "One strength of the course is that the units are all long and we go very in depth in the topics. I now feel like I could explain any of the major course concepts to a friend or family member, whereas in other classes we merely skim the topics. A weakness of the course is that there are so many readings. Some of them feel unnecessary and the sheer amount of reading per week isn't necessary to delve deeply into the topics.",
                "I think the structure of the course was well suited to provide a good foundational structure of different approaches to origins of race and their general implications in America, then expanding to examine these more theoretical aspects in the form of concrete examples. One weakness, however, was that some of the assignments, while helpful in providing incentive and an opportunity to wrap my mind around the different readings and themes, felt a little bit like busy work  I would have appreciated assignments that allowed me to actually analyze the texts and offer my own input on the arguments made. I also think there could be a wider variety of assignments, which would be in alignment with the idea of law and academia being only one aspect to the fight against racial injustice.",
                "There are really no weaknesses with the course in my opinion- it is the best course I have taken at Yale so far. Though it is a larger lecture, there are so many opportunities to engage, and the course is one that is so essential and so well taught.",
                "Strengths: Professor HoSang is an animated and passionate professor that is amazing at explaining and emphasizing the main points of every lecture. Most of the content was interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: there is so much assigned reading and you dont really have to read it for section so everyone resorts to not doing most of the readings.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- INCREDIBLY engaging lectures, super cool speakers, great organization and setup\r\n- Very useful content that will impact my work in courses to come, and beyond\r\n- Synthesis papers forced you to dive deep into readings and really understand and interpret them\r\n- The outside event paper and synthesis were really meaningful to write!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- slightly overwhelming reading load, that sometimes encouraged me to do even less reading than I would have if it was more manageable\r\n- super small critique but the synthesis paper was limited to 3 pages max and I found it nearly impossible to answer the prompt in so little space. 3-4 pages would have been more reasonable and still concise",
                "Strengths: Great organization of topics, great to learn from others who are community organizers, lawyers, journalists, etc. Because this provides forms of engagement with social justice and other kinds of work regardless of major\/career",
                "I think the way that Professor HoSang structured the class and the assignments was really well thought out and really helped me to retain what I read as opposed to doing the readings and completely forgetting the main points. The synthetic papers were held to a high standard but it helped that we did not have to be too specific with citations, meaning that citing really worked in our favor as opposed to being a tedious task.",
                "The lectures are great  super engaging while remaining nuanced. The reading is A LOT, which is a bummer because this is one of those courses where you really get the sense that you would benefit from doing every single one but I found that impossible. Personally, I really struggled with synthesis papers as a mode of assessment. This was the first time I'd been asked to write that sort of paper and it could have been nice for Prof. HoSang to provide an outstanding example at the start of class. The synthesis papers were also tough because they ask students to draw really heavily on the readings but no other element of daily class instruction calls for a student to have heavily engaged with the readings  which is perhaps also a testament to the strength of Prof. HoSang's lecturing.",
                "Strengths: Professor HoSang is an unbelievable lecturer that the whole world should listen to every time he opens his mouth. The writing in the class wasn't too difficult but didn't feel boring either and, though the reading could be dense at points, the densest readings were the most interesting and they're easy to skim if you don't feel like reading them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a testament to Professor HoSang that the only part of the class he couldn't control -- when students asked guest speakers questions -- ran on too long. You are not smarter than the guests on stage, so don't act like you are!",
                "Strengths: incredibly engaging lectures, phenomenal reading selection, and overall is a course that builds a sense of BIPOC empowerment\r\nWeaknesses: course material could expand to include more art\/film\/narrative forms as proof of alternative forms of protest and collective power, would help to receive some guides to interpret particularly dense texts, craved alternate forms of assessment beyond synthesis papers (the inclusion of a creative\/more free-form project would greatly benefit us and model the range of expression\/mediums of protest which we studied)."

                "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in the law\/politics and want to engage with questions of race, this is the course for you. I questioned and challenged so many beliefs that I came into this class with and got so much out of it. It was always an enjoyable class to go to and even the readings were enjoyable to spend time with. I met so many wonderful people as well from Professor HoSang to my classmates to my TAs, so it was well worth my time.",
                "Yes--this course is absolutely phenomenal. If you are reading this, please add this course to your schedule immediately--you won't regret it.",
                "Yes! This course covers important information that any major should learn about. If you are also thinking about going to law school this course is especially beneficial as there are several attorney guest speakers. If you're interested in organizing this course is also helpful as it definitely helped me rethink what leadership should look like and what true freedom means. The readings were also very interesting  I especially found interesting Killing the Black Body by Dorothy Roberts. While it can be a lot of reading, it's worth it because the content is so engaging and insightful.",
                "Absolutely. A course to take before graduating.",
                "if you dont have a nuanced understanding of the impact of race then definitely but don't waste your time if you do",
                "Yes",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, you learn so much. Any Er&M\/PLSC major--it's a must to ground your learning with these foundational understandings of race and freedom in the US",
                "Yes, this should be a foundational course for everyone and is extremely useful and beneficial to create progress moving forward in whatever spaces you enter.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I was never exposed to many of these topics in high school or even in life. I think the skills I will take away are important in daily conversation and how I will live my life. This course was the first course where I really felt like I was experiencing something unique at Yale University.",
                "YYYESSS!! Hands down one of the best at Yale",
                "Definitely",
                "YES! I think everyone should take this class. It gives you a lot of information and interesting questions to consider. You'll learn so much in this class.",
                "Yes! Absolutely would recommend to everyone. Especially STEM students who are looking for a humanities class that has a milks workload but amazing content.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The course material is extremely engaging and you walk away feeling that you have engaged with real-world organizing skills that you can carry with you.",
                "Yes!! I think it is best for people who haven't taken a lot of ER&M or AMST classes, maybe this will be your first time reading critical race theory, etc. If you've taken a lot of classes like this in the past, this one will seem redundant and perhaps a bit surface level. But if you're new to the field then this is perfect!",
                "It's a good overview but probably not for people already well-versed in critical race theory. Lectures are great but assignments are confusing and overall not very helpful to learning.",
                "I recommend this course to everyone I come across. It is my favorite course I've taken (and the most impactful course I've taken) at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. This is truly one of the best courses you can take at Yale. It was my favorite course. This course provides students the rare opportunity to reflect on how they think when it comes to the most pressing social and political challenges of our day.",
                "Absolutely. Anyone interested in any of the departments this course is cross-listed for must take this course, and I encourage you to do so in your first or second year.",
                "Yes. I think this course is very interesting and can help change one's perspective about the US and the world.",
                "Yes. There will be few opportunities to take a class like this one ever again. I went into the class with pretty low understanding of abolition, Critical Race Theory, and modes of collective liberation, but came out of the class with new understanding and excitement to advance justice and racial equality in my own life.",
                "Absolutely. This is an incredible class and I think everyone needs to learn and form their own opinions about the subjects covered in the course.",
                "Yes. Great course for anyone considering it really teaches you a lot about the political history of race in this country and I think that's something everybody can benefit from learning about and apply to their everyday and professional lives. Prof. HoSang is great and had a great team of TFs. Readings are interesting and you learn a lot from them. Lectures are fun to attend.",
                "YES; it will truly open your eyes to the faults in our legal system.",
                "Yes. 100% yes. This is a class, or classes like this should be taken by every single student at Yale.",
                "I would recommend the course because I learned so much about myself and the communities around me.",
                "Yes!! Essential for any political science, American studies, or ERM major. Its a very intro\/survey-level course so it wont be particularly challenging if youve taken classes in this area before, but either way its a great synthesis of important concepts that pushes you intellectually without being overwhelmingly difficult.",
                "Yes, but the workload needs to be reassessed. Too many small essays in the end! Otherwise, content-wise, the course is pretty good.",
                "Yes! A great course that is framed as an introduction but also has depth.",
                "Yes! This is a great course that will give you a vocabulary and outlook that you\r\ncan bring to all other courses at Yale.",
                "Yes, I would certainly recommend that every student at Yale take this course. I learned a new version of American history that has changed the way I think about the institutions built around me today. It completely changed the way I think about race and social movements as well.",
                "Yes, I strongly recommend this course to any student of any major. This is the type of course that is so comprehensive and essential, especially given the state of the world today, that all Yale College students would benefit from a course like this that provides students the tools to view the world.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes! The class does a good job covering some really relevant topics like CRT, sovereignty, etc. and framing the ways in which real communities are organizing and working to bring change. Prof HoSang is a wonderful professor as well",
                "Yes, a foundational course for life and a lot of different disciplines",
                "Everyone should take this course. You walk away with a much better understanding of Critical Race Theory and learn how to apply CRT when analyzing politics and the law. You will always look forward to lecture because Professor HoSang is the best!!",
                "Absolutely, this has been the best class I have taken at Yale thus far.",
                "Absolutely! You learn such important information that will help you gain a new perspective not just about the material directly covered in the class, but also about the material you learn in other classes.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of area of study. Especially if you don't already have a good understanding of CRT or abolition, this course really does a great job at introducing the core ideas, as well as proposing some really incredible and original theory at the end.",
                "100% recommend. If you're interested even slightly in issues surrounding race, politics, or the law in America, or in critical race theory, you should take this class. It changed my perspective on how American society has been constructed, and will have a lasting impact on how I look at the world. Great professor, great lecture, great TFs.",
                "Yes  it helped me understand our country and history in a new way and helped me respond to political arguments and issues I care about through a more complete academic and historical lens. It also gave me hope about the different ways I can enact change in the world from both within and outside of systems of power.",
                "YES! This course is amazing to take and sets up the foundation for so many other classes that use CRT as a pivotal point of scholarship. This lecture does not feel boring whatsoever and you get to learn so much.",
                "Yes!",
                "definitely yes! i recommend every student take this class",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, regardless of academic interest.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student, regardless of their interests or major. I found the content of the course to be relevant to many different fields and would be helpful to anyone.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. All of the information is incredibly pertinent in current discussions, and also having an understanding of historical issues regarding race, sovereignty, and recognition and important in any field of study. Professor HoSang is incredibly engaging and a leader in his field, so it was great to learn from him.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any person ever. This is a fantastic course for ER&M majors and non-ER&M majors, and is a great introduction to critical race theory for anyone with no background knowledge. HoSang breaks down concepts and terms to make them accessible to everyone, and he is an optimistic yet realistic social critic.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor HoSang is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter, and he facilitates a really comfortable learning environment. The lectures are also super engaging, with the incorporation of historical figures, information about organizations that are doing work pertaining to the subject matter, and different mediums through which various experiences have been communicated  from writing, to music, to visual art.",
                "Yes- this course changed my entire worldview and has completely altered my future plans in so many ways. I feel like I am a different and better person for it.",
                "Yes! It is an easier class workload wise, but the content is just great. I learned so much about how race and the law interact and all the guest speakers (and there were many) were intriguing.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! This course is incredibly meaningful, and it will provide you with the perspective and tools to further engage on everyday issues related to race and politics. I have brought the course content back to my suitemates, family, and friends, and I truly cannot recommend this enough. Lectures are engaging and fun, HoSang is super passionate, and everyone in the course seems eager to learn. Definitely take it!",
                "this is one of the rare lectures that I genuinely wanted to go to and showed up for everyday no matter what. it's designed so well imo because professor hosang does such a good job incorporating such a diverse range of media and guess lecturers- we see artwork, watch documentaries, listen to music, authors of the books and articles we read in class come in to talk and answer our questions, attorneys from local new haven communities come into talk about topics related to our readings- it's just honestly done so well and I've never been more engaged in a lecture class full of 100+ ppl. it doesn't feel like I'm just copying down notes on a slideshow and going home to write papers\/take a test- I'm actually getting to hear the insights of people directly involved in the research and field and every class I come out thinking and questioning everything",
                "Absolutely! I think this class should be required for all and in particular for ER&M majors. This class provides some tools for engaging in important work to make the world a better place.",
                "Only as an introductory course to abolitionism and sovereignty. This course discusses these issues at a very surface level. I would not recommend it for those more well versed or experienced in the subject matter as you might find this course boring and repetitive.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class because it functions almost as an introductory course but much more in-depth and concentrated which makes it very engaging while being easily understandable.",
                "I would. I took this course purely for fun, and I enjoyed it. I think that you would Really get a lot out of this class if you were exploring going to law school or working in organizing out of college. Even as not falling in those two categories, I really loved the outside speaker visits, so I can only imagine the impact for someone actively interested in applying to law school.",
                "I think every Yale student should take this class. Professor HoSang is a brilliant lecturer who is incredible at conveying complex topics in an accessible and engaging way. If you're anything like me, you will have heard some of the ideas from the class on Twitter or from other people, but hearing them from Professor HoSang (and, to a lesser extent, in the readings) makes you understand that, even if you've heard some of the ideas before, you've heard them through a many-person long game of telephone that obscures the power of what they are trying to say. Even if you don't agree with Professor HoSang, I think you will respect him and understand what he is arguing -- coming from somebody who is often dismissive of leftist ideas I find to be poorly thought through, nothing Professor HoSang says is poorly thought through. Yale is lucky to have Professor HoSang and you should absolutely hear whatever he has to say.",
                "Absolutely. RPL is a must-take course for anybody at Yale -- ER&M, PolySci, or otherwise. Professor Hosang does a fantastic job of making the course content relevant and accessible for everyone in the class, regardless of their discipline, especially in the way that he shines light on Yale's complicity and place in history among so many of the systems and structures we discuss.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in questioning their pre-conceived notions of freedom, eager to learn about intergenerational traditions of protest, and values truth-telling in all its many forms.",
                "YES, DEFINITELY. HoSang is an amazing lecturer. The class is well-organized, the readings are interesting, and the essays always felt like a valuable use of time.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Its a great introductory course that exposes you to the literature and frameworks of critica race theory and its very well organized so I felt like I was learning and understanding a lot of the material."
