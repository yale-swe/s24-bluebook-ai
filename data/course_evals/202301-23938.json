I also learned a lot about how cocktails and alcohol are tied to the economy and how the government uses that to capitalize off us. I also feel like I strengthened my creative skills, and this class forced me to think out of the box in a way I never had before.",
                "I'll never look at cocktails the same way. John and Jessica bring such different perspectives to the table, but both are extremely knowledgeable about the history of spirits and what they stand for.",

                "Strengths: the course definitely has a focus on helping you get better. The professors wanted everyone to succeed and were dedicated to accomplish this. About halfway through the class, I started to really appreciate the critical feedback I was receiving on my assignments, and focused on this improvement without stressing about the grade so much \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this isnt necessarily a weakness if youre in this position, but for the menu assignment (and others) the class definitely expects that you have a previous base knowledge of what alcohols mix well together and whats in certain drinks. Sometimes I felt behind since I didnt feel as skilled in this as my peers.",
                "independent project of creating a cocktail party! definitely a difficult one, but very rewarding at the end.",
                "The strengths of this class is the level of knowledge the professors have. The weaknesses are that they sometimes lacked synchrony and harmony. It seemed often that the teachers were on different pages about what they wanted to discuss or talk about. This made lectures feel somewhat disjointed. I didn't always walk away knowing what I was supposed to learn. The material of the course was also really broad, so sometimes it felt like I was going to a class to just talk about anything related to the idea of cocktails. I think the class could benefit from more structure, clearer themes, and more defines takeaways. I also think that the assignments were often unclear and did not always set the students up for success. So I think overall the class would benefit from better communication and clearer instructions.",
                "i loved the different approaches Jessica and John had to conducting the course. I think it made it even more engaging and gave us a fuller picture of the history of cocktails and spirits. I did think, at times, it could be a little distracting when they disagreed a lot, but still very engaging",
                "Sometimes the discussions felt a bit all over the place, but the course did a great job of following what students were interested in talking about. I especially liked discussing current events in the drinks world and how they related to the history we were learning about.",
                "I think the grading was, in some cases, extreme in either direction for individual assignments, but overall, this was an incredibly memorable course and frankly, one of the best courses I've ever taken.",
                "Strengths \r\nInsight from industry professionals \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\nNo actual interaction with cocktail (E.g. drinking, making, etc.)",
                "There were a lot of strengths. The professors were very fun, engaging, and understanding, which motivated me to come to class every week. They also made every lecture content interesting too. This has by far been the best course I've taken at Yale. The only weakness is that one of the Professors will be leaving next semester :(("

The teachers have strong personalities that often clash from eachother and this can sometimes take away from the learning experience. However, overall I don't regret taking the class and all students ended up with great grades.",

The course was also structured so that each and every student was encouraged to participate in discussions, which helped propel class discussions. I had a lot of fun doing the weekly assignments and final project as well!"
