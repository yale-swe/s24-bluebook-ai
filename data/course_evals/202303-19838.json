Some of the art and texts we looked at were very complex, more than what was covered up to Spanish L2, so I had to improvise and do my best to understand."

                "Very well taught class - Juliana is excellent. Interesting subject areas. Main drawback is that you are assumed to know the grammar from level 2 and theres no exercises or space to practice. As we learnt the subjunctive, future and other tenses very quickly in level 2, I had forgotten lots of it and still am not great at the end of the course. Need more conjugation practice.",
                "Strengths: The course is accommodating to a range of learning levels, and encourages student participation in a low-risk environment. There is a lot of opportunity to get to know peers through group projects and in-class discussions. Grading is very fair.\r\nWeaknesses: The course can be stressful, as a lot of preparation is required before presentations or discussions. The expectations for participation can be quite heavy handed.",
                "You always could plan what you were going to say ahead of time, and were never forced to push your self grammatically, so I went through the semester with good grades and projects, yet I don't feel I learned any new Spanish.",
                "This course felt a little advanced for someone coming from L2. It was a very different course design than L1 and L2, and it felt more catered to someone placing into L3 from years of previous Spanish experience, rather than for someone who is learning Spanish fully for the first time at Yale. I wish there would have been more grammar and vocabulary covered. It was more jumping into the content and being expected to speak and understand all Spanish, rather than learning the more complex verb-tenses and grammatical structures that are often used. Even if the content was covered at the end of L2, a review and check for complete understanding would have helped me be more confident in my speaking and writing. This class relies entirely on projects, and again, for someone who does not feel secure in fully understanding verb-tenses besides present, I do not think this was a good indicator of my Spanish knowledge or progress. I think quizzes or tests with vocabulary and grammar would have boosted my learning more."

                "Yes, but I think improvements could be made in adjusting it for people who knew Spanish previously and those who are still learning the language. It is a fun course because of the content and projects, I just do not know how much more Spanish I actually learned. Instead I am more proficient and guessing what is being said in a situation and trying to respond."
