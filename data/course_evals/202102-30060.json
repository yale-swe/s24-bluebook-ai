                "This class offered incredible new insights into how systems of housing and education work within the United States and how they structure and are structured by race and racism. The readings in this class are fantastic and offer a dense amount of new information and perspectives.",

A weakness of the class is that the assessment instructions were often vague, so I didn't feel very clear about what I was supposed to be doing. A way to improve this class would be to provide greater direction in the essays.",
                "Strengths lie in the content; weaknesses in the brevity of the summer session in which it is offered.",
                "strengths: the readings were very insightful and useful in understanding the history of segregation in America\r\nweaknesses: classes were largely lecture based, would have liked more discussion time",
                "The strengths of this class are its heavy discussion focus, the wonderfully curated reading list, and the faculty. Professor Barnes and Gabrielle created an amazing class environment for considering and pondering the material, and their assignments were perfect for synthesizing and developing new opinions. I absolutely adored Professor Barnes and Gabrielle and am so very appreciative of them.",
                "Professor Barnes was fantastic.\r\n\r\nI would like to see more quantitative studies to support the qualitative works.",
                "The readings were fantastic, but I wish we had some shorter readings in order to cover more material. Incorporating podcast and short films could also help enrich the readings.",
                "Only weakness is that it seemed like certain weeks were about education and others about housing. Sometimes it was hard to piece these complicated policies together.  Also the grades did not come back fast enough - so it was hard to improve our work week to week.",
                "Strengths include the discussion nature of the course, and how students were able to freely discuss their thoughts on the assigned readings. I wished there was a clearer transition/link between education and housing policy that was mentioned in readings. There were also at times lulls in discussion, and so during those moments, guiding questions would be helpful to facilitate further conversation. Another improvement may be including a list of questions or topics for students to think about before the assigned readings, so they come to class prepared with engaging, critical thoughts.",
                "The strengths of this course were that it was very interactive and thought-provoking. The weaknesses were that the lecture portion took up a bit too much of class time. It would be nice to have these parts recorded to watch beforehand in the future."

                "Yes, anyone going into education should have a grasp of the content covered in this class",
                "Yes, definitely -- this was a different from what I normally take as a CS major, but the weekly readings were very interesting, as are the reading responses that are graded pretty generously. Also, it puts into perspective the education I received growing up, and how different it is from one of my peers.",
