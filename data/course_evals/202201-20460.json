Engaged with a variety of iconic sociology texts and learned the arguments of several important sociological thinkers, including Foucault, Durkheim, and Marx. More broadly, learned to think like a sociologist, refuted arguments of biological determinism and instead looked for the social factors underscoring behavior.",
                "This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. The lectures are so interesting, and you can tell Professor Smith is extremely knowledgable and caring about sociology! Every reading directly helped with the course! I cannot recommend this course enough!",

I had a rough understanding of what sociology was before this course, but now I think I could apply a sociological perspective to just about anything: health, sports, sexual choices, train stations, discrimination, etc. Important thinkers/paradigms were reinforced throughout the semester: Weber, Durkheim, Marx, Foucault, etc. I also think I gained a lot of familiarity with the fields primary literature, by virtue of all of the courses reading being journal articles. Overall, you just gain so much information over the course of the semester that its impossible not to start noticing its application in everyday life."

                "Strengths: light workload from week to week; enthusiastic professor; wide variety of topics covered; teaches students to be more literate in sociological fields \r\nWeaknesses: lectures were based on topics rather than thinkers for the majority of the semester, but I think that some times it would be beneficial for the lectures to cover a specific thinker. Durkheim, for example, reappeared throughout the whole course. It would have been helpful to have a summary of his thoughts specifically to have a more cohesive picture of his body of work.",
                "I have a love of sociology now! The course was very strongly organized, with sections to help student education!",
                "Prof. Smith is a great lecturer! The topics are great and he makes lectures engaging and funny. Sections were not very interesting, though, but that might just depend on your TF.",
                "This course was very good in the breadth of topics it covered. However, this also meant that we flew through topics at the speed of light, with Professor Smith speaking 100 miles an hour for 50 minutes every class period.",
                "I think instructions for papers and assignments can clearer and benefit from a rubric. I also think there should be more time given for the midterm exam, and what is expected of the answers. The lectures were often interesting but fast paced. This course will cover sociology extensively.",
                "More interaction during classtime would be appreciated.",
                "The strengths of the course are that it covers a vast array of topics in a short amount of time. Weakness is that it is not recorded.",
                "Strengths: study guides and reading guides were very helpful for reinforcing lectures and section discussions. Professor Smith is an engaging lecturer. The papers we read for discussion section were interesting.",
                "Strength covers a lot of content and lectures are engaging. Content is shallow but it is an intro course",
                "i loved the section readings\r\nthe lecture was engaging but the slides were not as clear as they could be",
                "Strengths:\r\nProfessor Smith is a clear lecturer and the concepts covered are super intriguing\r\nReadings were very interesting\r\nI loved Section and my TF, Jessie, was incredibly engaging\r\nThe material in general is amazing \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLectures could feel disorganized\r\nLack of notes and supplementary material -- I felt like questions on the midterm or final sometimes expected more than what had been taught or covered in class\r\nAnswers to study guide questions would have helped a lot \r\nSample midterm would have also been great\r\nGrading can feel arbitrary -- I would lose points sometimes and have no idea why. Feedback felt limited.",
                "While the section presentations were entertaining, it would have been helpful to spend more time on the readings.",

                "Strengths:\r\n- Engaging, knowledgeable, and responsive professor\r\n- Fairly well-organized syllabus\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Sections could be better organized, have more structure to each class\r\n- The study guides/lecture notes were great for the first few lectures, the rest just became more sparse, then blank\r\n- Lectures could incorporate slightly more student activities/interaction",
                "the sections could have been prepared in a way that was more engaging and thought-provoking",
                "The lectures and slides are very plain, it makes reviewing difficult. The course could be improved by including more information or at least the name of the concept so additional research can be done after class.",
                "Strengths: Content was very interesting, Prof Smith was awesome\r\nWeaknesses: Slides were very barebones, not very organized",
                "I think the various themes were a strength because it showed how sociology is interconnected to all parts of life (gender, race, medicine, sports, etc)",
                "Strengths: Section was helpful for going over the readings.\r\nWeaknesses: 1) We did not have a textbook and the slides were very sparse, so if you missed content during lecture, which was likely to happen because he also lectured at a fast-pace, there wasn't a way to go back and learn it. 2) The content that was expected for essays was not clear. We got broad prompts, and then we're docked points for not answering the prompt the way the TF would have answered the prompts. I checked my essays with the TF prior to turning them in, and this was still an issue. The prompts should be less broad if they want you to answer in a particular way.",
                "Strengths: easy to follow along with the material, the readings were interesting, the workload is light, the lectures are entertaining.",
                "Strengths - the study guides and reading guides made it very clear what exactly we were supposed to be taking away from the course. Weaknesses - it was hard to be really engaged because we were jumping from topic to topic but I suppose thats also in the nature of a broad into survey course.",
                "Strengths: Lectures are incredibly content-heavy and yet somehow still enjoyable - streamlined is probably the right word. Everything Prof. Smith says is worth taking a note on, and if you do, you can be confident you know whats going on. The topics in the syllabus feel balanced and well-structured, and lectures are cohesive. Cons: In exams, youre expected to be able to reproduce every point of what was said in the lecture exactly, sometimes seemingly down to the word. Sections were extremely painful, mostly because no students would volunteer to speak and the TF seemed to interpret the goal of the discussion section as just being to get the students to summarize the weekly readings. Very little discussion was ever actually had - and as a result, I think the class was a bit unsuccessful at conveying how students themselves could actually get involved in/do their own questioning of/debate sociological ideas. The presentations students were made to do in sections were more than a bit ridiculous because no guidelines were ever given and it was very clear no one cared about them.",
                "He's very self-aware. He said from the beginning that most of the lectures would be him talking at us. That being said, I think that he really tried to find moments where we could participate in the lecture which I really appreciated. Also, I think he gives good feedback, especially on the papers.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were interesting, section discussion was very enjoyable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Students responsible for way too much unstructured information for midterm and finals."

Professor Smith is quite charming, and I always felt thoroughly entertained during class. Lectures can occasionally feel a bit repetitive, but these lectures in review provided additional time to digest past information.",

                "Yes I would, but I would tell them to start their final essay very early",
                "Yes, I would: this is a great introductory course. Even though it is introductory, it felt like we went in depth on many different topics, which was pretty satisfying. The professor is enjoyable, which makes lectures more engaging.",
                "Yes",
                "No, I feel it was very very broad and covered too many topics, not going into depth in any of them. The course includes a lot of readings, many of which are outdated, that are only discussed in section at a surface level.",
                "Yes, everyone should take this or a different sociology course to better understand the world around them.",
                "Yes as the type of information one gains from it is very unique and perspective-changing.",
                "Yes! If you like humanities classes and understanding why things are they way they are, I would recommend this class",
                "Yes! The class was very interesting, but be aware that professor Smith tends to lecture fast, and that the posted slides have very little information on them.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because we were taught about a large array of societal factors like race, gender, education, and medicine. The professor was easy to follow along with and the course was not very demanding.",
                "not really, you have to make sure you have time to learn and memorize everything,",
                "I definitely would!",
                "As intro classes go, this was a pretty good one, and Id generally recommend it - though it may not be exciting so much as useful. Its a great introduction to why sociology is valuable, whether youre in the social sciences or in STEM (or in the humanities).",
                "Yes. I think it did what it was supposed to do in introducing topics and explaining how sociologists think. I do think that having the midterm paper and exam and the final paper and exam being so close to each other was harder in practice than I thought it would be looking at the syllabus. Also because the course tries to give an overview of so many different topics, we were never able to dive into any subject too deeply which I think would have made the course a little more enjoyable."
