            "comments": [
                "Professor Valeggia is an engaging lecturer, passionate scholar, and a great person, period. I did love the weekly discussion boards, but they allow for everyone to provide input on the material even if they are reluctant to share in class. In summary, the course itself is strong, the smaller assignments however can be tedious.",
                "The strengths of this course are that you can really learn at your own speed. The assignment deadlines are very flexible (with the exception of the final project deadline of course), which creates a much less stressful learning environment compared to other Yale courses. You can also tell that Prof. Valeggia, as well as her TA Sakura are very invested in their students' academic and personal development. Moreover, Prof. Valeggia has done extensive research with the Qom people in Argentina, and it is a pleasure to see her passion for the research that she has conducted with indigenous populations. You can tell that Prof. Valeggia has great expertise in her field, and yet she is humble and eager to learn from her students, as well. The course also encourages students to really explore their interests and use their talents to the fullest.\r\n\r\nA slight weakness of the course was that weekly assignments were too short (usually 350-400 words) to express any nuanced opinion. I do think that learning to concentrate information is important, but the short word limit encourages regurgitation of talking points and lack of reflection. This ties into another weakness of this course: other than the really cool perspectives on cultural practices and attitudes of the Qom people, the opinions presented are often reduced to typical US narratives of progressivism are presented as \"truth,\" while everything else should be \"unlearned.\" I am not against teaching typical US-American progressive ideas, but I do think that they should be accompanied with more diverse perspectives. I am also all for progress, but I believe that progress can look different for different people. Having a more \"conservative\" perspective-- or simply one that does not fit into any clear ideological framework in the US context-- was met with derision and hostility in class discussions (exclusively by peers though, the professor was very respectful of everyone!). I think the class could be improved by providing more diverse perspectives and by focusing slightly more on evolutionary biology, rather than 2020s US-focused ideological discussions. All in all, I had a great experience, though! I want to underline that I was still able to express my own opinions and that the professor herself was very respectful of everyone's perspective.",
                "I think the section at the beginning of the course about transgenderism was actually the least interesting / relevant part of the course. Theres so much to discuss and I dont think its worth the opportunity cost.",
                "Really strong class that covered interesting and nuanced topics. A great mix of scientific and anthropological content that appealed to students with a variety of interests. Manageable workload.",
                "Strengths: Claudia is an absolute joy of a professor. She encourages students to forget the grade and just try to learn But she does not just say that. It truly holds with everything she does. The \"leminar\" formatting of the class is perfect, so I never feel like I'm being just talked to or just made to figure things out on my own. The material is interesting and essential for everyone to learn.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "I appreciated how our classes were split into lectures and small group conversational seminars each week. That helped me both gain knowledge and understanding of that week's content, digest it, and be able to have a conversation about it later in the week. I believe this is the ideal classroom learning environment. I think towards the end of the semester we focused more on lectures, as there was more content to cover, and we lessened the number of small group conversations. If that can be avoided, I think that would improve and invite more student engagement during the second half of the semester.",
                "Strengths: the professor and TF are wonderful,  the lecture/seminar structure is valuable, and the course does a great job of making everyone reflect on the material and carry those reflections forward in their own lives. \r\nWeaknesses: the discussions often felt one-sided and the class could benefit from more intellectual diversity. The group activities sometimes felt forced and and seemed to unintentionally trivialize the topics at hand. The interactive style of the class isnt always an effective method of learning.",

I would not recommend this course if you are only interested in female physiology, as the class quite heavily focuses on culture and societal issues.",

                "I recommend this course to everyone with every fiber of my being. This class was more than a much needed revisit to what I had learned in Sex Ed class in high school. We challenged long-held beliefs at a high conceptual level, were encouraged to be curious and ask questions, and had a very fun time learning. I felt extremely supported as a learner, and felt that the classroom was a safe place to learn so many things that everyone should know.",
                "YES! BEST CLASS EVER if you're a woman or ever plan to live with, be friends with, or commune with a woman. I have a deeper appreciation and understanding of my health and my habits.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone. Every person needs an accurate and true understanding of female reproductive biology, which this class offers. During this class, so many societally-constructed myths were broken down in my mind and I feel a deeper appreciation for the sanctity of life and the female body.",
                "Yes, its a good science credit. The material is very interesting and the professor and TF are great.",
                "YES if you can get into this class, take it. I loved not only the curriculum, but my classmates and the learning community we created. Professor Valeggia and TA Sakura are both AMAZING!"
