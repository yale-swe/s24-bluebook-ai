                "The course was taught very by the book. This was both a strength and a weakness as it was easy to follow the course/lectures but more real world applications and examples would be helpful.",
                "I think this class wasn't very engaging, and the lectures didn't help learn the material. The time we spent going over practice questions in class was good, but it might be nicer to spend more time going over different types of problems, because it seemed like we spent a lot of time going over concepts and not too much time applying them. Moreover, it would be nice to discuss more the applications of the various concepts we learned to the real world.",
                "good course, could make lectures slightly more interesting but was good overall",
                "This course is well formatted and taught. I do wish, however, that weekly readings of the text book were more directly assigned and I would have also benefited from weekly grade scope worksheets like in other courses.",
                "Strengths - tas and the textbook and a really kind professor",
                "Professor was very nice and generous in terms of grading. \r\n\r\nProfessor needs more experience teaching -- many students and I believe it was difficult to follow lectures at times. We had to rely on the textbook to learn the material, not lectures.",
                "Strength was definitely the stirling engine project, other bonus assignments, and extra credit opportunities on exams. I believe I would have gained more knowledge in class if we did more examples and didnt just basically write down equations from the textbook.",
                "I believe that the extra credit for this course was engaging, as we were tasked with building an engine and seeing the theory we learnt in class being applied. However, the actual in class material moved to quickly and seemed to be rushed, without giving sufficient explanation.",
                "The power plant tour was the highlight of the class and was very interesting to see how what we learned in class is actually enacted in the real world and specifically Yale. The extra credit assignments outside of class also facilitated learning about other aspects of thermodynamics that relate to class. The organization of the course was a weakness as it seemed random at times what topics were discussed in class which made it hard to stay engaged with the content.",
                "No weaknesses stand out, the course was taught in a clear and straightforward way. We were provided with lots of examples and opportunities for help. The extra credit on exams and other options to boost our grades through making a Stirling engine was very considerate and allowed me to learn more.",
                "I loved the field trips and practical projects it kept the conceptual class much more grounded than it otherwise would be.",
                "This course covers many different areas of thermodynamics and teaches many tools to calculate various thermodynamic quantities. Additionally it gives students insight into how thermodynamics is used in engineering. A weakness of the course was the minimal hands-on experiences. There was an extra credit opportunity to build an engine and I wish that there were more projects like that in the class."

                "Most people taking this course are likely taking it as a requirement for an engineering major. While I think it could be interesting for others to learn, it likely makes the most sense for those who are already doing the associated majors.",
                "Yes it is interesting and even though exams can be difficult, ample extra credit (15%) is available throughout the term and there is a grading curve where 92% is an A",
                "This class was taught relatively well, especially in the context of many other more poorly taught engineering classes. I did walk away from it with a much better understanding of various cycles and thermodynamic concepts. I wish that we spent more time learning how they are applied practically. We had a tour of the power plant on the last week of class, and while I recognized a lot of the general ideas, it seemed like there was a lot more practical applications we could have discussed in class but didn't because we just focused on the theory.",
                "yeah it was very cool and full of useful information",
                "Yes, certainly for engineering majors and those curious about engineering.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, even though the class was poorly taught, I feel like I got a basic understanding of thermodynamics by the end of the semester.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn thermo. Cool concept",
                "If you want to learn the basics of thermodynamics this could be an interesting class, but mainly it is just a requirement for meche majors and is not extraordinary in any way for a non-meche major to take the class.",
                "I found that this course was far too focused on the mechanical applications of thermodynamics. I would have appreciated it if we spent more time talking about the theoretical basis for concepts and equations and then learned about applications with a greater understanding. There was not much math in the course, except for the tedious task of computing sums of material property values. The course took the textbook's approach, so most problems required that you reference some sort of table. Rather than elaborating on the statistical basis upon which all of the introduced equations are derived, the textbook seems to provide equations without sufficient inspiration and asks you to understand their use-cases.",
                "Yes, I really loved the professor and felt her way of teaching was very effective. This course gave me the luxury to optimize my learning while not stressing over grades.",
                "Yes! The course provides a strong understanding of thermodynamics, with emphasis on power cycles and thermal efficiencies since it is designed for mechanical engineers. The class has a field trip to the Yale Power Plant at the end of the semester, which provides another perspective on thermodynamics after studying a more theoretical analysis during the lecture. Furthermore, professor Luo offered a bonus assignment to create a DIY Stirling Engine, which seems really appropriate for a thermodynamics class. From what I understand, professor Luo is not teaching this class in the 2023-24 academic year, but hopefully the other professors can also implement this project into their course.",
