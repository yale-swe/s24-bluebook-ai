However, perhaps having two assignments per paper, one being the first draft and the other the final draft, would be helpful for getting feedback on papers and editing them."

The simple term plague means several other things to me now after this semester than it did at the beginning of it. It will encourage students to think differently about such a vast and intersectional subject in literature."
