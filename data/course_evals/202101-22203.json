Discussion frequently devolves into tangential conversations about contemporary politics that have little to do with the reading. While tying century-old political theories into contemporary discussions is nice, I don't think it should trump the texts themselves.",

However, Professor Kreiner does a great job of drawing important connections to contemporary events. If anything, the significance of the readings themselves should justify the workload.",
