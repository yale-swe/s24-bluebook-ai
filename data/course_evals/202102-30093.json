                "Screenplay format, how to develop multi-dimensional characters, how to cover screenplays, how to read screenplays, how to write dramatic action, how to write an engaging plot, how to critique screenplays, how to look for plot development, how to write cinematic dialogue, how to write cleanly and concisely.",

(I might wanna try producing at some point, because what Fred said was quite convincing)",

                "Some of the strengths include the opportunities for participation, opportunities to work with other students, talking to guest speakers, and the professor. \r\n\r\nSome of the weaknesses include very long lecture periods. There were several classes where I felt like the class was dragging on. We each had to go over our first pages and then our entire scripts in front of the class, and they were a little hard to get through.",
                "This course is great because it demands a lot from its students. Writing a screenplay is a challenging task and requires students to dig deep for a story that they want to tell and read a lot of screenplays. We were required to do script coverage and plot point analysis which gave us a sense of cinematic timing, dialogue, plot development, and action. The group critiques were also a great way to get exposure to others' stories and style of writing which improves everyones' writing. There were also great speakers who came in to speak about what it takes to forge a career in the film industry. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that there was not much guidance on how to complete the midterm and students are thrown into the process of writing without much hand holding. This can be daunting and learning how to do script coverage without any instructions is difficult if a student doesn't have much confidence in their own writing abilities. The workload is also a lot and can get overwhelming. Another weakness is that Professor Lapadula's feedback can be too heavy handed at times.",
                "Strength: It is perfect for new beginners to start writing screenplays. The professor teaches all the basics that though seem simple but is actually a very important habit to form. \r\nWeakness: Maybe we can analyze some movies from this century?",
                "The strength of the course was in its interactive nature. We were watching stuff and commenting on it, as well as bringing in our own material. Professor Lapadula also provides comprehensive feedback on all of your work. He also brought in interesting speakers, including one of the producers of La La Land. It was a tad bit long and had a tendency to go overtime though.",
                "The strength was that while the course required a lot of work, by the end of the process I really learned a lot about screenwriting.",
                "No improvementsawesome course.",
                "Strengths: every class was challenging and engaging, so even when they went overtime I was happy to stay and listen/chat.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more instructions about what to discuss with our small groups? Mine only met twice.",
                "The strengths were the professors passion for the topic. He treats every student as though they plan to go into screenwriting as a profession, which is very useful for learning. I think the class could be improved by having more class discussions. Because it was on zoom, it was harder to stay engaged for the length of time without constantly having discussions.",
                "The structure of the class itself felt somewhat disorganized at times and I think it could be really helpful to have smaller deadlines throughout the course rather than the complete midterm folder at once.\r\n\r\nSome strengths of the course include film analysis as a class (ex: Rebel without a Cause), the assignments of the midterm folder (helpful for constructing the final screenplay), and the collaborative atmosphere of the class (in-class critiques and group meetings outside of class). The guest lecture with Fred Berger was also really interesting."

I decided to take the course because Im interested in the film industry (specifically the on-camera aspect of it), and I figured this would be a great opportunity to learn about the behind-the-camera aspect. It was really interesting, and I would definitely recommend it to someone who is interested in the film industry or even the theater industry.",

Professor Lapadula brings in a lot of great speakers who talk openly and honestly about what it takes to make it as a writer. His end goal is to produce professional screenwriters.",
                "Absolutely. The thing is, none of my friends really like screenplay the way I do, for them, its simply a hobby so I dont think they are willing to come to this class. If I encounter someone  someday who is interested in movies and screenplays like I do, I would definitely recommend this class to them.",

                "I would only recommend the course to another student if they are genuinely interested in learning how to write a screenplay. It is an introduction to screenwriting, so if the student is already knowledgeable/familiar with it, they may not get as much from it as the rest of the class who is learning it for the first time."
