                "I think the homework load could be cut by about 15-20% while still covering the same amount of material. It was often difficult to internalize all the concepts I was learning because I was so preoccupied just with keeping up with the assignments that I could not spend a great deal of time letting the material sink in. I think the course could also benefit from having a more centralized manner of presenting the vocabulary and grammatical concepts; the workbook is a good step but is a bit disorganized, and while the French in Action curriculum is designed to teach French using an immersion, learn-as-you-hear-it approach, the textbook and workbook don't do an effective job at putting all the vocab and summary of grammar concepts in one clear place and instead you have to repeatedly dig through the books to find what you are looking for."
