                "Pieter is an extremely smart, well versed astrophysicist. He is obviously very knowledgable about the forefront of the current state of astrophysics research, mainly because half of the material talked about his own papers. It was a course that gave me a broad understanding of various subfields in astrophysics, and because a lot of the research is so recent, a lot of questions naturally popped out from the material. The material of the course was interesting, relevant, and engaging. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think that often the course notes were hard to read, and a lot of the class had to be fueled by my own personal research through astrophysics papers. The timeline of problem sets was unevenly distributed, with three of the four psets assigned and due in the last month of the course. And because this course is also an intro grad school course, the undergraduate grading scheme is not strictly defined, making it hard to determine how well I was doing in class.",

I wish that there were more opportunities to have office hours, as I had a class during the office hours sessions, and could never make the section."

This class is taught by an amazing, well known astrophysics professor, but there was sparse feedback for the problem sets as well as how I was doing (as an undergraduate) in the course. It is a tough class, but worth it for interested astrophysics students.",
