The textbook is very thorough, but the coursework is accessible to students of any linguistic background (I had none). Some translation exercises\/study of the actual languages might have been useful.  The course format could be a bit repetitive at times, but the textual examples that we explored in a few meetings were engaging and helped bring the topics to life.",

A lot of the morphological and grammatical stuff went right over my head, but that was okay. I took the pieces that interested me the most and ran, and that was okay. I think that spending a few classes on explaining basic linguistic terms would be nice, but we didn't do that because there were so many grad students in the class."
