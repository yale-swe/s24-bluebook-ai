   "comments": [
    "Wide exposure to classical literature of the western canon. Practice in close readings and analysis. Good practice writing essays.",
    "I learned how to really read.  How to read the minutia. How to discern irony and innuendo. I also learned that I have a lot of work to do on my writing.\r\nI also learned what treasure literature is.  Professor Quint is amazing.",
    "My writing has improved and I have become a more concise and careful writer. I also learned how to connect ideas from different texts and see how authors parallel each other throughout time.",
    "I learned a lot about how complex literature truly is and the intricacies that each author inserts in their texts. I developed a more critical approach to literature, digging way beyond surface-level implications of the books we read.",
    "I learned the first half of the western cannon in literature. I learned how to closely read and I learned a lot about writing and proper grammar.",
    "I learned to love the Western literary tradition and write more clearly.",
    "I developed better critical analysis skills, especially with close reading small passages of text.",
    "Close reading. An appreciation of the intricacy of literary constructions. How to write concisely and effectively.",
    "Taking DRST 001 allowed me to elevate both my analytical and writing skills. Prior to my experiences in this course, my ability to connect with, understand, and pull hidden significant details from texts was more limited than I had realized. After working with Professor Quint and my classmates, I feel that I have a better understanding of how to approach, respect, and investigate a work of literature. I have learned to think my arguments through to the best of my ability and to never settle for half-crafted analyses. Finally, I gained valuable insights into Greek, Roman, and Italian culture, and I now am able to see how each text informs another.",
    "I received a fantastic introduction to classical and medieval literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I feel like we could have a \"Directed Studies textbook\" with the required works and specific sections in it.",
    "We learn a tremendous amount in the class and by writing papers. Sometimes the info-dumps are overwhelming, though, since it can be difficult to tie together long tangents on tiny moments in the text and apply them to the works overall theme.",
    "Strengths: Professor Quint is the very top of his field. Like, he's the world's top scholar of Virgil. He's read the Aeneid over 40 times and he knows the Latin and Greek for a lot of the books we read. This means he is an excellent teacher and really delves deeply into the text. The class is discussion based but Professor Quint steers it well towards where he wants the conversation to go.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Quint is not an easy grader but he always made himself available for office hours and wrote extensive feedback. By the end I knew how to write a good paper for his class. I guess this is more of a strength than a weakness!",
    "The readings and lectures were great, I felt that the lectures did a really good job at providing context and highlighting the important parts of the week's reading.",
    "This course is strong in its presentation and comprehensive analysis of the texts that we read. By progressing through our texts in chronological order, we were able to understand how each work of literature drew from its predecessors, and I feel that I can now see a larger narrative emerging across various works. Additionally, the combination of lectures and seminars surrounding each text allows students to address both fundamental and complex facets of the material, and I feel that it provided me with a comprehensive understanding. This course would improve greatly by placing a larger focus upon the Divine Comedy. Ideally, students would be able to read the Comedy in its entirety, and I do not think that we spent enough time discussing both Purgatorio and Paradiso.",
    "I don't see how the volume of reading could be reduced without changing the nature of the course, but the sheer number of pages per night could be overwhelming at times."

    "DS is extremely dependent on the professor and on the students' personal leanings. If you don't enjoy ancient lit in particular or don't like having a decently heaving reading load with very scant covering in class (my favorite work was only talked about in one seminar meeting-- this happens), then it isn't for you. The essay load and the reading load are completely manageable as long as you budget your time well. The grading is not extremely difficult. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the particular texts we read and is looking for a wide breadth or texts and excellent depth on some very particulars of each text.",
    "yes.  this is an amazing opportunity to read and discuss some of the greatest writings in history.",
    "Yes, the books that are discussed in this class are extremely interesting and thought-provoking. A very good introduction if you are considering a classics or humanities major.",
    "I would recommend this course because the ideas it provokes are very insightful and intriguing. Analyzing the texts on your own can be difficult, but it is rewarding when you discover something new or obscure.",
    "This is an amazing class -- I recommend DS students try to switch into Professor Quint. I learned how to write and read closely.",
    "Prof. Quint's love for literature inspired me in every section.",
    "I would recommend this course. It provides a great introduction to early Western works of literature.",
    "Yes. I thought this course was phenomenal. The professor is inspirational - in terms of his erudition, his ability to tease out meanings from a text, his committment to his students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Exposure to the great works of literature is valuable for any student, and the comparative nature of the course develops ones ability to pay attention to detail on both a wide and narrow scope.",
    "I love David Quint. So yes."
