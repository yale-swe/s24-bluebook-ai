In addition, I learned a lot about the canon of English poetry, its key characteristics, and developments from Alexander Pope, Wordsworth, Robert Browning, T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, Elizabeth Bishop, Rita Dove, and Robin Coste Lewis, and others.",
                "Great class to learn to read poetry.",
                "This course provided an illuminating survey of English and American poetry over several centuries. I gained an understanding of the ways these poets responded to one another and to broader developments in the genre, the literary milieu, and the world. Through rigorous engagement with a high volume of poems written in different styles, I learned how to quickly determine a poems basic premise, and how to slowly work through its subtler parts.",
                "I gained a much greater appreciation for a variety of poetry styles. I had never taken a poetry course before so listening to the insights and interpretations of the poems from classmates and professor Figlerowicz each class was so interesting and informative. It was really fun to experience each poem going from a bit of a puzzle to a really clear and meaningful picture as we discussed sections of the assigned readings in class. I also really improved my skills in close reading, and my ability to discuss and write about poetry.",

The rest of what was good about the course really came from Dr. Figlerowiczs instruction. I think this course could work harder in diversifying its syllabus, not only based on poets identities  but based on the content and style of the poems it teaches.",

                "Take 126 with Dr. Figlerowicz!! I was not excited about taking this course and only did so because it is required for the major, but Dr. Figlerowicz facilitated rich, challenging classroom discussions which elevated the course from a chore to a true joy.",
                "If you're interested / need to take ENGL 126, I would absolutely recommend taking it with Professor Figlerowicz. They are genuinely one of the coolest and kindest people on campus that you'll ever meet and will always treat you first as a person and then a student, which I think is a rarity on campus. What's more is that they're so incredibly gifted at teaching and so knowledgable about both poetry, but it just general. I cannot tell you the amount of times the class would veer off into other topics such as film, music, and art histories and cultures. So in a word: absolutely. Absolutely take ENGL 126 with Professor Figlerowicz. Also the readings are wonderful.",
                "Yes absolutely. This course reminded me why I wanted to go to a liberal arts college. The discussions and teaching in this class were both so valuable and interesting and I feel like I can enjoy poetry in a new way thanks to this class.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in poetry at all or simply filling an English requirement Professor Figlerowicz is absolutely amazing! They give really great insights into the poems and manage to make all of the course materials interesting.",
