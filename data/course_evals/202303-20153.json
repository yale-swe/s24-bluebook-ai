                "I developed grammar skills, speaking and pronunciation skills, and knowledge about different French books and movies.",
                "This course challenged me to develop highly accurate grammar and a vast vocabulary relevant to difficult conversations.",
                "Much like a continuation of FREN 120, with a particular emphasis on relearning integral grammatical rules and tenses like pass compos, imparfait, forming des phrases conditionnel. Read three short novels--Le petit Nicolas, L'tranger, and Monsieur Ibrahim et des fleurs du Coran--and watched two films: L'argent Poche and Jules et Jim.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course is how organized and efficient it is in teaching French. There are great class activities and really great books/films to learn the language and culture. Some weaknesses is that the course is very fast paced, meaning that we often had to go through topics very quickly which made it difficult to truly learn whatever we were learning.",
                "I think the frequency of exams allows for students to learn and retain material. I think there could be more of an emphasis on speaking / conversation. Though the course is taught entirely in french I still feel that I am not the most comfortable speaking extemporaneously in the language.",
                "I think the strengths are having a very organized workbook and schedule that we could follow along with. I also enjoyed some of the books/movies. The weakness is there is a lot of homework every day so it starts to feel less meaningful and like I just need to complete a certain number of hours of homework and not pay much attention to the actual content. I also thought the online format for the tests was hard especially the first few when I didn't know what to expect so I wish we got some more instruction about how to do that.",
                "The course excels at placing you in a rigorous series of exercises that is incredibly rewarding. At times, some of the activities in the course packet felt like they did not relate to the class, but this was never a frequent occurrence.",
                "I feel like that this course was much more of a literature seminar, focused on understanding the material that we were reading in class together. My section didn't feel particularly engaging in terms of sociability, although I do feel as though the choice of literature was decently compiled.",
                "There was a lot of work each day, and I think all of us had a hard time completing it despite our best efforts. I always felt prepared for the tests, which was nice, but I think some of the work was superfluous and just burnt out the students. I also think there could be a stronger emphasis on speaking. I'm much better at writing and listening, but only in an academic context. Casual conversation without the high pressure of oral productions on exams could help with that a lot."

                "Yes! This is a great French course to take. You will learn lots of vocabulary and grammar rules which will help you with reading and writing the French language. This class gives you the space to grow while also being challenged. I could not recommend it more.",
                "I would recommend it if they had already experience with French because it is hard to learn so many new things unless you have a good base understanding. I also would only recommend if they are passionate/enjoy French because it is a lot of work.",
                "If you want to improve your French and are determined to endure a hard-fought learning process, I highly recommend this course.",

                "Yes, but only if they want to advance in French for the purpose of taking L5 classes or studying abroad."
