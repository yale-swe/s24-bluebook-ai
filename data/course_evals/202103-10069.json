Starting from the colonial period and going to the present, with four classes on Covid-19, the content of the course was deeply interesting. Also, a number of guest speakers visited the class, whose expertise enriched discussions and the course as a whole even more.",
                "Knowledge of pandemics in Africa (and internationally, to be fair), critical thinking skills and insights about how disease shapes and is shaped by political economy and other factors. Knowledge of specific epidemics (flu, Ebola, HIV\/AIDS, COVID) but also broader themes in colonial medicine such as the interactions between missionary medicine and colonial medicine and traditional medicine.",

                "The readings are interesting and felt quite manageable, as were the writing requirements. The content of readings was always interesting, and discussions were well run.",
                "Strengths: Great readings and reading structure, great discussions and guest lectures. Great overview of the content and a really manageable yet productive workload. It was also truly a blessing when we moved towards having guest speakers towards the end of the course because as work for other courses was ramping up work for this course was becoming a little bit lighter. Weaknesses: Sometimes the discussion did lose pace.",
                "Really enjoyed the discussion based class. Im the future, I think the class could benefit from breaking into smaller groups and talking to mix up the structure of the class.",
                "The strengths of this class consisted of the chosen readings, guest speakers, and curriculum. Professor Steinberg created an engaging curriculum by varying the types of readings and inviting notable and knowledgeable guest speakers. The only format of the class that I would recommend changing is providing a few guided questions for the readings. The students were very involved in the discussions, but the open-ended format made it difficult for discussion to begin.",
                "The readings for this course were very thoughtfully chosen and I really enjoyed the discussions in class as well as the insights from Professor Steinberg. I do think the course could have slightly more structure in terms of how discussions are led. I think it would be helpful to pair \"questions to think about\" with each set of reading so that students have a chance to think through answers before arriving to class. Although the questions brought up in class were all very interesting, it was difficult for discussion to flow as people required more time to think of responses.",
                "The strengths are definitely the interesting readings and the great professor!",
                "Overall, this course was extremely enjoyable. I liked how accessible Professor Steinberg is, in terms of office hours and email. Open discussions could be extremely eye-opening as well, however, sometimes I wished the course had more structure to it (for example, we didn't have guided discussions that often). I really liked having guest speakers in class, as well.",
                "Strengths: fascinating presentation of subject matter, a strong selection of weekly texts providing topical exposure as well as perspectives in the field, Professor Steinbergs extensive and in-depth knowledge of the course material and continual encouragement of students to ask further questions\/make connections\/consider new viewpoints, the guest speakers (so engaging and what a neat range of backgrounds!), and the discussion posts  discussions in class made the meaningful exchange of knowledge (academic\/age\/personal background diversity of students in the course contributed to this) Improvements: more 1:1 engagements with Professor Steinberg, and encouraged collaboration amongst peers built into the class -- all my classmates were so knowledgeable, I wish there were more opportunities to engage in smaller sections (ie smaller discussion groups that convened to the larger seminar as a class day progressed, or exchanging essay ideas and collaborating on the writing process)"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I learned so much about topics that are not only fascinating but also very relevant to the present. Professor Steinberg is a wonderful instructor, who gave helpful feedback and facilitated great discussions in class. Plus, the workload was very manageable. Also, having guest speakers was a really neat opportunity to engage with experts from different relevant fields.",
                "Yes! This is such a great course not only given our current context, but also just as one of those general courses that could be added to one of five majors, but by being connected to all of them really lets you get outside of your comfort zone and explore different things. I feel like it's a very important perspective to have in our modern world, and is also one of those courses that can genuinely make you sound and be so much smarter in everyday life. Overall, a great multidisciplinary perspective on challenges of today with a broad historical lens as well that I would highly recommend either to someone interested in any of these fields or just as a great Social Science credit.",

                "Absolutely. This class provided a comprehensive approach to understanding the historical and political impacts of global pandemics. The discussion format of the course allowed the students to share their varying experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their opinions concerning the different responses from around the world.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course if you are interested in thinking about a multi-disciplinary approach to global health and pandemics. The professor is very approachable and well-spoken and was passionate about his students' learning.",
                "Yes, if they are at all interested in public health and disease they need to take this course.",
                "Yes, I would certainly recommend it. This was my favorite class from the semester.",
                "Absolutely. Interdisciplinary approach to area studies that expose students to the depth of the topic matter (not just about healthcare. Theres a deep social and economic bent to the discussion, as well as (geo)politics, historical, etc), combined with the engaged class environment and knowledgeable professor, students are bound to take much away from this course and apply it to personal interests (even if its only to become better-informed about our surroundings)."
