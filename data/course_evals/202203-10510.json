                "I developed a full toolset of literary analysis techniques, borrowing from the styles of authors I encountered throughout the course, ranging from Aristotle and his poetics, all the way through Bakhtin's analysis of literature through the \"chronotope\" (an equivalent of spacetime). I tightened my writing and my literary style, and learned to piece apart texts more thoroughly than I have ever done previously. Overall, this course taught me how to perform like a scholar of literature",
                "I gained an entirely new perspective on what \"comparative literature\" is, as we took a tour through the different theoretical frameworks that have guided the discipline and also applied them in unique and creative ways to the texts. In particular, the assignments in which we had to reading for narrative instead of close-reading developed a new skill for me I appreciated the way in which the course made us look at texts both on the extremely micro and the macro level.",

                "Strength - the readings were really interesting.\r\nWeakness - the class conversations were pretty quiet. I think the professor could have done a better job at making people feel comfortable speaking. The structure of the class also was trying to do too much. I think we should have done half as many theory readings, and just gotten a deeper understanding of fewer. As it is, I'm not sure if I understand any of them, because we just did too many too quickly.",
                "Strengths: The literature texts were really well formulated to go with the theory texts. I liked the format of theory first, literature second. I also think Sam knows how to run class discussions very effectively and always asked questions that seemed to probe the best contributions out of all of us.\r\nWeaknesses: At some points, I was very confused diving directly into high-level texts on literary theory when I didnt even know what literary theory was a few weeks prior. The essay topics were very convoluted, and I needed to go to office hours several times to even understand what was being asked of me. I hesitate to even call those weaknesses, because I was eventually able to understand what was going on and grew from it immensely, even if the initial plunge was jarring. On a very minor note with an easy fix, in the second-ish half of course, it was unclear which texts were meant to be read for Tuesday and which ones were meant to be read for Thursday, which often led to scrambling to get everything done before Tuesday.",
                "I think the class provides a strong introduction to how to read and engage with works of literary theory. However, I think the class could have put more focus on how to write about literary theory.",
                "It was really fun! I would have preferred more assignments, so I had a sense of how I was doing.",
                "Very interesting material and Hodgkin is extremely knowledgeable and passionate! The course is sometimes a bit fast-paced though and I wish we would slow down a bit more. Essay rubrics are also hard to understand and I sometimes didnt really know what was expected of me.",
                "This course was an amazing sample of all the world's literature and the different ways people analyze literary works. Films, poems, books, video games... the list goes on. I never thought that I would ever encounter a spread of literature like that in my life (and frankly, I did not realize that such a spread even existed). Thus, for the literature alone, this class is excellent.\r\nIt is also excellent because it drives students to perform at a very very high level. Every analysis we did as a class cut to the very core of the works, while also reaching across large expanses of space and time, which is not an easy task. We were driven to think creatively and critically about everything: the texts, the literary theory about the texts, the theory behind the theory of the texts, etc. This is a very intense course.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by providing more guidance in what is expected in the essays for the class. Although we received instructions which set out the details of the essays, some of the nuances expected of the students, and what to avoid, the course could have better covered the stylistic aspects of literary analysis: I.e. how to write. Having a clearer idea about the expectations regarding style, the level of depth and engagement with each topic explored, and the unstated \"code\" of literary analysis could help students hone their skills further and faster. In my experience, I did manage to learn all this through example: by simply writing and then aiming to address the professor's comments, I improved. However, it would be helpful to have a bit more guidance at the beginning so that the students have a running start in this regard.\r\n\r\nOVERALL: Excellent class. I really really enjoyed this, and I believe it was one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale.",
                "A strength of this course is the care taken to incorporate texts from outside Europe and North America, with many texts originally written in Arabic and Persian, among others. Its attempt to ground the field of comparative literature in theory is also helpful and interesting. One area of the course that frustrated me, however, is how it all seemed too structured, from essay assignments where the content of specific paragraphs and sentences was planned for us, to heavily structured seminars, with \"breakout rooms.\" Although I understood the attempt to direct us towards specific exercises and conclusions, the effect was that it often stifled discussion and made conversations, and essays, feel stunted. This was a shame, since a lot of the work we were looking into was really interesting and meaty, but (as is often the case with survey courses, admittedly) we didn't really get to dig into them.",
                "I very much appreciated the diversity of literature texts that Prof. Hodgkin provided to us--books, movies, articles, stories, magazines from various geographic, historical, political regions of literature history."

This was an amazing experience for me and I think that everyone should at least try it. I recommend doing the preparation so that you can focus your mind in the direction of literary analysis of the caliber that is expected.\r\n\r\nYale talks about \"exploring classes\" but most people simply don't. Rather, they try a few things, find something they are good at, and then stick with it in fear of getting a bad grade in a class they are \"not good at\". This is silly, since the point of going to a place like Yale is to explore and try new things outside your main interests. This class is really intense and challenging, but it is worth it. My intellectual horizons have been broadened by this course.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this to anyone pursuing the comparative literature major. Even as a required course, it was truly fascinating and useful, and I feel like it lay a groundwork for all of my further work in the department.",
                "Yes!! Okay, it's not an easy class. But it really helped me grow as a student of literature. We grappled with a century-worth of literary theory, the stuff that gives texts their direction, identity, structures, and relationships to time and space and the world."
