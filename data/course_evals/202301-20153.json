                "Concise writing and presentation of complex foreign policy issues. How to breakdown a problem/foreign policy strategy.",
                "I learned how high-level foreign policy decisions have been made in the US over the last 100 years. It was a great chance to understand how prominent US policymakers thought. I also feel like I learned a number of lessons about the conduct of US policy, though they mostly remain somewhat general (e.g., regime change is almost always a bad idea).",
                "This class teaches how diplomacy and foreign policy is done in the 20th and 21st centuries. There is no theory. It is an excellent course for demonstrating to students how diplomats actually operate in the real world.  I would argue this was the most valuable foreign policy class I have taken since I have been at Yale",
                "Huge amount of knowledge and insight into the workings of foreign policy, and Americas greatest failures and successes internationally",
                "I learned more on foreign policy and its real-life applications than I'd ever learned in another class at Yale. The topic of every week in the seminar was so carefully chosen by Ambassador Ford, and it showed, because of how essential these particular events were to shaping our understanding of foreign policy and negotiation. We learned how to analytically consider foreign policy approaches in a national interest to strategy to tactics framework, which again, was so new but made so much sense. I don't think I can look at foreign policy news the same way again without stopping to consider it the way we were taught. This class also served as a part-time writing workshop, where while not formally taught, Ambassador Ford would very meticulously analyze your writing style and analysis. I think I also learned a lot more in terms of college writing in this class than I had in an English class.",

                "Best course I have taken at Yale. Ambassador Ford was born to teach. You'll not only get a really good grasp of the major moments in American foreign policy during the last 100 years. You will also walk away with a new set of books to love, fantastic conversations, and great framework with which to analyze any foreign policy."

                "All strengths: Assignments, engaging instructor, Syllabus content",
                "Strengths: really interesting readings and Ambassador Ford has an excellent grasp of how US Foreign Policy works, grounded in personal experience\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more debate and discussion between students! Honestly, I'm not sure how to foster this, but I think it would have made the class even better.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nThe seminar was the highlight of my week. Ambassador Ford is a reservoir of knowledge for all things diplomatic. He is also an excellent resource for those interested in a career at the State Department.  We went into depth and really got to work on developing a framework to interpret the interests and motivations of the United States (and other countries) at various points in the last Century. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nIt is challenging to understand going in what kind of paper will achieve the best grade possible. I think more class time and syllabus space should be allocated for what makes a better paper. As the current syllabus stands, it is a little too open-ended and could use some more direction",
                "Strengths: absolutely great readings, Amb Ford has amazing insights from his career, and class is very focused  he makes an effort to guide it (which is great) while also allowing time for disagreement. Also a few great students really make the class. \r\nWeaknesses: maybe Amb Ford couldve asked more open ended questions, or tied into bigger picture more, but still did a great job with both of these",
                "This class was excellent. I have no weaknesses to report whatsoever. I think what this class did that was unlike most other seminars I've taken is stay true to its \"seminar\" nature. Every class felt like a stimulating discussion, that was so organic and inherently driven. We'd very often lose track of time. Frankly, I'd have to contribute this to Professor Ford himself.",
                "strengths are Ford! there are no real ways this can be improved.",
                "It is, in my opinion, perfect! The pace of readings and papers allows you to really think and learn without busywork, and the class discussions are the liveliest I have ever had."

                "If it is taught again, I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants a primer on US foreign policy. You will learn a lot! Just make sure that you have the time to read 200-300 pages of a book each week--the books are usually pretty engaging, so it's really not as bad as it sounds.",
                "If you have the chance to take a course with a U.S. ambassador you take it. Robert Ford is an excellent professor and created an engaging seminar. You will read roughly one book a week though so be ready for it to take up a pretty significant amount of time.",
                "Absolutely. One of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. As a stem major I thought this class was still very approachable and fascinating.",
                "YES! If taught in the same way, then this class is a gold-mine. Even if you aren't considering foreign service, if you are even remotely interested in history, this is probably the best seminar you can take at Yale. The readings are superb, enjoyable, and very captivating. The discussions in class are even better; while we have questions to guide our reading, we go wherever the discussion takes us in class and I think that freedom of conversation, especially in a class setting, is very lacking at Yale.",
                "yes! for sure.",
                "Yes! You get to read great books and talk about them with an enthusiastic practitioner, who will help you ask big and important questions about America's role in the world."
