                "This class was amazing! A wonderful combination of history and literature in an extremely relevant field. We studied the ideas of empire and nation over time in Russia and the Soviet Union, largely through literature, art, and film. This made the material much more digestible, but, more importantly, allowed us to understand the depth, breadth, and impact of the Russian imperial legacy. I thought the syllabus was amazing. TAKE THIS CLASS! Very very important given Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - will help you to understand why this is happening...",

            "comments": [
                "STRENGTHS:\r\n- Profs. Bojanowska and Roosien are both fantastic. Both are experts in \r\n- The format works quite well for what the course is going for. It's a lecture with discussion section, and the lectures had significant student interaction to add our own interpretations. However, I do feel like the lectures could've been longer. We'd often read an entire short novel and then only spend one lecture (and however much time in section) discussing it. 75 minute lectures may encourage deeper analysis of the material. \r\n- The variety of sources was refreshing. This isn't your standard history class focused solely on readings. Film screenings and art helped to diversify the material of the course and my favorite part was analyzing artwork. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES:\r\n- The structure of the course can be somewhat disorienting. It's structured in a way such that we focus on particular regions or groups of people at a time instead of chronological order like you may expect from a typical history course. More context would've been helpful from one week to the next. Additionally, it felt like we would revisit topics we already learned about. For example, we discussed the Soviet Union in the first or second week of lecture and then came back to it in the final few weeks of lecture. \r\n- Some of the readings were more interesting than others. I loved Tolstoy's Hadji Murat, but I slogged through other readings like Ulitskaya's Medea and Her Children. It seems like I wasn't alone in this, but Profs. Bojanowska and Roosien are committed to improving the course in the future and took a poll of what readings we most and least enjoyed, so I expect this to be addressed.",
                "The professors were very engaged in the class and cared about how it was structured and how students were responding to the material. They were great about responding to student concerns and questions! While I thought that overall the readings were put together very well, I felt like there were some texts that weren't as necessary or could have been left out.",
                "I loved its engagement with cultural materials in order to truly understand the society we were studying. It could benefit from a more chronological order, as I feel like I did not get an entire grasp of Russian History",
                "The readings were quite dense, otherwise it was well structured!",
                "The strengths were the teaching staff. All of the professors and TA's were great, offering wonderful insights into the topics discusses. I think that the course should improve the assignments and the and the graded material. The two essays were a good way to asses students, but the exams were unnecessarily stressful and difficult, it was hard to prepare, and even after reading every single require material, I still did not feel ready. It may be beneficial to scrap the exams and include a third essay.",
                "No weaknesses",
                "Strengths: Both professors are extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Syllabus is well thought out and engaging. Felt like we had just the right amount of reading - I almost always got it done for 2 classes a week (which I can't say about all my classes). \r\nWeaknesses: 2 papers, midterm, and final exam felt like a lot.",
                "I think that overall the course was very strong.It's well-organized and well-taught. I understand that the professors reduced the workload from a previous iteration of the class, but for me, it still felt like the reading load was more than I would expect from a lecture class. Other history lectures that I have been in often only assign one set of readings a week in preparation for section, or else assign a small amount of reading for each lecture, and so it did often feel like this course which had multiple dense/lengthy readings for each class ended up being twice as much work as I had expected it to be when I registered.",
                "The strength of the course is the diversity of texts and ideas. The weakness is Professor Roosien. Her lectures were banal and have never offered anything beyond what readings have already shown. Her choices of topics and readings tended to be quite idiosyncratic and secondary to key themes of Russian imperialism.",
                "Well organized lectures, great selection of readings, although I preferred the first half of the course to the second half",
                "Strengths: the course offered a wide range of cultural productions, many of which I never would have read. Weaknesses: some of the film screenings are unnecessary",
                "Strengths: Both professors are amazing, perfect amount of workload, really engaging material\r\nWeaknesses: maybe not always enough context, sometimes it is assumed we know more than we do",
                "The readings were engaging and highly integrated into lecture materials. Professors deftly adapted the lecture and seminar format to create a hybrid class environment. Additionally, in the current geopolitical context of war in Ukraine, this course serves as a prime example of responsible engagement with Russian literature; in my view, the current moment prompts us to reconsider the classics of the Russian literary canon through the lens of empire and colonialism. Too few courses in both the West and Russia accomplish this. This course is a rare and wonderful exception."

                "Yes, I'd recommend this course if you're even remotely interested in how and why Russia is the way it is today, particularly its actions in Ukraine. Ignore the workload from the previous time this class was taught as it was drastically revamped in order to be more manageable, which it did succeed at this semester. The final lecture of the course was focused on a speech that Putin wrote justifying the unification of Ukraine with Russia, and we were well-equipped to spot the inaccuracies in his speech and also see the effects he was trying to create. Even though this course was centered around Russia, I feel like I came out of it with a better understanding of imperialism as a whole. However, be wary that this course is often more literature than it is history.",

                "Yes I think that it is an enjoyable course and the content is interesting. However, I would definitely suggest the course with the caveat that you should go in expecting a fair amount of reading.",
                "Yes, the course is amazing if you want to learn about Russian imperialism through a cultural lens.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in Russian history and literature",
