I learned about G20 and policies related to energy at an international level. learned about energy markets and auctions and ESG investing.",

Additionally, I really disliked being in a room with no windows for class.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I really enjoyed the class and would like to thank Professor Oristaglio for such an amazing semester!",
                "Strengths: The diversity in assignments; live auction, electricity market bidding, final presentation, mid-term paper, and footprint and lifecycle assesment. Instructor was not only professional, but extremely knowledgeable on subject. Welcoming of all opinions on the topic creating friendly, academic atmosphere. \r\nWeaknesses: Classroom can be at better location with more eye-friendly lighting (not criticism of class itself).",
                "Teaching format could be improved - it is pretty heavy on the listening and less discussion based",
                "You get out what you put in",
                "Strength: I (and everyone else in the class) really enjoyed the energy market simulation!\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish more of the classes had hands-on components like the simulation and discussions. As the course was taught, a lot of it was lecture and felt repetitive from previous Energy Study courses. As this is a higher-level course, most students in the class were upperclassman and had already taken similar courses in the program."

I love the energy studies program as it provides participants with a comprehensive view of world energy while also providing flexibility in the classes you must take in the program.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to students learning about the challenges in rising demand for energy and need to balance environmental concerns with society's needs. I learned a lot of scientific and policy-related knowledge on world energy and questions confronting clean energy transitions.",
                "Yes, especially if they're doing Energy Studies!",
                "If youre in Energy Studies, this is a great smaller seminar to break away from all the lectures youre used to taking.",
                "Yes! It's a very relaxed environment to facilitate engaging discussions about world energy, and we cover many interesting concepts. Each week has a small selection of readings that is completely manageable, and the only sizable assignments are a short midterm paper and final presentation. Very discussion and learning focused in a pretty stress-free environment."
