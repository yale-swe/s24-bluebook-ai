The course was very engaging because the professor allowed the students in the seminar to interact with each other (even for the virtual Zoom seminars). By looking at multiple media of history-telling such as historical writing, painting, documentaries, audio recordings and primary sources, I learned to view history from multiple lenses. The questions asked in this course were important in shaping my deeper understanding history now.",

I learned to view historyin monuments, memorials, books, essays, movies, shows, artwith a greater sense of respect and sensitivity, and most importantly, to think about what learning about the past could teach us today. In addition to becoming of better and keener observer of history, I learned how to write effectivelyto capture audience with tension in the beginning of a piece, to use my personal experiences and knowledge as a vehicle to go deeper into a theme, the importance of well-chosen evidence, and much more.",
                "I think about history differently--before, I thought history was all about dry facts, etc., but this course really tried to emphasize personal engagement with history. I know think much more carefully about words\/punctuation I use in my writing."
