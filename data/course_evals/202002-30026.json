   "comments": [
    "I learned about the structure and reactivity of many organic compounds found in the world.",
    "I genuinely enjoyed the content learned in this course. While it does require a lot of memorization, the course really tests your critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Among many other things, I think one of the most interesting things I've learned from this course is that given a certain set of conditions, we are able to predict the mechanism and the product of a reaction.",
    "Introduction to organic chemistry, covering SN1, SN2, E1, and E2 reaction mechanisms, reactions with alcohols and alkyl halides, stereochemistry, and the like.",
    "Throughout this course, I acquired a deep understanding of organic chemistry as well as ways to study\/obtain the material.",
    "I learned how to name organic compounds. I learned reaction mechanisms on how organic alcohols, alkenes, and other types of molecules are formed. I learned why certain organic reactions happen the way that they do and, as a result, how to predict what the products will be when given specific reactants, reagents, and solvents.",
    "I was able to really dive into organic chemistry and learn many problem solving strategies.",
    "I learned a lot about different reactions and the products of such reactions.",
    "I learned so much about organic chemistry in this course, and it really is taught in a way that makes sense and is relatively easy to follow.",
    "The biggest takeaway for me was learning enough vocabulary to be able to look up answers to organic chemistry topics on the Internet.",
    "I developed an understanding of Organic Chemistry concepts including information on Alkanes, Alkenes. Specifically, I can predict the outcomes of various reactions related to these compounds and the mechanics associated with them.",
    "Mostly the foundations of organic chemistry  bonding, structures, mechanisms of fundamental compounds such as alkanes, alkenes, acids\/bases, etc. End of the course started to build on these foundations to introduce more complex reactions.",
    "Understanding various chemical reactions, drawing chair structures, basic nomenclature, basics of organic chemistry",
    "This was your basic first semester of orgo. It was online, but the teachers did a great job, and I felt like I really learned the material."

   "question_id": "SU103",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength is the ability to cover such a wide array of molecules in a notoriously difficult subject in just 5 weeks. The weakness is that many lecture summaries are literature rather than concise typed out reactions, which are the principle concern in the class. But that does also allow students to create their own summaries.",
    "I think this course had a lot of strengths. First of all, Professor DiMeglio and Professor Martinez were very accomodating given the current public health situation. I appreciated the lectures being pre-recorded so that we can take notes and learn new material at our own pace. Also, the recorded lectures allowed us to go back and rewatch areas we were struggling with. I also liked the idea of DPPs. It forced us to stay on pace with the course content and reinforce the material discussed in that day's lecture. Since the summer session goes through this curriculum a lot faster then an on-campus course does, it's as important to not fall behind on lectures. Lastly, the numerous problem-solving resources that were available to us were super helpful in solidifying ideas and applying what we learned in lecture to actual problems. \r\n\r\nMaybe one area of improvement could be how the exams were administered. The multiple-choice were worth a lot of points and it didn't give us an opportunity for partial credit to show our work. I guess this is normally how multiple-choice tests run but with organic chemistry, I feel like showing our work is important.",
    "For the most part lectures were pretty clear and straightforward. There seemed like there could have been a better supply of practice problems, because it felt like most of the ones provided were for much simpler cases than the tests covered.",
    "The strengths of the course were that because it was taught online, I was able to take my time going through the lectures, pausing when needed, so that I was able to get the most out of every lesson. Along with this, Dr. DiMeglio and Dr. Martinez were very available to meet with me as well as answer questions over email, making it even easier to grasp the material. \r\nA weakness of the course is because the tests are online, I found myself short on time towards the end with having to upload material as well as type out answers throughout.",
    "Strengths: The professors were extremely well-versed in relaying the content in a way that students would understand(especially this being the first time a lot of us were exposed to orgo lingo). The availability of Office Hours and the ease of emailing the profs whenever you had a question was top notch as well. The only weakness was the speed at which the class moved, but that was more so because of the nature of taking summer classes.",
    "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio uploaded all the lectures by the start of the course, as well as all the assigned problems and reviews. This was immensely helpful as it allowed me flexibility (e.g. if I was going to be really busy one day, I could learn the course content beforehand). Dr. DiMeglio also responded quickly by email with thorough explanations for any questions I had.\r\nWeaknesses: I did not always find the problem solving sessions to be helpful, as sometimes we lagged behind the course content. I also wish we covered more difficult problems during these sessions. I also think that we could have spent less time on the material for exam 1 and more time on the material on exam 3, as there were many reactions covered in the last week of classes.",
    "Strengths: Dr. DiMeglio and Dr. Martinez and their organization and personalities. Dr. DiMeglio is a great lecturer and is very organized which makes it so much easier to learn. She is very clear and has great slides and made this class a much better experience than expected. She tells you what you need to know and explains things well, and makes sure you know what you need to do to succeed. She is also so understanding and helpful and makes you be more comfortable talking to her and asking questions. \r\nWeaknesses: not many, sometimes the sections were slow and the questions we went over were way easier than what we would see on the tests, so maybe going over some more complex things would be better. \r\nRecording everything and prerecording the lectures was also a great way to plan out the course.",
    "The course was pretty quick, but that was to be expected. I feel that the teachers did the best they could given the circumstances.",
    "I enjoyed that exams were open note because it encouraged us to learn skill instead of memorizing chemicals. However, college education is incompatible with Zoom. The course could not successfully adapt to the remote environment. The cost of the solutions manual was also a significant barrier preventing me, an FGLI student, from accessing the course at the same level as my wealthy peers.",
    "It was difficult",
    "I wish the answer keys to the textbook problems were provided to the students. We were given a lot of practice problems to solve, but it was frustrating at times to not know if our own answers were correct. The solutions manual was expensive, so I think this made the course a bit unfair to certain students, especially as asking questions was more difficult given the remote setting.",
    "The class was well organized for online teaching. The prerecorded lectures were great, and allowed for flexibility in learning the material, with out falling behind.",
    "Professor DiMeglio did a very good job at actually teaching the material that was important and tested on (something a lot of the science teachers strongly lack). With an accelerated course such as this one it is unreasonable to expect the students to be able to read every page of the book, but Christine did a good job at teaching us what was actually going to be tested and in a comprehensive way that left you with an understanding of the material. If you go to lecture and refine your knowledge using the practice problems you can very easily get an A in the course. That being said the last week is a lot more material than the rest of the semester so prepare extra for the final.",
    "Course was very, very well organized. Lectures and assignments were uploaded well ahead of time and organized into modules so it was very clear what needed to be done each day.",
    "Dr. DiMeglio was amazing, really the best part of the course. Everything was taught so well and it was very organized. Wonderful teacher, wonderful course.",
    "Dr. DiMeglio was an amazing instructor who explained everything very clearly. She was very open to helping students and all the resources were very well organized. The only weakness is it felt like we were going so slow in the beginning, spending a lot of time on general chemistry review, and in the last week, we were cramming all the difficult portions of the course. I think the content could have been distributed better.",
    "Strengths: The professors are very helpful and seem to genuinely care about the students. Also, you can finish a semester course in 5 weeks! I also appreciated how lectures were recorded and able to be viewed ahead of time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very fast paced!",
    "The course was well structured and easy to follow. Lecture slides were very useful for notes, and the daily problems instead of psets were preferrable. I also liked the pre recorded lectures which let me go at my own pace. The daily readings could have been more easily accessible and the answer key for the textbook would have been nice to not have to purchase."

   "comments": [
    "Considering the rigor of the course, I only recommend it if you need it for your major or if you plan on attending a type of medical school.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student considering a science major at Yale. Even though organic chemistry is a pre-requisite for many biology\/chemistry majors, I think its an interesting and useful course to take.",
    "Taking organic chemistry over the summer moves pretty quickly, and it's hard to compare an online experience to an in-person experience, but Dr. DiMeglio and Dr. Hernandez definitely care about supporting students.",
    "I would! This is because of the professors and how much care and time they put into the course! It was definitely an improvement from General Chemistry I and II. Taking online during the summer also allows for as much time as one would like to be taken with the material.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend taking this course if you need to take organic chemsitry. Professor DiMeglio and Professor Martinez are great educators.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they need it. The course is VERY fast paced (covers a chapter in about 2 days).",
    "I would recommend this course - I think this is probably the best orgo course someone could take because it really wasnt bad.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have to take it.",
    "Most students taking this course probably are required to do so, but I would still recommend it.",
    "I think studying chemistry is useful for understanding the world mechanistically - but if that is not important to you (and it doesnt have to be) then dont take this class.",
    "Yes, but I would recommend taking the summer course only if the student is able to dedicate the majority of their time to the course. The course is very fast-paced, especially after the second exam. Otherwise, I would recommend taking the course during the school year.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Yes, the course is really great for introduction to organic chemistry.",
    "Yes. If you're gonna take orgo, I would recommend this summer course to get it done instead of during the semester. It was enjoyable!"
