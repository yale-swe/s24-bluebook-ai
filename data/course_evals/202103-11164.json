                "I learned the skills of thinking critically about legal topics, legal jargon in Spanish, and about the way our government is structured compared to other Latin American countries.  This class offered many opportunities to better my Spanish writing capabilities and to motivate myself to practice the language verbally more often.",
                "You learn a lot about the Spanish legal system as well as others.",
                "Great insight into Latin America legal systems.",

                "You're knowing exactly what you are getting - learning about the laws in Spanish. Only weakness was that the course packet was disorganized which made completing exercises a little annoying. But fine course and amazing professor.",
                "Professor Carreras is very kind and patient with students, but she can be difficult to hear (especially with a mask) because she tends to talk very quietly. There is also a weird dichotomy in this course because many of our readings focus on legal theory and principles, but the class also spends a lot of time reading about and listening to news articles. It's not always clear how those two areas relate and if we should try to draw similarities between them.",
                "The strengths of this course are the weekly writing exercises that allow us to practice and the in-class activities. The weaknesses of this course is that sometimes the transitions between topics is unclear and there is no overall schedule of what we'll be learning.",
                "I think that a weakness of this course was the long lecture notes during the class, I think it would be more helpful and captivating if the class involved more activities and projects. I also think that we should get more opportunities to research and learn about topics in depth rather than skimming the surface on many current global issues.",
                "Strengths: Amazing professor. Prof. Carreras is an absolute gem of a human being.\r\nWeaknesses: Can be difficult to keep up for non-native speakers.",
                "I liked that the class was laid back and did not contribute to my stress.",
                "Strengths where super interesting content and Professor Carreras is a great teacher. I think it would be useful if there were more opportunities for class participation so that students had a greater chance to improve their Spanish speaking.",
                "Strengths: Professor Carreras is such an understanding professor and she is amazing at what she does. She is always willing to explain things and makes the class enjoyable. The class is outlined by a notebook so it is easy to keep track. Class conversations are also interesting as they cover a variety of topics.\r\nWeaknesses: The homework can be a bit heavy as it almost feels like busy work but it is important to understanding the subject.",
                "interesting topic, would have liked more of a seminar-style.",
                "Strengths: Well-organized and structured syllabus; clear feedback; straight-forward assignments \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More opportunities to participate in discussions with other students would have made class a bit more engaging"

                "I would recommend this course to another student that needs to take L5 Spanish. It is relatively less work but still worthwhile in terms of learning.",
                "Of course I would recommend this course! It was incredible to explore the legal system through a different language! I think that their is a lot to learn about Latin American countries, which is something we often don't recognize, and students interested in global affairs, politics, and government should definitely take this course.",
                "Yes! Great, easy L5 class.",
                "Yes, its a fun and interesting way to practice your Spanish reading and writing!",
                "Yes! If you are like me where you weren't sure if you are ready for an L5 Spanish class, this is the class for you. The course is laid out where you are able to develop a broader vocabulary and Professor Carreras makes it a supportive environment to learn in.",
                "The professor is very likeable and the topic itself is interesting. But it is very much lecture-style, and not very organized as to promote understanding and appreciation.",
                "If you are looking for a more relaxed L5 Spanish course or want to learn Spanish vocabulary related to the legal world, absolutely. Your written Spanish will definitely improve.",
                "Yes! Its a very interesting and well taught class. If youre interested in pursuing anything in the legal field its really helpful to be exposed to all the terms in Spanish."
