We read a lot of thought-provoking pieces and I think it's a very accessible introduction to both technical and policy aspects of cybersecurity for someone who only has experience with one of those.",

                "This is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The seminar setting & mix of undergrad\/grad students was incredible. In no other class was I ever so intimidated by my peers (in a good way).",
                "Prof Wittenstein has tons of connections so he really makes the class an interactive experience. We frequently had very high profile guest speakers and would be invited to dinners and outside events that were being put on by ISS. I wish I had received more feedback on my papers though.",
                "Strengths: a lot of hands-on learning and events, Ted knows what he's doing \r\nWeaknesses: I wish there had been more structured debate in class in which two sides could've debated an issue more thoroughly",
                "The Yale Cyber Leadership Forum is highly additive to the class; a great way to hear from experts across the policy and technical worlds. The guest speakers in class were also high-ranking elected officials or retired policymakers who all brought a lot of first-hand expertise and insights to our topics of discussion. The case studies and readings were sometimes very focused on the technical aspects of different cyber attacks, but overall it was a great class to learn about cyber policy."

                "Yes, if you're looking to focus mostly on the policy aspect of cyber. The class is not going to focus as much on technical concepts beyond understanding the \"need-to-know\" for a policy discussion, so you have to be interested in the politics and policy considerations around cybersecurity and cyber warfare. Professor Wittenstein is very knowledgeable, has a really cool background, and the guest speakers are very cool as well."
