I think we would have benefitted from a little being forced to move onto different topics in the reading."

If you have little background in analytic methods\/writing specifically, you'll be caught a tad off guard. 2) The course isn't really to convince you of the fact that certain phenomena ARE socially constructed, more on arguing about how certain details cash out given the assumption. This is NOT to say we don't read anything along the \"convincing\" lines, just that that wasn't really the purpose of the class. I think this was for the better, but it's something to keep in mind."
