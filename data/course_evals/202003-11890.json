                "The course offered a wide range of support resources to help students succeed, such as many office hours and private tutoring sessions with our preceptor, TFs, peer tutors, and more. Everyone was more than happy to help and was very accessible. One weakness of this course was the platform used for exams, which did not allow for partial credit. Using this platform did allow for exam grades to be received quickly, however many students lost points for things that in a normal year they would have gotten partial credit for.",
                "strengths: Nilay's lectures, the resources provided by the teaching team to help students\r\nweaknesses: Sapling exams, Microsoft teams",
                "Strengths: Nilay was a great lecturer who strived to engage with students even in such a large class. Hannah was an excellent TF who clarified things exceptionally. There are plenty of resources to help you succeed and improve in this class, especially Hannah and many of Peer Tutors who were very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures did not always help with the problem sets and you would require not only reading through the textbooks but also seeking other examples in youtube videos or other external resources to help you with the problem sets if you could not make it to peer tutoring. TAs during discussion section are not the best both in explaining concepts and giving us supplemental materials. Midterms (particularly the first one) felt significantly more difficult than problem sets and practice materials.",
                "The discussion sections could be improved. I thought the professor was great and engaging though.",
                "Strengths: NILAY! He was an amazing professor and Dr. Hannah Lant is so helpful. I love the website she made that gave us extra practice problems. \r\n\r\nWeakness: It was sometimes difficult to keep track of when office hours were occurring. When Nilay would post poll questions, students who watched the recorded lecture could not see the answers and the questions.",
                "Strengths of this class include above all Nilay, as well as Hannah and the TA's, the Sapling homework site, the recorded lectures, and the fair examinations. The only weaknesses would be that the review sessions were not recorded, and occasionally it was hard to read\/understand Nilay's notes.",
                "Lectures are great, Nilay is awesome, notes are awesome.  Discussion is also a strength of the class.  Only weaknesses are the tests.  I only lost points because of easily avoidable mistakes I wouldn't have made on in-person tests.  No partial credit was also frustrating.",
                "Strengths: All lectures are recorded so you don't need to attend the class synchronously, there are also a ton of resources, peer tutors and TFs that can help, Nilay and Hannah are both SUPER responsive and I can tell that they both really care about students. \r\nWeakness: It is incredibly easy to zone-out during lecture, I don't think this is really any fault of Nilay's because of the nature of online classes.",
                "I found this course had many more weaknesses than strengths. Although some lectures were well put-together, the overall testing policy was inherently INEQUITABLE. Absolutely NO partial credit was given, and the testing was high-stakes and anxiety-inducing. The instructors did absolutely nothing to improve this, and Id have to say this was the worst class I took this semester.",
                "Strengths: Nilay! Also the format of teaching in clear sections related to the textbook really helped organize learning. The online notes were EXTREMELY helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: the content is not very engaging but it's basic chemistry so that's expected",
                "Nilay's lecture is amazing. Very engaging, great pace, and I love the music when we first come in. He is really great. Hannah and all of the other TA's are also awesome. I really appreciate all of the support and resources we are given. I also really liked Sapling, although I would've loved if there was more partial credit on the midterms, but I understand that was hard this year and Nilay did his best.",
                "I feel like explanations should be more focused on examples and less verbal conceptualizing. Going to study sessions virtually is already difficult and when a student asks a question and the TA's decide to explain a difficult concept that involves calculations verbally with no visual aid (though the capability was there), it's just disappointing. I felt like most were teaching with the mindset that everyone here wants to be a chemist or is a chemistry major. When people asked questions and had a blank stare after the complex verbal explanation, I found myself leaving study sessions because they were kinda demoralizing and just confused me even more. I'm passing the course, but it was literally from getting help online from sites that could explain it to me with great visuals. And that's just disappointing. Lastly, this final exam was unacceptable. Our learning and testing was all completed through Sapling. Now the final is hand written and it was completely unlike sapling. The homework and tests on sapling are more geared toward assessing a basic introduction of these concepts. The final and its questions seemed to test for a thorough knowledge with the most ridiculous questions. I feel like we should have either tested and did homework according to sapling the entire course, or hand-written homework, midterms, and final according to how he wanted us to grasp the knowledge and apply it. Because the final (and just looking at his old hand-written mid-terms on Canvas) versus sapling testing, it's like taking two different levels of this course.",
                "Nilay was very engaging as a lecturer and Hannah was very helpful. Sapling is the largest weakness to this class, since it often made exams impossible to receive partial credit on.",
                "Overall, the lectures were great. Nilay did a great job explaining concepts and answering questions. All the posted resources were also very helpful. Discussions sections, however, I felt moved very slowly and could have provided more time for actually discussing the material.",
                "Sapling homework.................did not reflect completely on what we would be tested on. I get it though it's chemistry.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the lectures were interactive with students mostly because of the polls done to check our understanding. Another thing that was strong was the connection shown clearly between chemistry in class to our everyday lives.",
                "The strengths of this course are that there is a great support network if you need help. You could attend a meeting to get more help every single day if you wanted to. The weaknesses of this course was probably the layout of the lecture. All you did during lecture was watch what the professor was writing on his iPad and then copy it down. I wish they provided more images and illustrative examples of what they were teaching instead of just handwritten notes. I felt like the notes also made it confusing to see how topics were connected together.",
                "It probably provides a good foundation for future chemistry courses, but the material wasn't very engaging or interesting. I don't know if that's because of the virtual format or just how gen chem is.",
                "A weakness of the course is the repetitiveness in the mode of instruction. For example, I think Nilay could use powerpoints one day and one-note in other days. Taking notes every lecture does make the course less engaging. I think a huge strength of this course is the outside resources such as bookable office hours and Hannah's website. I think that having outside resources is certainly more important than the lecture since a majority of a student's day will be spent outside of the lecture.",
                "This course was good!",
                "It'd would've been nice to take all paper exams\/final or all Sapling instead of switching from Sapling exams to a paper final.",
                "It was a little fast. I felt that the teacher skimmed over much of the information and since the course was not in person it made it more difficult.",
                "weakness: the lectures consisted of the professor writing in black in in Onenote for 50 minutes at a time 3 days a week, with the occasional video in between. This really tanked my engagement with the class which I believe I would have had more if it were in person and also If I was taking the lab associated with it.",
                "I had a lot of trouble focusing during online lectures because they were not engaging and I was on my computer all day. Its hard to fix this as this is the best we can do during the covid situation.",
                "The strengths of this course was the clarity of the explanations provided in lecture that aided students' understanding of both easy and difficult topics in general chemistry. Additionally, the problem sets supplemented learning in the course, and the midterms tested these topics fairly. One of the weaknesses of this course was that the timing on the exams was very limited and sometimes led to students running out of time to complete all questions to the best of their abilities.",
                "A weakness of the course is that the lectures were very fast paced and it was diffucult to learn material during this time. Most learning of material occured outside of class during problem set work and peer tutor sessions. A strength is the variety of resources available to help students",
                "I enjoyed this class a lot. I understand that there is a lot of material, but I would have liked if lectures were a little bit more thorough when covering material.",
                "difficult to succeed in the class without extensive time devoted to practice problems. Probably easier if you have a background in highschool chemistry. If not, it's hard to keep up given other classwork",
                "I think this class is standard it was not fun, but also could not see how it could be improved. But, Nilay is super nice and very funny.",
                "This was an okay course. It's an intro-level science course, so nothing especially exciting. Sometimes I felt like the TAs and professors did a poor job of providing extra practice material for students and sometimes Nilay did a poor job of explaining general chemistry concepts.",
                "strengths: friendly professor, organized lectures\r\nweaknesses: lectures were a bit slow-paced and some material was not explained thoroughly enough",
                "Strengths: Problem sets were on Sapling so we had an infinite number of attempts for every question. They also gave hints and a detailed solution once you solved the question. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We had to pay to do our mandatory homework. Online lectures were boring 99% of the time.",
                "I appreciated the lectures being recorded and thought that overall this course was designed well to facilitate online learning. However, I did not always find section to be as engaging as lecture - would have liked more time to go over how to do practice problems",
                "I wish it was more engaging",
                "I really enjoyed the professor and his teaching mechanisms!",
                "I hunk it was hard to stay engaged because it was an online lecture with little interaction between the professor and the students. I thought the online format made it harder to understand concepts as well.",
                "Class was good",
                "Good lecture and teaching of content as well as a lot of help offered.",
                "The problem sets on Sapling every week were really helpful to me in learning the material, although I might have liked more visual resources, especially for topics like bonding and orbital shapes.",
                "I think the discussion sections werent that helpful.",
                "Provide more office hours",
                "It is hard to evaluate with the virtual set up, but the it was very good for how the semester was set up. Despite the lack of personal connections, the course was still interactive enough to remain interesting.",
                "Sapling was not a great way to conduct midterms, as its pretty easy to miss part of a question if one forgets to scroll down.",
                "I thought sapling was very useful in practicing different concepts we were learning. I also enjoyed the flexibility with recorded lectures.",
                "Learned how to manage with STEM courses and understand how PSETs function.",
                "This class was very fun and engaging. Lecture was never boring, and you often get to see applications of what you learned in the real world. I think the problem sets were also really manageable, and resources were available to make your performance the best it could be. Nilay and Hannah were ultimately the greatest strengths of the course. They were very approachable and available to assist any student. There were no weaknesses to this course in my opinion.",
                "Nilay is an amazing professor. He made the topics easy to understand. The homework assignments on Sapling also helped me further my understanding of the topics covered in class. Sometimes I felt that he would lecture too fast but maybe that was just because I would get caught up in taking notes.",
                "My strengths were the material. I learned most of the material in high school. However, I did not perform well on the tests because of the partial credit. We could not show our work leaving a lot of room for silly mistakes.",
                "More example questions and guidance for exams would be helpful",
                "The lectures were well done and helped me understand the knowledge. However, the class felt somewhat disconnected. I didnt get to know any of the other students. Engagement really depends on how much youre willing to put in.",
                "I thought it was a well-taught course.  I specifically appreciated Professor Hazari's ability to keep class engaging.",
                "I thought the course was run very well. I loved how the chat was used to answer questions and the TAs held office hours",
                "The recorded lectures made learning and reviewing very efficient. The weekly problem sets and discussion sections also really helped reinforce the material covered in the lecture.",
                "The strength of the course is that Nilay is so nice and a great person who cares about his students and tries to make the lectures enjoyable. The weakness is that I felt like I did all of the learning entirely on my own. I learned very little from the lectures themselves (just took notes). I only really learned while doing the homework and spent a ton of time looking up videos on the material and learning fully from other online resources rather than the class itself. Also, the TAs chosen were not strong and my discussion section was incredibly unhelpful. My TA made everything more confusing and I tried to get help from other TAs by going to their office hours and review sessions but they were not good at explaining and did not make you feel comfortable asking questions.",
                "Strengths of this course include the numerous resources for extra help. A weakness is the lack of interaction between classes during these times, but this is a byproduct of lectures on Zoom.",
                "This course was taught well, I enjoyed attending the lectures. The material was fascinating, and it was always a joy to see how what we learned in class applied to the real world. However, there are some things that could have been done better, just to make the class more engaging and helpful to all students. First, it would be nice to be assigned readings from the textbook every week just so students can have a better correlation between the textbook and what is taught in lecture. Second, I think discussion sections could have been more engaging, and it would be nice for participation to be more encouraged as it was often difficult to stay engaged.",
                "One considerable strength of the course was that it was exceptionally well organized. Despite the breadth of the course, everything was very well arranged into easily replicable and reviewable notes. That said, the sheer breadth of the course materials also means that there can be quite a lot to keep track of, remember, and follow along with. Example problems were a bit difficult for myself to follow, and occasionally it seemed that the material was going by rather quickly. The material is definitely difficult at times. That said, the faculty did a great job of trying to accommodate students, and, as aforementioned, everything was very well organized.",
                "Interact with the students more, it was difficult to learn over zoom.",
                "I think it was really hard this year with virtual learning. Also, my TA for discussion section really seemed to struggle and often didn't seem to know what he was talking about\/how to answer questions. It often didn't feel worth my time to attend discussion. The lectures for the course were very good although the teacher's handwriting could be difficult to read at times and you couldn't see the chat\/zoom questions in the recording. Nilay and Hannah were great!!",
                "Nilay is a wonderful, charming person, as is the preceptor, Hannah. They both worked tirelessly to provide easy access to instructors to answer our questions, whether through the multitude of office hours, the Teams forum where we could ask a question and readily receive answers, or through questions during lecture itself. The problem sets were the right amount of challenging, but many times they covered concepts we didn't touch upon in lecture.\r\n\r\nThe discussion sections weren't the best; because all we did were more practice problems, it just felt like doing another problem set. Also, Nilay isn't the best at explaining some of the foundational concepts that can be confusing to newcomers of chemistry; you'll know enough to do well on tests, but you'll never really fully understand the concept. Some may like Nilay's style of displaying his notes as he speaks; some prefer powerpoint slides. The tests also felt unnecessarily difficult, as if they were deliberately trying to trick us. These tests would give problems much, much harder than anything else we would have encountered in the course.\r\n\r\nThe class itself though is more like learning different facts and concepts; there's not much critical thinking involved, it's mostly just rote textbook knowledge.",
                "I felt the instructors and TFs did a great job making the course and outside resources for help accessible, and I truly appreciate all they did this semester to accommodate the complicated circumstances brought about by COVID. However, I felt that the practice exams for the midterms and the final were not at all comparable in difficulty to the actual exams (in other words, I did quite well on the practice exams and then struggled on the real exams).",
                "Strengths: The availability of the instructor to speak to students about their questions, the straightforwardness of the grading platform (Sapling), the videos on virtual lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: One-on-one interaction with students was lacking, teaching methods on certain lectures (some lectures were impossible to understand without having read the textbook for copious amounts of background information), lack of flexibility with grading methods (Sapling and half-credit)",
                "The strengths of the course were that the staff was readily available for extra help, and all of the lectures being recorded made them very accessible. One weakness of this course would be that sometimes the discussion sections were not very helpful in covering  the material we had learned in class.",
                "Not enough personal connection",
                "Strengths were having one-note available to look back on and weaknesses were the difficulties of questions on tests compared to class and problem set examples.",
                "The recorded aspect of this course was nice, and the teacher was very entertaining, but the recorded nature did make things difficult to engage with.",
                "strengths: lectures were recorded and saved for future viewing; numerous resources were available to aid in student understanding\r\nweaknesses: lectures were sometimes fast-paced and topics weren't explained well; lectures didn't always prepare me to solve problems on the sapling problem sets \r\nimprovements: more fitting examples\/explanations (during lecture) that relate to topics\/problems on the psets",
                "There were not enough practice problems provided. Due to the online format, the material was difficult to internalize.",
                "Unfortunately online makes it invariably difficult but I think more support should be given for students struggling with exams. I found the psets were a completely manageable difficulty but exams were paced and weighted far worse. A strength was definitely the lectures which seemed quite digestible and helpful.",
                "pace was a little fast .",
                "This course was designed hypothetically for people who haven't taken chemistry, but in reality it was hard to follow if you didn't have at least a little previous chemistry knowledge. The lectures went fast and skipped explanations that were crucial for understanding. Perhaps going through examples in more depth rather than trying to get as many in as possible.",
                "The format of the lectures was consistent and organized, and the lectures were offered live as well as recorded which was very helpful. A discussion section was offered to help students further master the material of the course, and weekly problem sets also assisted in assuring that information was mastered in the course.",
                "The lectures were informative but discussion section was largely a waste of time. The breakout rooms were uncomfortable. Were this class live, it should without a doubt be recorded!",
                "The course is very inclusive in terms of background knowledge. No prior chemistry knowledge is assumed by the professors or the TA's, although they are also understanding of the fact that most people in the course have taken chemistry before. The course covers far more content than most high school courses so it is still very beneficial to those who do have a background. The main issue with this is that if you come in with no prior background, it seems like it would take a lot of work to keep up as things move very quickly especially in the beginning. I think by cutting some of the more extraneous content, students could get a deeper understanding of the more fundamental aspects of chemistry.",
                "I think given the nature of online classes this semester, Nilay did the best he could to engage the class (I also took the course asynchronously, which is also part of it)",
                "Overall, the course is taught clearly. However, I thought that the discussion sections could have been made more engaging.",
                "It was nice not to have much work outside of class but I might have benefited from having homework due more often. Sometimes I could forget completely about what happened in lecture until it showed up in Sapling, so maybe more synthesis of the material could have helped. For example, short reading quizzes\/example problems (for a grade or not) due on the day of lecture each day.",
                "Strength was that there was a lot of resources. Weakness was that we often taught many things to ourselves.",
                "The strengths were that it is a good overview of chemistry and helped me feel more prepared for the courses I plan to take in biology. Nilay is a great professor and made the class engaging and was really open to listening to student input. One weakness was the way that midterms were assessed. It was done on an online format called Sapling which allowed for virtually no partial credit. (This isn't how it is normally done, but the way they tried to make testing possible for this virtual semester). However, after students gave their input about how this testing format didn't work for them, the professor and preceptor changed the final exam to a paper format. So I think the willingness to listen to students and be flexible and accommodating was a definite strength for this course.",
                "questions in lecture more closely related to exam questions",
                "The lectures in this course were hard to follow and very ineffective. Material was much more quickly, fully, and easily understood by watching none of the lectures and reading the textbook.",
                "Weaknesses: some topics were difficult to understand because the basics weren't discussed initially\r\n\r\nStrengths: good entry chem class",
                "Parts of this course were good in learning basic chemistry. Sometimes, it felt as if it  was hard to pay attention in lecture because it was always  the  same  thing. The ability  to go  back and  rewatch lectures was a  strength  of  this  course as it  provided  a way to go  back and study  if  something was missed the first  time.",
                "Strengths: professor was patient taught at a great pace.\r\nWeaknesses: chemistry is a difficult subject and some topics I believed should have been reviewed more than once.",
                "There are always enough discussion sections and Q&A sections for students to utilize",
                "A strength was the fact that the course was recorded, so I could go back over and catch up on information I missed during the class. A weakness of the class was how late in the semester the third midterm was.",
                "Strengths: Nilay is great, fun, and engaging. Hannah is incredibly helpful and has lots of resources. Online transition was well-executed, did not encounter any problems.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: material, if you're not a fan of chemistry.",
                "The lectures were very useful and entertaining but at times they went too fast. The TAs werent very helpful except for a few and office hours were weirdly scheduled. The availability of so many practice exams and practice questions was incredible helpful.",
                "the lectures were severely unhelpful. straight-up reading the textbook and learning from youtube profs was better than attending lecture. they were not engaging and the material was usually too broad to actually apply to first time chemistry learners",
                "Psets can be long and hard but are mostly helpful for learning content and studying for the tests. Taking tests through Sapling is tricky though because you can't get any partial credit, it's 400 points or none at all if you round wrong.",
                "I think a weakness of this course is that it's online (which is something that I do not fault the teacher or school for). I just think the online experience really took away the experience and the beneficial aspect of my learning. I definitely think I would've performed better had this course been in person. Another weakness was the way that midterms were graded. I think that the tests should have been on paper the entire time just like the final exam. I think that the paper would allow students to show their work to earn partial credit and potentially do better on the test. It also allows professors and TAs to get a better idea of areas students are struggling with based on how they approach the questions and show their work. I also feel like I didn't know what was expected of me. I didn't know what the read when reading the book. I also didn't really know how I was doing in the class, which was a weakness for me. I also think that more resources should be made available in the Canvas site as well. I struggled to find some of the resources I needed because they were posted in the Teams chat, but not the Canvas website. I just think that posting it in both Canvas and Teams would be better and less confusing for students looking for those resources. I think one strength of this course was the concepts taught. They were not necessarily too difficult to understand or too overwhelming. The concepts were basic enough for me to understand, but also hard enough to challenge me (with my limited high school knowledge). I also think that Sapling was good for homework. It helped me understand the concepts in class and taught me more about applying the concepts. I do have to say that understanding the concepts seems easier in class than it actually is on my own, which could be considered a weakness of sorts.",
                "Strengths: The course was very well structures and the professor made the lectures very engaging via use of videos and polls. The homeworks were well designed and they helped reinforced the materials. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Did not feel like the discussion sessions were helpful. For some reason students did not collaborate well in break-out rooms. In pretty much all sessions I attended, nobody wanted to talk unless I started the conversation. Almost everyone preferred to stay on mute and off camera and work on their own and this was not helpful. And then there was very little time to go over the actual problems in class. \r\n\r\nThe lack of partial credit for the mid-term exams was also very discouraging.",
                "Great resources for help and studying. I wish office hours were easier to access though.",

                "A great strength of the course was the polls that the professor had us do during the live lectures. It kept me engaged and allowed him to see if the class understood the topics being discussed. The professor would also answer any question happily during the lecture and would make sure to go over any topic that needed further explanation before moving on.",
                "The course was very packed with information but had clear organization, so it wasn't as overwhelming. Sometimes, the course moved a bit faster than I was expecting and needed to review a lot information before I was comfortable moving on to new subjects."

                "Sapling problem-sets were okay, but the exams had no way to show reasoning (and perhaps receive partial credit), and often had confusing questions. Additionally, it would have been nice to just send us the material given via Microsoft Teams through Canvas and\/or Zoom.",
                "The recorded lectures were very useful throughout the semester. The virtual tests with a time window were convenient, but could have been improved by allowing more opportunities for partial credit (which they incorporated after the first midterm so I commend them for that!).",

                "I liked using Sapling for homework but did not like using it for tests. Often times I made small mistakes that would have counted for partial credit that were marked completely wrong because of Sapling. These errors would accumulate and give me a much lower grade than I would have thought I would get even though I was confident on the material.",

                "The virtual setting for this course in no way impeded the success of my learning, and in fact I think the virtual setting helped optimize the learning of this course in what would usually be a massive lecture.",
                "The testing format needs to be reformed. Sapling was a terrible testing format. By not rewarding partial credit, it discouraged learning. If partial credit had been awarded, Id find myself more encouraged to demonstrate the proper steps and understand the concepts, instead of focusing on the math and final answer. This could be in the format of scanning the test and receiving partial credit for the answers. I know this would take more effort, but Im sure all exams were hand graded in the past. Current students deserve the same opportunity to not be penalized for small mistakes that may lead to an incorrect final answer, yet fully demonstrate understanding of the concept. \r\n\r\nThis was my first semester at Yale, and Im disappointed that the instructors failed their students in a time where they were in the need of most support. Id like to repeat, of all of the courses I took this semester, this one was the worst. Other classes truly prioritized rewarding improvement, awarding partial credit, and supporting students in an unprecedented climate. This class, unfortunately, did not. I hope next semester will NOT be like this.",

Breakout rooms worked if all of the students had their video on or were otherwise participating, but sometimes it was pretty silent. The chat function during lecture was hilarious and a bonding moment for the students.",

                "Overall, the class went well despite COVID. The live lectures also being recorded was helpful and I felt like I still got to know Nilay. I do feel like Sapling tests were aggravating because of the lack of partial credit, more dynamic feedback, and the ability to show work. I was happy the final was on paper, but would have appreciated all tests being done that way.",
                "A practice that succeeded for me would be having two instructors, one that lectured and another that was in the zoom chat answering people's questions as the lecture went on. It allowed the maximum amount of time for the lecture and let students have their questions being answered without interrupting.",
                "I appreciated the polls during live lecture since they got me involved and disrupted the monotony of lecture. I also appreciated the Microsoft Teams aspect of the class as you could see questions from your peers being answered and ask questions yourself. The support was also great as there were always review sessions, tutoring hours, general office hours, and private bookable office hours. I would like the style of lecture to be improved since watching notes being written down and barely seeing any physical representations of chemistry principles made learning the concepts more difficult.",

They could watch the recorded lecture during their own time. The poll questions and the ability to ask questions in the chat to be answered by the preceptor allowed for virtual engagement. The Sapling software used for homework and exams succeeded when it came to completing problem sets. However, when it came to completing the midterms, it was limited in its features, and it didn't allow for any partial credit to be awarded. The final exam was on paper, which allowed for partial credit to be awarded.",

I wish that the polls were visible during the recorded lectures because I never could answer the questions when I wasn't watching synchronously since the poll question and answer choices were not recorded.",
                "Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it is completely understandable that midterms and PSETS were unable to be graded like in previous times. However, taking the paper final without having taken paper exams throughout the semester was a very difficult adjustment to make. The only thing I would have preferred is consistency between the midterms and the final exam. Other than that, the teaching team did a great job adjusting to the online format.",

                "I liked the use of polls during the live lectures, but sometimes the questions were too hard or we didn't have enough time to think through them before the poll closed. Additionally, I liked the use of breakout rooms during discussion section to help us work with each other in smaller group settings.",
                "I believe that the in paper final was better than the sapling exams, especially due to a few technical errors that occurred during sapling tests.",
                "The format of the course was very conductive to learning during the pandemic, as the dual format of live and recorded lecture allowed for a flexible schedule.",
                "Discussion section format needs to be improved because it seems to dissuade section leaders from going over answers or doing any teaching at all. Ask the MATH 110\/111 sequence how they do it, because it's actually useful. These problems might have been surmountable before, but they are compounded by Zoom.",
                "The use of live lecture while allowing students to still attend asynchronously was very helpful for me as it allowed me to take the course at the times where I could focus best while being at home with enough engagement in the lecture from those students who attended live to provide clarifying questions and point out errors. While doing exams through sapling is significantly less stressful than written exams that must be scanned in my opinion,  it overall felt as though it hurt my grade significantly. There were many instances where I understood content but made a formatting, typing, or small calculation error in which a normal exam format would much more accurately represent my comprehension.",

I also think that the way the final exam was administered, an on paper\/tablet scan-in exam, worked very well as a way to show what we've learned. What could be improved was the way the midterms were administered, which was on an online format called Sapling that allowed for very little partial credit. This was improved though in the sense that it was changed for the final exam.",

I suggest having a set of peer tutors and\/or TAs who are or can work easily in a timezone different than EST.",
                "I think that the recorded lectures could be improved. One of the more engaging tools used in lecture was the usage of polls to apply concepts. However, I was unable to see those poll questions and answers in recorded lecture, which didn't allow me that same engagement my classmates had. I think that having the notes available online was successful. I also think that the idea of polls was nice (if I had seen them). I think that the discussion sections could be improved by having more of a variety of plans, especially because it's online. I think it's less engaging doing the same thing every week. I don't think that there needs to be a great variety with something different every week. I just think that there needs to be something new or different every so often.",

                "The virtual lectures and in-lecture polls were very engaging. Taking the midterms on Sapling was not very helpful as it did not allow students to display their thought processes when approaching a problem.",
                "The polls were very successful since it gave the professor an idea if the class was understanding the material based on if the majority of the class responded to the question correctly. Having the big assessments on sapling was difficult since some functions required more time to input than it normally would writing and getting corrections was not always possible. For some questions I wouldn't know what I did wrong, nor would I be able to figure out how to properly solve the problem.",
                "The lecture was effective at allowing the professor to teach undisturbed, especially with how dense the course was. However, over time (as the professors themselves noted), less students seemed to be showing up to the live lectures. While there are many opportunities to participate in the course, such as small polls or quizzes, the live lecture format where most students are muted can feel a little restricted."

                "Only if it's a requirement for your major.",
                "I would only recommend to intended chemistry majors or people who are planning to do pre-med. Basically, only if you have to take it, but I would not take this class for fun.",
                "Yes, good foundations chemistry course, especially for chem\/bio majors.",
                "Yes it was a strong course and nilay was very enthusiastic about helping",
                "Yes! I really felt like I was able to improve my chemistry skills at a reasonable pace.",
                "I think it is good for learning the basics of chemistry, but a lot of studying will have to be done outside of class to fully understand and the class will be better in person.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, to learn basic chemistry and learn more about the sciences I would recommend it.",
                "Its an intro necessary for most STEM majors so yes.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a good way of getting into STEM without being overwhelmed.",
                "I wouldnt to non-stem majors, as this course is a bit difficult due to the nature of chemistry as a subject.",
                "Yes, the class is good for learning basics to chemistry.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a great introductory science course that helps you gain a pretty thorough understanding of a lot of different topics. I found that the quantum mechanics portion of this course was particularly enthralling. Additionally, there is no excessive work in the class. Lastly, you are definitely able to work hard and see that hard work produce a greater understanding of concepts and better performance relatively quickly. Chemistry is a great field with so many applications.",
                "Yes! I came into this course with hardly any previous knowledge of chemistry and it was easy to learn and follow along. I ended up really liking chemistry because of this class and Nilay and Hannah.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes because it is a fundamental course with basic knowledge one must know if they want to pursue any science field. I learned a lot and had a good review from chemistry in high school.",
                "Not really, not unless it was required",
                "It did help me gain a good foundation as a premed. However, it really does just feel like a prereq course sometimes.",
                "Yes. This course gives you a great understanding of basic chemistry.  I thought Professor Hazari did a great job as well.",
                "If you are interested in Chemistry then yes. It covers a lot of intro topics and the lectures are well paced",
                "Yes, I would, especially if you are interested in Chemistry! The course was set up very well and there are many resources and opportunities available to you if you are ever confused or need help on anything.",
                "Only take it if you have to. I really didn't feel like the resources available to help you were useful. I spent majority of time learning on my own and so incredibly confused. I hadn't taken AP Chem before and thought the material was really difficult and not explained clearly.",
                "Probably not until the end of the pandemic\/when this course will be offered in-person.",
                "Yes I would. This course really solidifies the basics of chemistry and is especially helpful for people who may not have had the strongest background in Chemistry. The help throughout the semester was immense, so if you are struggling, there is always help! Thanks to this course I now have a greater appreciation for chemistry and how it applies to other sciences.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to beginners in chemistry, as the teaching faculty are incredibly approachable and understanding. The course is a helpful intro course for anyone required to take it as a prerequisite. That said, I would only recommend the course to those not taking biology in the same semester, and I would also warn the student of the considerable workload.",
                "Yes because it's necessary as a baseline for many other courses! Even if you've had chemistry in high school, I'd take this so you can get used to the college pace and have a really solid foundation.",
                "If it's necessary for their major, sure. Otherwise, I wouldn't really bother.",
                "Yes - I'd recommend the course to anyone interested in chem (or STEM more widely).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because I think it was a great introduction of chemistry.",
                "yes because I liked nilay",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in STEM.",
                "Yes because Nilay is a fantastic personality and it is a necessary course for most stem majors.",
                "only if required because the class is fast-paced and some of the topics are difficult",
                "Probably not its definelty not a class just to take to try something new. Some pre-existing interest in chemistry or perhaps to be a doctor is essential to sucess in this course. This is just because the applications were limited and class usually revolved around word problems.",
                "This course certainly needs to be taken but I would recommend striving to make study groups and take it in person. Without the element of group work you will have to teach yourself much of the content.",
                "I would recommend this course to people considering pre med track because it is required.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they have to take it to fulfill a requirement. It would have helped tremendously to have at least a little bit of a chemistry background because baseline knowledge and chemistry skill was assumed and if you haven't taken chemistry, it will take a lot more work, self-study, and advocacy.",
                "Yes, I believe this course was beneficial to anyone interested in the sciences.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to learn the foundational concepts of chemistry, or anyone interested in the STEM field. Obviously its required for pre-med students and those whose major requires it.",
                "Yes, it's probably the best option for taking CHEM 161.",
                "Yes, the course has interesting content and the staff is exceptional. If you are worried about taking a higher level chemistry or think this might be too easy talk to the professors, but if you are deciding based on enjoyment this class will not disappoint.",
                "Yes, it's a good introductory class",
                "Yes. This a great course for anyone who has an interest in chemistryeven non-STEM students.",
                "Nilay was a great professor even if we didn't have much of a personal connection. Lectures were very thorough and there were tons of resources available outside of class to help.",
                "Yes if the class is needed for a major\/pre med.",
                "Would only recommend if you are premed or it is a requirement for your major. The course is definitely a little challenging for someone who hasn't previously taken a chemistry course, but there are lots of people who are willing to help you if you ask for it. TFs are frequently available for office hours, which is nice. Nilay and Hannah are also very responsive to their emails and are always happy to help you.  Discussion sections weren't too helpful for me, but they weren't mandatory which was nice. This class was never too much work; it only became a little overwhelming when we had midterms. Nilay is super nice and funny, although I didn't think his notes were as clear\/straightforward as they could have been.",
                "Yes. It helped give me a basic understanding of chemistry and literacy in ways that scientists talk about chemistry (naming, lewis structures) that I think will be helpful going into a STEM field.",
                "Yes, very illuminating",
                "It is a requirement for many, of course, but objectively? No. With incredibly poorly presented lectures, a useless discussion section, and a robotic-feeling virtual learning format, I felt as though I could have learned the material just as easily on my own with the textbook and the final exam. No feedback was given on assessments and exams, and little structure was available for extra help.",
                "Yes, most STEM majors will have to take it.",
                "I would  recommend   because  it  provided basic  chemistry  knowledge that can be extended  outside  the  field of  chemistry.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it gave me knowledge of basic chemistry.",
                "Yes, definitely a foundational course that must be taken.",
                "not unless they were required to take it",
                "Yes, especially if they need it for their requirements. My answer is yes because I felt Nilay did a great job teaching this semester.",
                "Yes, as the teacher is very good, the class is not too hard, and it is a common prerequisite anyway.",
                "only if you need it for your reqs or major",
                "If you have to take chem, well there's no way around it. Heads up though, this gen chem is supposed to be for any lower level chem students (whether you took it in high school or not), but coming from someone who took chem over summer four years ago, it was fast-paced and pretty tough (compared to some other people who took ap chem and seemed to breeze right through the course). But if you work hard and really put in the effort, you'll be ok.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course. It allowed me to build a good foundation of basic chemistry knowledge that I will need in my future.",
                "Absolutely! I have learned so much in this course! The course was very well structures and the professor made the lectures very engaging via use of videos and polls. The homeworks were well designed and they helped reinforced the materials.",
                "Yes, it is informative and the professor is great!",
                "Yes, for those interested in chemistry or a major needing it as a prerequisite.",
                "Yes, I found that the course solidified and expanded my knowledge of chemistry. The course was engaging and challenging.",
                "This course is a great introduction to many chemistry concepts that will be used in many other advanced science courses. It is also a prerequisite for many science majors."
