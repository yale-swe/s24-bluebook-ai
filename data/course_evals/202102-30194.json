                "I learned how to translate spanish in to English!",
                "In this course, I learned how to read and translate Spanish texts effectively. The course gave me the skills to identify the structures of Spanish sentences and read texts of different complexities with the assistance of only a dictionary. In other words, compared to my level of knowledge prior to taking this course, now I am more aware of the grammar, usages, conventions of writing, meanings and basic vocabulary of the language. The key insight that I gained was to approach reading and understanding Spanish in a step-by-step manner, breaking the sentences down to parts and understanding the relations between these parts.",
                "I learned about the significance of context, which helps determine the verb tense. These dynamics really dictate the translation and\/or comprehension of a sentence."

            "comments": [
                "I thoroughly enjoyed this course and felt that any weaknesses were not due to the organization of the course itself, but rather the format of a totally asynchronous, online learning experience, which I don't think could have been avoided, given the pandemic. The Canvas site was easy to understand and all the resources we needed for our work were easily accessible. Professor Asensio-Manrique and Craig Osterbrock provided prompt feedback on our homework and were readily available to answer any questions or concerns we might have had. In addition to providing us with written chapters, Professor Asensio-Manrique also provided recorded mini lectures, which were helpful for ironing out any particularly confusing aspects of the course.",
                "This course provides a well-thought framework to learn Spanish. If there is anything to be improved, maybe a bit more materials on the cultural background of Spain should help. I really enjoy the course and grateful for her teaching.",
                "The class modules in the last two weeks of the course were a little difficult to understand and I sometimes looked up additional resources outside of the course. Perhaps making the chapters a bit longer\/more detailed with sentence translation examples would be helpful!",
                "The main strength of the course was how the modules were organized. Each module and the corresponding assignments built upon the previous ones in terms of the level of proficiency, and in a way that allowed a relatively new student of the language to quickly learn the basics of reading more complex texts. I am sure that if in-person classes were possible the course would have been much more effective. The only weakness was that the video lectures could have been a little more elaborate or interactive. Perhaps a few zoom meetings to complement the video lectures could have been helpful as well.",
                "Although I recognize the importance of context, it was also very hard to keep up when the tense kept changing. It seems, then, that a firm grasp on grammar is important."

                "Sure thing. I think it's an efficient way to improve the self-study ability and inspire us to plan the study time.",

I might not recommend it to students who are completely new to the language, as it would require many more hours to complete the course requirements if one didn't have at least a very basic prior understanding of the language.",
