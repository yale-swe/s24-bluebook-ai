                "Strengths: The writing workshop style of the course was quite helpful and really helped better my writing. I also thought many of the discussions that the course's content encouraged were pretty stimulating. Professor Skowronek made great edits on each successive draft and really challenged students to better their writing during the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The reading was a bit dry and at times felt heavy. Additionally, much of the reading was very theoretical (more like political theory) with historical examples rather than contemporary application. Class sometimes felt a bit unengaging as it mostly consisted of Professor Skowronek lecturing on the reading.",
                "This course did a really good job of covering the materials in the readings and explaining the different models of leadership we read about. I don't think the course was very well organized, though. It wasn't clear what the professor was looking for in our papers, which was a bit frustrating.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is that it gives students an opportunity to develop a research paper over the course of a semester. Prof. Skowronek is very helpful in the writing process. He gives thorough feedback on drafts and his office hours are also very helpful. A weakness of this course is perhaps the amount of readings it assigns. Since students are already conducting their own researches, sometimes there is not enough time to complete the common readings.",
                "The primary strength of the course is the individual feedback that Professor Skowronek gives. Rarely do you have the opportunity to construct and workshop a single research paper over the course of a semester, and Professor Skowronek was always available to offer advice and work through ideas. The primary weakness is that, as a seminar, the success of the in-class discussions and workshops was highly dependent on the participation and engagement of other students."

                "I would recommend this course to someone who is really interested in learning about political leadership. This course requires you to spend all semester on a research paper about a leadership problem, so you need to actually be interested in the topic to keep working on that all semester.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in writing the research paper. The paper is the major component of this course. You learn a lot about the topic of your paper, but also how to write a paper in general.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is self-driven and is interested in exploring topics in political leadership at length. It helps to come in with some idea of what you would like to research.",
                "Yes, you can get a lot out of this course if you want to. Most of your work will be on your final paper, and it is really great to work with one set of ideas and one body of research for a whole semester. There were a number of students who took this course less seriously and probably didn't get much out of the course, don't take it for a PLSC that you think you can get an A in, take the course if you think you would benefit from writing a paper for a semester on a cool political leadership topic."
