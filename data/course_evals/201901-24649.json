    "I gained strong skills in understanding Yiddish grammar, which makes it much easier to improve my language skills in the future. This course provided a great baseline for Yiddish language comprehension, and I feel like with the knowledge I have learned, I have the gift of a looking glass into various forms of Yiddish language texts\/songs\/speeches, etc.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is very strong at doing what it advertisesgiving students to understand written Yiddish. I wish that this course also had more speaking components, but that obviously isn't a shortcoming of the course, since that's not what the course is designed to do. One strength of the course is its tailoring to the individual student. For the midterm and final project, we were able to consult with Professor Price to pick texts that were interesting and relevant to each of us. As a result, we were all bale to go into depth into topics that truly interested us.",
    "Strengths: Very nice professor, worksheets were very explanatory, college yiddish (book) is great, lots of feedback\r\nWeaknesses: Moves very quickly, would be helpful if we slowed down a bit; Professor gives a lot of HW (unrealistic to be able to do it all in a week - he's understanding but would be better if he just assigned less in the first place); if you didn't have an Hebrew or German background, this class would be very difficult",
    "Strengths: very interesting readings on the syllabus, students encouraged to explore the texts that interest them in more depth and present on them to the class, casual\/non-stressful learning environment\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: translation ability was quite varied amongst the class and sometimes the assignments are of a reasonable length for some students but not all"

    "Yes; this is a really good course with a sensible workload and tangible progress.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student even moderately interested in the Yiddish language. It provided me with skills and a broad background that will open the doors of Yiddish literature and other texts should I ever decide to pursue more Yiddish learning in the future.",
    "YES!!! Absolutely fabulous!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in learning some Yiddish this is a good course!",
    "Yes, if you are interested in gaining the tools to read texts in Yiddish and navigate your way through the vast world of Yiddish literature"
