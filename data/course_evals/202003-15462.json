                "I think I tried to be engaged in the readings which helped me formulate questions for the people presenting in class!",
                "Strengths: All of the wonderful lecturers! The lectures were unique and opened my eyes to areas of cogsci that I had never previously studied.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I understand the reasoning for a 9 am mandatory class, but differences in time zones made this class time unbearable. At some point we were told that lectures would be recorded for students in different time zones, but I only ever saw a few of those lectures posted. As a result, I wasn't always as present as I would've liked to be during lectures. I regret not being able to fully engage with the lecture topics each class.",
                "I think the presenters should try to perhaps engage students a bit more and create more opportunities for conversation.  It was really cool to learn from these professors but sometimes it felt very one sided.",
                "It's a really fun course. Definitely, one of the most fun I have taken since it's a lot about discovering new areas of study.",
                "The course was the perfect balance between the amount of administrative information and intellectual exploration. I enjoyed hearing from a different professor and field each class.",
                "Guest lectures back to back, to back to back. You peep into many worlds.",
                "I thought that having readings + short responses due before class made me more engaged with the presenters the next day.",
                "Strengths: Mentally prepares you for the kind of work you'll have to do for your capstone, both in terms of research and asking professors to supervise it. \r\nWeaknesses: Students don't have input on the schedule of speakers so it seemed like the disciplines and subtopics represented in the syllabus reflected the balance of class interests pretty poorly. Also I really think this course should not be in junior fall  if you come out of this class, which is the most in depth intro to the field you can get, realizing that you've picked the wrong major, it's too late to switch. It'd be better if it happened sophomore spring after the intro class and applications to the major have just been accepted."
