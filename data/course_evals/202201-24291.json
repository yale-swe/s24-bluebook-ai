                "I definitely learned how to read more critically and think more deeply about what I was reading. The readings were also engaging and challenging, so I think my reading comprehension also improved as a result of taking this class. One of the hardest parts of this class was deciphering the essay prompts and figuring out how to skillfully articulate a cogent answer to the prompt. I think this class overall made me a better, more thoughtful reader and a more analytical, direct writer.",
                "Introduction to the work of Galileo, Vico, Darwin. They all had fascinating conceptions of nature and science, and they were all revolutionary thinkers. Vico was critical in understanding modern historicism. These are all thinkers whose concepts we use without always having read themit was great to trace many modern concepts to their sources.",
                "I learned how to read historical texts in various academic disciplines. I learned how to differentiate types of arguments, and find the novel element in each.",
                "The course digs very deeply into the premises, thought processes, and human values that guided scientific developments. It was fascinating to fathom what the world would have felt like without these innovations and the reasoning it would have taken to override centuries of believed knowledge.",
                "Vico. Difference between scientific and humanistic ways of thinking. What a scientific revolution looks like.",
                "I learned a lot about the history and development of scientific thought, writing, and modes of engagement, which is an invaluable skill to have, especially in an age where scientific discourse is prominent in public life. For example, we analyzed Darwin's use of both 'objective' and narrative argumentative styles to convince his readers of the theory of natural selection and evolution. The goal was to build a lineage from Galileo through Darwin (and at the last, Schrodinger)."

                "The class fostered a really good environment for discussions, although sometimes I found it a bit daunting to participate. At the same time, the class ultimately helped me become more comfortable with speaking up in class.",
                "We spent way too much time on Galileo",
                "Prof. Tomlinson knows a lot about each text, and hearing his insights was always fascinating. The weakness was that there wasn't much room for discussion during class; student contributions were mostly limited to clarifying the professor's opinion on the text, rather than encouraging us to learn to read it on our own.",
                "I think that the paper assignments were a bit confusing. I appreciated that they werent as traditional, but I think that the expectations of these papers could be difficult to understand, and in my opinion, i tend to prefer writing papers in which I can craft my own argument rather than defend one already provided.",
                "The one thing I do wish is that the prompts to the essays were a little more open ended. It would have been exciting to think about the texts in different contexts and higher level of thinking. It felt like the essays were closer to book reports and just wish we had maybe just one or two longer essays that we could really delve into.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the texts, the pacing, and the teaching was fantastic.",
                "Tomlinson is brilliant and at the forefront of his field. Learning from him is a pleasure. Student participation isnt great, though.",
                "I love Professor Tomlinson. He took each of us seriously and wanted to hear what we had to say. Engaging course.",
                "The material read is really quite fascinating - I find Darwin emotional and compelling and almost BIblical in sweep and emphasis. That is to be commended in the highest terms. It feels meaningful, intellectual, and 'relevant'. It's a SC credit for non-Science majors that still challenges one at the right levels."

All three of these books are must-reads (for any person), and I think that Professor Tomlinson is the perfect person to comment on their importance. Although I was intimidated by some of the other students in the class (who I thought knew more than me), I still think that the experience overall was very enjoyable.",

                "The readings and texts of this class are fantastic, for STEM or humanities students alike. It's essentially a \"great books\" course, but the texts thread the line between the sciences and humanities in a really exciting and inspiring way.",
                "This is a wonderful course.",
                "Yes, I would. This is a fun and meaningful way to receive a SC credit, if one is in need of one. Often SC credit classes are too difficult or not at all challenging enough. Professor Tomlinson makes sure that the course is structured around readings, but that the engagement with science is being done deeply and seriously."
