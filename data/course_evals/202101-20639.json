This particular course read the two philosophers in light of their thoughts on mythology, revelation, and religion, which was a fascinating angle at which to read them, and provoked a lot of interesting questions about the role of philosophy and the proper relationship between philosophy and religion.",

                "This class helped me develop my writing skills on subject matter that's very esoteric and confusing, and digging through obscure text to pull out ideas relevant to a certain point. It was also fascinating to learn about Hegel and Schelling's philosophies generally, as I hadn't previously really been exposed to them.",

                "I feel like the lectures are fairly disorganized.\r\nThe professor can focus more on concepts and fundamentals before discussing more difficult concepts.\r\nHonestly, I am usually left confused after the lecture.\r\nCould give quicker feedback on papers. I didn't get the feedback on the second paper, even right now in the reading period.",
                "I thought that the lecture-seminar hybrid was good. Maybe slightly more time to discuss ideas with peers and Professor Franks would be nice.",
                "This course had a nice blend between lecturing which made great use of the professor's expertise in the subject and seminar discussion which allowed students to pose interesting questions, although sometimes these discussions could get out of hand and detract too much from the central questions of the class.",
                "Lectures were great, maybe some reading responses or perusall assignments would help.",
                "I'd like to see more secondary sources included in the syllabus, particularly standard sources that might (a) give contrasting interpretations of the primary source text or (b) provide an overview of the denser portions of the material.",
                "I really like the historical treatment of the material, though I think the class could perhaps be more grounded in the political developments of the time, which were mentioned and informative -- would have liked more of that.",
                "I think the lecture format was very appropriate for the difficulty of the material, and the lectures were very good and interesting. I do think maybe a section where we could have discussed lecture might have helped as a checkpoint for comprehension of each piece of the material.",
                "I think the strength is of course the material and Professor Paul Franks. Paul is an amazing lecturer and a very kind person who is more than willing to be helpful to anyone who needs extra help or simply wants to discuss the ideas in the class in more depth. I think the weakness is the discussion in the course - there wasn't enough, or questions were sometimes long and a bit disruptive."

                "You need to have a fair amount of knowledge in Hegel, Spinoza, and Kant before taking this class.\r\nYou have to be really interested in the topic. Some curiosity on Hegel (like how I feel like I don't understand Hegel and want to know more) may not be enough.",
                "Absolutely! Hegel and Schelling are philosophical titans whose works are both incredibly important and difficult. Having Professor Franks guide you through your readings of these two figures is invaluable, and you will walk away from this course with a newfound appreciation of the possibilities of philosophy in modernity.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is particularly interested in this important moment in Western philosophy from an intellectual historical perspective. Post-Kantian philosophy can often seem overly abstract or unpractical to those who are not interested in it either for its own sake or for the historical content, so I would only recommend this course to students who are either fascinating by questions like the Pantheism Controversy or the subject-object distinction, or students who want to know the historical backing and context for these very influential philosophers. This is very much not a course centered around the practical implications of Hegel's thought, nor is it trying to be the most complete survey of Hegelian or Idealist philosophy one will get. Rather, this course will teach you how to approach philosophy historically, by trying to take up the most important questions and anxieties of a historical moment and trace the various ways in which philosophers try to resolve those questions in their own time. Given the Hegelian nature of this approach, this is all very much to the course's credit, but it may not be for everyone.",
                "Yes, if you like Paul Franks and\/or are interested in German Idealism",
                "I would indeed. The themes of this course (and in Hegel and Schelling) are broadly applicable within philosophy, and Prof. Franks does an excellent job of tracing the backdrop of German idealism, connecting it in particular with the Spinozism controversy.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in digging into Hegel and Schelling a good bit. Familiarity with the material is not needed or expected beforehand, but this is definitely not an introductory philosophy course, and might be quite difficult as a first philosophy course. If interested, I think it's a great class and a great way to explore very complicated and esoteric philosophies."
