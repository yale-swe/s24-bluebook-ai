                "survey of classical system designs and the general approach should  be adopted for system research",
                "Throughout this course I read research papers across a wide range of subjects ranging from hardware trends, security, and distributed systems for exampe and how computer scientists in these areas have tackled challenges brought by the large amounts of big data they collect. This was very useful exposure into many different modern, practical challenges, and the course definitely increased my skills in effectively reading cs research papers overall. Also, while the group research project was very open ended and we ran into several challenges along the way, Anurag was very flexible/helpful in getting us through these and we learned a lot about what doing a research project in these areas could look like.",
                "I gained a lot of research skills. I learned how to do literature review, peer review, and how to write a research article. I also gained a bit of experience in the field I was researching. Additionally through the paper summaries and class discussions I was able to learn a lot more about current trendy hardware and distributed systems concepts.",
                "This course covers so much fascinating material. All sorts of different cutting edge disaggregated frameworks, and the history of how data centers and relevant related technology came to be. You also read a lot of academic papers and learn how to be critical of academic papers, which is a useful skill. Working on a semester long project can be challenging, but the professor is very engaged with the projects and is supportive of student ideas. I can tell he wants everybody to succeed, so while it was a challenge, it was a rewarding one.",

                "Strengths: interesting papers, mandatory discussion leading allowed us to really dig into 1-2 papers, discussions were lively\r\nWeaknesses: although final projects were interesting, relatively low guidance on smaller issues",
                "Strengths: Very interesting discussion of papers in the field. The student presentations are great and Anurag offered numerous valuable insights into the fields. Highly recommend.\r\nWeakness: more feedback about the paper critiques",
                "I think that content wise, and staff-wise the course is great. The only thing that I will say is that there is very little feedback about your grade over the course of the semester, and if you ask for feedback, it isn't very concrete.",
                "It's a very organized course. But the workload is much larger than expected.",
                "The selection of papers we read was a strength, as each one was interesting and offered unique perspectives to think, discuss, and learn about. One weakness was the the limited feedback we had about how we were performing in the class. The feedback we got was primarily through comments on our initial and midterm project reports and verbally through our project meetings with Anurag. Some feedback regarding the paper critiques and in-class discussions could have been helpful as well along with more clear indications of our grade at points throughout the class.",
                "Strengths: It teaches students how to do research in computer science\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "This is a fascinating course, and it covers so much content. That is a huge strength: you will learn a lot. About the frameworks, about how to read academic papers, about how to be critical of novel ideas, etc. Having to do a semester long project is definitely a challenge, but ended up being a rewarding process, if not a stressful one. One weakness of the course is that throughout the semester, students receive very little tangible feedback. For most of the semester, it was hard to gauge how well I was doing, so all one can do is keep up with the reading and the project and hope for the best."

The discussion was great and I feel like I learned so much from each class.\r\nHowever, I definitely recommend you to have some exposure to OS/Networks. Though they are optional but I think some knowledge in these fields are very useful in understanding the papers discussed.",

You largely get out what you put in, but by reading the papers you do learn about a wide range of important and practical concepts such as in distributed systems, hardware trends, and security for example, and Anurag was very helpful in guiding us through various challenges we faced during our research project.",
                "Yes if they were particularly interested in computer science systems research. This class dives deep into that field and can help a student gain experience or determine if they want to do a PhD.",
                "I recommend this course if you are really interested in disaggregated systems. If that is not interesting to you, you will not enjoy this course. It is a rigorous overview of many different technologies, that requires students to be critical and respond to dense academic writing multiple times a week. Most of the course work is a semester long project, which is challenging. If that sounds interesting, you'll love this course. If not, you'll probably struggle through it."
