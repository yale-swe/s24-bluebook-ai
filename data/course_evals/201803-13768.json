    "Learned important contemporary educational issues, and how journalists report and research.",
    "Knowledge: Greater awareness of trends in K-12 education reporting, common topics of interest and what's prevalent in ed journalism coverage today, \r\n\r\nSkills: How to report in the K-12 education space and effective approaches (e.g. getting on-the-ground school perspective), news\/opinion\/narrative writing exposure and feedback to improve my writing, how to use sources effectively and other journalistic practices\r\n\r\nInsights: Firsthand exposure to challenges and rewards of reporting on an education beat",
    "I learned  a lot about journalism. This class teaches you what it's like to be a real journalist. You learn how to interview properly and fact check and find good sources.",
    "Learned a lot about the topics covered by guest lecturers, and a little about journalism. But not much."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:  Depth of discussion due to small class size and class being discussion-led, ability to hear students flesh out and walk through their article ideas and provide feedback, diversity of topics covered within K-12 education and access to hearing from different experts in the field due to professor's connections\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class could benefit from more structure (e.g. maybe a handout or slide with key takeaways related to each class topic; or an outline that weaves together components from topics provided in the class)",
    "Strengths: Very interesting guest speakers from various sectors\/experiences within the field of journalism, manageable reading load, flexibility with assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Felt really disorganized in many aspects, a new syllabus was uploaded nearly every week, instructor sometimes treated students as full-time journalists\/expected a little too much, instructor did not start the semester with the basics of journalism so some students had a leg up from extracurricular journalism activities whereas others started far behind",
    "We had amazing guests! That was a big strength of the class. I wish we had more time to discuss readings or could peer edit each other's papers.",
    "Strengths: Writing a story allows you to explore topics youre interested in. The guest speakers are well known and offered insightful comments. Karr has an amazing resume and knowledge base. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course isnt necessarily set up for learning or for improving of writing in my opinion. Little time was spent on the format of writing journalism pieces, which I hoped would be a more central topic."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you interested in learning about education journalism, this is a great class, but the professor doesn't give much direction as to how to actually write the pieces, nor does she make it clear how she grades.",
    "Yes - discussion of very timely topics related to K-12 education reporting, access to top education journalists and subject matter experts, ability to work on and refine several journalistic pieces",
    "I would recommend this course to those interested in journalism or already a bit experienced in journalism. The guest speakers were awesome, and the assignments are great for those interested in education issues and experienced in journalism. But this course is not for students who like a lot of structure and organization.",
    "If you think you might want to be a journalist than absolutely. Otherwise, maybe not.",
    "I would enroll in this course if you feel like you can give your more attention than any other classes--the expectations are set very high (you are expected to travel for your articles, as one example) and the reward in terms of becoming a better writer and learning about the US education landscape is high, but only if you are willing to put in that work."
