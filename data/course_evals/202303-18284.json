                "As a playwright, I focus so much on language that I find it easy to forgot just how important action is. This course has been a powerful reminder of what action can do  the entirety of an tude is action in the moment, action which you can only loosely plot in advance. Additionally, because of the improvisational nature of tudes, I've been reminded just how much actors' creative decisions shape an overall performance, and just how collaborative of an art form theater is.\r\n\r\nI've also learned a new, deeper way of engaging with texts based on the methods of Dima Krymov. Dima is masterful at pushing you to identify exactly what in a text speaks to you on a personal level, and making your emotional experience into something real. I've taken many literature classes at Yale; none have come anywhere close to deepening my appreciation of a text as much as this class has.",
                "This class teaches you how to trust yourself and others in improvisation, some clowning technique, and how to craft Etudes from an incredibly evocative source material. Because the class was so small this semester, my classmates and I truly learned to work with one another almost like a troupe of traveling actors. Every class felt poignant and vastly important. We got to work with a professional director, Dmitry Krymov, whose guidance, along with Professor Chambers', was invaluable.",
                "I continued to build on my knowledge of adapting a piece of literature for the stage through improvisation and tudes. I also was immersed in the work of Russian director Dmitry Krymov and built my confidence working as a director with tudes.",
                "To be creative and in touch with wonder at the beauty of theatre. To dig deeper into the why not just the what or how."

                "This is an exceptionally strong course with very few weaknesses. From the get-go, you are up on your feet, interacting and collaborating with your classmates. The emphasis on collaboration and group exercises causes rapport to form among the class naturally and quickly. Additionally, the active nature of the class means that it is almost never boring  the four hour class blocks always seemed to pass by quicker than my two hour seminars. I genuinely couldn't wait for class each week  it was an opportunity to play with some of the most interesting and creative people I've encountered at Yale. \"Play\" sounds childish in this context, and in some ways it was  one of David's maxims for the class was \"be stupid\"  but everyone also took what they were doing very seriously and cared very deeply about each and every performance piece they designed and participated in.\r\n\r\nThere are few to no weaknesses I can think of for this class. My only recommendation for improvement would be stricter time slots  the discussion of some tudes would run over the allotted time, causing other tudes to receive less attention and occasionally be delayed for a week.",
                "Strengths: The structure of the course was excellent. I enjoyed learning to work with sticks as an introduction to Etude-making with my particular classmates. We could simultaneously bond as a group, finish reading\/processing The Master and Margarita, and train our coordination. Then, having a clowning workshop topped off this physical work and gave us a base to work with in improvising together. Focusing the remaining weeks on Etude crafting with Krymov was perfect timing. The final project assignment was really fulfilling.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses I can think of.",
                "Wonderful course. The only thing I wish we had was more set rehearsal time to work on the etudes.",
                "Dmitry Krymov (Dima) is absolutely brilliant and it was a joy to be able to work with him. Because the class was small, we all got to present our work to Dima and get his feedback, so it felt like a more personal experience than it has in the previous class I took where Dima came to work with us. David did a great job in preparing us to work with Dima - we all felt like we had a handle on tudes before he came to class, which was not the case last year. I also loved the text we worked with, the Master and Margarita. It was perfectly chosen for the course."

                "Absolutely! Working with Dima is a transformative experience, and one that you can't miss if you're even the slightest bit interested. The way he brings theater to life is truly inspirational.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone yearning to explore the \"Why\" of theatre-making. How do we make sure we are creating always from a source of authenticity, passion, and questioning, instead of becoming complacent in the 'industry'? It is a remarkably philosophical class as well, and demands a real quality of thought and interpretation, as well as soul! It is only as gratifying as the heart you invest into it. Like most art.",
                "Strongly. Krymov and Professor Chambers taught that we, as theater artists, should know what we are saying or trying to say. We must have some control over our medium. Theater is a place for ideas as well as feelings. It is not good enough for true art to be moving or entertaining or a faithful rendering of a great text.  No. Theater should be held to a higher standard. It should seek the truth that can only be discovered in the theater. Such seriousness of craft allows for irony, theatricality, nuisance, and joy which is hard to find in much theater.",
                "Absolutely. Take a class with David because it will change the way you approach theater as a director, actor, or designer. Along with Dima, he makes me feel optimistic about the possibility of revitalizing theater in an age when it has become incredibly commercial and boring.",
