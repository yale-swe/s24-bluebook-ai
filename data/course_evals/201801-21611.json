    "Learned a lot about music theory and things I did not even know existed in music.",
    "This class provided me with a thorough understanding of basic music theory as well as an introduction to music composition and analysis.",
    "Being able to analyze written music",
    "I obtained a good handle on the basics of music theory and feel confident in reading sheet music. A great starting point for further learning.",
    "I developed a widespread foundation of musical knowledge and have learned the basics of music theory. This course allowed me to hear music differently and appreciate it more by taking my entry level knowledge of music to a much more advanced level."

   "comments": [
    "The class teaches you a lot but sometimes I feel like concepts were pushed that we were not ready for. Luckily grading was never too critical, but there would be times where I would be genuinely lost in class. I think with such a small class a better feel of what the classes pace is at and what level they are at may be more beneficial.",
    "The class moves quickly but is very manageable.  There is a lot of work and assessments, similar to being in a language course.  Those variety of assessments, however, were a large benefit to me, giving me many opportunities to receive a good grade in the class.",
    "Moves too fast sometimes",
    "Teacher was very friendly and open to students. Wish piano had been taught more in the curriculum.",
    "The course was taught well. The curriculum is well-organized. I would have loved to have been taught how to apply the music knowledge and theory on an instrument, namely piano, but I do understand that this is not necessary to understand what was taught. The homework assignments are time consuming and sometimes repetitive, but that is what it takes for the knowledge to really become habit when the course length is one semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you want to learn the real science behind music this is the course for you. It's much more than singing a few songs and messing around. Almost like learning a new language. The language of music.",
    "If you have any interest in music theory, despite your level of prior knowledge, this course is a great jumping off point for music at Yale.  It is a lot of work and should not be taken as a gut.  That being said, it is not incredibly difficult to succeed.  You just need to find the material interesting, as it is a time-consuming course.",
    "Yes, especially to anybody with any interest in music. One of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who has little knowledge about how music works but wants to change that. I would definitely advise against taking it if you are just looking for an easy credit without having to apply yourself."
