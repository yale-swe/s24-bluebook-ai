This includes topics ranging from the electrochemistry governing neuronal synapses and action potentials, to the nervous circuitry contributing to motor control and learning."

                "Its a little quick and the material is unbalanced as far as how much is taught per week. Perhaps it might benefit from a little more top-down organization and structure.",
                "The strengths of the class are the broad range of topics covered. It could be improved with more student interaction, as opposed to only lecturing.",
                "One strength of this course is that the handouts were very well written and detailed and explained complex information that we learned in class. Another strength is that lectures were very engaging, and I enjoyed not only going over the discoveries, but also the logic behind different experiments. One weakness is that while I really appreciated the extra hour long discussion section, I think I would have benefited from it more if it wasn't right after our Monday lecture. This would have given me a bit more time to digest the information and formulate questions.",
                "The strengths of the course are that the material is very interesting, and goes into fine detail about how exactly the biological processes work, and there is always something new to learn in every class. Additionally, Professor Keshishian's handouts are extremely helpful for understanding the difficult material. However, the exam structure of the course is not preferable, as the entire grade consists of only three exams, for which the class structure provides little to no dedicated resources. I believe that a great improvement would be to provide practice problems for both midterms as well as the final exam, rather than just the first midterm."

Additionally, instead of using rote memorization, we drew connections because the mechanisms of each signaling pathway to make them more understandable.",
                "I would recommend this class to neuroscience majors, as it is required and provides a lot of insight into neurobiological processes they may not have learned about previously. As for non-neuroscience majors, it depends on the level of interest and exposure to neurobiology concepts. The focus of this course operates at a deeper level of understanding. It may require significant effort to understand the material for those with only the most basic knowledge of the topics."
