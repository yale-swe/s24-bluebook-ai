Professor Thomasson narrates the integration of the cinema into American society as well as its evolution, giving students a look at the key genres, actors, and cinematic elements popularized during the era. Even more so, I enjoyed the close analysis of scenes, learning how cinematography, musical composition, and direction can convey subtextual messages. This class immensely rewarding and you will walk away having grown as a writer and admirer of film.",

In addition to learning about films, I also developed skills in different forms of writing from the interview, the comparative analysis essay, and the thematic analysis essay.",

I was always interested in this topic, but I had never previously gotten a chance to explore it to this extent. This course truly created a dynamic learning environment, which allowed me to engage with the masterpieces from that era.

                "The professor is an absolute genius and every lecture was interesting and fun. The movies are great and I learned so much. No weaknesses.",
                "Camille is a great!! professor -- the lectures are pretty engaging (and watching movie clips in class is very fun) and the feedback she provides on assignments is really helpful. She also cares a lot about her students. I learned a LOT about Hollywood and cinema that I didn't know before (I had never taken a film class before) and I really didn't have that much work for this class. It's also a GREAT writing credit - you just have to write a midterm, a final, and a casual page-long reaction to the movie each week.",
                "This course was amazing. Each lecture was perfectly timed. They never felt rushed and never went over-time. The lectures were engaging and assignments were fun and helped engage me in the content each week. The help offered for this course was great too. I don't see any way it could be improved.",
                "Overall, a very fun and engaging course! Camille makes the lectures very entertaining and often throws in a few fun surprises, such as puzzles or jeopardy games.",
                "Camille is great! The TAs are also all great! Great class for a spring semester senior.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson is the most enthusiastic professor I've ever had. Her love of these films is contagious. I enjoyed the majority of the films and I also loved the fact that we could watch a bonus \"Cinephile Weekend\" film each week for extra credit. We had an assignment where we interviewed an elderly person about their memories of the Classical Era, and this was a meaningful experience for everyone in my section. For the midterm and final essay, you can choose to write about any films you want, which lets you find a topic that is actually interesting to you.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture material can be very detailed, and it's hard to keep track of all the different studios, actors, and directors (but there are no tests so it's fine).",
                "Strengths include upbeat class environment. Engaging material. Weaknesses I would have appreciated submitting 4 film diaries every 4 weeks rather than all at once at the end of the semester. I think it helps keeps the class on track.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson is an absolute powerhouse. She cares more deeply about her students than any other professor I have encountered at Yale, and that's saying a lot. You'll get out what you put in, and if you put your heart into it, she WILL notice and it will be one of the highlights of your semester. Weaknesses: Not sure if this is a weakness for everyone, but you do have to watch a film on your own time every week (sometimes they're 3 hours long!) and you really can't miss a film, so make sure you're committed to that.",
                "Amazing course that was engaging and fun. Learned a lot and work load was manageable. No weaknesses!",
                "Camille is the best professor of all time and cares so much about her students!",
                "So, so engaging; as a senior, the little incentivised participation points/ quizzes (treasure hunts) throughout the semester were literally among the highlights of my time at Yale",
                "Strength: Camille and the Teaching staff. They are all so enthusiastic and I didn't know Zoom lectures could be this engaging. Camille's passion always blows me away, and her lectures are always so enjoyable to attend. The assignments, too, are flexible enough for you to write your personal reflections and incorporate your personal interest. Ariel was so supportive and encouraging, and I really enjoyed going to section too! \r\n\r\nWeakness: honestly, none.",
                "The main strength is Professor Thomasson. Her genuine love of film was infectious and her lectures were so engaging. I cant think of any weaknesses - the class is incredible!",
                "Professor Thomasson is amazing!",
                "All great things. Course is super engaging and fun !!",
                "Great lectures, assignments were fun and not too hard. Discussion could've been more organic and student led but zoom makes that harder.",
                "Only strengths! Very enthusiastic and kind professor, great insights and wonderful films. I liked the jeopardy days and I thought the assignments were well spaced and well designed to be educational.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson an undeniable standout among the Yale faculty [for heavens sakes, give her a ladder faculty position]; frankly, I do not understand why she is not running this entire place already. Seriously, take this class just to witness the spectacular commitment, knowledge, and passion Professor Thomasson brings to an already engaging subject. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a single one.",
                "No weaknesses. This class is absolutely amazing and everyone needs to take it. Lectures are entertaining, office hours are like therapy, and Camille is the best and most understanding professor you will ever have.  It's an all around incredible experience and a great way to get a writing credit if you need one.",

                "Strengths: the teaching staff. Camille is amazing, and all the TAs are so enthusiastic and supportive.",
                "Strengths: professorThomasson is wonderful, and the lectures were delightful to attend. Very engaging and fun\r\nWeakness: slight disconnect between sections and  lectures but it didnt matter that much",
                "The unique lecture style of a documentary style narrative was quite riveting. Another strength was the professor's encouragement for students to participate during lecture via chat, which greatly increase engagement with the material. The review games were also helpful in encouraging participation and measuring mastery of the content. An additional strength lies in allowing students to select their own midterm/final paper topics, which allows students to explore their own interests as it pertains to classical Hollywood narratives.",
                "Professor Thomasson and the TFs are a gift to the class. Every lecture felt like a story being woven and articulated to us. The assignments were fun and allowed us to explore the topics we were interested in. It was an accessible class for people of all backgrounds and interests.",
                "This was one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale. Professor Thomasson was incredibly engaging in lecture and I learned to think critically about all the films that we covered in the course.",
                "This course is really well done, there is a good mix of interactive elements even though it is a large lecture. The films are well-taught and each lecture is very well thought out.",
                "Strengths: Professor Thomasson is easily the most engaging lecturer I have had at Yale; the selection of films is incredibly diverse in terms of genre and themes; we got to practice many different forms of writing; the workload is very manageable and Professor Thomasson is always clear about what she expects; Professor Thomasson genuinely cares so much about her students and is always trying to make things more fun with Jeopardy games and treasure hunts; lots of extra credit opportunities! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NONE! This course was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and I would not change a single thing about it.",
                "I believe that the course is very strong as it is. Perhaps it could be improved even further if it incorporated more works featuring BIPOC, women directors, etc. Even though the course covers these topics as well, I would have loved to have seen them even more.",
                "Strengths utterly awesome course content. So fun and engaging many thanks to Professor Thomasson's stellar presentation of it all!\r\nWeaknesses none."

                "Many events, like live in-person screenings and team jeopardy were moved online/ remote, and they were still successful in this semester.",
                "It is clear that Professor Thomasson really put a lot of thought into how to maintain engagement despite the virtual format. I thought the use of the chat feature to answer questions throughout the class was a good idea, since not everyone is comfortable with speaking through the microphone. Also, sometimes we would role play skits or Professor Thomasson would make special mention of students who participated in extra credit assignments, which really encouraged me to push myself more! The Jeopardy games were also great, and I personally love that Professor Thomasson lectures like she's telling a story.",
                "I believe that the course involved practices that worked well despite the pandemic restrictions. There were some disadvantages such as virtual chats instead of the live discussions we would have had in normal years instead. Contrary to this, I believe that the virtual call allowed us to be immersed in the in-class screenings without getting distracted.",

It was so nice to watch films that I might not have had exposure to otherwise (like Casablanca or Roman Holiday) and get course credit!! There was also a good number of extra credit opportunities.",
                "YES! This course was THE BEST I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. It was fun, engaging and I gained a love for classic Hollywood films I never know I could have! Camille is wonderful. She is an amazing lecturer and truly cares about her students and the subject and I felt that even from doing the class online from my bedroom. The workload is totally manageable and even as a STEM major I had a lot of fun writing the papers because you were given so much creative freedom to explore something that truly interested you! Each week I looked forward to watching the new film and section where we got the chance to talk about. I couldn't get enough of this course and raved about it to literally anyone I could.

She manages to present a huge amount of information about the Classical Era through lectures that include lots of interesting film clips. I really knew nothing about older films before taking this class, and I learned a ton! I wasn't sure if I would like black and white films, but I found them to be very engaging and watching them felt more like entertainment than work. I liked how flexible and unique the writing assignments were in this course. Instead of just having a bunch of traditional essays, we had two essays, a film diary, and a movie memory interview. This adds up to a lot of writing, though. The film diary, which you work on each week of the semester, is about 13 pages single-spaced. This course would be best for someone who likes movies and doesn't mind writing about them.",
                "Absolutely. Take it if at all possible.",
                "Yes, absolutely! This is a phenomenal course. I took it because of the extraordinary CourseTable ratings and it really lives up to the hype. It's fun and engaging, and Professor Thomasson wants everyone to have a personally meaningful experience exploring these films. And you will, if you put in a little bit of effort!",

                "I would 100% recommend this course to other students (as an extra class, not as a major class). I learned a great deal and the movies were fantastic.",
                "As a senior, this course is a MUST take. It was the absolute best.",
                "Yes. This class was the highlight of my semester and I enjoyed writing the weekly entries. Camille takes the time to read all of them and write to you about her thoughts on your reflections, which I just appreciate so much. PLEASE take this class.",
                "Absolutely! I learned a lot about films and my writing skills really improved.",
                "Yes, professor is great!",
                "Yes!! Amazing course. Super fun",
                "Absolutely, Prof is great and class is interesting",
                "Yes absolutely. I would take it again if I could! Lecture, section and films all brightened my days. Even enjoyed writing the papers",
                "This class cured my depression.",
                "This is such a fun class! Professor Thomasson is so kind and dedicated to making the class a real community. Her lectures are electrifying. The films are really good... even if you don't take the class you should go watch Top Hat. It's the most delightful musical comedy I've ever seen.",
                "Yes!! Amazing class and fantastic WR credit, I'm so glad I took it.",
                "Yes! A must take and a great WR credit",
                "Yes, would highly recommend this course to students of all majors who are even the slightest bit interested in films/classical narratives. This course provides a great introduction to Hollywood films and leaves students with a greater appreciation for human creativity, ingenuity, and culture in general.",
                "I would absolutely recommend to take this course no matter what your background is. You learn so much about classical Hollywood and become aware of the ways in which it influences modern culture. The films are fun to watch, and the assignments are enjoyable.",
                "Yes! It was an absolute joy watching all of these classic films and learning more about the history of Hollywood.",
                "Yes! For any one who loves movies, this is a great chance to watch a lot of classics that you've probably never even seen before. The lectures are always really engaging and fun.",
                "ABSOLUTELY!!! I hope that anyone who even has the slightest interest in films in general will give this course a chance. This is easily one of my favorite courses at Yale, and I came in with absolutely no technical knowledge of films or classical Hollywood. Professor Thomasson is such a fun professor, and she genuinely cares so much about this class and her students. She really wants everyone to succeed, and you have so much freedom with which topics you can explore on your papers so there is really something for everyone. I truly cannot emphasize enough how amazing, knowledgable, passionate, and caring Professor Thomasson is. As long as you have the interest and the dedication, then I guarantee that you will love this course and come out with a great grade. The workload for the course is pretty minimal (usually just a few articles, one movie, and one short diary entry a week) aside from the midterm and final papers. I can also say that I really took pride in every single piece of writing I submitted, which is always a great feeling. The discussion sections are also super chill and feel like getting together with friends, and the TFs are amazing resources. In summary, please take this course, you will not regret it!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anybody who is interested in film and the history of Hollywood.",
                "Yes absolutely. It is a fun WR credit and Professor Thomasson is great! If you like film or are looking for a good WR this is a wonderful course.",
                "110% yes! Couldn't recommend it enough. Definitely one of my favorites at Yale, if not my absolute favorite. The movies are amazing, and so is the organization of the course on the whole."
