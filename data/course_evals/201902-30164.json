   "comments": [
    "Quicker feedback on assignments would have been better",
    "The biggest thing that could improve this class is, if it continues to be online, increasing engagement and supplemental resources where the textbook alone is insufficient. Too often, it felt like working through a (not excessively user-friendly) textbook more or less alone, occasionally watching videos and leaving a trail of feedback, always a little too late to be very helpful.",
    "We are in a good pace, cannot believe I can read some French after 6 weeks.",
    "There were often spelling mistakes in the French texts of powerpoints and homework assignments which, given that this was a language translation course, increased the difficulty in an unnecessary way. Feedback was often delayed by two weeks or more or not given at all, including a lack of feedback on the midterm before the final exam was due. This seems unacceptable given that this is a course with assignments every weekday.",
    "Perhaps more opportunity to read outside of the textbook especially in the last week",
    "Strengths: flexible working\/learning hours, clarity of videos, great textbook.\r\nCons: delays in grading and feedback, which began mid-semester. I made repetitive mistakes because I did not have feedback in time.",
    "The course was organized, and the textbook was very helpful."

    "Yes. It is self-paced and the assignments push one to do all the readings and to learn the grammar",
    "Yes",
    "This course was, however, extremely helpful in improving my translation skills.",
    "Yes, especially for the fact that the course forces you to study in terms of timing",
    "Yes. It was a good way to brush up on language skills which are necessary for us as PhD students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, because it was a convenient way to fulfill the language requirement, and I noticed myself making a lot of progress from the beginning to the end of the course."
