                "Strengths: Presentations and instruction. Kind professors and TAs and culture exposure\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of grammar instruction at times. However, Vietnamese grammar is extremely simple, so not a barrier at all.",
                "Strengths: I think this course definitely helped me solidify my knowledge and understanding of my current vocabulary. The environment was never rushed, and I was always given more time to complete an assignment if I asked for it. This made me able to learn at my own pace, and I was able to enjoy learning Vietnamese language rather than have it feel like a chore.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the classes would be very unstructured, and I often would not know what we were doing in class the day of because the lesson plan keeps switching around. This made prepping for the class extremely hard.",
                "Strengths: presentation assignments to work on speaking, the small class size, friendly and understanding professor and TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: length of homework packets (I think they'd be more effective as small assignments due every day, because even though that's how they were intended to be done, without a deadline it was really easy to put off and then get overwhelmed), and slight disorganization (sometimes homeworks would be re-posted several times and we would all be doing different versions of the homework packet and not know we were doing extra or not enough work)"

However, I would have definitely liked if there were a live whiteboard around because I know in person Professor Van would write things out on the board so we can visualize the term and remember it, but on our live sessions, everything is just spoken--which is not as productive for me because I am a visual learner.",
                "I appreciated the short quizzes, as I felt like they tested our comprehension of the material pretty well, but I wish they had been done on Fridays instead of Thursdays to give us an extra day with the material. It often felt like quizzes were based entirely on the material from the day before, so having an extra day to process would be nice. I really enjoyed the few chances we had to meet in person, particularly eating out together and even the few times we were able to informally meet with our classmates and c Th were really great."

Even if you are not Vietnamese, Prof Quang makes the Viet language and culture approachable to everyone. The workload can sometimes add up, but I think it is much less compared to other languages here at Yale. Plus Prof Quang truly wants you to understand and learn, so it is not a stressful environment at all.",

I never thought I'd be taking a Vietnamese class in college, but I'm so glad I did as it's really helped me connect with my culture and my family and even if you aren't Vietnamese, the class environment is great and it's such a fun and chill language course. I couldn't have asked for more."
