One weakness is the amount of material. It was difficult to recall all the examples from a particular topic and so the future, fewer examples might be more helpful so that students could spend more time on the most important reactions."

The material is well organized, but students should be prepared to prioritize studying the material for 5 weeks because the course is extremely demanding with the shortened semester."
