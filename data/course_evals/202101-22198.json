                "Selecting different material. To be sure, many of the thinkers we read were formidable and offered impressive theories. But philosophers like Conway & Ryle were just... uninteresting. Even the lectures struggled to make them exciting. Cutting away excesses like these may make the class more engaging.",
                "Philosophy is an amazing class!  I was able to fledge out my argumentative wings much more this semester and make friendships with everyone from Descartes to Kant.",
                "I found it helpful when the professor guided the discussion and went over the text more slowly. I think one way that the class could improve is if it has reading questions to focus the reading.",
                "DRST 004 has a refined and well-considered approach to understanding complex and difficult readings. We often had more reading than we could feasibly discuss in seminar, particularly with Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. The course would be improved by removing Ryle and giving an extra class on Murdoch.",
                "The DS curriculum this semester was great with a lot of diverse and interesting thinkersalthough I thought Hegel and Nietzsche would have been cool to read in philosophy instead of H&P...The course of was on Zoom so that was an obvious weakness but Professor Kronman and his feedback on papers were amazing. Even on Zoom, he kept class interesting.",
                "Like all courses taught over zoom, it was sometimes difficult to engage with the class. I'm hesitant to list specific criticisms because I feel like most of them would be addressed by the class being taught in person. The seminars were illuminating and enjoyable. If anything, I would have liked to have more of a discussion of KantProf. Kronman mostly lectured about his work, which was useful, but more difficult to retain than regular discussion.",
                "I think this was a strong and enjoyable course. It claims it will provide a survey of western philosophical thought and does precisely that. My understanding of philosophy and how to write and think about philosophy has been greatly improved due to this course.",
                "The syllabus is excellent and class conversation generally was stimulating. The discussion was much too guided however."

Dive into epistemology, explore ontology. Ethics are cool, but we all already have ideas of whats right and wrong. Solutions to the mind-body problem, though... now THAT is contentious.",

My classmates were more comfortable and confident in seminar, and the readings were more interesting and relevant. Having the first semester as foundation helped reveal the interconnectedness of the DS philosophical canon, and DRST 004 gives satisfying completion.",
                "Yes. Philosophy with Professor Kronman was a difficult, but awesome experience. DS Philosophy is going to be hard (Kant!!) but Professor Kronman is an expert and his ability to explain things clearly and interestingly is unparalleled.",
                "Yes definitely! Honestly this course and many of the concepts introduced by 19th and 20th century authors revived my interest in philosophy. Even the ancient philosophy I had disagreed with previously became more interesting because it became presented as a school of thought in dialogue with modern philosophy, rather than an overbearing, unquestioned canon.",
                "Yes, I would recommend directed studies without hesitation. The spring philosophy section provides deep and compelling insight into many of the most famous and influential answers to important questions regarding thought, space, time, morality, and more.",
                "The workload is not for everyone and you need to carefully consider whether you want to spend over an hour every day reading dense philosophical texts sometimes without much thanks. But if you're willing to commit to it, you get a pretty useful vocabulary of ideas along with a sharpened sense for logical reasoning."
