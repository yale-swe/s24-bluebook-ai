                "The course was a good introduction to the field of pragmatics. I learned a lot about the history of the field and its connections to semantics and other subfields of linguistics. I also learned to appreciate the philosophy side of pragmatics and I got better at reading philosophical literature.",
                "We were given an extensive overview of speech acts, presupposition, implicature, experimental pragmatics, etc. from an amazing professor!",
                "I learned about the use of language in context and different types of meanings that are contained in any utterance- presuppositions, implicatures, etc. We talked about the interaction\/overlap between semantics and pragmatics, conversational maxims and how we intend and comprehend utterances, and different types of speech acts.",
                "This course offered a fantastic insight into the relationship between language and its usage. The central topic of this course was meaning in language and how it relates to both context and speaker intentions. The course was broadly divided into three sections: Speech acts, presupposition, and implicature. Speech acts are rituals like naming, marriage, inauguration, agreement, and other instances of linguistic meaning that change the world instead of communicating information. A presupposition is a condition that both speaker and hearer must believe to be true before a particular assertion can be made. An implicature is meaning that is beyond the literal sense of what is said. Throughout this course, we developed philosophical and cognitive pictures of the use of language to mean more than what is said.",
                "Some linguistics, a notion of what pragmatics is (not triviail!), and some of the fields in pragmatics.",
                "how context affects language and what we take for granted in speech: the underlying theory of speech acts, presupposition, implication, and reference. some fun stuff about what constitutes lies and truth!",
                "This course teaches you a lot about the unsaid parts of language, at the crossroads between linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy. Not only was this helpful for me academically--for instance, learning how papers are written in those fields--but I also now use these things in my daily life, such as how to reiterate something to someone, and how to be more direct.",
                "Lots of pragmatic insights!",
                "I developed knowledge on the path of the study of pragmatics as well as perspectives on current topics in pragmatics.",
                "As someone with no linguistics background, this was a fascinating introduction to the more \"interesting\" aspects of linguistics. It was fine to follow for the most part, although sometimes the discussions delved pretty far into terminology or notation that I was totally unfamiliar with. This course has changed the way I think about language, I keep finding myself thinking about it in my daily conversations.",
                "We covered speech acts, presupposition, implicature, the distinction between what is said\/what is implicated, and reference. By the end of the course, I felt like I had really been initiated into the scholarly world of pragmatics, with all of its recurring heuristics, major figures, disputes, and potentially fallacious assumptions. I became able to read and interpret work at the boundary between linguistics and philosophy of language, and even write my own."

                "This was a really well-designed and well-taught course. Josh is a fantastic lecturer -- he is engaging, thorough, flexible, and thoughtful. Additionally, the curriculum was well-paced. It felt a bit slow at times, but it was actually kind of nice to be able to sit with some of the concepts for a while. It was a really nice course, and it was a nice introduction to pragmatics.",
                "This course is one of those rare gems at Yale. Professor Phillips made pretty dense material super accessible and his lectures were always insightful and thorough.",
                "It was really well-taught and well-organized for student learning. I thought it was a good amount of material for the time we had to teach it. The material was interesting, and I liked the instructors- they were very flexible with due dates and the like. I don't really know if there are weaknesses, but I think it would have been nice as a smaller course with more discussion, which I think is how the course was taught in years past.",
                "This course covered interesting material highly applicable to linguistics, cognitive science, logic, and legal philosophy. The material was at the intersection of cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy, and as such helped to develop a broad set of skills. This is the only course I have taken which had both problem sets and essays. It was a great opportunity to get practice reading and synthesizing philosophy papers, and to get a broad overview of topics in both philosophy and linguistics. I think the only weakness of this course was the volume of material covered in lectures. The slides that were presented in class were often too long to get through in one class period, and when we did get through them, each slide was covered so quickly that I often was not able to take thorough notes.",
                "Feedback on submitted work could be improved.",
                "strengths: not much work, enjoyable lectures (and really gorgeous slides)  \r\nweaknesses: felt a bit disorganized in the beginning but as a result the instructor\/ta were very flexible about deadlines",
                "Strengths: very engaging and interesting course material, reasonable workload, friendly atmosphere\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: assumes some basic knowledge in linguistics and philosophy, but it's easy to catch up!",
                "Less scope more depth into topics",
                "This course is so full of content that any student wishing to learn about pragmatics is sure to gain a better perspective on the topic. The course though could be improved possibly by providing even a 1-class overview of the field of pragmatics more broadly to put the rest of the course in perspective. The first few weeks felt awfully disorienting as someone without linguistics background and this would've been very much appreciated. I also would have appreciated a somewhat more organized approach to when to do certain readings in more advance than a week before. Additionally, more check-ins would have been helpful rather than bi- to tri- weekly psets (or at least perhaps provide answer keys to the questions in the textbook) to help less experienced students have benchmarks to ensure they're understanding the problems.\r\nSometimes lectures seemed a little wayward",
                "Fascinating content, well presented. The course ended up being very much a lecture course, and I think it really wanted to be a seminar. The format could sometimes get repetitive.",
                "The course was a slightly chaotic but therefore immensely fun journey through pragmatics. There were a sizeable number of graduate students and lots of opportunities (optional discussion board questions, readings assigned as \"here's five different articles, check out some of them before next class\") for getting as engaged as you wanted. The only weakness might be that, despite Semantics not being a prerequisite, there was some expectation - if only because pragmatics is a field that originated in\/responds heavily to semantics - that students were familiar with the basics of propositions and logic."

                "Definitely. If you're interested in pragmatics at all, this is the class to take. You'll learn a lot of interesting theories about how we communicate, and there are some great real-world applications.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I found it to be an interesting introduction to the area of pragmatics and it was accessible to students with all levels of experience with linguistics. Josh explained concepts clearly and in an engaging manner.",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, whether they have never before taken an introductory course linguistics or have even a remote interest in the field of pragmatics",
                "Yes! You learn a lot, but the course isn't too work-intensive outside of going to class- the readings aren't too bad and there are very few assignments. I think the material would be really interesting for anyone, regardless of the amount of background you have in linguistics\/philosophy- you're not expected to know a ton of information at the start, and there was a good mix of upper-level linguistics students and people who didn't know much going in.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone with previous experience in linguistics or philosophy. It was possible and still enjoyable for me to come into this course without having previously taken philosophy or linguistics, but I felt that a lot of information and a flurry of academic papers were difficult to wade through without having previous experience. I also did not feel confident enough in my understanding of the material to comment or answer questions in class to the extend I would have liked. That being said, I learned a ton from this course, and I am very happy to have taken it.",
                "I would not. The professor is good and interesting, but try as it may the theory of linguistics (and particularly pragmatics) is stabbing at the dark, trying to find some way of explaining how language works in context without ever making any headway. The few concrete tools it comes up with are hardly given mention in the class, and a thorough discussion of the field is buried behind decades of theory revised and revised and revised until even the foundations are shown to be unjustified.",
                "If youre looking for an intro into the linguistics major, this isnt exactly the best course. The material of the course is too high brow and far from practical. Dont get me wrong, its interesting, and a ling major would def love this course. But its not for all.",
                "Yes! I had fun and learned a lot.",
                "yes! i think if youre interested in philosophy of language or how conversations and human interactions work, this is a really fun class to take. there are a lot of things we take for granted in language, and it was interesting to be able to put a name to all these phenomena and pose questions about how language operates",
                "Absolutely! It's useful not just from an academic perspective, but it teaches useful things about communication that I use every day. If someone doesn't understand what I'm saying, I can figure out how I'm complicating it and how I can be more direct.",
                "Yes",
                "Fascinating content, but grades were pretty unpredictable. It's definitely not a gut, but it's a very manageable workload and you can get away with skimming readings pretty broadly (though I often found myself reading them anyways, just for interest).",
                "Strongly! A surprising number of non-linguistics-majors took the course and all seemed to enjoy it greatly. What was most special, in my opinion, was that it was an introduction to a subfield that is really still in the middle of active development, even of its very fundamental principles. It became clear over the course of the semester that so much of what we were being introduced to was various philosophers of language\/semanticians\/pragmaticians just throwing new terms and definitions at the wall to see if they stuck - and the course made it feel like we, too, could be part of this great sandbox experiment. Josh (Prof. Phillips??) was so instrumental to creating this atmosphere, displaying unparalleled earnest excitement for the content and sending us (both the whole class and individually) lists of literature to check out on any topic we were interested in. The material was certainly confusing and chaotic at times, and I think I ended the course thinking that a lot of existing pragmatic theory was misguided in various ways. But feeling like I could articulate my disputes and imagine what better approaches I would take was possibly one of the most intellectually rewarding experiences I've had yet."
