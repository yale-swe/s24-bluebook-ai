I wish they had a separate course that was geared towards practical applications of the language, focused on speaking fluidly, that someone like me, who is interested in learning Spanish solely to interact with patients when I am a doctor and be able to communicate in a Spanish-speaking country.",
    "The organization of the course is very clear in the syllabus, and the constant Spanish conversation in class helps grow language skill. The breadth of the grammar topics\/vocab covered on exams, however, sometimes made it difficult to effectively study.",
    "All taught in Spanish which is great, but lessons weren't always fun\/exciting.",

    "Very helpful with grammar and vocabulary. Very tough class though.",

Your time and efforts would be better spent elsewhere (especially if you're just looking to fill your Language requirement).",
