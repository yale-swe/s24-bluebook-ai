Starting with Peano's axioms, I learned the construction of the naturals, followed by the integers, followed by the rationals, and then the reals. I then learned how we rigorously prove the foundational results that led to differentiation and integration.",

Along the way, I learned new proof techniques. All in all, an essential beginning to proof-based math (though quite an advanced beginning course).",

                "The course had great teaching and fantastic ULAs, a high but manageable workload, and very fair exams. It was rewarding to take and I really felt like I was learning a lot each week. A weakness is definitely the pace of the course-- it was extremely fast, and each lecture felt a little bit like high speed time travel. I understand there was a lot of content to cover but the course would definitely be improved by slowing the pace slightly. Also would have appreciated better feedback on homework submissions (exam feedback was usually good though)",
                "Long, hard homeworks, which were helpful but strictly graded. The slow build-up, with heavy early emphasis on basic logical foundations of real analysis, proved tremendously helpful. Lectures were fast-paced but mostly accessible, and professor was highly available to students throughout the semester. A fair and transparent grading structure that encouraged cooperation between students, not competition. Lectures didn't always correspond to particular textbook chapters, since we used multiple books with varying levels of detail.",
                "The pacing was great, the homeworks were fun, and I loved Francos lecture style.",
                "Strengths: Thorough overview of real analysis.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes lectures went too quick and were difficult to follow. There was not a primary textbook used to clarify information and follow along.",
                "Weaknesses:\r\n- Terrible terrible terrible organization. Office hours were constantly cancelled the same day of the office hour. It wasn't clear which problems came in the exams or when and where the office hours will be held. This really made the experience much harder.\r\n- The ULAs did not have good answers to the problems. In many cases they did not know what to answer to certain questions.\r\n\r\nIt can be improved by having a lecturer as the professor and by adding a GOOD teaching fellow.",
                "MATH 255 is marketed as an \"intro\" proofs class, though this iteration of this course was quite dense. I think more practice with proof techniques and the language of proofs would've been helpful. Also, there was just SO much material. You're essentially building calculus from the ground up, but I think the course could've benefitted from less content - it is supposed to be a gentle introduction to proofs, but I feel like most people already came up with some working knowledge of proof-based math. I struggled quite a bit, since 255 was my first proof-based course.\r\n\r\nI also had mixed feelings about the structure of the exams, where each question was a proof we had seen before. Though we knew exactly what to expect, it felt more like a memorization challenge rather than an application of the material. There were A LOT of proofs that were fair game - I'd estimate we'd learn about 15-20 new proofs a week. I think the course gave an advantage to those who had seen this before and, given that this is an introductory course, I would've appreciated a more even playing field.",
                "Generally clear lectures and well-organized. Exams are very fair.",
                "The content is more difficult to grasp than linear algebra, but having a good textbook(s) and following it closely makes a huge difference if you find a specific proof or concept difficult to follow in class.",
                "The pacing of the course felt a bit off with some topics such as elementary logic getting too much of a focus and others like topology and integration feeling a bit rushed."

                "I would recommend this course to another student only if it is required for their major and they are already comfortable with writing proofs and thinking mathematically. Otherwise this course is way too fast-paced and really difficult to follow at times.",

                "If you are a math major, then yes, since this is a core part of mathematics. However, I don't know if I would say the same for non-math majors. This course isn't as \"fun\" as other proof-based classes such as linear algebra, and at times, the rigor of proving everything (even the stuff that seems like second-hand nature) can be tedious and a bit tiresome. Nonetheless, if you are interested in this and are willing to put in the work, this class is great.",
                "Mixed opinions. Franco is a FANTASTIC lecturer - kind, engaging. Truly the highlight of the course. I showed up to every lecture; in part, because he didn't record the lectures, but more so that he clearly loves math and wants to share his joy of math. Office hours with him were always a pleasure; he would break down the steps of each proof and made everything click. As someone who had minimal experience with proof-based math, he truly made sure that I learned the material.\r\n\r\nThat being said, MATH 255 is a LOT of work. I struggled on each PSET and had to go to devote 2-3 hours each week to go to office hours, in addition to the 2-3 hours it took me to actually write the PSET. Midterms and finals were fair, though. I'd say only take this class if you have people to work together with - it can be very isolating.",
