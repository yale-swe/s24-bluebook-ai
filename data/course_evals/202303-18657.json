                "I learned how to play out a statement to its logical implications and what the logical implications of some statements (such as \"the purpose of punishment should be rehabilitation\" or \"punishment should be proportional to pain caused\") might reveal about the statements' relative peril and promise. I did this by reading works on the philosophical justifications of punishment; these works covered retributivism, rehabilitation, incapacitation, deterrence, and moral education. I began thinking about punishment in a much more rigorous way, which did not surprise me; I also began thinking about emotion, morality, and politics in a much more rigorous way, which did surprise me (and pleasantly so). I also learned about the conventions of writing and thought in philosophy (this was my first philosophy class).",
                "This is truly a wonderful course that really helped me improve my reading analysis and conversational skills.",
                "I understood the underlying philosophy guiding the American penal system. Before taking this course, I never questioned why we choose to punish at all and why we do it the way we do--these were things I grew up taking for granted. This course helped me understand these \"whys\" and still left me with many questions to think about. It was a great introduction to an area of political science that has tons of writing dedicated to it. I also never truly acknowledged how messed up the American penal system is until taking the course. Reading statistics and testimonials of prison life makes you question what went wrong that left America with the incarceration system it has now. It also helped me think critically and challenge many notions that might be controversial or unchallenged elsewhere--like the relevance of retribution and emotions in punishing, the idea of capital punishment etc.",
                "An in-depth dive into how theorists view the issue of punishment, its purposes, and its justifications. I came away with a framework of how to consider issues of punishment. \r\n.",
                "I learned the different branches of philosophy of punishment in the western world. I learned how philosophers diverged on how much power the state should have to inflict pain on individuals who break the law (if at all) and the ethical and moral implications of different kinds of punishment in the US today.",
                "I learned so much about theories of punishment; I learned to step away from the practical and challenge my opinions in the theoretical realm, thinking more critically about punishment as a political practice.",

                "Strengths - Readings were manageable and interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Class discussions were often dominated by specific people.",
                "Professor Rosas's emphasis on precision was a central strength of this course: he encouraged us to articulate the specific basis (or lack thereof) of our statements, and this encouragement made us better thinkers (the fact of the encouragement also reflected Professor Rosas's respect for his students). The course's selection of readings is another strengththey led into one another smoothly and played off one another in an electric manner. One weakness may have arisen from random chance: class discussion was dominated by a few students. Everyone in the class was competent, friendly, and respectful; I just think some of us were more confident than others (and again: everyone was truly wonderful and attentive to everyone else; no one was actively trying to dominate the conversation). More cold calling may have remedied the conversational imbalance. It feels somewhat sinister to recommend cold calling, but I would have appreciated it: I always did the reading and often had things to say, but the eagerness of others and my own diffidence made it hard to raise my hand.",
                "I really improved a wide range of my skills. I just wish that the course met more often during the week.",
                "The course is structured well to enable learning. The course material is well-selected, insightful, and interesting. This is a novel topic for most people taking the class, so there is much to learn! The people taking the class engage deeply with the course material and have good, intellectual discussions about the course topics. The discussions\/debates can be intimidating but very insightful to observe and participate in. Professor Rosas also knows a lot about the topic and directs the class well to keep the conversations focused. The readings are >100 pages weekly, which is expected from a high-level political science class. The midterm was fun to attempt, and you have a lot of leeway in deciding what your final paper will cover. Overall, excellent course structure!",
                "I cant think of a single weakness. This was an engaging seminar where ideas were challenged by other class members and Prof. Rosas. The reading was pithy and always engaging. We were lucky to have a great seminar group that engaged with the material forcefully.",
                "The class was organized incredibly well and thoughtfully; the readings built upon one another in such a way as to allow the student to draw from prior weeks and knowledge when engaging with each class's readings. The discussion itself was also terrific and was guided well by the Professor.",
                "best class i've taken at yale as a senior-  \r\nstrengths so many, but prof. rosas does an amazing job with the socratic style seminar especially with more difficult texts. i always walked away with so much more than i had originally picked up from doing my reading myself\r\nweaknesses - wished there was a better diversity of students, same couple of people would end up speaker"

I had read not a lick of philosophy (not a lick!) before taking this course, and I think that made things hard for me. I ended the semester relatively proud of my work, but I had to make some painful and unexpected sacrifices in other areas of my life to get to that point (and, for context, I've never before had to make unexpected or painful sacrifices for a class at Yale). If I had expected and proactively made those sacrifices, though, I could imagine this course dominating my semester in a pleasant, revelatory manner (the course's strength depends, I think, on its ability to push you). Regardless, Professor Rosas's generosity, respect, and dedication made the course worthwhile.",

                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to another student interested in punishment, political philosophy, or just curious about where the origins of their opinions on crime come from. This class will push students to second-guess their own opinions and learn a lot about the history of punishment along the way.",
                "Yes! One of the better courses I have taken at Yale. Especially if you are a political theory student or someone looking to get a taste of that world. The oral reading reaction is also a great means of assessment and something I really enjoyed taking part in.",
                "Yes I would. This is an important course to take.",
                "Yes. This was easily one of the best classes I have taken thus far at Yale. Professor Rosas is an extraordinary leader of discussion and guides conversation in a very fruitful and interesting way. I came into the class thinking I knew a good deal about punishment and was quickly humbled. I would recommend taking this class, whether or not you are familiar with the justice system."
