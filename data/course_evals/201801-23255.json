    "This course taught me a new lense through which to approach the history of art. Instead of thinking about isolated works of art or artists I learned to think about the ways in which objects are contextualized and how they are employed to do different types of cultural work.",
    "You will learn a lot about the history of the formation of collections, and generally collecting, institutionally. This class exposes students to not only western institutions but also looks to non-western sources. I learned a lot about the background to specific museums and the motivations of many of the collectors who built large collections. Further, this class also considers more up-to-date collecting practices like franchise and global museums.",
    "I learned a great deal about this history of collecting and institutions.",
    "This course was a great exploration of object collecting. Much more than simply how museums collect their works.",
    "I learned about collecting practices from the 18th century to present-day. The course covered everything from private collections, artists as collectors, cultural capital, and museums.",
    "I learned a lot about museum collections and how they are formed. I also loved that we were able to travel to different museums in order to compare the ways that different collections were formed. We even got to take a trip to D.C. where we saw the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of African American History and Culture."

    "The readings were, at times, a little dense, but overall very interesting. Considering that this was a WR credit, I don't feel that there was much emphasis on, or feedback to, our writing.",
    "The class was open enough that it allowed you do a deep dive into whatever subject interested you.",
    "Great discussion because its a high level art history course.",
    "I thought this was a great course. Professor Rizvi is a great seminar leader, and the syllabus was great.",
    "I think that the course was well run, and professor Rizvi was always prepared. I don't have too many suggestions for improvement."
