                "I think the senior thesis is great and you learn a lot. I really wish the professors worked with each student on an individual level instead of giving everyone checkpoints. The checkpoints are really good for some people, but they really stressed me out, and I worked on a different timeline than most people. So I wish the checkpoints were created between the individual and the colloquium professor, especially if someone has a disability."
