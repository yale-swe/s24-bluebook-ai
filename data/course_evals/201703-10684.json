    "I learned quite a few different topics that gave me a more clear understanding of what cognitive science is. I also got a sense of what it means to work on a research topic, which helps me feel prepared to do more research in cognitive science, which is probably the most important part of the course.",
    "It was nice learning about a wide range of Cog Sci topics that I otherwise wouldn't have experiences. I also feel like I have a better understanding on CGSC research in general, including current issues and where the research is heading.",
    "This class gave me a deeper understanding of the history and fundamental concepts of cognitive science, in addition to an ability to analyze primary documents in the field.",
    "This seminar covers the foundational works that have impacted cognitive science, in addition to the latest papers and studies in the field. Topics are presented as multifaceted, and discussed productively in class."

    "I really appreciated the extent that Mark went to give us feedback on our reading responses and our papers. It really helped me to take a second look at the topics we were learning in class. \r\nIt's also pretty cool how we were able to link some themes of cognitive science together in so many wide-ranging topics. I think at the best part of the course is that it really helps me feel prepared to study cognitive science.  \r\n\r\nSome of the topics can get dry, especially if you're less interested in it. I also think some of the topics were mishandled because those topics are really a whole field, and it's almost hopeless to try to gain a good understanding of what's going on in a ~100 min discussion and three different readings from the literature. It only merely provides an introduction.",
    "I appreciated that we started the paper early with small deadlines for each component. I'm glad that they weren't hard deadlines because that gave me enough leeway\/wasn't as stressful but still made me get it done at a reasonable time. The discussions were generally pretty solid as Mark is an engaging instructor that moves with the flow of the conversation quite well. I can't really think of any weaknesses besides some of the dry weeks\/readings in terms of content.",
    "The class had very interesting readings and gave a good overview of the field, but discussions sometimes felt forced. I think people didn't really take the readings seriously, leading to discussion that was very opinion based on not based on the readings at times. Perhaps creating a way to make students read the readings more closely or have more constructive contributions to the class would be prudent."

    "I will echo a review I have read about the class, which is that this is such a natural extension of Introduction to Cognitive Science. We ended up going back over some of the topics that Scholl brought up, like evolution, but we went a little more in depth. It's also a great stepping stone for what comes next in a major that can be too broad. At the very least, you get to really decide what parts of cognitive science you like and what parts you don't like. Thus, you get a better understanding for what cognitive science is about, which is something difficult to do because cognitive science is so nascent and it's hard to defend its existence to people who are unfamiliar with it.",
    "Good class that counts for the depth requirement for the major. Only a few readings each week and very reasonable responses, plus a final paper at the end of the semester but other than that, it's a good chance to talk about a variety of topics in CogSci.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're a CGSC major. Not only does it automatically count for the depth requirement, but it's also just incredibly well taught. Mark is an amazing instructor that is nice getting to know before you have him for the junior\/senior colloquiums. He makes the discussions engaging and flow easily even when the content for a certain week was somewhat dry. The workload isn't too bad because the paper is broken down into manageable chunks with soft deadlines. The weekly reading responses are also nice because they can be fairly casual and the readings are usually pretty interesting to read anyways.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants a class with interesting readings or anyone who wants to get to know people in the cogsci major better. I think discussions depend largely on the group of people that end up taking the course, so quality of discussion could vary greatly from one semester to another.",
    "Yes, great way to satisfy one of your cogsci depth requirements"
