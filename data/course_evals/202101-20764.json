Finally, through all of the breakout rooms and projects, I feel so much more fluent and natural in conversation. I feel comfortable holding a long and deep conversation in Korean now.",

Every project is super fun and engaging, my favorite being the story-telling one. What an incredible class.",

                "Strengths: get to do creative projects, learn lots of vocabulary, learn about Korean culture through stories and history. Prof. Lee-Smith is a very approachable and energetic professor who makes learning very engaging and fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class sometimes goes over 11:20, which was not a problem bc of remote learning, but it might be during an in person semester where it takes some time to get to the next class.",
