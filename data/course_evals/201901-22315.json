    "I think the format and facilitation of discussions were great. They really forced people to properly debate and defend positions and interpretations from the text which contribute to better conceptualisation of major debates. Although, i personally would have appreciated if there were at least some short lectures to better tie the different books and concepts we read into a common theme, and to put them in conversation with each other and the field of deontology and ethics as a whole.",
    "This course was a thorough treatment of 3 prominent contemporary ethicists, all of whom fall under the broad category of \"deontology\". Shelly is great, the books are interesting, and the class as a whole was wonderful, so I don't have much feedback to give besides \"keep up the good work.\" But maybe a clearer working definition of \"deontology\" would have been nice (albeit borderline impossible)."
