                "I developed the ability to think more critically about topics that I would have initially resisted. This has been a fantastic course!",
                "I learned about the different styles of jazz as they emerged, the lineage from one style to another, the different schools of thought that accompanied different jazz developments, and the history of blues and jazz music with respect to African American social consciousness and the struggles Black Americans faced in the United States during the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries. We also sought ways of comparing jazz music and its antecedents like ragtime to more contemporary musical genres that stem from the African American tradition such as rap and hip hop. This course highlighted the roles of minorities like women and LGBTQ+ jazz musicians, their erasure, and the roles such musicians played that might not have been considered historically significant by jazz historians.",

                "The course material was very interesting and we got a good overview about the different styles of jazz and their developmental history. There were more writing assignments than I anticipated, but each assignment gave me an opportunity to condense my knowledge about each style of jazz. Unfortunately, there were instances of Zoom fatigue given that the course was a 2 hour segment in the evening, but the professor did occasionally give breaks in the middle.",
                "Interesting survey course, very nice professor, appropriate amount of work\r\nCould be improved with more films",
                "Strengths: Exceptional professor, quick and fair grading, option for regrades, grading policy very transparent, fun + interesting class material (if you enjoy jazz and/or politics), breakout rooms to foster collaboration, professor always open to help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: cold calling - completely understand why it needs to be done, I get it, but personally wasn't a huge fan. professor played slight favorites (ultimately inconsequential), political discussion in breakout rooms is stifling if you're anything but a liberal (and a far left one at that)",
                "Strengths is that the professor is very knwoledgeable about the course, but there is not enough interaction within the class",
                "This course was terrific! It would be wonderful, but it was great just the way the course was!",
                "Strengths: Listening to the various jazz styles, following jazz developments in roughly chronological order after getting a strong foundation of African and African American musical forms. The format of the class with small assignments that accumulate points over the course of the term. Not too much music theory necessary for this class, so it was pretty accessible. The fact that lectures were recorded and posted to canvas for review was helpful, especially for completing some of the writing assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some dated readings, readings that were abstruse and circuitous, some readings that were lengthy and difficult to digest. The pace was pretty non-stop by my estimates. Not a ton of discussion time within the class either.",
                "This course was great for a broad overview of jazz history but was unable to go in depth on many specific artists. In particular, I wish more time were spent learning about female jazz artists.",
                "The strength of this course was the clarity of the professor's lectures; he taught concepts very comprehensively and was also super accommodating and kind to students' needs. The weakness was that, at times, the course lacked cohesion; sometimes we would learn about something tangentially that was never wrapped into the general discussion.",

                "Yes I would recommend it to students who are interested in learning about the different styles of jazz and about how race and gender shaped the evolution of the genre. However, I would give a warning that the course requires a fair amount of writing (an essay due each class, multiple writing responses on the side) and reading, which results in a relatively heavy workload despite meeting only 2 times a week.",
                "Yes! Excellent survey course.",
                "Highly recommend. It is clear that Professor Duffy is a brilliant professor that is highly experienced in the field of jazz and really cares about his students well-being. He is kind and always provides great feedback, is a more than fair grader, and brings up some interesting political questions surrounding the history of jazz. I do not regret taking this class, and really enjoyed it compared to other classes I've taken here.\r\n\r\nBe forewarned that this class does deal a lot with politics, and Yale has its fair share of liberals that swing extremely far left. The class is named \"Jazz, Race, & Gender.\" It felt that sometimes other perspectives which were centrist or honestly even slightly liberal (forget about conservatism) were stifled during class discussion, especially towards the end of the semester. I would be lying if I said that I didn't feel out of place politically during every breakout room. This, however, is largely dependent upon the people in your class (although I can't imagine it would differ significantly from my experience). \r\n\r\nRegardless, Professor Duffy does a great job at trying to make sure that all opinions are adequately represented. Class discussion was largely (but not entirely) representative of all sides. It is only during unmoderated breakout rooms where you have the stereotypical Yale debater aggressively enforce their (factual) opinions on everyone. Also, keep in mind this is bound to happen in any class as politically charged as Jazz, Race & Gender at Yale especially - perhaps even more so in other classes. To be honest if you're anything but extremely liberal at Yale, I'm assuming you've learned by now to keep opinions largely to yourself if you want to avoid conflict. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd definitely still take this class. This is intended to be something to keep in mind, and not a factor when deciding what to take.",
                "Its a lot of work, but if you put in the work, you should be fine. Also, I would not take this class as an easy humanities credit, which is what I did. It has way too much work for that",
                "I would recommend this course! The amount of personal growth that I have experienced since taking this class is amazing! I think more deeply about in-depth topics and look forward to hearing other opinions.",
                "Yes, but only if they were particularly interested in some aspect of the course material beforehand. This doesn't necessarily mean that I would only recommend this class to jazz fanatics, but I would probably only recommend this class to someone who either was passionate about music more broadly and wanted to learn about American music or jazz specifically, or someone who was interested in African American studies or American studies, because there is a lot of history tied into the class (which is something that I genuinely enjoyed and was pleasantly surprised by). Otherwise, I feel like the work could be kind of a slog.",
                "I would recommend this course only to musicians or people who have an interest in jazz. I think that these are the ones who will get the most out of the class.",
                "Yes; you learn a lot about the history of jazz (and get to listen to a lot of music) and the workload is pretty low. If you're looking for a course that delves more into music theory though, this class is not for you, as it ended up being a pure music history class rather than history and theory combined.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you have any interest in music, this course provides a great look both at the music of jazz and factors supporting its development"
