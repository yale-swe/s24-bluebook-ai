                "Strengths: The course syllabus was well-designed to promote student learning and discussion; the course was heavily based on class discussion, which allowed me to learn both from Dr. Freeman and from my classmates. Furthermore, Dr. Freeman is so knowledgable about early national America, Hamilton, Jefferson, dueling, and other topics that the course focuses on, so she had so many fun anecdotes to bring into discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings often feel laborious and because the course was based on discussion, we did not always talk about all the readings that were assigned. But besides that, very few weaknesses!",
                "Strength: Professor Freeman line edits your essays -- unparalleled help with essay writing. Good discussions, Professor Freeman has found the perfect balance of encouraging students to talk but still teaching! Amount of reading was good -- not too much, but gave us stuff to talk about.\r\nWeakness: None!",
                "Strengths: incredibly engaging and kind prof, work with primary sources, right amount of reading each week\r\nWeaknesses: cannot think of a single one",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman was the best part of this course. Her passion for early American history was contagious and she was always extremely encouraging, supportive, and inspiring. The course created a great sense of community in this weird zoom pandemic semester. I thoroughly enjoyed our discussion every week, and my classmates always had wonderful things to say.",
                "strength: professor is incredibly interesting and the discussion was always lively\r\nweakness: lots of reading but never felt like I couldnt manage",
                "Strengths: The quality of conversation fostered by Professor Freeman was phenomenal! At some points, I got so into the conversation that I momentarily forgot we were communicating via Zoom. I also thought the letters Prof Freeman asked us to read consistently surprised me, forcing me to reevaluate my preconceptions about Hamilton, Jefferson, and the elite politicians of this era. Weaknesses: I wish there was a bit less reading assigned while we were writing our research papers, but in the grand scheme of things, this was a small price to pay.",
                "Professor Freeman is incredibly knowledgeable on the subject matter and is a really lovely person to get to know and is definitely a strength. The discussions never were flat or never went silent.",
                "Honestly the course was great. The only thing that might be improved is that sometimes the discussion seems too structured which means it can sometimes be hard for students to get their thoughts in.",
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman is so enthusiastic about the topic material, which was certainly infectious. She is also extremely knowledgable about Hamilton and Jefferson and their time period, so she had a lot of insight to share and was super great at offering clarifying answers or giving us appropriate background when we needed it. Despite that, she very much let us steer the discussion in the direction of whatever topics interested us as a class. The final paper was a cool chance to do a deep dive into whatever topic (related to early national America) that we were interested in. You also get a lot of experience understanding and interpreting primary sources, since all of the readings starting in the fourth week are letters\/documents written by Jefferson and Hamilton. Weaknesses: I actually kind of wish there'd been a bit more consideration of secondary sources and the differing perspectives that they bring. We got Professor Freeman's views on a lot of the primary sources after we offered our own, but I think it could be interesting to loop in other scholars' perspectives somehow, even if it's just reading excerpts of books or essays on the primary sources we're reading. I also think that readings tended to be a bit heavy, and it would've been nice for them to be lighter than they were on weeks when we were expected to do substantial work on the final paper. A neutral point: Components of the final paper (prospectus, rough draft, final draft) were really the only assignments, aside from a short reading response. It's great if you're really into your topic and really into the assignment, but if not, it can be a bit stressful to have to spend so much time on the same topic, and it can feel a bit like you're missing out on opportunities to examine other facets of the course in writing.",
                "The strength of this class is the personal feedback you get on the rough draft, how nice the teacher is, and, if you engage with it better than I did, how interesting the perspective of the material is on a well-known time period (and characters)."

Good discussions, Professor Freeman has found the perfect balance of encouraging students to talk but still teaching! Amount of reading was good -- not too much, but gave us stuff to talk about.",
                "Yes! Professor Freeman is wonderful to learn from and it's so crazy to me that I got to learn from someone who's worked with Lin Manuel-Miranda and Joe Biden (https:\/\/www.axios.com\/biden-historians-meeting-filibuster-0a7d726c-4041-405f-a3ac-c31550c590bc.html). It was really helpful to have a big ol paper to write because Professor Freeman was really invested in helping us with our writing and the lessons for this course are going to be really helpful when I'm writing my thesis. Also, I hadn't taken an American history course since 7th grade and had absolutely no trouble, still got to learn a lot about the period.",
                "Yes! I was never particularly interested in early American history and took this course mainly to fulfill my seminar and pre-industrial requirements, but Professor Freeman made this course so much more than just Hamilton and Jefferson the dead guys. I was inspired by her passion for politics in the 1790s, her expertise in duels, and her immense knowledge about the period in general. If you have never written a college-level 15-page research paper before, this would also be a great first seminar\/research course because Professor Freeman provided great guidance & support throughout the paper writing process and made it a very straight-forward and enjoyable experience.",
                "Yes! Loved this course and you should definitely take if you get the chance.",
                "Take anything that Freeman teaches. Trust me, you won't regret it.",
                "In a heartbeat! The chance to talk with and learn from Professor Freeman is invaluable and the discussions we had in this seminar were some of the best in my Yale career thus far. I am a better historian and better student thanks to this course. It asked me to bring 110% of myself to the classroom and, in the end, left me feeling incredibly proud and fulfilled.",
                "Yes, its a really interesting course and if you pay attention to politics, you always hear about Jefferson and Hamilton. So its nice to actually be informed on them.",
                "Yes-just be advised, most of the course is reading primary sources.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to understand more about the Founding Fathers and the foundations of the United States from the perspective of two prominent leaders at the time. If you're excited by the idea of working with a LOT of primary sources or by spending the full term on a research paper, then this is probably the class for you.",
                "Yes - In light of the glowing reviews for this course, I was a bit disappointed in the weekly seminar, but this may also stem from me engaging with the reading less than I should have because of COVID\/online. I basically would have loved to learn more from Professor Freeman directly because she's so interesting and engaging, but it was a seminar, so it's mostly classmates talking, which may not be a fair complaint. However, one of the primary reasons I took this class was to get to know a great professor and get intensive feedback on my rough draft\/guidance in the research\/writing process, and this class definitely delivers those things and is worth it even just because of that."
