                "This course covered basic lab procedures used in biochemistry research, such as genetic engineering, protein purification, enzymatic assays, and DNA purification. This class also covers how to write a detailed laboratory report at the end of the project.",
                "I learned many lab skills that are very useful in the scientific world. I learned about many techniques that I think will help me in my research endeavors in the future.",
                "In this class, I developed a technical and conceptual familiarity with various laboratory techniques common to biochemistry laboratory research (e.g., blue-white selection, PCR mutagenesis, agar activity assay, etc.). I learned how to analyze my procedures for potential sources of error, and I was able to showcase my conceptual knowledge via a final lab report and accompanying presentation.",
                "I learned how to conduct a project in the laboratory from start to finish, specifically problem-solving and trouble-shooting issues that arose. I learned how to document observations from each lab, noting which observations were important to the overall experiment. A big part of the lab was also learning how to analyze the data that we obtained using various different resources, including computer simulations, all of which are valuable and widely applicable skills. The laboratory skills that we learned are also widely used within biology wet lab research, therefore it was very helpful to build foundational knowledge.",
                "The course largely focuses on the most fundamental and important skills of biological wet lab research, however, the optional meditation and mindfulness sessions also aim to cultivate skills for stress management and the maintenance of mental well-being and happiness."

            "comments": [
                "I liked how each lab built on the previous one and there was a final goal at the end instead of just learning isolated skills. I did find that there was lots of wasted time in the lab, mostly from the lab lectures and group discussions. I think this could have been simplified by having us watch youtube videos as a refresher since most of the material from the lab lectures was covered in previous biochemistry lecture courses or in the lab manual.",
                "The strengths of the course is its organization. You always know what you are going to do that day, and exactly how to do it, so that you can feel prepared. One weakness would be the Labsters which were a bit redundant, but the professors mentioned that the license was expiring anyway so these likely wont be an issue going forward.",
                "This course is strong in that it exposes students to a variety of techniques that may prove useful in future research. The final lab report promotes ownership of the material learned throughout the course, and the focus on two large projects across the entire semester (rather than a new project every week) better simulated the scientific process. This course could be improved by (1) holding lectures in a separate, quieter room (it was often difficult to hear both professors clearly in the lab), (2) replacing Labster activities with educational materials that convey subject matter more concisely, and 3) trimming down discussion or lecture time in each lab to allow for a less compressed procedure.",
                "The strengths of the course included the in-lab support that was provided, the structure of the course as a long project that involved a wide range of skills, and the fact that it was well organized and had a relatively low workload outside of the lab setting, which is how every lab at Yale should be. The lab took up the entire 4 hours typically, but was condensed so that it was not overwhelming outside of this time period. The lab lectures were one of the weaker parts, specifically because they were hard to follow along with and didn't explain the material as well as would have helped. That being said, the group discussions after the lab lectures were very helpful in understanding what was covered during the lecture and I think they were a great aspect of the lab. Another weakness was that a large portion of the grade was based on the one lab report at the end, which meant that we didn't receive any feedback about our writing throughout the course, making the lab report more stressful.",
                "The largest strength of this course is how well it cultivated an workspace which prioritized the students. The optional meditation and mindfulness sessions before each lab and the organization of the course as a lab which set realistic expectations for workload and student engagement served to foster an environment that prioritized student health and well-being above all else. I have no higher praise to give it than that it was a lab which I always looked forwards to attending and never felt the need to stress about. The only weakness of the lab is its positioning within the order of courses to be taken within MCDB and MB&B tracks, as the techniques and skills taught during it are extremely important to be taught early on in a student's academic career, but it is almost impossible to fit the lab into a schedule alongside the introductory biology sequence, which would be when these fundamental techniques would be most impactful."

                "I would recommend this course to another student before beginning biochemistry research. It offers a good foundation for the basic skills, but the skills can also be just as easily learned through independent research.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to go into biological research. The techniques are pretty much the standard of any lab, and will give a huge boost as a newcomer in terms of experience for any lab you apply to.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student looking to gain wet lab experience.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, particularly if they are looking for a lab course that would give them a solid foundational understanding of what working in a lab and lab techniques are like. The workload is very manageable and the in-lab support is wonderful.",
                "Absolutely. Never before have I taken a lab course where the lab was designed so well to cultivate student success. This lab does so without coming at a detriment to student well-being, without imposing a massive time commitment beyond the hours spent in the lab itself, and overall is a truly wonderful experience."
