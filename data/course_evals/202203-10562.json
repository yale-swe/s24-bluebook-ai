Readings are not too lengthy but intellectually stimulatingyou will enjoy them if you are interested in the topic. Reading responses were meant to be brief and pointed which I think is the best way to do reading responses in a seminar. Class discussions didnt get overly repetitive and were interesting til the end of the semester. No weaknesses I can think of.",

I wish that the syllabus didnt move so quickly through topics and we were able to sit with some readings more, but I understand this is a function of the semesters pace.",

                "For sure.",
                "Yes! This is one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. The level of reading is perfect to have people actually do it and engage but still have more than enough material to discuss. Professor Demvroff is amazing at leading discussion and contributing without being overbearing. The ideas discussed are so interesting and you get to go undo the topics at quite a high level. I really recommend this class to anyone with a background in philosophy."
