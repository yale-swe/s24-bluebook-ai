                "Strengths:\r\n- Diverse and well-curated syllabus with multiple surprising connections between readings\r\n- Texts\/excerpts were well-selected to maximize efficient understanding--we read relatively few pages, but gleaned a lot of content from them!\r\n- Syllabus was very accessible and texts were updated\/added with direct links far in advance. We always knew what was coming up and could therefore plan ahead.\r\n- The impulse presentations were fantastic! It's a clever way to engage students differently from simply writing a paper, and we learned a lot about content as well as how to explain it effectively.\r\n- Very helpful and timely announcements\r\n- Lots of intellectual freedom to explore engaging topics in the final paper! I felt supported in deciding on a final paper topic and how to best approach it, yet there was plenty of independent work and research involved.\r\n- Context was always given during the lecture portion of the seminar. I found the presentations incredibly interesting with creative commentaries and wish we had more time to discuss everything!\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I would have liked class discussion to be more organized at times, as there were many digressions which made it sometimes difficult to follow the key concepts and conclusions\r\n- Maybe this is a strength, but students had different levels of past experience with philosophy, so some students understood more philosophical context than others and then other students spent time asking clarifying questions philosophy students would be expected to know. The gravity of this is when non-philosophy students give anecdotal stories as evidence to contradict a claim, which is often only slightly relevant and anyway does not observe a traditional philosophical method of generalizabe concepts, and this was often more confusing to everyone than helpful. On the other hand, however, non-philosophy students had a very kind introduction to the discipline!\r\n- I would have liked to see more engagement and attendance from the graduate students, though that is of no fault to the course or instructor."

                "Absolutely! This is a great first introduction to philosophy since the texts are relatively easy to understand and lots of helpful context is given. The concept of transparency is super relevant to everyday life, and example are drawn from present-day as well as ancient philosophy, so the course spans a wide range of years and traditions, and will yield helpful conclusions which are applicable to one's own life."
