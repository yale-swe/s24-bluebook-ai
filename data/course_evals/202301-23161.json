                "I am an EEB major, and taking this course allowed me to deepen my engagement with non-biology perspectives on climate change solutions. I learned a lot about how the underlying history of ideas like nature and capitalism has informed and shaped the way we engage with the environment on individual, social, and political levels. Great class!!!!!",
                "Think about many climate change issues from humanities perspective",
                "I learned to think critically about climate change and interrogate the cultural, socioeconomic forces that have informed my relationship with nature.",
                "I learned a lot about the history of climate humanities.",
                "I got an in-depth look into the environmental humanities in the context of climate change. I was able to strengthen my critical thinking a lot in this context which was great.",
                "This course is useful for thinking through climate change in a non-scientific perspective. How does our discourse impact how we view climate change and possible solutions? What are some alternative futures imagined in literature? What can we learn from other ways of knowing and incorporate to our future? These are the insights that this course will help you think through. It's also a great course for developing your reading and writing skills -- prof. Lindskog gives great and thorough feedback.",
                "I learned how to ask questions about our most basic assumptions about climate change. I also learned about the crisis from many different perspectives.",
                "I think it'll be difficult for me to read anything in the humanities or climate sciences quite the same way after taking this class. Every week we were exposed to fascinating concepts that shed light on environmental issues from the perspective of the humanities, and humanities issues from an environmental perspective. The theoretical\/historical\/scientific texts we read were always interesting and linked to the literary works that we studied.",
                "Analyzing a topic in depth through discussion, looking at environmental issues through multiple lenses including literature, human rights, indigenous perspective. \r\nVery interesting and some of the discussions will stick with me for many years to come, including the discussion on geoengineering."

                "Fantastic readings-- all of them were interesting and added to the conversation. The professor is great at synthesizing her students' perspectives in discussion and facilitating nuanced conversations. It's hard to BS your way through discussion\/analysis on this one, which is a huge asset and encourages you to do the readings.",
                "Strengths: professor gives very useful feedback\/guidance to help students learn",
                "This was a really eye-opening experience!  We read a wide variety of texts throughout the course and seminars were always interesting, but I would have appreciated more of an emphasis on potential climate solutions during our class discussions.",
                "This course provides a broad survey of climate in the humanities over a long stretch of human history. It is a fairly introductory course, so if you're already familiar with the topics, don't expect to learn anything new. However, the course is set up to bring humanities and science students into the same space and allow everyone to think together, and it's worth taking it for that aspect alone.",
                "Great syllabus! Everything is really well structured.",
                "Strengths: prof. Lindskog, the readings in the syllabus, the courses format allows for thorough discussion and engagement.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not sure.",
                "Strengths - Very clear syllabus, course progression, readings very applicable to course\r\nWeaknesses - hard to get through all topics, might have rushed through some content."

                "Yes! No matter your major, you will get something from taking this course. The different academic and personal backgrounds of all the students make this course meaningful. Highly recommend-- just know you gotta be highly invested to get off the waitlist.",
                "Yes - highly recommend the course to anyone even remotely interested in the topic, or wants to explore something new. I love the variety of topics, and how it touches on the humanities side of topics that are not as prevalant in current discussions surrounding climate change.",
                "Yes!  As our climate worsens, these discussions are more important than ever.  What is it we are saving?  Who decides what to save?  This class challenges you to reexamine your own conceptions of the environment to understand how a more sustainable future encompasses so much more than lowered carbon footprints and greener technologies.",
                "I'd recommend this to STEM students who are interested in exploring the humanities in more depth.",
                "Yes. This class provides a setting for students from various disciplines to come together and share ideas about the current climate controversy. You learn to look into the deeper problems surrounding the climate crisis and, with that, the fundamental issues that drive climate panic. Dr. Lindskog is an excellent teacher. She has shown above and beyond care for her students and their ideas. The readings are curated well and engage a wide range of perspectives.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the environmental humanities as well as people vaguely interested in the environment. It's really important for future policymakers to think through these questions and understanding these issues is as important, if not possibly more, than understanding our current legal frameworks and science. The course is well structured, Prof. Lindskog is great at leading the discussion and is very helpful, and the syllabus is engaging and well-curated.",
                "Yes! It is very difficult to get in, but keep trying! My favorite class at Yale.",
                "Yes, absolutely, regardless of what angle they're coming at the class from. Prof. Lindskog does her best to ensure that there are people in the class from an array of fields (biology\/environmental sciences, humanities, policy) as wide as the readings in the course, and my impression was that everyone in the class benefited from this exposure to different ways of approaching the same problem.",
                "Yes I would highly recommend this course to another student. I was very engaged and felt that I learned. Be aware though that you are not allowed to use electronics."
