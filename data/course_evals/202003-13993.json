                "learned a lot about important tools and methods for studying different aspects of global health",

                "A good overview of GH frameworks for analysis and evaluation such as cost-effectiveness and health assessment technology. It was also helpful to receive insight and guidance about the field as a whole from professor Hecht.",
                "Global Health Financing and about how complex making decisions in global health is",
                "I learned about global health financing in the context of NGOs, cost-effectiveness analyses, and donor funding. We also learned about careers within the global health field.",

                "I learned how to understand and analyze various global health issues from new perspectives, notably health financing, costing, cost-effective analysis, and other assessments. These built upon past skills gained in the GHS program and provided a necessary component of health intervention implementation and evaluation."

                "strengths: student presentations are great, you get to do class with GHS cohort, Professor Hecht is great!\r\n\r\nweaknesses: readings are a lot at times, hard to be engaged with them\/stay on top of them at times",
                "It would be great to focus less on costing and maybe a bit more on issues of ethics, logistics, etc.  Also being able to go in depth in one thing and maybe practicing some of the statistical skills we learn about in class.",
                "Hearing about other students' research was amazing. It was also fantastic to get an overview of the field alongside professor Hecht's genuine care for and support of each student. I think one of the elements that was missing from the course was a critical discussion about global health ethics and all the power dynamics and potentials for harm baked into this work.",
                "Instead of the final paper, I wished that everyone could have worked together on a final project where we got to apply what we learned. The course topics were very interesting but I think we could have gotten more by just discussing one case study in-depth and understand the reasoning behind every decision, rather than try to go over multiple examples (especially since student presentations took up so much time)\r\nOverall, the course was highly engaging and very interesting. Prof Hecht has probably done everything there is to do in global health financing and was very patient in teaching the material.",
                "Strengths: in-depth seminars on cost-effectiveness analyses, histories of NGOs, global health financing, donor funding, health budget management, students got to present on their interests each week.\r\nWeaknesses: could have benefited from a group project to learn more directly from fellow global health scholars, could have had a greater variety of topics discussed each week, guest lecture series to understand global health from different career perspectives.",
                "Overall I enjoyed the discussion format of this course and the prepared lectures. The readings and assignments were also helpful learning opportunities. One way I think the course could have been improved is by having weekly, small discussion responses where we can explore some of what we were thinking about in relation to the readings. (This semester there were occasional discussion responses but I think small, low-stakes weekly discussion responses could have been a good way to get a sense for how people understood the readings before class.)",
                "Strengths: very strong and cohesive group of classmates, and all were engaged. The class also filled a lot of gaps in our past global health curriculum. We covered a lot of different types of activities in class which made the class more exciting. The student presentations were also amazing!\r\nWeaknesses: The class covered a good amount of material that had already been covered in past health studies courses that I had taken. Second, it was at times tough to see how the course material overlapped and fit with each other\/it was hard to fully grasp some topics due to the lack of hands-on experience."
