                "I learned about the celestial coordinate system and how to identify the optimal months to view an astronomical object given its RA and Dec. I learned about the various effects one has to take into account while observing (ex: effects of seeing, atmospheric absorption of infrared wavelengths, etc). I learned how telescopes are designed and the many different types of telescopes and each of their strengths and weaknesses. I learned how CCDs work. I learned how to reduce data. I learned all the steps in the process of astronomical observing, from selecting a target star to observing it in the night sky to reducing the data to finally getting its spectrum and final image.",

                "I learned how python can be used to interpret raw data that is collected through many different astrophysical methods (photometry, spectrometry, etc.). I was also exposed to not only optical astronomy terminology, but also radio astronomy.",
                "how to code for astrophysics research as well as a survey course on astronomical methods",

I learned about some different types of astronomical observations (such as visual photometric, spectroscopic, radio, etc) and the methods used to conduct these types of observations. I also learned how to process data using Python, and how to write a telescope proposal.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the problem sets are pretty easy and you learn a lot about the science behind astronomical observing and data reduction. The spacing out of deadlines for doing the mock telescope proposal was also helpful to prevent us from doing everything last minute (which would've been disastrous for us).\r\nWeaknesses: the professor could be more engaging during lecture and make more of an attempt to make eye contact with the audience rather than look mostly at the slides while teaching.",
                "Many problem sets were focused narrowly on specific skills that would be useful for an astro major, but not necessarily explained or developed upon in an interesting or challenging way. Lectures were a survey of\/introduction to astrophysics topics with some information about coding (strictly what was useful for the psets), and the final project was a good way to dive into a topic you were more interested. The assignments could have been less repetitive and it would have been great to have more active development of our coding skills, not just as a tool for those tasks only.",
                "The homework assignments were very useful in developing the course skills and Python programming",
                "Strengths: Course was formatted to be very interactive and grasp the curiosity of its students very quickly. It definitely expands you knowledge of the coding language python and how it can be used for astronomic data reduction processes. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "only weakness could be slightly more python instruction. I felt behind and lost on how to code sometimes",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting, and it's so cool learning how to take a raw data file and pull real science results out of it. The telescope proposal project is also very cool -- it seemed like it wouldn't be too hard at first, but it was actually really involved, and I learned so much about searching through literature and creating a valid research project. Weaknesses: The only weakness would be that the math was actually a little confusing -- I wish we would've spent more time on the equations, and that we would have done practice problems in class. It wasn't too hard to figure out on my own, but it would have been awesome to do examples together in class.",
                "The strength was the breadth of the topics covered; the class went over a wide range of relevant topics and skills in astronomical research. The weakness was probably the steep learning curve; completing the assignments is difficult without prior coding experience and the course could benefit from some more support and resources for this.",
                "Lectures are reading over slides and not too engaging. Most of the learning happens through the psets which may be difficult if you don't have prior experience coding in Python."

I took it hoping to get an introduction to astrophysics through the lens of coding, but all of the work (aside from the final project) was very constrained to a few particular topics. I'm sure they would be useful\/necessary for continuing in the major, but I was not inspired by either astrophysics or using CS as a tool to do astro\/other scientific research in this course, since the focus was often on details that didn't require much reflection. That being  said, the final project was a great way to pursue your own interests, and if you put effort into it the TAC meeting was rewarding.",
