This course did a phenomenal job of challenging a lot of the preconceptions people tend to have about different types of nationalism or nationalism in specific countries; the course and its readings revealed how our biases impact the way in which we understand or label ethnic conflicts abroad and how we are often ignorant to our own practices of nationalism at home. The course also helped provide more insight into the pros and cons of nationalism, and how it is not necessarily always negative.",

                "Professor Hierro was a huge strength of the course; it's clear that she's incredibly knowledgable and passionate about the topic. Another huge strength was the way in which Professor Hierro included that week's reading responses in each week's discussions; it made it easier to participate and gave everyone an equal opportunity to contribute to the discussion. It also allowed our discussions to focus more on what aspects of the readings interested us most, making our class sessions more engaging. I also found the readings interesting and the reading responses allowed for a lot of flexibility to respond to readings of our choice. There were two short review tests that were very low stakes and a helpful way of reviewing what we had covered so far. We also got a lot of feedback on our work through the course, which really helped during the final paper process. There are no major weaknesses I can think of.",
                "The readings were really interesting but I often left class more confused because information was not organized well for learning and I didnt feel like I was getting anything out of it",
                "weak organization and discussion, course could have been more helpful in guiding students' reading",

                "Yes! It's a great course with an amazing professor. Professor Hierro cares deeply about her students, and nationalism is such a relevant issue in the contemporary world. The course is fairly theory-heavy, but theory is often applied to real world cases. I think the workload is also comparatively the same as other courses. You get feedback on assignments and Professor Hierro is very approachable and can connect you to a lot of resources during the final paper process.",
                "Prof.Hierro is one of the kindest professors at Yale. She really cares for her students (even asked me for an update on my post-booster shot) and is very good about setting up the class to offer feedback and guidance.",
                "I dont think so, I didnt enjoy this course which I was surprised by because I really like learning about nationalism. Class discussions felt tedious at times and really confusing as to what was being asked.",
                "No, I think there are other courses that are a better use of time. I would recommend Hierro's lecture though",
