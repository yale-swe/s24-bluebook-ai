We created continuity charts of fugues using Google Sheets (an interesting way to analyze the macro scale of fugues).

As a result, discussions were enriching and productive. One weakness was that the course was not extremely structured. At times it felt like we were just reading things and discussing them without them being a continuation on what we had discussed previously. Additionally, sometimes we wouldnt have enough time to sufficiently discuss the material we read.",
