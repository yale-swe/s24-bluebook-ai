    "I developed an introductory understanding of thermodynamics and their applicability to solve problems pertaining to chemical engineering.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great professor and TA who are always available to help, interesting content\r\n\r\nWeakness: Online aspect made it hard to fullywork together with others",
    "I would appreciate more focus on examples of the concepts we're learning, but it may just be me",
    "All of the material needed is covered, but with a flipped classroom style, lectures often repeated the same information instead of engaging in practice problems. Both the professor and TA were always open and available for any questions even when not during scheduled office hours.",
    "The problem sets covered a wide range of topics that successfully tested my understanding of the material, and the lectures and videos thoroughly covered all of the important information. The only weakness of the course was that some of the lectures felt repetitive, as the content covered in the lectures was often the same as the content covered in the videos. While it was important to dive deeper into the difficult topics, it would have been helpful to spend a little more time covering example problems in class.",
    "This class was taught in almost all aspects better than Physical Chemistry I, which is also about Thermodynamics. There is arguably less depth to the class (PChem was more theoretical at heart, went into statistical thermodynamics for a bit, and made fewer assumptions\/extended further into some of the assumptions), but it was taught with much greater clarity where you leave the class actually knowing more. If there is anything to improve, it would be about depth: non-idealities were introduced as an aside, and most of the class just focused on monatomic ideal gases. The textbook is also super old, although I have heard that it is a canon in the thermodynamics world.",
    "Strengths: Callen is a great textbook and the provided lecture notes really complemented and summarized the relevant content well; non-cumulative weekly exams made sure exams were not that stressful and manageable\r\nWeaknesses: none"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, only if you're interested in the subject or else the topic may be hard",
    "Yeah if you need it, probably not if you don't. I'm taking it as an elective for ME, so if you are going into normal thermo or coming out of it and need the elective it could be a good choice",
    "I would recommend this course to any engineering major student because of the applicability of the material covered.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student because of the strengths listed in my answer to question 3. I enjoyed the course, and I learned even more than I had hoped to.",
    "Yes but there are not that many people who would consider this class as a non-STEM major.",
    "Yes; it really gave me a solid foundation in thermodynamic theory"
