    "I learned about the history of baseball in the caribbean",
    "literally nothing. This class was pointless and a waste of my time. I definitely regret taking it.",
    "I gained a great understanding of the complex development of baseball in the Caribbean, along with the history of Latin America and American baseball.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history of the Caribbean, and the origins of baseball in the region. Moreover, I have a very strong understanding of Cuban history, and the history of baseball in Cuba. I also learned about the relationships between Cuban players and MLB, and the important figures throughout Caribbean baseball.",
    "A detailed knowledge of the history of the cuban league and the surrounding political climate that influenced its development",
    "I learned the history and origin of baseball in the Caribbean.",
    "I learned about the growth and development of baseball in the caribbean. The effects of sugar on baseball and US soft power were discussed a lot, as well as the Cuban winter league.",
    "Information about the factors involved in the development of baseball in the Caribbean like the impact that the sugar industry and imperialism have had on the game.",
    "This course taught me all about the Caribbean's history of baseball, history around baseball with including both its origins and its affect on daily life, and a lot about the leagues itself. I read a lot about Caribbean baseball and learned about many players who never made it to the major leagues because of skin color or other factors but were still great Caribbean ballplayers. Also, we learned to be very questioning of the history presented, that much of it can often be \"factoids,\" like the fact that Castro NEVER played baseball.",
    "history and geography of the Caribbean, how baseball has changed in the Caribbean over time, how baseball was shaped by revolutions, the Caribbean's relationship to the MLB and the United States, the history of baseball in the Caribbean, similarities and differences between baseball in the Caribbean versus other parts of the world; also improved my writing and critical reading skills",
    "A deep understanding of the history and cultural impact of the sport of baseball in the Caribbean, especially Cuba."

   "comments": [
    "Should have powerpoint slides",
    "It was just a random spew of information that meant absolutely nothing.",
    "The professor could organize his lectures a lot better. Much material was repeated during several lectures.",
    "A little more organization in presenting the information. Additionally, I did not think the final did a good job in representing what we learned in class - I think the final should have focused on Cuba more.",
    "The beginning of the course was a bit unorganized. I wish it had focused more on the interaction between baseball and politics in the 20th century.",
    "This course provided very good information and essay help.",
    "Its really interesting in the first half because there is a lot of information about culture and the development of baseball. However, the second half gets very repetitive. I think better organization could help with this.",
    "The topics within the class were really interesting, but the lectures were not engaging and repetitive.",
    "The material is the strength of this class, the weakness is all the presentation of the material, as there was no clear structure to lecture, or to the homework, which made it very hard to grasp it all and understand exactly what were points of emphasis.",
    "Strengths: Professor Gonzlez Echevarra was very passionate and knowledgeable about the subjects and topics we discussed, he brought a lot of energy to each class and cared deeply about the material.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the class felt unorganized or repetitive (but this was also the first time the class was being taught); readings were sometimes heavy but we didn't always cover all of the readings in class or the lectures felt disconnected from the readings; paper topics sometimes required outside research and felt a little random"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "No. The professor asks you to read a book a week and it was ridiculous.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone that enjoys baseball and is looking to have myths about their understanding of Cuba unraveled. I had never even heard of the Cuban baseball league in this course, even though it has major historical relevance in the history of baseball.",
    "Yes it was a very good writing credit class and very interesting.",
    "Fun if you like baseball. Probably the main reason I enjoyed it.",
    "I would not. I love baseball, but this class was not organized in a way that promoted any real learning.",
    "NO!",
    "I would recommend it to students who REALLY love baseball and that's really it. There's not a lot in this class outside of understand another aspect of the game that many American fans don't really know, but for anyone who doesn't love baseball it'd probably be a taxing and boring class that tends to wander a whole lot without any really focus.",
    "Yes, if you are really interested in baseball and want to learn about its role throughout the history of the Caribbean and how it has become what it is today."
