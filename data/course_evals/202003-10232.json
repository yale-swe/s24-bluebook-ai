                "This class was just a gift. Steph does one of the most difficult and valuable things for an instructor to do: carefully weave together a depth of insight that continually pushes us to add nuance to our ideas while also holding a space of such joy! I think this is one of the best seminars I have taken at Yale and that is because of a combination of Steph, the material we were able to read, and the students in the class.",
                "Strength is the class environment. Weakness is the early time and lack of a break",
                "The reading list for this course is absolutely phenomenal. Steph also had us do smaller research tasks for several (but not all) of the classes. These helped a lot with class engagement and sparked discussion in our seminar meetings. The only weakness is purely logistical: several of the novels we read were challenging to purchase. The bookstore couldn't get them for one reason or another and the library only had a copy or two. This meant that Steph had to photocopy her edition and post the pdf. This was fine, but it often meant that it was impossible to get the book earlier than the week of the class meeting.",
                "This course has only strengths! All members of the seminar engaged fully and discussions were natural, despite the online format.",
                "This course had a very strong syllabus, and the texts were really engaging. I almost wish we had one or two less books on it, so that we could have discussed some of the other novels in more detail than in the time we had.",
                "The class discussions for this course were always insightful and provided me with new ways of understanding the novels we read. From time to time (not often), I'd lose the vein of discussion a bit because of how theoretical it could be.",
                "A full book a week with critical essays during a pandemic was ridiculous. There was simply too much work, and feigning engagement for a 2 hour zoom seminar was near impossible every week. The assigned essays and novels were good, but that means little when its so difficult to finish them for class."

It was so helpful for comments that were related to things people had said previously or for posting links to articles, etc. All of us wished we could have a chat bar in classes meeting in person.",

There is such a powerful tradition in African storytelling that exists in a parallel form of knowledge production that Steph is so brilliant at guiding you towards. And if that isn't argument enough, Steph is just wonderful!",
