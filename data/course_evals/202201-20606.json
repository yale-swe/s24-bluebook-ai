                "In this course, I learned about distinctions in different dimensions of political systems used around the world. We delved into many specific aspects of how democracies work: for instance, the role of parties, electoral institutions, corruption in democracy, as well as democratic backsliding, what causes democratization, and how to measure a country's level of democracy. I gained knowledge about the nuts and bolts of different types of governments (e.g., what an open and closed ballot is, how coalition formation works in parliamentary systems, etc.) as well as the ability to read and critically analyze political science research.",

                "Strengths: Professor De La O is a very clear lecturer, and there are generally clear expectations on the assignments\r\nWeaknesses: it tries to introduce empirical papers, but it doesn't require statistics\/econometrics as a pre-requisite. The course would probably be a lot stronger if everyone had a solid baseline knowledge in regression analysis. You can't go halfway with the empiricism; either require stats and introduce more empirical work, or don't require it and don't assign empirical papers. We spent a lot of time in section going over statistics and game theory that could have been avoided if those classes were required.",
                "I think it could go more into broad concepts and then apply them onto case studies. I sometimes felt like we were getting too specific instead of understanding general concepts first.",
                "From my own experience and from speaking to other students in the class it felt somewhat like the course was a little set up for us to do poorly, at least in the beginning. I think the writing responses were fine although perhaps graded a little harshly for what they were trying to accomplish, but it was truly the pop quizzes that were a journey to figure out. They were extremely not intuitive and asked hyper-specific questions about 60 page readings while also transitioning from closed to open notes and more. It just felt like there was a bit of a learning curve for the class trying to figure out how to handle this quizzes and even though they changed the format several times, I do not believe we are being rewarded for improvement on them which I feel like should be given seeing as the admin of the class took some time to settle into how to give us quizzes, it makes sense to me that our later quizzes would be weighted more heavily. I also think less dense readings, a slower lecture pace, releasing lecture slides before class, allowing us to see what mistakes we made on quizzes, etc. would all be helpful towards promoting learning in the class.",
                "The textbook was very clear, and I enjoyed the readings, however, there was a strong bias toward Latin American politics. If we could have engaged more with other parts of the world, the class could have been more well-rounded. The readings and assignments are thought-provoking but not overly hard.",
                "Strengths: Survey of different country contexts \r\nWeaknesses: Not particularly interesting or engaging in the way the findings\/studies were presented. Little engagement with the countries we looked at.",
                "The course content is very interesting and the readings are quite strong. Sometimes the order we were studying things in felt very strange, but Im honestly not sure how it could be fixed. Is there a natural segue from corruption to civil conflict?",
                "The layout of the course was excellent with a good balance between textbooks and research papers.",
                "Strengths - interesting informative \r\nWeaknesses - sometimes redundant and readings were hard",
                "One strength of the course was its heavy emphasis on interpreting political science research critically. Prof. De La O went into detail on the methods of the studies we were reading and encouraged the class to think about their limitations\/what their regressions did and did not show. I really enjoyed this aspect of the class, and think it will stick with me going forward. \r\n\r\nThe class curriculum was another strength. I found many of the weeks extremely interesting, particularly those covering theories of state formation, the roles of corruption and clientelism in democracy, and whether democracies or autocracies promote more development. Although I also know that some students disliked it, I thought that the APSE textbook was clear and did a good job summarizing research that was relevant to each of the questions that the class addressed. \r\n\r\nA final strength was Prof. De La O's use of specific examples to illustrate concepts that we learned about in class. Prof. De La O frequently provided detailed case studies that did a great job demonstrating what much of what we learned about looked like in practice. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class was the reading quizzes. I did the readings every week and annotated most of them, but even then sometimes had trouble with the reading quizzes because they would ask about parts of the readings that sometimes seemed arbitrary and only vaguely relevant to the theme of that reading\/week. That said, Prof. De La O was lenient about grading the quizzes, and I understand that they were an accountability mechanism that was necessary to make students do the readings. \r\n\r\nAnother slight weakness was the pacing of the lectures. The lectures were quite good overall, but Prof. De La O sometimes rushed through specific slides, making it hard to write everything down. That said, the slides were later posted, so this also wasn't a huge issue.",
                "I really didn't care for this course. I felt like it was disorganized and not engaging. There were pop quizzes, which was fine, except prof. would immediately review the answers to the quizzes in the lecture while going over the reading thoroughly. What was the point in taking the pop quiz if she was going to dissect the readings anyways? To catch us? Some of the readings were interesting, but the lectures were pretty dry.",
                "Good, engaging readings. Lectures sometimes felt like summarizing the readings rather than engaging with them",
                "The lectures felt like a rehash of readings, as opposed to driving further information or interactive discussion. It was also unclear how we should take notes based on the lecture, which also made it easier to lose attention. I would also appreciate more feedback from the coursewe didn't see pop quiz results until somewhat late, for instance.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is that the lectures are essentially summaries of the readings. There were some interesting case studies in the lectures, like when we talked about government formation in Portugal, FARC in Colombia, and Democratic backsliding in Turkey. I would've liked to see more of that, because it kind of feels like a waste of my time to assign me a reading and then summarize it to me. I liked the short written responses. They weren't much work but still required me to think critically."

If you need it for your major then I would not warn you against it, but also if you have other options maybe consider them.",
                "Maybe. If you are interested in exploring a new field of political science, this course may be a good overview of comparative politics. But the level of engagement with actual issues and current questions in different countries is low. Very technical course.",
                "Yes! As long as they are somewhat interested in international politics (not international diplomacythats different).",
                "Yes, I would. The course has a lot of reading involved, but the learning is justified by the effort.",
                "Take it if you have to, otherwise there are probably more interesting and engaging PLSC courses. So PLSC and EP&E majors",
                "Yes! Great introductory political science class.",
                "Yes- if they are just starting to learn about political science this is a good course. Interesting and engaging",
                "I would. I think that the curriculum is quite interesting and that the class addresses questions that seem foundational to the study of political science. It also does a great job teaching you to think more critically about studies within political science, and provided an accessible introduction to research methods in the field. Finally, the workload is reasonable and the grading is fair\/reflective of how much effort you put into the class.",

                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they are a poli sci major, particularly if they are very very intrested in poli sci. I will say, however, I think a lot of my discontent with the course was with how the prof. ran it and what she chose to include and not include. The course would probably be a lot better if prof. De La O wasn't teaching, or if she were more organized.",

If someone needs to take an intro political science course (as I did), I might recommend the IR class (although I don't know if that one is any better)."
