                "I thought the lectures were always very organized and I really enjoyed the material of the course. Also, the exams were very doable, especially with the accommodations that Prof. Herzon gave us. I think there really wasn't much to be improved other than getting more feedback on our quizzes\/exams.",
                "Strengths - Professor Herzon is one of the best professors I have had at Yale and did a wonderful job accommodating student needs in the midst of a stressful and unusual virtual semester.",
                "Strenghts: Prof. Herzon is concerned with making students understand the material in an intuitive way\r\n\r\nWeakness: clearer feedback on the psets would have been helpful",
                "It would be helpful if this class was actually meant to help students learn the material rather than being a weed-out class.",
                "Weaknesses: Some of the exam\/PSET questions were a bit too different (and thus difficult) from the lecture material.",
                "Strengths - weekly PSET\/quizzes helped for practice purpose \r\nWeakness - execution of course content",
                "There is a lot of information that is crammed into one semester.",
                "Great prof",
                "The strengths of the course is how well the professor could explain the hard material.",
                "The strengths were that the lecture notes were so well organized and well taught. I was able to follow along and look back at my notes and know what to study. I also really liked having the weekly group quizzes because they forced me to try to grasp the material. However, I feel like the quizzes were a lot more difficult than the material we learned in class so a lot of times we were no sure if we were doing the work correctly.",
                "The group quizzes on Friday could have been better facilitated. The material on these quizzes also seemed harder\/different from what we learned in class sometimes and required time beyond what was given on Fridays and going to office hours. The class overall was very well taught and I appreciated the live drawings of all of the reactions.",
                "The professor does a great job of explaining concepts in a way that's clear, comprehensive, and easy to understand. While the concepts themselves were difficult, the problem sets and Sapling questions as well as the teaching staff (professor and TAs) helped me get a better grasp of organic chemistry and not feel so intimidated by the large amount of content. I wish we could've had time to learn the later topics of the book (thiols, ethers, etc.), but I'm happy with what I was able to learn. A big weakness of the course was the difficulty of the group problem sets. For a lot of them, we had to wait for a TA to enter the breakout room and give us hints on how to solve the problems, which misses the point of assigning us problems to do in the first place. It would've been so much easier if the problem sets related more directly to the things we learned in lectures.",
                "Group work- people do more wok than others.",
                "The instructor was pretty good at teaching what he taught. The only weakness of the course was that office hours were held directly after class which I could not attend due to overlap with other classes.",
                "Strengths: the quality of content presented by Prof. Herzon as well as the flexibility and strong email communications of the TFs and Prof. Herzon. Another strength was transparency in communication, from office hours to exam changes.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was quality of notes - it was definitely hard to decode tablet handwriting -- just a consequence of virtual classes."

In addition to the recorded lectures allowing me to learn at my own pace, I was able to better absorb the material when the teaching staff shared their screens versus if I had to learn from them writing on chalkboards.
