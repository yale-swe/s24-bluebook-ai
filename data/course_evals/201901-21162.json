    "I gained a very strong foundation for Italian that will serve me in the years to come, if I decide to keep pursuing this language.",
    "I learned Italian!",
    "I learned an incredible amount of Italian in such a short time period. I feel that I can speak fairly fluently and yet I have only studied Italian for one semester. Its amazing how far the class has come in such a short amount of time.",
    "I developed a strong foundation in the grammar and oral practice of the language.",
    "I learned the majority of grammatical structures for a beginner's level of Italian  and a proficiency in speaking.",
    "I learned a good amount of Italian in a short amount of time. We practiced speaking quite a bit during class.",
    "Speak Italian",
    "Lots of focus on speaking and listening. Could focus more on grammar."

   "comments": [
    "My teacher was phenomenal and brought a sense of informality and levity to the class that really made us feel welcome in his classroom. That being said, sometimes the class felt a little slow-paced, and that we really didn't have much to do in the two hour period.",
    "Strengths: Michael is a really fun and engaging teacher. He truly cares about his students a lot and makes an effort to ensure that everyone feels comfortable in the class. He also hosts Italian Table, which is a great way to practice Italian in a low-key setting. He makes learning Italian feel easy and exciting.\r\nWeaknesses: The class is largely self-taught. The homework assigned each night is to learn the material for the quiz the next day, which is a little strange. It makes it so that you end up teaching yourself. It should be swapped - the quizzes should be on the material learned the previous day in class.",
    "The course was very well conducted. One of the biggest strengths it had was how engaging it was. In class we would actively talk in Italian the whole time and go through Italian grammar practices. The class was always very lively and you naturally got very close to everyone in the class. For this reason, another huge strength the class has is its size. With the class being smaller, you got more opportunities to speak and get closer to everyone who all became close friends. \r\nIt was amazing that we were in class for two whole hours every single day, yet the class went by so fast because of how fun it was.",
    "The nature of the course was very lax, which I liked, but it could have been a tad bit less so to encourage more effortful involvement from all students.",
    "This course excelled in the moments of unorganized language practice, when we would sit around or take a walk and engage in Italian conversation. The course struggled in areas of organization, it was often unclear what the assignments were on any given day, and make-up assignments were sometimes not asked for or accepted.",
    "Strengths: professor is fantastic. Weaknesses: It's obviously a lot of work, but you learn a lot and if you're willing to show up everyday and do the work, it's worthwhile.",
    "The course is very involved and does not need much improvement."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If they want to be taught by an incredible teacher and learn a strong foundation for Italian, then I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely.",
    "YES! I absolutely loved this class, it is my favorite class at Yale! Not only did I fall in love with the language and culture but I made so many great friends, that's the advantage of meeting everyday for two hours with such a small class. Micheal is a terrific teacher and has a contagious enthusiasm and passion for Italian. If you are thinking about taking Italian at Yale, definitely take it with Micheal.\r\nI loved the course so much that I decided to change from studying abroad in London to doing the Intermediate Italian Program in Sienna.",
    "yes! the instructor is amazing! this is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Michael Farina is an amazing professor that makes a highly demanding class extremely fun and enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely. Michael teaches the language in a very casual and conversational way, and makes it very easy to pick up. No one is left behind unless they choose to fall behind.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student if they were really interested in the language so much that they were willing to put a lot of time and effort into learning it. A lot of students did end up dropping it because their interests did not match the workload, but the ones who stayed found the course a lot of fun and very fulfilling.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in learning Italian, this is a great course to take.",
    "Yes, especially with Michael Farina as a professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to those looking for a fun way to learn Italian. It is intensive, but Michael is a kind and engaging professor."
