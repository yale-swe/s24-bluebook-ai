    "I learned a lot about Israeli\/Judaic short stories, drama, poetry and journalism, while also improving my active writing and speaking skills.",
    "I learned a lot about influential and\/or typifying pieces of literature in Hebrew and Israeli culture. I expanded my vocabulary. I exercised my creative muscles in the unit projects."

   "comments": [
    "A major strength is our professor. She cares about her students and the content of the course, making it very enjoyable.",
    "A strength of this course is the engagement. I enjoyed being able to converse with my peers in the class. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is the how the homework was given. I felt that homework did not reflect what we did in class. They were mostly grammar based, despite that never being spoken about in class.",
    "Strengths: exposes students to a variety of texts and styles\r\nWeaknesses: classes are often repetitive",
    "I would like there to be more writing guidance.",
    "strengths: engaging discussions with classmates, varied assignments to improve both active and passive knowledge of modern Hebrew, lots of cultural insights\r\nweaknesses: none really, I highly enjoyed this course, maybe it would have been even better to read a longer work in Hebrew rather than merely very short texts",
    "This course is extremely well organized and the students know what to expect from the consistent workload and style of assignments. Engagement with technology is well done. There is breadth and depth to each topic covered. Unit assignments are fun and fitting. I would have appreciated covering more grammar in an organized way."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it allows us to improve our Hebrew writing and comprehension without the stress accompanied by other courses at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they had a genuine interest in Hebrew Writing. If not, it is an unnecessarily difficult way to fulfill a language requirement.",
    "Yes. It is a good Hebrew credit and I feel it significantly improved my reading and writing",
    "Yes, it was very interesting and I read a lot.",
    "Yes, if you are fluent (L5) in Hebrew, I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you do not have experience with creative writing, you should not be intimidated-- through the readings and class discussions you will feel inspired.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants to keep up with their Hebrew and expand their cultural references."
