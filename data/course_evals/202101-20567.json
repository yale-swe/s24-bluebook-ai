You are given a profound appreciation of establishing knowledge in general and how important good experimental design is.

                "I really enjoyed the course and there are not really many things that I would change. Winston is an incredible human being and a great professor. Unfortunately this was his last semester at Yale so the next time this course is taught may not be as good as the experience I had. The readings were well balanced and I really enjoyed the conversations that we had. I really liked the weekly journal idea as it got you to actually do the readings. My only complaint is that the workload was not very well scattered throughout the semester. We started off pretty lightly, having one assignment every two weeks, but during the end of the semester we had an assignment every single week. Also, I found it a bit unnecessary to have a fifth pset. It had by far the longest readings of any assignment in the semester and it was due right in the middle of reading week. Still, the psets did not take too much time and they were enjoyable to go through. Also Winston provided incredible feedback in each of the assignments that was really insightful.",
                "Strengths: Winston is so kind and cares about his students a lot. I liked that this class focused on learning about methods and reading\/analyzing papers rather than computational work, it was a nice departure from the other classes in the department. Weakness: lectures were long and kind of dry sometimes, it was definitely hard to pay attention over zoom.",
                "Strength: Winston is by far one of my favorite professors at Yale. He is incredibly generous and humble  the man can recall just about any date, page number, and author from hundreds of causal inference papers. But, he's not intimidating in the slightest! He's very soft spoken and always willing to let his students learn. I also had a reading group that was very helpful in discussing key concepts from the homework  this was very helpful. \r\n\r\nWeakness: There was a \"front row\" in the virtual class that Winston would cold call to answer questions. It was a little nerve-wracking being in the front row, but I understand the rationale behind the engagement. I wonder if a less scary idea would be to have a few people in \"charge\" of the reading each week, and we can have them stir up discussion and answer questions?",
                "Strength: Professor Lin is a super star professor who is passionate about casual inference and also deeply cares about his students. Professor Lin personally grades all the assignments and he was always a very fair grader, who provided lots of feedback on the assignments. Also if you're interested in data science or research, the material covered in this course will be super helpful in your future career or research projects.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Winston!!! Incredible prof\r\n- If you are interested in causality, this class has fascinating material \r\n- Gives you a sense of the history of this field, which is unlike other stats classes and very interesting in contextualizing what you are learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- Some of the readings were a bit dense (but mostly very interesting!)\r\n- 4pm on Zoom is not the best time for class",
                "The professor Winston is the main strength of this course. He is incredible and made the material very interesting to learn!",
                "Strengths: Winston is incredible. His slides are great, and you can tell so easily how well he knows his stuff. The assignments (journal entries\/homeworks) were well-made, and he provided extremely helpful feedback. I thought I wouldn't like how open-ended some of the questions would be, but as the semester went on I found them to be a good way to really critically think about the readings. They were graded leniently as well, and I feel like that really helped me not be afraid of spouting off some thoughts I had. I truly feel that I learned a lot from the assignments and exams, which forced us to apply theories to actual journal readings. I just want to reiterate: WINSTON IS AMAZING! Super thoughtful and wants everyone to really understand the material. Yale is really missing out on a great teacher (he's leaving for Penn next year), and I wish him everything good in life he deserves it haha :)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps this was more of a weakness of Zoom and the late afternoon meeting time of 4:00-5:15 than anything else, but sometimes the lectures could drag a bit.",
                "The only weakness of this course was its virtual setting. At times, the zoom environment made it hard for me to keep focused. Otherwise, it was perfect.",
                "Weaknesses: The large class size led to less meaningful discussion with people. I enjoyed the smaller group discussions that we did one time in class because it gave us an opportunity to talk to others about what we thought. Lectures were also quite long.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Winston was very cognizant of the struggles of online fatigue and gave us a reasonable challenge instead of assigning busy assignments. Winston also had a lot of knowledge on the many academic perspectives on causal inference which was a double edged sword because he provided thorough overview of the landscape of opinions on issues but also led to drawn out lectures.",
                "The strength of this class is by far the instructor. Winston has a heart of gold. He should be the one to win every teaching award that Yale has to offer. He took a paycut so that he could teach this class exclusively, which I feel that Yale is doing students and society as a whole a great disservice by penalizing instructors like this (he wanted to do this btw). Also, we students did not deserve this. I felt that most of my peers (sometimes including myself) were lazy or tired during the midafternoon class. Yale and Yale students didnt deserve him  and hes leaving next year :( \r\nThere is only one weakness, and it is that the lectures can get somewhat dry at times. Winston tries his best to keep the class engaging, but with COVID-19 and zoom university, its not the most engaging class. I felt like taking a nap at times Winston is a great instructor, but can sound somewhat monotone through the screen (it may have just been his mic Im not sure)",
                "Winston is an amazing professor and does a really great job of explaining concepts in class. I enjoyed the balance of learning the theory of causal inference techniques and reading\/critiquing papers that applied these methods.",
                "Strengths: Winston is probably THE biggest strength of this class. He is an enthusiastic professor that created a great class atmosphere for learning. One of the things that most helped with this was the \"Journal Entry\" assignments, which were low-stakes and a great opportunity for learning free from pressure. I thought the readings were well-selected and well-contextualized by Winston. This class is unique in the S&DS department in that the main focus is understanding techniques of causal inference and their assumptions, then critiquing and discussing the limitations of their application, often by reading journal articles\/newspaper articles that rely on them. I feel WAY more comfortable and equipped reading these types of articles after this class. I think another huge strength is that we were able to gain insight into the causal inference community and how it's changed over time. We were able to read from scholars with competing views and get a sense of some of the debates. It's been exciting to see the same names show up in other areas too! Winston is extremely well-read in the area and always did a fantastic job in giving credit and referencing the works of others, often sharing optional supplementary readings ranging from newspaper articles to academic journal papers to blog posts. I don't think I've ever read as many optional readings as I have in this class!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think offering this class in an earlier time slot in the day would improve engagement. 4-5:15 PM on Zoom presented a challenge at times, especially after several classes worth of Zoom already that day. I think this would have been less of an issue with in-person classes."

                "I think having a 5 minute break in lecture was a good idea. We started doing this towards the end of the semester and I thought it helped people stay engaged on Zoom.

                "Absolutely. I don't know if it'll be offer again, but this was one of my favorite statistics classes at Yale. The workload is manageable, and you learn important critical thinking skills beyond just reading and memorizing.",

                "Yes! Not sure how it will be without Winston, but it really gives you a good sense of the limitations of causal inference. You will never read a study in the same way again!",
                "Yes I would! It's a really interesting course to take in the S&DS major as it provides a different perspective on techniques learned in previous classes. It's also pretty applicable.",
                "Yes! Although I'm not sure how this class will be without Winston, because I feel like he really made the class what it was.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, but do a little research of what causal inference is before diving into the course. Chances are, this is the first causal inference class you've taken and it really helps to understand a little bit of the goals\/challenges of the field.",
                "A hesitant yes. For those who are interested in social experiments or experimental design, then a resounding yes! This class covers the basics and fundamentals of causal inference very thoroughly goes over key and interesting points in how to think about experiments in the social sciences and medicine. Also, the readings are very interesting, sometimes very witty, and will give you a good chuckle here and there. However, if you are not interested in these topics, it may not be the class for you. I personally wasnt too particularly fond of these topics, so I didnt have as much motivation to study hard or read the supplementary material (which I bet was very good since Winston seems to have a great taste in academic literature). If you dont know whether you are interested or not, then Id say give it a try! I think this is the best quality class you can get here at Yale, it just has to be aligned with your interests. \r\n\r\n(heres a copy pasta from my review on the strengths of this class to convince you to take it and for those who are lazy and wont read it) The strength of this class is by far the instructor. Winston has a heart of gold. He should be the one to win every teaching award that Yale has to offer. He took a paycut so that he could teach this class exclusively, which I feel that Yale is doing students and society as a whole a great disservice by penalizing instructors like this (he wanted to do this btw). Also, we students did not deserve this. I felt that most of my peers (sometimes including myself) were lazy or tired during the midafternoon class. Yale and Yale students didnt deserve him  and hes leaving next year :(",
                "Definitely!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course in its current iteration. That being said, I feel that a large part of what made this course so fantastic is Winston, the professor. As the course currently stands, I think it is unique among the offerings in the S&DS department in that the main focus is understanding techniques of causal inference and their assumptions, then critiquing and discussing the limitations of their application, often by reading journal articles\/newspaper articles that rely on them. I feel WAY more comfortable and equipped reading these types of articles after this class. Winston is incredibly well-read and extremely thoughtful about what he assigns and the questions he asks. He also gave great feedback on homework assignments and class discussions, even recommending readings based on your individual interests. Winston is such a gem in the S&DS department, and so is this course as taught by him. Winston is moving to another institution next year, and I honestly have no idea what the next iteration of the class will look like. I hope it continues to be offered, because it is one of my highlights of the major."
