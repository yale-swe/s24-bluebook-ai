                "online lecture format",
                "Bad class",
                "A strength is that readings are short but still get across a good amount of information. The rewirements are helpful in helping us put what we learn into practice, and the quizzes and exams offer chances for review. The biggest weakness I often thought was lectures. Prof. Santos went really quickly through many studies, often overstating and simplifying their findings, rather than going slow and actually digging into any one of the studies. I think we would have learned more that way. She also talked to us like we were eight years old which was frustrating from someone who says she values students so much.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, not a stressful courseload, made accessible online for students in covid isolation\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: inconsistent grading with the TFs",
                "strengths: could watch lectures asynchronously, could drop 2 quizzes\r\nweaknesses: course structure, unforgiving grading (I answered \"Stiles\" for a question where the answer was \"Ezra Stiles\" and got the whole thing wrong), lack of facilitating interaction with psych fam, didn't give us the rubric for the research proposal before grading the proposal.",
                "Strength would be the interesting content but a weakness would be how hard they graded the assignments. It just creates the stress that she is trying to prevent.",
                "Strengths: lectures were very well-organized, readings supplemented the course content",
                "Strengths: super interesting topic, really well organized course (Laurie Santos gives you absolutely any resource you might need), not intensive at all, you learn a lot if you actually engage with it (although not many do)\r\nWeaknesses: the lack of engagement with it from students (partly because of its size being ~500, partly because it feels very rehearsed so people might find little interest)",
                "Strengths: good overview of happiness research\r\nWeakness: I think a lot of Yale students are neurodivergent (probably a higher % than the average human population), and the class felt like it was modeled toward a neurotypical student body. I'd recommend implementing more research about happiness for students who are ADHD, autistic, bipolar, etc. Our brains sometimes defy the typical stuff Prof Santos taught about, and it was discouraging to hear her teach about it as if it was true across all people.",
                "Strengths: the class itself was really fun (the memes on the lecture slides, the music that would play before class, the fun extra credit opportunities, the podcast episodes assigned as \"readings\"); the content was also interesting  \r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the time it felt like material that was very specifically situational (like that getting one bad grade won't make you as sad as you think it will) was applied broadly to contexts that weren't scientifically relevant (like that college grades in general won't make you happy, even if your passion is medicine and you actually need decent grades to get into medical school); also, with such an emphasis on grades being bad, it felt like there was a lot of pressure on studying for exams  I think if Professor Santos really didn't want us to worry about grades and to focus on learning instead, the exams should have been open note",
                "Professor Santos is a true gem and a brilliant lecturer! It was evident that she is a top researcher in her field of psychology given the wealth of information that she prepared for each and every class.",
                "The course was available to lots of people which was good, but since the class was only one section and so large it was easy to become disconnected with the class.",
                "This class had no strengths. Laurie Santos is simply the worst professor. Her celebrity status has gone to her head. Her course was not beneficial to my happiness at all. This class is only good if you don't have any REAL problems in your life. Sorry but gratitude exercises won't fix anxiety or depression.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, relevant life applications, livestreaming the lectures was a godsend because I had a class right before that was 25 minutes away and there was no way I would make it to lecture on time so the live stream allowed me to attend class AND have time to actually eat and relax\r\nWeaknesses: some things in the class are counterproductive like we learn about grades and competition being bad but then have to log wellness activities on an app where we compete for points and we have to take a midterm AND a final AND 4 quizzes (although the lowest 2 are dropped) - I know Prof Santos has to grade us and all that but Yale does not mandate all of these assessments...English classes, example, are entirely paper based and still give students grades - the class can feel very hypocritical for these reasons but the actual content is interesting",
                "a little bit redundant but was good to review material taught in the last lecture that might have been confusing. all the concepts tied well with each other and the lectures connected well",
                "We were tested on the smallest of irrelevant details. The big picture ideas were more important but were never tested, even though we were told to write down only the big ideas",
                "Grading scheme unclear... I thought this created unnecessary stress, especially when the reason given was \"grades don't matter\". I understand the sentiment, but we really had no idea what our final grades would be.",
                "Doing high-quality recordings of the class was awesome. I would have had to skip lunch if it had not been for the distanced learning option. The one main assignment, the hack yourself project is inherently flawed. Using perma scores as a sole metric for seeing if happiness changes week to week based on trying a new thing or strategy just doesn't make sense. My perma score can change hourly, who knows if what is changing the perma score is your intervention or any other thing in life. The app was annoying and It wasn't clear from the beginning it wasn't mandatory.",
                "This is just not a good class. Don't be fooled by the headlines like I was. Looking back, I'm just kind of sad I wasted one of my Yale credits on a semester's worth of material I probably could've learned in a 30-minute Ted Talk.",
                "Strength was that workload was manageable and topic was interesting but weakness was it felt repetitive",
                "I would argue that there are hardly many strengths to this course. The lecture is organized but it is incredibly difficult to take much of the lecture seriously since many of the practices that Santos utilizes in the course are so against much of what she lectures about. Additionally, the material becomes repetitive at one point but not any less dense.",
                "Aside from all the problems of positive psychology (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology#Criticism), the course content was just presented in a way that seemed really thoughtless, and at times it felt almost cult-ish. Pretty much every lesson went, \"You might think your brain works this way, but you're wrong, and here's studies that prove you're wrong.\" My issue is not with the statistical rigor of the studies presented, which Professor Santos made very clear to address over and over again with the meta-analysis train meme  my issue is that the course felt like a self-help book except with psychology sprinkled in here and there. Honestly I think taking this course greatly reduced my subjective well-being this semester.",
                "This course was excellent; I learned about the psychology of happiness, had fun while doing so, and the workload wasn't stressful. \r\n\r\nI don't think this course can be improved. Instead, Yale should work on improving its mental health services, as Laurie Santos urges Yale to do during her lectures.",
                "I feel that if there was more interaction like group projects would help greatly",
                "Very well organized and a workload that is low because the instructor luckily understands that more work does not equal better learning/remembering!\r\nWeakness: not everyone that wanted to take the course was able to and the fact that spots were distributed based on first come first serve was infuriating because people actually wanted to take the course and learn instead of just getting a credit, but that was not considered at all.\r\nWeakness of the course itself: it was too easy at times, which also shouldn't be the goal of it...\r\nBIG weakness: the course JUMPS to conclusions in the spirit of \"correlation equals causation\", which was really really tough for me to take given that Professor Santos is a scientist at Yale and we are usually taught to think critically. The way that correlations and studies were generalized in the course to fit the needs of what the professor was trying to express (e.g. a 0.1 correlation being HUGE if it said that going to church made us happy, but SUPER SMALL if it said that social media makes us happy) HAS TO improve in my opinion. It almost seemed like propaganda (obviously for a good cause that I support, but that's still propaganda...)",
                "Strengths--engaging. Weaknesses--repetitive, relies on a huge amount of memorization",
                "Strength: Laurie Santos is an excellent lecturer and makes each lecture engaging, fun, and relatable. She organizes her slides with the learning curve clearly in mind, with repetitions of the most important concepts so that you won't forget them. There are also really good examples and studies for each concept she introduces.\r\nWeakness: There are a lot of studies mentioned in each lecture, many of which have the same of similar conclusions, and they can be hard to keep track of. Also I feel like a lot of people don't show up to lecture because the slides and notes on Canvas basically cover everything you need on the exams.",
                "Strengths: Prof Laurie Santos is such a kind person and so passionate about her course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures went by so fast I couldn't even read the definitions on the slides. IF YOU TOOK INTRO PSYCHOLOGY YOU WILL KNOW MORE THAN HALF THE MATERIAL AND THIS CLASS WILL BE A WASTE OF YOUR TIME!!!! \r\n\r\nI really think this class would have been super valuable to have taken as a freshman or as a non psych/cogsci student. As a junior, I have already learned most of these things.",

                "The strengths are the purpose of the course.",

                "Strengths: the lectures are interesting\r\nWeaknesses: TAs, as is usually for psychology classes",
                "strengths are organization\r\nweaknesses are the lack of structure behind lecture slides, tough to keep engaged",
                "Strengths: subject material seems interesting. Weaknesses: the course felt catered to children. I felt like I didn't learn anything meaningful, and by nature of the material, students were kinda talked down to. Also the final exam was really long and was way more difficult then the rest of the class. For a class promoting how grades didn't matter, the final was extremely intense.",
                "Better scientific evidence",

                "Strengths include engaging classes, a professor who is knowledgeable about the topic, and and a hack yourself project at the end of the semester.",
                "Strength - class was interesting\r\nWeakness - tests are overly hard even if you go to lecture / do the work so everyone credit ds and loses engagement in the class. Professor Santos theory about grades is completely false.",
                "The quizzes, exams, and assignments were all fair and helpful for learning the material. I think some of the material we studied in class was not presented well. I wished professor Santos would have used the original figures when showing them in class.",
                "The content taught was good, but I feel like ti focused too much on studies",
                "I think that the curriculum could be changed in that it should either be a force credit/d/fail because the testing did not really align with the professor or work. I think the strengths are that the material is very interesting.",
                "/",
                "The course was relatively comprehensive and very accessible, but the lectures dragged. I feel as though having 50-minute lectures 3 times a week would have been more useful because some of it felt repetitive.",
                "I could apply more psyc pro tips in my life",
                "I really liked this class - I thought it taught really important and valuable tactics on improving happiness with psychological principles.",
                "The assigned TA's were not engaged in helping out. I sent my TA emails, and he never replied.",
                "Course is tougher than expected and I am sure that there are much easier classes out there if you are hoping for a low workload.",
                "Strengths: interesting + applicable content to your actual life\r\nWeaknesses: presentation of data can be biased at times when she wants to prove her point (e.g. a misleading use of the word \"significant\": she would say one study with a lower correlation coefficient that supports her argument has a correlation that is significant to mean statistically significant, then she would say another study with a higher correlation coefficient that refutes her argument has a correlation that is \"not significant\" to mean not a strong correlation)",
                "Some stuff seemed not true",
                "bad teacher, good content",
                "The information is interesting. I think the rewirements should be required to make people actually do it. Also, the exams are mostly cramming, which I think undermines the class. I  think the final project should be a turned in write up with a take home p set rather than the exam + write up.",
                "strength was the content",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Having 2/4 quizzes count toward the grade did help alleviate stress in trying to get a good grade\r\n- I really liked the style of lectures, the slides were super helpful\r\n- The rewirements were amazing!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I heard of many people who did not do the assigned readings for each class. I think it would be good to include in lectures one slide on the main takeaways from the reading so then those who choose not to read them got a brief exposure to the content, but don't give them a lot so then students would still be enticed to complete the readings \r\n- The PSYC fam was a great idea, but I didn't really have that much engagement with them. Would be cool to do an activity with PSYC fams in class",
                "The course provided many studies, which showed the effects of the proposed interventions empirically, which was nice.",
                "The lectures are very strong but the class is way too big, leading there to be policies that feel really unfair; for example, all students are allowed to drop 2 quiz scores, but no extensions or deans excuses are allowed for any quizzes since that would be too much work for the TAs in such a big class, motivating students to come to class even if they are contact traced or feeling sick. \r\nI also found Professor Santos's refusal to answer questions about grades really frustrating; when asked about curves on the midterm, she refused to answer using the logic that grades don't matter, we shouldn't be stressing about them, and reminding us that she wants everyone to be credit d failing  as someone who needed the social science credit for a distributional requirement, credit d-ing was not an option making this really frustrating and stressful.\r\nOverall I learned a lot and really enjoyed the class though!",
                "S: Relatively engaging, and highly relevant, course information \r\nW: No information was presented in any explanatory or in-depth manner; this translated to a lot of the material feeling like a trivia-esque game of remembering each term without much deep knowledge",
                "You should check literally everything on Canvas before each assignment, because there's no information about the assignment at the assignment tab.",
                "asynchronous format may have been a weakness because of decreased engagement\r\n\r\nwould've loved more guest lectures or class-wide activities\r\n\r\nreally enjoyed professor santos' enthusiasm and humor",
                "Weakness: the concepts are too broad with too many different studies\r\nDig deeper in certain studies and expand it.\r\n\r\nStrength: very useful. Teaches me how to be happier. And appreciate my life.",
                "This course should spend less time focusing on memorization and more time on creating lasting habits for happiness.",
                "Content is very interesting but layout of the lectures got a little repetitive and boring",
                "The lectures were very engaging.",
                "I feel that the content was relevant and that Professor Santos delivered the information in a way that made it memorable. I liked her memes in lecture. However, I didnt like how the grading of the class was unclear. She spoke to students as though everyone was going to credit/d the class when that was simply not true. This was actually kind of stressful for me because I wasnt sure if she would give me a C just to prove a point. I wish she were more clear early on.",
                "Strengths: Very chill class with extremely life-relevant stuff, lecture notes are immaculate so no need to take notes in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I know they want everyone to Cr/D/F so they are evil with the grading, and that's how they make people do it. If this is still the policy, just Cr/D/F the class and learn some cool stuff while giving yourself a bit of a break from work.",
                "the exams could have been less difficult to match the message of the class",
                "Weaknesses include statistical cherrypicking, hypocrisy in methods advocated and course execution, and self-aggrandizement",
                "I think the course should be more interactive because although the information is interesting, it's presented in the exact same way every day and sitting through a long lecture that has the same structure every day can be tiring and make you not want to pay attention.",
                "The final project being incorporated into the final exam was stressful and not conducive to learning. Also, it seemed like there was more of an emphasis on memorization than conceptual understanding.",
                "Strength: plenty of real-life applicable things mentioned in class and walked through. Weaknesses: I think the class could have been more directly engaging, possibly through adding a section.",
                "One huge weakness with the course was what we were expected to know, specifically when it came to the studies. For exams, Professor Santos \"did not expect us to know specific details about the studies\" but then required us to know the methods by which they were conducted. And might I add this is for over 200 studies, which many of the time proved very similar things. I understand that Professor Santos has to test us, but it seemed like a big flop in the process of trying to reach happiness to require us to know all these meaningless details that don't really have any effect on us achieving happiness as opposed to simply the big, overarching ideas that the studies proved.",
                "The lectures could be a bit repetitive but the material was very interesting and the problem sets, lecture notes, and other course materials were very clear and informative. Professor santos is a great lecturer",
                "I think the rewirements, at least most of them are a clear strength. For weakness, I think the class structure is poor, and I wish the studies presented to us were more convincing about their conclusions. I spent a lot of time in class seriously questioning if the info being presented to me was even true which made it had to fully accept class tetachings most days.",
                "Weaknesses: often feels rather oblivious to some real-life issues and a lot of the information we learned was pretty contradictory. I found it difficult to relate to a lot of the tools and skills we were taught for improving happiness as they were sort of taught in a way that we were told what to do but not taught how to do it",
                "I liked its scientific nature",
                "I feel like it was a little tough to find a realistic balance between managing the class's atmosphere grade-repellant goals and Yale, all other classes, and social scene of academic achievement.",
                "It's an extremely strong course!",
                "the first class left a bad taste in a lot of students' mouths: bragging about the class seemed like an awkward opening\r\nit was difficult for many students to take the class seriously after that but for those who did, they probably did take something away from the class",
                "For a person who stresses not worrying about grades, professor Santos was very condescending and made students worry about grades quite a bit",
                "Strengths -- life changing, well-organized course content\r\nWeaknesses -- could get redundant, wish there had been more of a concrete way to teach/learn studies",
                "I think that Laurie Santos is a great lecturer, but I don't think that this course makes sense to be taken as a class as a grade given that it's difficult to maintain a grade with an assignment that slips. Honestly, her preachings in the course regarding grades and course-load are a direct contradiction to her pedagogy.",
                "Requiring going to lectures would improve participation. Required discussion sections. No grades.",
                "Strengthsthe incentives to actually put behavior into practice were nice, like time affluence, the PSYCfams, etcetera.\r\nWeaknessesI feel like the course could have been improved by having a dual-element to it, describing moreso why some people cannot put these behaviors into action. Maybe adding in a sociocultural perspective would make the course appear more realistic for those that do not have the same privileges that we have. Also, sometimes we were confused on the correlation between thingsperhaps explaining potential biases of studies would help.",
                "It'd be great to have in-class exercises as a concept comes up to help us reflect on it live.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course were the topics and the workload . I enjoyed every lesson and attended the lectures in person which made it easier to understand the material. One of the main weaknesses of the course was the exams. The final exam was difficult to answer within the amount of time given and was extremely challenging in comparison to the material provided and prior quizzes.",
                "I think it would be nice if there were actual sections, rather than just the lecture, which were a bit impersonal. The lectures were very good though, and compelling. The assessments could definitely be improved to involve less memorization - that wasn't something I thought really contributed to the course a ton.",
                "I think this class is all strengths. It's not going to fix your life around for you, but I'm sure there at least 50% of the course content will be relevant to any given person taking the class.",
                "Strengths: encouraged thinking seriously about happiness, taught some basic life skills in an accessible manner, allowed for not just knowledge but also practice of various happiness-increasing strategies. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: little to no discussion of whether studies should be taken seriously, or how to evaluate this, other than professor Santos saying \"this is significant\". No comparison or attempt at comparison between happiness strategies - I have no idea, for instance, how gratitude journaling compares with meditation. Also, the course mixed messages in counterproductive ways: grades are bad for learning but also you should study the psets because of quizzes; the rewirements are intrinsically motivated but also you get 'psychgold' for doing them; you should credit-D this class but also it's a social science credit. The silly/arbitrary/graded parts took away from my intrinsic motivation to take the class somewhat. Of course, while this was a weakness for me it may not be so for others - perhaps I could have better sustained intrinsic motivation if I had taken fewer classes and been less stressed. The bottom line here is less that the class is poorly designed, and more that it will not hold your hand - if you want to learn from it, you will need to put in conscious time and effort beyond what is required of you. There will be quizzes, and they will be easy enough that you do not need to study for them, and this will distract you from the fact that maybe taking the class seriously means reviewing your notes every once in a while.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I found after-class discussions with friends as valuable as lectures. Perhaps this could be systematized? The lectures often felt repetitive, especially at the start of the course, and could maybe be cut somewhat in exchange for some group discussion (e.g. with the 'psychfam' groups to which we were assigned).",
                "The weaknesses of this course was the repetitiveness of some of the content.",
                "This course gives a broad scope of different understandings of and techniques to improve happiness, at the expense of diving into the methodologies of and in-depth analysis of different factors or studies.",
                "The course's biggest strength is the fact that it allows students to engage with the material on a practical, personal level (the final project is especially helpful for this). The course manages to deliver an enormous amount of information while never being stressfulI learned a lot and genuinely enjoyed it.",
                "Strengths: good course format, PSETs are helpful, lectures are easy to follow\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Difficult to normalize grade among the course with so many different TAs",

                "I think the course could have been a lot more engaging and interesting in the lectures itself. Especially considering the positive nature of the course, the study/lectures were kinda boring",
                "Strengths: this course actually gets you to practice the things that you know are good for you but you're sometimes too lazy to get yourself to do. I've always wanted to meditate consistently and now I'm doing it because I developed a habit of doing it for homework.\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Santos goes super fast and does not dive deep into any studies, so you kind of just have to take them at face value.",
                "I wish it was a little less reliant on memorizing terms. The class is super hard if you don't credit D and a lot of definitions.",
                "weaknesses: not as engaging as anticipated; the exams were incredibly difficult and not did not provide enough time to complete. the lessons were redundant and it felt like we were learning the same material every class. the professor told us we didn't need to memorize any specific psych studies, but the exams and quizzes were basically testing us on how many experiments we knew. overall, made me less happy.",
                "There were not that many assignments to form a proper comprehension of the class material.",
                "Lack of communication about grading system. Despite the emphasis that grades do not matter, the uncertainty of success lead to greater stress.",

                "assessments pretty hard since lots to memorize",
                "There are no strengths.\r\nWEAKNESSES: \r\n- The actual worst professor for many reasons: 1. she would try to fearmonger about COVID for the entire semester by saying things like 'I just came from a meeting and it has been the worst day of cases yet', which was a complete and utter lie. 2. She doesn't allow dean's excuses for quizzes which is ridiculous considering there are things such as illness. 3. She literally forces you to listen to her podcasts with loads of ads and continually advertises herself and basically only uses the class to make money/become more famous. There are more but it would be too much to write.\r\n- The grading of the course is actually awful because she tries to force you to credit D the class, which is stupid. She does this because she says grades don't matter but then assigns you 4 psests, a paper, a research project, and 2 midterms. \r\n- You learn actually nothing. Like straight up nothing. All she does is say stuff like 'take a deep breath and don't be stressed'.\r\n- This class gives a bad rep. to psychology because literally all the correlation coefficients are like 0.1, which is essentially random and doesn't actually show anything, but she tries to say otherwise.",
                "I think that the course would benefit from providing a more comprehensive pathway for students who are taking the course for a grade.",

                "There should be more opportunities for students to improve their grades",
                "Strengths: This course is great at accomplishing what it sets out to do, which is to teach students about happiness and help them change their daily habits for the better. The lectures are very entertaining and well-paced.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The existence of a midterm and a final are ironic considering some of the lessons taught in the first lecture. The professor and teaching fellows aren't translucent about how to complete assignments, and there is a significant disconnect between the instructor and the students. The length of the final exam isn't adjusted to take into account the fact that we need to write a research paper in a section of it (myself and many other students left questions blank since over half of the allotted time was taken up writing the research paper).",
                "Strengths: Does give you actionable ways to improve happiness, low workload\r\nWeaknesses: Laurie Santos tries to force everyone to cred/d by making the midterm super hard. It was incredibly detailed and far more intense than it needed to be. Lectures were also very repetitive.",

                "strength - broad range of content covered, content relevant to daily life\r\nweakness - a bit repetitive at times",
                "This class was well-structured with a manageable layout.",
                "The course seems like it could be compressed into a shorter time scale or shorter lectures. Also many of my peers were not taking the class very seriously so maybe some sort of a way to make sure the people taking the class are actually going to do the work and pay attention.",

                "I think I liked the content or the course, but I wasnt thrilled by the execution. I felt lectured could be kind of monotonous and boring. I think I did learn a lot but Im sad it wasnt more interactive. Also I had difficulty keeping up with requirements so maybe work on that.",
                "it was very organized and clear. lectures were pretty interesting but could have been more engaging",
                "Strengths: Organized readings along with lecture notes to follow along with the lecture, Santos had a focus on learning the material and not trying to test every single detail explained \r\nweaknesses: none",
                "I think some of the content was a bit repetitive. Additionally, with some of the more intuitive conclusions that we reached, I feel like it would have been better to focus on another aspect of that subject, since hearing about things that already made sense slightly decreased my engagement with the course throughout the semester.",
                "The lectures were very engaging and I found myself tuned in throughout the entire hour and fifteen-minute block.",
                "After having completed the course, I feel as though I bought into a fad. The course was certainly valuable to have taken, but many of the lectures were a bit dry. It was also hard to stay motivated when most of the class did not show up, and when those who did show up were a bunch of freshmen and athletes who talked and played on their phones all lecture.",

                "Great format and structure of the course in general, and the content specifically was well thought-out and structured well. The exams could be a little more challenging, and the final was quite long. Would have preferred more challenging questions and more time to think about and answer them.",
                "This course is extremely hypocritical. The assignments are graded harshly and there is no path to better your grade simply because \"grades do not matter\".",
                "This should not be a class, please do not force students to sit through a semester of lectures where they are told everything wrong in their life is their fault.",
                "I found it very unfair that we did not receive the full class period for exams. I think I speak on the behalf of many students when I say that exams were extremely rushed and I often didnt get to finish multiple questions.",
                "Strengths: low workload\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, it felt difficult to stay engaged in lecture because it felt like I was being babied in terms of what lecture content. Most of it seemed pretty obvious but also super counterintuitive i.e. Laurie Santos would often say grades don't matter for one's happiness! But later she would counter that by telling us to get an average of 8 hours of sleep per day because more sleep is correlated with higher GPA.",
                "Strengths: the rewirements actually helped with my overall happiness levels and challenged me to do self-care activities I would not have done on my own \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures are boring and repetitive, the class is catered as a life-changing course but in reality anyone who has taken other psychology or cognitive science classes has probably heard of most of the studies, the class seems hypocritical because you are taught not to care about grades but it requires studying, assignments, and exams in the same exact way that other classes do (this class would be A LOT better if the rewirements made up a portion of your grade instead)",
                "Strength - Depending on how much effort you want to put into the course, you can learn a lot. The atmosphere of the lecture is very inviting and low-stress.\r\n\r\nWeakness - Not very engaging. Depends on how interested you are by the week.",
                "strengths - not overwhelming. i felt like i could keep up with the homework and material pretty well.\r\n\r\nweaknesses - grading was unnecessarily hard. the lectures sometimes felt like a marathon because it moved so quickly and note-taking could be difficult/. had to switch to taking notes on my laptop even thought that was discouraged for speed purposes",
                "Strengths: This course has very important information to understand how to increase well-being and does a good job of showing the specific practices that you can implement in your day-to-day routine. The class is well-organized. Weaknesses: I felt that the exam structure was somewhat antithetical to the teachings on what makes people happier. I think the grade should have been based on journal entries or something similar that shows implementation of the techniques not memorization of the research.",
                "weakness- very heavy on the studies and often too heavy on them. seemed like she was always trying to prove every little point she made\r\n\r\nstrengths- psets were very helpful in affirming that I was learning the content and taking things away from the class",
                "Lectures were engaging and presented well. Lots of variety. Only weakness is I would sometimes be unmotivated to go to class in person and watch online.",
                "It is clear that this course is based off a general skeleton intended for many different audiences, giving it a pop psychology feel, which makes it too challenging for many students to actually take it seriously, when many college students are already inclined to be cynical about the subject of actually improving their well being.\r\n\r\nAs for the app: it was not an intuitive design, requiring very specific activities to be completed to earn points, and takes a lot of joy out of doing the rewirements. When someone falls out of the habit, its almost impossible to start trying again, turning a journey of self improvement and learning into a burden and a system that reflects shortcomings more than it does achievements",
                "This course's lack of focus on grades did help me disassociate the grades from the value of learning in this class; however, I did not enjoy how the class was taught. It seemed quite repetitive. In each lecture, the class was taught like this: new term + definition, study (or multiple studies) about that term, then new term, studies about this term, then a new term, etc). This lack of interactiveness in class did not make it enjoyable and may have been part of the reason why people just resorted to watching the lectures online. When we did the workshop in class, I really liked the activity because I got to meet more classmates and I felt more engaged in the class.",
                "It was very student-friendly. I thought class was a light work load. An improvement could be engaging more of the class.",
                "The assignment due dates were a bit confusing at times. Could be better if there was just a big list in canvas on when things were due.",
                "poorly paced, not well lectured",
                "The class focused a lot on things that we thought would make us happy and why, in reality, it does not, rather than trying to make us happier with what we have.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is fun to take with a lot of people, the content is digestible (you do not need a background in anything), and you do learn some fun tips. Professor Santos is an engaging lecturer. The weakness is that it is incredibly hypocritical. There is immense pressure to credit-D, not just verbally, but because the midterm and exam are actually both quite difficult and graded harshly (with no curve). If you take it knowing you will credit-D, it is fine, but for those who do not want to waste a limited credit-D on the course, grading becomes a source of stress, even though that is the opposite of what Professor Santos teaches. While we learn \"grades don't matter,\" there is still strict grading, which is confusing and discouraging in conjunction to the course. I ended the semester feeling more stressed about Good Life than any other course I was taking this semester, because it had the most unpredictable grading and I did not want to use a credit D this early in my Yale career.",
                "I liked the way that this course covered a broad range of topics; however, I felt that the format of the lectures was very repetitive. We would learn a concept and then see a study to support it.",
                "Strengths: Applicable; Laurie Santos is amazing; last lecture is amazing, the class is definitely designed for the students! She has our best interests at heart and deserves a good burn-out year.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the studies can get tedious, but I don't know how else you would structure the class",
                "I love how Professor Santos discussed many case studies that allowed us to understand the concepts of the class. Super interesting readings and podcasts. I wish the review sessions for exams were not the night before we have to take them.",
                "strenghths: loved the lecture notes given before the class, super helpful and the atmosphere \r\nweaknesses: too big of a class",
                "The course was well-organized and had very intriguing lessons.",
                "This course is taught through lectures that feel like Ted Talks. There isn't a lot to be gleaned from the way that Prof. Santos teaches in this style, and once you get to the exams you are meant to remember every word and every concept that she lectured on. Basically, the examinations are much more specific than the lectures. This course would be improved by small-group (TF group) study sessions as opposed to Prof. Santos' one-hour review lectures as well as some more help with study guides/key terms.",
                "The course is not very transparent about grading policies (i.e. whether there is a curve, etc.). I also think that while, yes it is better if everyone credit-d fails the class, that was pushed too aggressively onto us; some people either didn't have any left, need/want this class to count towards their major, or wanted to use a credit-d fail for another course, but a lot of my peers felt like they had to credit-d fail because they grading policies weren't completely transparent.\r\n\r\nThe class is strong in the sense that the material is actually important and useful to any human being. It also is very well-structured and Laurie Santos does care about her students. I think if grades didn't exist or didn't effect our real-world realities (not just our future happiness due to our perceived increase in salary), this would be a class that I'd recommend everyone to take.",
                "I think there were an overwhelming number of studies mentioned very quickly. That in itself is not a weakness since psychology classes generally cite a lot of studies, but I think slowing the pace of the class a little would make it feel less overwhelming.\r\n\r\nI was also very unimpressed with the happy climate exercise at the end of the term. I understand the idea but it felt like a waste of class time.",
                "Strengths are the teacher and weaknesses are the size of the class.",
                "A bit surface level. Each example is provided with a 2-sentence explanation of several different studies that support it. Theres no real, deeper psychological exploration. Some literature that disagrees with whats being presented would be nice from time to time, everything is presented as a be-all and end-all",
                "Shorter lectures",
                "I really liked the organization of the course and how Prof Santos had the lecture slides and notes available to us. I thought the content was interesting, although we spent too much time talking about how dumb our brains are. A lot of the material felt repetitive. I also thought some of the graphs weren't very credible because they didn't have error bars and the y-axis was way zoomed in, making a small effect seem huge. It's tough hearing \"don't have kids if you want to be happy\" when there isn't much credible research to back that up. I think there's a difference between a fleeting feeling of happiness vs long-term joy and it would've been nice to learn about that and how to reach each one. Also the 75k point for happiness is from several years ago, so with inflation it would be larger. I liked that the course got us talking about this all!! My friends and I would spend a lot of time debating different topics from class.",
                "n/a",
                "The biggest weakness of this course was the professor forcing students to credit/d/failing the course. I understand it is reassuring to explain that our grades are not the most important things in our lives, but unfortunately they are still real. There are many students who took this \"popular\" course who needed a distributional requirement, or who needed the credit/d/fail for another course, or who did not have any credit/d/fails left or more importantly students who are psychology majors and could use the course for their major requirements. Thus, it is incredibly inconsiderate to not truly give students an opportunity to not credit/d/fail. The reason I say people did not really have an option is because we were given only 60 minutes to complete a 13 page final before reading week. An exam that was majority open ended questions that required a lot of writing to explain our thoughts. This is clearly unrealistic to anyone and I know of many students who had to credit/d/fail following this exam. Students who were concerned and reached out for advice were told not to worry about it because \"grades don't matter\". This is an incredibly tone-deaf statement to say to a class of 500 Yale students when not a single one of them would not be at Yale if it were not for their good grades. If grades did not matter at all we would not be given grades.",
                "There is a lot of memorization in the class for the quizzes and exams for the psychological terms",
                "I did not like that we were so encouraged to take the course pass/fail. I understand why this is relevant to the subject matter of the course. However, I felt as though the grades given on the research proposal were extremely harsh (low) just for the purpose of encouraging people to take it pass/fail. This in some ways causes additional stress, which the class is all about reducing.",
                "I have a lot of thoughts about this course. \r\nStrengths: \r\nI think that it was well-organized and well-intentioned, but there are a lot of parts of the content and execution that I would change. \r\nWeaknesses: \r\nFirst, the lecture slides were really difficult to read, and about 50% of Professor Santos' graphs could end up on the bad graphs meme page--she almost always cut off axes so they just...misrepresented the data in a way that was beneficial to her. She cited so many studies and put up data and graphs, but then explained none of the data, instead just telling us that this was good for you or bad for you, basically. \r\nIn terms of the content, I often found myself frustrated at the incredibly capitalistic, working-within-the-system mentality. For example, one concept she repeated over and over again is that money doesn't increase happiness past $75k, which shouldn't be a problem for any of us since the Yale median salary is 76k or whatever. But like...that ignores the millions of people who don't make that much. The climate change lecture was poorly done and the guest lecturer advocated for CARBON WRITE-OFFs, which I thought had been pretty much established as generally shitty for the world. \r\nIn addition, the information and data she presented was based on being a financially stable, neurotypical, mentally healthy white cishet individual, which doesn't apply to a significant proportion of Yale. There was no discussion about who is typically included in psych studies and how these biases skew results. Overall, it just felt like a well-intentioned self-help class, with no real intellectual curiosity or in-depth science involved. Lastly, the \"hack-yourself\" project was weird--framing it like a proper scientific study ignores the fact that it was not scientific at all, and there was no discussion of statistical analysis of results, or anything. Anyways, I'm angry.",
                "I heard about this course upon my first visit to Yale as a senior in high school and I feel as though it was falsely advertised. I think the long wait time before offering this class is meant to trick students into taking it once it is offered next. One particular strength of the course was the flexibility and option to watch the lecture recordings online, which allowed COVID conscious students to learn comfortably. Regardless, there wasn't much learning. I genuinely believe the course material is presented in a more difficult manner in order to get students to take the class Credit D Fail. While Prof. Santos stresses that grades do not matter, I think the statement is a little tone deaf given that grades do matter for first gen low-income students who are trying to pursue grad schools following their time at Yale. The exams were surprisingly difficult and grading was not standardized across the class.",
                "Strengths: Cool lectures and engaging course material\r\nWeaknesses: Some studies felt a little too disconnected from course material (wasn't relatable)",
                "A weakness I found in this class was that the content was not always engaging and I wish the class was more discussion based or there was more interactions in the class. Additionally, the PowerPoints and content always followed and presented in the same format which made the lectures every monotone and boring after awhile.",
                "The course has lots of wonderful information, but a lot of it feels very intuitive. It would benefit from being more engaging, in order to put these in practice. Currently, its very easy to cruise through, just listening but not making any changes. In lecture, its pretty interesting, although the reality is that the classroom tended to be empty most days.",
                "The biggest strength of the course is Laurie Santos herself -- she is an amazing lecturer and made lecture so enjoyable because she was very engaging (peppering her lectures with memes etc). I also loved getting to know my Psych Fam. I also loved how Laurie encouraged us to Credit/D/Fail the course, because after looking at all the research about how bad grades are for learning, I'm glad that in this course I was just able to focus on learning for the sake of learning.",
                "Lectures felt performative",
                "The exams were too extensive for the time granted to take them.",
                "I definitely gained some practical skills that might help me improve my mood or reduce anxiety. However, I felt like a lot of the graphs and science used to back up some of the Psych Pro Tips perhaps were not significant enough to justify presenting.",
                "Strengths: Did what it said it wouldit's definitely helped me become happier! More importantly, I feel like I have a basis of knowledge to fall back on in the future if I'm struggling to find happiness. Getting to put what we learn into practice in rewirements was fun. Weaknesses: It's hard to stay motivated to do all the optional (but still valuable) work.",
                "I think the strengths are the content but the weakness is that it is such a large lecture class that you cant ask questions",
                "Strengths: clarity in the outline of the lecture and the units, assessment timeline, and expectations for the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n - though the Professor repetitively mentioned \"science-backed\" methods to improving our happiness, I felt that much of the \"science\" was a bit spuriouslike correlational studies between walking on a swinging bridge and taking bigger risks. I really enjoyed the lectures where we learned about certain neurological processes, and wish to learn more about those. \r\n - I also felt that the class contradicted itself at times; though the Professor criticized grades as depressors for happiness, we were still assessed through point systems, some of which were harsh. I think the class should transition out of point system to evaluate students' quality of work and use broader metrics like check minus / check / check plus, if no metrics at all.\r\n - I also felt that there was little TF to student connection in the course. I struggled to get responses from TFs.",
                "Dr. Santos is passionate and believes in what she is teaching. However, I would've liked to see her acknowledge research that disagrees with some of the ideas she preaches as fact.\r\nAs a senior psychology major, I often felt I was learning one-liners, catchy \"pro-tips,\" and seemingly undisputed phenomena instead of really examining research in the field of positive psychology.",
                "One strength of these course was that lectures were very engaging and structured in a way that made it very easy to understand and connect the material. The suggested happiness strategies were also very specific, which made them easier to tackle.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was that lectures were sometimes very packed and full of information, which made it hard to learn the specifics of studies. The details of studies were sometimes needed on exams, so it would be helpful if there weren't as many studies or the important studies were identified.",
                "I think the lectures became repetitive in terms of their format. I wish she switched up the delivery of content sometimes because its great content but the repetitive nature in which it was presented made me get bored.",
                "The lectures were very good and clear. It would be helpful if for the quizzes, a scan of them were returned over canvas. That way, rather than just seeing the grade, we can see what we got wrong. I believe sometimes quizzes were handed back in person, but if they were returned over canvas as well, that would probably be beneficial for people.",
                "The  course content is great aside from the metrics used to back up the content: correlation studies are used but their correlations are like ~0.22. They are statistically insignificant. I think this class is best taught without the number, so that it is easier to digest.",
                "This class was branded as the happiness class and one that teaches you principles of psychology and actually help students become happier. I don't think it was that at all. The grading system was horrible and so incredibly picky and strict. I received 2 points off on my research proposal for having a heading for my works cited labeled \"citations\" instead of \"references\". And that's just one example of this- the whole course is designed for you to not to well to encourage you to credit/d/fail.",
                "Boring and very repetitive class material and poorly executed lectures. To claim to promote student learning and then to prompt students to write by hand, the professor went by extremely fast in class and made it impossible to do so.",
                "Didn't like the structure",
                "It's a cool concept. I understand why so many people want to take it. But the class has many serious issues that need to be discussed.\r\n\r\nFirst, the most glaring issue is the false pretense that grades don't matter or don't make you happy. This is simply not true. Yes, it is true that we would have happier student populations if grades didn't exist, or if they were heavily reworked, but that is not the reality. The reality is that all of us, especially Yale students, are operating within a system where success is very directly correlated to our GPAs. Saying that \"grades don't make you happy\" is NOT an excuse for being relatively opaque about how grading will work in the class. The preliminary information for the midterm and final was very vague. A friend of mine asked Prof. Santos if the exam would be curved, and she was told that she shouldn't be worrying about her grade. I witnessed one of my friends try to convince herself that she was happy because she was blindsided by a B when she thought she was going to get an A. I've heard of many, many students who receive C's. In the happiness class. \r\n\r\nAlso, the major assignments (with, perhaps, exception of the midterm) were extremely stressful. I understand the idea of having 500 students design their own scientific study, but this class is not marketed to students with a scientific background. It is marketed to students of any background seeking to improve their subjective well-being. As an English major, I was excited to design my first own experiment. I followed all the instructions provided to me, and I took risks with my proposal and was probably over-ambitious. It was my first scientific proposal, and I was proud of it. You can imagine my dismay when I received a B- on it. My TA told me two things were wrong with it: it was not properly formatted for research, and it was over-ambitious. After that B-, my grade was unrecoverable, and I had to Credit/D/Fail the class. There was no opportunity to rewrite or to speak to someone about my grade, because nobody speaks to you about your grade, because that would shatter the notion that \"your grade doesn't matter.\" Besides, Prof. Santos wanted me to Credit/D/Fail the class anyway, because, again, \"my grade isn't going to make me happy.\" I know friends whose grade will forever drag down their GPA because they weren't expecting it to be so low. \r\n\r\nI have never seen a greater cohort of stressed-out students than the night before the final exam. Nobody knew what the format would be like, or how we would have time to be tested on over 100 terms and 12 weeks of lectures while also writing our FINAL WRITE-UP FOR OUR STUDY. We weren't even given reading period to prepare, because the final was taken during the last class, so we had to study for a final on top of all our end-of-year work. Plot twist: we didn't have enough time. Everyone had to rush on their final. Thank God I had given up trying on my study after receiving extremely discouraging feedback, because I would've been extremely upset to see the culmination of my hard work be a rushed few handwritten essays on a test that was too long for us to only be given an hour. \r\n\r\nAll of this being said, I did learn many extremely useful tips and strategies that I will take with me. I think if there was much less pressure to memorize and a lot of my frustrations were reworked, this could be an extremely useful class that leaves much more students happy that they took it. There will always be students who check out and stop going to lecture. But what I cannot comprehend is why students who DIDN'T check out, who WENT to lecture, were punished as well.",
                "Strengths were that it was a cool class, Professor Santos is an amazing lecturer and personality, and the stuff we learned about was actually interesting. Weakness was that the tests were made overly hard to try and get more people to take it Credit/D/F. While I understand the point of this within the purpose of the class, it is unfortunate if you wanted to take it Credit/D/F, but then ended up wanting to take a different course Credit/D/F instead and so you save it and now you might get a bad grade in this course.",
                "The course is well designed and organized. The slides and lectures are engaging themselves and Laurie Santos is amazing. Weaknesses include TOO much repetition. Some points from class were repeated too much and it became annoying and disengaging. Some concepts on how to be happy skimmed the surface and were iterations of things we hear in everyday life.",
                "I believe that all the material is easy to digest and learn, however sometimes it may be a bit too repetitive",

Otherwise, I would probably avoid it since the concepts are all intuitive so you don't learn all that much. Some of the studies are interesting but Prof. Santos doesn't spend too much time on them so you really only get the big-picture takeaways which are almost all predictable. The rewirements are a good chance to try some of the stuff Prof. Santos talks about probably my favorite part of the class.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend the course for the material, but only if the student did not care about their grade/was able to credit/D the class.  The grading was inconsistent, fluctuating between the quizzes basically just being a test of if you had been in class, to the midterm where many peoples grades took large hits.  A lot of it was stuff we kind of already know (or is intuitive), but with scientific proof and studies to back it up.",
                "No, despite being called psych and the good life, it made me more depressed, unhappy, stressed, and anxious than any of my other 4 classes. I was so excited to take this class, and worked hard to get into it, but it might have been one of my least favorite classes at Yale (and I even ended up taking it credit/d/fail, as the syllabus recommended). Some of the concepts taught go without even saying, and the exams didn't test these understandable course concepts, they asked for regurgitating definitions, citing studies that prove a certain term (not the name of the researchers, but having to know what they did and how they carried out the study), and fill in the blank questions on minute stuff that was only mentioned once. The main takeaways that I would think Prof. Santos would want us to have from the class (such as strategies to make us happier in our own life) were not the things remotely close to what the midterm and final tested us on. The course material was interesting at times, but I wish I had used my credit/d/fail credit on another,  better structured class.",
                "Yes because I actually learned a lot of good ways to help reduce my stress increase my happiness",
                "Yes! It really opens your eyes to the distinction between things that make us happy (e.g. social connection, prosocial acts, time affluence, etc.) and things that do not necessarily make us happy (e.g. money, beauty, good grades). This distinction is important to know, especially because many of us mistakenly think that things like good grades, expensive clothes, a lot of money, etc. will make us happy, when in reality they don't",
                "Yes, but be mindful that to actually get something out of it (i.e. to actually improve your happiness levels and start appreciating what you have in life) you really need to engage with the course by doing the 'rewirements' and caring. This can be hard when most people just don't put in the effort.",
                "Yes, but take that advice with a grain of salt. You have to work to implement the strategies from the course, or you won't see a difference in your happiness.",
                "I think a lot of students (including myself) came into this course with the idea that it was the \"happiness class\" and just a big gut. If this is what you think  do NOT take it. Many students were worried about receiving a poor grade in the course, and often felt stressed by the difficultly of the exams. In many ways, Psychology and the Good Life is just a normal psyc class, so I'd only recommend it if you're genuinely interested in the field of positive psychology.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. I engaged fully with this course- attended every lecture, did every rewirement, studied for the exams, did the readings. And it did not make me happier, it did not teach me anything new, it in fact left me actively more stressed and in a worse place than before. It's a pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps, victim-blaming course that I thought would be new and interesting and instead left me regretting that I had signed up at all. This class isn't life-changing  it's a pain and unnecessarily stressful experience that was not worth my time.",

                "Take it for the content. You will learn about some interesting studies and actual ways to be happier. But you do have to brace yourself for a couple of things: Prof Santos makes the grading unnecessarily hard...I had friends score in the 80s on a research proposal...not even the final project just the proposal. It also makes no sense that there are so many assessments in this class. Prof Santos tried to say that Yale makes her give everyone a grade (which is true) but giving a grade absolutely does not necessitate exams (based on every humanity class I've taken that's paper-based or the BENG class I'm in this semester that just has a presentation and participation). So Prof Santos can be really hypocritical in the way she chooses to assess students - I think it's part of the tactic to convince people to take the class Cr/D/Fail when it could just be based on projects and assessments that people could do well on but not have to study for like an exam. I think it's a little overhyped as \"the most popular class ever\" at Yale and that's gotten to Prof Santos' head a bit (ie taking the time to make slides with screen clippings of all of the news articles that have been written about the course...including in foreign languages) and it might be good to reassess the class and have a more humble attitude - leading by example. So with those downsides in mind, you can still really learn things from the content...I would say the content is solid but the external factors of the course are a bit suspect.",
                "yes, if you want to learn some new ways to think about happiness and the psychology behind what makes us happy and how to be happier",
                "No. Professor Santos is not a good teacher and the content is not interesting enough to put up with the bad teaching.",
                "It was interesting, but grading very unclear and frustrating.",
                "She say's it's not a gut, but it is. You don't need to do any readings except to do the first 2 quizzes (she drops 2/4) and studying the day of or a day before will get you good for the exams. Also, credit/d so you don't have to worry at all.",

The class is presented as a way to learn about well-being and begin putting those methods into practice since \"learning is not half the battle.\" The course emphasizes ways in order to reduce stress and Santos talks in-depth about why she wanted to teach this course which was of the concerning reports from college students across the country. What makes no sense is how Santos can be so aware of these issues and want to tackle them but feed into the issues just as equally, if not, more than other classes at Yale. The course unfairly and unrealistically assesses its students to the point that it makes all of the learned material pointless since you really will not feel any less stress or value on grades while taking the class. Although Santos will tell you that grades and hardships don't matter for your future happiness, she fails to consider an incredibly influential moment of one's life: the present. Honestly, this class presents itself like a band-aid to the problem that is Yale but really acts as further damage. So, I would not ever suggest someone take this course unless the models in which the material is examined change to match the mindsets that Santos is attempting to put onto her students.",
                "Aside from all the problems of positive psychology (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology#Criticism), the course content was just presented in a way that seemed really thoughtless, and at times it felt almost cult-ish. Pretty much every lesson went, \"You might think your brain works this way, but you're wrong, and here's studies that prove you're wrong.\" My issue is not with the statistical rigor of the studies presented, which Professor Santos made very clear to address over and over again with the meta-analysis train meme  my issue is that the course felt like a self-help book except with psychology sprinkled in here and there. Honestly I think taking this course greatly reduced my subjective well-being this semester.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This course teaches you a lot about the psychology of happiness. Even if you don't believe that you'll be happier after PSYC 157, it's worth taking just because the science is so interesting. \r\n\r\nI think this course in many ways gets a bad rep for promoting \"toxic positivity,\" for being a shallow & uninteresting class, or for being Yale's band-aid fix for their insufficient mental health resources. If you watched the PSYC 157 lectures, you would see that this is definitely not the case. Laurie Santos addresses many of the critiques during lecture, and it seems clear to me that most people's complaints are merely misinterpretations or hearsay. Also, it is not Laurie Santos's fault that Yale has terrible mental health support.",

I hate to be so brutal because Prof Santos is amazing and the course was taught pretty well, but I as well as many others I have spoken to did not belong in this course and sadly we wish we weren't taken off of the waitlist. \r\n\r\n*The course should be advertised to people who never took psych classes or freshman.

It's clear she knows and loves her subject, spends a lot of time preparing lectures and cares about us learning the material. I am incredibly grateful that I had the good fortune to secure a spot in PSYC 157. I learned a lot in this class that I genuinely think will improve my happiness. However, this is absolutely not a gutthe midterm and final were actually somewhat long and difficult. You'd learn just as much listening to her podcasts, without stressing about what your grade might be throughout the semester. If you take this class you have to go in knowing you'll take it credit Dotherwise, there's too much stress and uncertainty.",

However, if this course is taken as a primer for more psychology or social science courses at Yale, I do not think students will walk away pleased. The \"science\" referred to in lecture lacks much depth or significance. Many bar charts are posted in class with y-axes between 3.2 and 3.6, and prof.

This is obviously the most famous class at Yale so it's gonna receive a lot of hate, but there's actually a lot of great science covered in the class. If you really focus on the rewirements you'll approach life in a much better way by the end of the class. You also get the being in a famous Yale class experience which is fun too. It's very little work (no need to take notes in lecture because immaculate lecture notes are posted) and there aren't many graded assignments (lowest 2/4 quizzes are dropped). However, just beware that Professor Santos wishes she didn't grade anything in the class, and wants everyone to Cr/D/F, so she curves very harshly to encourage everyone to do that. PSYC 157 is still very much worth it though; just Cr/D/F for a lighter course load and really try to work on yourself in the class. It helped me a lot while also teaching me a lot about psychology in a low-stress manner.",

I would not want to put someone through that.",

As a person with depression, the information we learned in this course felt extremely performative and since the course is recorded and the information is distributed on other websites where non-students can participate in the course, it felt like the information wasn't really directed towards us students and a lot of what prof santos talked about was a bit oblivious to the issues that students actually experience. I definitely didn't become happier because of this course, and in some ways it was more often frustrating than rewarding.",

                "Maybe. It depends on what the student is looking for (or maybe what I think would be useful to them). If the student is more interested in the field of psychology than in personal happiness, I would recommend a different psychology class: this course doesn't really consider studies in a critical light, which I think would be important to anyone curious about the field.\r\n\r\nIf the student is looking for something rigorous, or is worried they might not have enough intrinsic motivation to do more than the bare minimum for the class, I would recommend either to take this class with friends who share your goals, or consider taking something like Perspectives on Human Nature, which I believe covers some of the same ground (immune neglect, hedonic adaptation).\r\n\r\nIf the student thinks they could be intrinsically motivated to take a class seriously even while disagreeing with the methods of the professor, or is most interested in the physical practice of happiness (i.e. the rewirements), or is just looking for a low-work class discussing some interesting features of the mind, I would recommend taking this class.",
                "Yes, I think if you take it seriously it has many positive individual implications.",
                "Yes",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another studentI believe that taking the course in my first year at Yale will make my Yale experience happier and more meaningful, and has set me down a more genuine major/career path. I would make the course required for all students.",
                "Eh. It really depends. If you don't care to look through all the surface-level BS, then sure. But there are better, more interesting classes to take at Yale.",
                "Yes. even if you don't get a good grade, the few nuggets of information that you pick up on will genuinely make you happier.",
                "I would recommend it if you're planning to take it with a friend. I took it with my roommate, and we held each other accountable for doing the rewirements and had fun laughing at the lecture memes together.",
                "Yes, but be sure to use a credit/D on it. You won't want to try to have to get a real grade. Also, don't make it one of your core courses for the semester. Just tag it on and halfway it. It's a nice thing to sit-in on.",
                "no, the class material was redundant. it felt like we learned nothing new the entire semester. the exams were made so difficult and asked super specific questions about individual experiments/studies even though we were told that we didn't need to memorize these. each question on the exams are worth so many points, so if you get just a few wrong, you're grade automatically plummets. you can't even ask the professor about your grade because she wants everyone to cr/d/fail. the homework/reading for the class was just a plug for her podcast. i did not enjoy this class at all.",
                "I would if they want to understand the sciences of well-being more but otherwise, I don't think it is absolutely necessary.",
                "I would recommend taking this course only if you plan on taking it credit/d/fail.",
                "Yes! I think I learned knowledge that I subconsciously apply everyday.",
                "yes!! but you have to be willing to put in the work and really think about how you can make changes to your life if you want to become happier",
                "yes",
                "No like it was my least favourite class at Yale so far, I actively hated it.",
                "Yes, only if they go in knowing that they are going to Credit/D/Fail the class.",
                "Yes! Definitely take it!! I learned so much!!! Thanks to this class, my Yale experience has been one of the best times of my life.",
                "yes! everyone need to learn these skills",
                "Yes, but be warned it is hard to get a good grade, so if you're a psych major or can't CDF you'll have to put in a lot of extra work.",
                "I would recommend auditing this course. The class itself is great and there are many interesting things to learn about in the class, but the structure of the course is flawed to the point where it's not worth taking as an actual course unless either it counts towards your major or you use it for a distributional requirement.",
                "I would only recommend if you know what you are getting into. You won't learn much, the workload will be low, and you will likely have to cred/d. If that's what you are looking for, then take this class.",
                "Yes, if youre looking for a basic overview of a very wide field. I think that if there had been more nuance on certain topics (I.e. looking at the race/gender/class breakdowns of certain studies) I wouldve enjoyed it more but it aimed for breadth over depth, more of a personal preference but I wouldve found that kind of analysis super interesting .",
                "Yes, HOC Santos is a great lecturer and every day is interesting! I found myself talking about all the studies after class.",
                "Yes, especially if you want to learn how to make yourself happier and more well.",
                "Only if you are willing to put up with laurie. The content is great.",
                "yes, you learn content with clear application to your life as a college student",
                "Yes!! Really special",
                "Not really unless they are very interested in psychology and can rote memorize well.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Your enjoyment of this class will depend on your reason for taking it. If you are genuinely looking for a fun class with a wonderful and caring professor, and are looking to put in the work to make changes to improve your life, you will find benefit in this class.",
                "Yes, but you have to be engaged with the material.",
                "Yes. I think a lot of the techniques and skills are either applicable to students' lives now, or if not there will be situations in the future where it will be helpful to have learned what things can be done to improve our overall well being.",
                "Absolutely not.",
                "Yes but dont expect an amazing life changing course, you get what you put into it. Also I lowkey kept comparing it to Thinking another psych course but thought that one was more interesting so look into that.",
                "Yes! I found The class very helpful in gaining perspective of whats important in life and just take a step back from the usual grinding rhythm of college academia.",
                "yes. it is interesting and helpful",
                "Yes! Lot's of the information may seem obvious but taking this class has helped me put many things in my life into perspective. I have used a lot of the methods and knowledge learned in the class without realizing it.",
                "I would recommend it as a low-challenge fifth class, especially if you are interested in learning a bit more about the little ways in which you can improve your well-being.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who I knew was going to fully invest in it and do everything they could to get the most out of it. I would not recommend this course to a student just trying to get through.",
                "Yes! I was engaging, not too difficult, and the content is really important.",
                "Not sure. I think it can definitely be helpful for some students, but I personally felt that the lessons for leading a happier life were all things that I intuitively understood going into the class, so Im not sure how much I got out of it. Its possible that the class will teach you things you dont know to help increase your personal happiness but dont be surprised if it doesnt.",
                "Yes, if you have no misconceptions as to what you are getting into by taking the course.",
                "No, not a gut but also can get boring.",
                "Yes, overall I thought the course was excellent and the content learned has had a positive impact on my life. The workload also was not very stressful.",
                "No, it is a waste of time. You will have to credit d fail it and honestly, it did not make me happier. If you are taking this class because you want a social science credit, go ahead. If there is any other reason you are taking it, do not.",
                "No! You should never take this course, it is a complete waste of time and mental energy. It does not teach you how to be happier and is instead focused only on ways that people fail and how we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps. There is no thought given to structural problems or any of the issues outside of our control. The assignments are not useful and do not help achieve the course goals. The exams are unfair and do not embody the spirt of the course at all. What is supposed to be a fun and useful class was instead a horrible fear inducing experience. This entire class is hypocritical. Litteraly take anything else!",
                "Not really, I feel like there are so many other classes you can take that is worth investing your education into. I mostly took this class because I liked having being able to say that I took the most popular Yale course taught by Laurie Santos, but in terms of what I learned an what I retained, it wasn't really a fruitful experience.",
                "Yes- pretty easy and a great way to learn strategies that can make you happier.",
                "I would not recommend this course to any other psychology or cognitive science majors, as a cognitive science major the amount of information in this course that was repetitive of what I have learned in other classes was extremely disappointing. I would only recommend this class for first year students, or upperclassmen who have never done anything remotely related to the social sciences",
                "Yes, if you care about your health and well-being I think that this may benefit you. Although you can probably find the studies/practices/advice on your own, its an easy class so you might as well take it.",
                "yes 100%. if you are struggling with mental health issues or just want to work on little things you can do to improve your happiness, definitely.",
                "Yes, it's a good overview of happiness research and gives concrete things you can do to increase well-being. It's only worth it if you engage with the weekly \"rewirements\" to help with happiness in your life. But good class overall. Nothing too hard, while being fairly engaging.",
                "yes, but understand that it is not a gut. you will have to study for the midterm and final.",
                "It's a cool class and pretty unique. Definitely one of the funner classes to take.",
                "Yes, it is a very interesting class and you can learn a lot about some surprising things about the way ours brains work and simple changes you can make in your life to be happier. If you implement the rewirements it probably won't cure your depression but can definitely help you have better, healthy habits",
                "Yes, the material is very interesting, and definitely worth learning.",
                "I would not recommend this class to another student since while I did learn a lot of findings from studies, this class was not as engaging as I hoped it would be.",
                "no",
                "I would recommend this course based on the chance that you can learn a lot about your mental and physical state if you truly invest in this course. It could be extremely beneficial.",
                "Take it with a grain of salt or tempered expectations. I recommend the class as a take for how unique and practical it is, but it's not going to solve all your problems.",
                "Yes it was very low key and learned a lot",
                "no",
                "Unfortunately, this class did not meet my expectations so I would most likely not recommend this course to another student.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is willing to credit-D it. If I had not been worried about my grades I would have really enjoyed how relaxing it was and taken helpful use of the hints. However, because I wanted to save my credit-Ds for courses I thought would be harder later in my Yale career, my stress about my grades in it (which was a surprise challenge) detracted from my ability to fully enjoy the course. If you can credit-D it sure, but if not, maybe just do the free online version.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I think it is crucial to take step's to improve one's own happiness. Especially at a place like Yale where people are often inclined to be high-achieving, it is important to have an opportunity to do some self-reflection on one's priorities.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yesssss!!!!! You learn real and simple ways to personally improve your happiness, which impacts your future self more than you think.",
                "no",
                "yes, if interested in psychology",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as it offers an interesting psychological insight into the science of well-being.",
                "I would recommend against taking this course. The concepts are simultaneously too simple and too specific to gain knowledge from this as a lecture. If it is ever offered as a seminar, it seems like it would be a much better course.",
                "I would recommend this course to everyone because the things you learn will definitely apply to your life, and if you commit to doing everything the course requires, you will become happier. However, this class isn't a gut, to the surprise of many people. If you can credit-d this class and take it definitely take it; if you are genuinely committed to being happier and are willing to do everything she recommends in the class whether it is for a grade or not, also take the class. Otherwise, yes it will be interesting but you won't actually benefit that much and could take a spot away from someone else who would have.",
                "nah",
                "I would neither make a strong recommendation for or against the course for another student. I think this course is what you make of it so someone would have to want to really take it on their own to get something out of it.",
                "Yes because it teaches you a lot about yourself",
                "If you want to have a fun class where you learn some fun facts, yes. But for a psych major or anyone who has taken psych classes before and is interested in really learning the psychology of this, it runs a bit too surface level to get anything more than a ok thats cool, next",
                "Most of the course is Prof. Santos going over psychology studies - if you are really interested just check out her podcast / recorded lectures",
                "I would NOT recommend this course to another student. It is ineffective in improving your well-being and you are not given a chance to do well in the course because \"grades don't matter.\"",
                "No, very hard to get an A and the content is super mid. Lots of handwavy explanations and pretty meaningless graphs. The tests are pretty hard and pretty much everyone I knew ended up taking it Cr/D/F which is ridiculous for a happiness class.",
                "Honestly, I'm not sure. I think it wasn't a difficult class conceptually but I walked out of lecture 90% of the time angry at something Laurie Santos said. It is helpful maybe if you're someone with little psych background and no mental health history, but I don't really feel like I learned much more than what I learned in my own research about mental health, and a lot of the lectures made me feel frustrated.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course.",
                "I don't think I would recommend this course to another student. I thought I would really enjoy it but it turned out to be a class where I was not that engaged with.",
                "I feel as though I gained from this course, especially as a Psychology major, but Im not sure that others would if they didnt have interest in the field. I wouldnt discourage students from taking this course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student at Yale, especially a freshman so that they can start implementing some of these tactics to improve their well-being while they're young at Yale!",
                "Nope",
                "Only if they truly are willing to do the work to become happier that we were given by the professor.",
                "Yes! This course made me rethink how I move through the world. Unlike most Yale courses, which do that through intellectual stimulation, this one felt more like a language course in that it was intellectually lightweight and more focused on building a skill. As long as you understand that going in, I think you'll find it a really satisfying experience.",
                "I would I think it can help you learn what can help you be a happier person and give you new strategies to do this",
                "I highly recommend this course for the mindless, hurried Yale student going from class to class, lecture to lecture, meal to meal without asking yourself: what do I actually want in life? For me, this class didn't automatically elevate my happiness, but it did show me the things I thought brought me happiness but simply don't matter, and the ways my mind suckswhich are arguably even more important. Like any course, you shouldn't go in with very high expectations that your outlook on life will be dramatically transformed, but I do think you should put in as much effort as possible.",
                "I would recommend this if you want actionable information to help you make better habits that will likely lead to more happiness. But, the mid-term and final can have tricky questions and you really have to study if you want a good grade (though you'll be STRONGLY encouraged to credit-d it).",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it discussed many parts of psychology that general classes don't take a lot of time to explore. I also find myself continuing to implement ideas from the course into my life.",
                "Yes I liked it. I did not like how she graded so I would warn them on that. It felt like she tried to tank our grades to prove to us that grades dont matter when all that did was cause us to stress about a class that is supposed to be anti grade stress. I wish she released herself from grades by evaluating us on effort and creativity of projects or something, not tedious details and memorization. It just felt very counterintuitive to the classes values.",
                "Yes, if you are Credit/D'ing. Psychology classes aren't a lot of work, but it isn't a walk in the park for a good grade",
                "I would, but I would warn them that it won't be as life-changing as it was marketed to be.",
                "I would recommend taking this course because it forced me to discover myself and how I can improve my life with my own action",
                "No- don't take it. It'd so overhyped and you never know what grad you could get. Not worth it and I feel like I gained nothing in terms of improving my happiness. All common sense and arbitrary conclusions.",
                "No, because it was poorly executed in the way that the professor didn't lead by example; all the things she promoted herself (such as for example notetaking in class to strengthen learning experience) she made it impossible to do so in class, on top of the fact that she says grades don't matter but was yet one of the harder graders I have ever had. And I've taken Orgo and Biochem...",
                "No",
                "Not in its current state, no. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it adds unnecessary stress to an already stressful Yale environment.",
                "I would recommend it. I enjoyed it overall and thought I actually took something away from it that will help me in my day to day life. Also helped me develop some good habits and made me just a better person to be around.",
                "Yes it is a fun and interesting class for psychology that proved useful in personal life aswell",
                "I would not just because I was so stressed because I was afraid I would fail the class no matter how much I worked or learned.",
                "I'm unsure. It was interesting, but as time went on it was repetitive and unengaging. So I'm neutral on it.",
                "I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student. I half-jokingly called this course \"Psychology and the Bad Life\" during the semester since it was by far and away my greatest source of stress and unhappiness during this past semester. If you do not CR/D/F the class, the unpredictable grading of tests makes the final grade in the class a complete gamble, especially with the harsh regrading policy in the syllabus that requires a full course review \"where Professor Santos is likely to be in a grouchy mood\" even for objectively incorrect grades. The class aims to force students to CR/D/F it, even if they do not want to for their own personal reasons. Even if the class is taken CR/D/F (as I did), the class still has a multitude of problems.\r\n\r\nThe lack of any guidelines on what pieces of information are important encourages students to memorize the most irrelevant information (i.e. that the 24 character strengths are Creativity, Curiosity, Open-mindedness, Love of learning, Perspective, Honesty, Bravery, Persistence, Zest, Kindness, Love, Social intelligence, Fairness, Leadership, Teamwork, Forgiveness, Modesty, Prudence, Self-regulation, Appreciation of beauty, Gratitude, Hope, Humor, Religiousness), which in turn makes the students stressed to study and take away less of the truly important parts of the class (i.e. the general idea that finding a career which appeals to your personal character strengths will make you happier). The class is pitched as a way to improve your happiness, but in reality, it is simply a class based on rote memorization of useless facts that won't make you happier. Similarly, the class is oftentimes ironic in its teachings. While it teaches the G.I. Joe Fallacy during the first week or two of class, it fails to understand the significance of the fallacy. The G.I. Joe Fallacy, in this context, says that simply knowing how to be happier won't make you happier. You would have to take action to improve your happiness.\r\n\r\nHowever, the tests in this class simply test whether you know how to be happier according to the lectures in class. While the class attempts to patch this ironic failure through the \"Hack Yourself\" final project, the project's associated writing tasks shift it from an activity that should be increasing your happiness to an activity that relies on memorization and knowledge rather than implementation.\r\n\r\nI am confident that Professor Santos has excellent intentions with improving the mental health of Yale's student body. However, I firmly believe that her attempt at improving our health through this class is a failure for a significant portion of the students that take it, oftentimes having the opposite effect on mental health. While taking the class, I often had the impression that Professor Santos did not truly have the intention of improving student mental health. I heard other students who asked Professor Santos for help and received an extremely unhelpful response that made these students feel isolated in their problems with the class. The class, I'm certain, could be restructured in a manner that would actually improve mental health. However, the current class design is very far from achieving this goal.\r\n\r\nWith a disastrous grading policy and an unhelpful teaching team, I would recommend that future Yale students avoid this class."
