                "I think this class was not what I was expecting, and that is definitely at least partially due to COVID. The lack of in person labs meant so many necessary resources were unavailable to us throughout the semester. Overall, it was lacking in this department, it was very hard to learn about a lot of the DAWs, and other concepts like MIDI without examples and without a proper lab section of this class. I want to believe that when these are available, this class would be much better but it felt very weak this semester, at no fault of the professor. The content we did learn though, the history and the examples given were always in depth and fun to learn about. Props for that.",

                "The strength of this course is how it sits on the intersection between STEM, the arts, and the humanities. The course traces the relationship between technological shifts in music production and subsequent musicological shifts. My biggest gripe with the course is that I would have wanted a more expansive history of modern music technology and more emphasis on the cultural history after the 1960s. Electronic, funk music, and hip-hop are all incredibly technology-dependent genres of music, and I would have liked more breadth to focus on these subjects alongside the many weeks of musique concrete we discussed. Sometimes it also felt like we were being tested on material that wasn't discussed in class or the readings, and had to search for answers online.",

However, that was obviously not the main focus of the course, and the course was very well taught and were very informative. I learned a lot and felt my creative skills being nurtured.",
                "The course material itself was very interesting and helpful; however, I found it less than helpful that the class was only lecture, with basically no participation from students. It seems like the course material would lend itself to a more interactive or hands-on style class, instead of the professor just doing demos all the time.",

You'll learn about the wacky\/weird (and super interesting) histories behind the tools and sounds of contemporary music, as well as how they might be used (although this is very much NOT a course on music production). Konrad is also a Max\/MSP wizard (and a super friendly and good-humored professor), and he puts together tons of his own cool interactive demos for each lecture. Only two downsides were that weekly two-hour 9:25am lectures on Zoom can be a drag, and labs were often not very enjoyable (despite our TA's enthusiasm, most people's cameras would remain off, lots of breakout room activities that didn't feel very engaging or helpful).\r\nAlso: if you're CPAR + Music, definitely take this course as early as you can. The material isn't super challenging, and it serves as a good introduction to ideas that you'll be encountering again in greater detail in other classes (esp. synthesis techniques\/how sound works in the digital domain). I took this after taking CPSC 432 and some of Konrad's other classes, and it sometimes felt like it was covering the basics of stuff I had already learned 2 or 3 times in other classes.",

I don't believe this class if meant to be taken the way it was taught this year, I felt like I've learned very little and have only become a little more familiar with DAWs. Again, I don't believe this to be at the fault of anyone, but rather the circumstances did not allow this class to be what it is meant to be. I want to believe I would recommend this class if I took it under normal circumstances, but I guess I'll never know.",

I would not recommend this to a student in search of a Sc\/QR gut, as I watched many students struggle with those concepts when set against the musical background needed for the class. Lastly, there were certain elements of musicological analysis that were difficult to parse as a non-musician in this class, so I would note that non-musicians may have to put in a little extra effort to keep up in this course.",
