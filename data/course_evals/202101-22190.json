All of the one-on-one office hours before and after essays were extremely helpful in identifying areas for me to improve in essay writing and close reading. Sometimes feedback on essays took too long to receive though, and in the beginning of the semester the discussion post homework was a bit tedious, and thankfully that was reduced as the semester progressed.",

Professors had a great ability to explain the texts and I value the fact that they focused our discussions on how texts work, even if discussions sometimes tended towards more ethical evaluation of characters.",
