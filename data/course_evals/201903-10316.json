    "Very well taught by Professor Sanneh, with a low workload compared to other language classes. However, the gentle way she taught made me learn more in this class than in any of the other 3 language classes I've taken here at Yale!",
    "Thisha is the greatest strength of this class! She is a wonderful professor and makes class enjoyable every single day. The variety of assignments were interesting and varied. Everything we learned in class had practical applications and made me feel prepared to have real conversations with people in Zulu. The small class size was another strength because Thisha could really adapt to our needs and focus on our individual growth.",
    "Strengths: I loved how well South African culture was incorporated into the course.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "This course is amazing. In this course I have been fully engaged in class every single day, which is unusual in a course that meets daily, and have enjoyed the content immensely. Thisha makes sure that we learn a variety of things, with the syllabus including music and documentaries about cultural matters. This well rounded syllabus allows for us to both learn about Zulu in a more complete way and keep the class interesting. I would not change anything about this course.",
    "No weaknesses. Professor Sanneh is so cool. She's extremely knowledgeable and conducts class in an engaging way. She makes sure to present both the Zulu language and the history of the Zulu people in South Africa."

    "YES! Please, take this course. It gives you such a valuable background on the language and the culture of the amaZulu. Would have regretted not taking this course so so much.",
    "Absolutely! This was my most enjoyable course of the semester and I truly looked forward to coming to class each day. Zulu is a language that challenges you and has a fascinating history and culture along with it. Thisha is a fantastic professor who cares about her students and makes the language so fun to learn!",
    "Yes, 100%. Amazing language class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. It is enjoyable and, because of that, I feel like I have learned more in this past semester than I would have had I chosen to take another language.",
    "Yes - Thisha is great!!",
    "Absolutely. If you're genuinely interested in the language or in South Africa, please take the course."
