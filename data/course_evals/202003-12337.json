                "The programming assignments were well-designed and were a great way for me to engage with the material and understand the concepts from class. The written assignments were also helpful. The lectures were generally well-organized and easy to follow with plenty of opportunities for discussion and questions when something wasn't clear.",

                "Strengths: Professor Piskac is a pretty great lecturer and is clearly passionate about the subject. Both the professor and TA were readily available to answer questions and meet over Zoom.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More work that I anticipated. We had 6 hw assignments (which is the total workload of some other CS classes) along with 4 coding projects, at least 2 of which were quite a bit of work.",
