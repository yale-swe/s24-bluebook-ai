I've also learned that each city is very different, and policies for each city should be carefully considered according to the city's context."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: super interesting topic, very engaging professors with alot of knowledge, nice breadth of issues discussed\r\nWeaknesses: no one really has a background in the topic, so sometimes the discussion could feel a bit forced",
                "Strengths: I loved the organization of the class, with each week focused on a different topic. The topics were perfectly selected, and the readings that accompanied each reading were super interesting. The instructors' unique background as practitioners (rather than academicians) was such a breath of fresh air. I also loved that they organized a field trip to NYC to see some of the sites we had discussed, and coordinated an end-of-semester reception.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The instructor presentation often covered material similar to the readings, and then the student presentations recapitulated the readings again. It might be cool to have student presentations apply the topic of the week to a specific city other than the ones referenced in the reading. The class also focused a lot on New York City, which was great because the instructors have a lot of experience in NYC, but it would be great to have a broader range cities included.",
                "Strengths are leminar format. Weaknesses are lengths of readings.",
                "Strengths: I really liked the lecture\/seminar hybrid this course had. I also love the topics and the way the content was presented. Each lecture was like a little ted talk, and it was always so well researched and put together by the professors. If you are interested in cities in any way, this is a great class to take!",
                "The professors are genuinely invested in the course and the students and the thematic approach facilitated discussion. Would have liked to have gotten more insight on professors real world issues.",
                "Strengths are the interesting material, the good prompts for writing pieces, and that the professors have real world experience. The weaknesses are that the lectures\/class discussion could be designed better. I think the half lecture \/ half discussion format we did this semester was suboptimal.",
                "The strengths: the class were set up to be half lecture and half student led presentations\/discussions. This was a good format because it enabled us to have larger scope historical and theoretical context. the field trip to NYC was cool.\r\nThe weaknesses: literally so hard for no reason - the grading on the papers was super harsh and particular when they did not give us any instruction besides a prompt - we were told to be creative with the final paper (which was 15 pages) and then was penalized for not offering concrete policy? (this was not a public policy class - we barely even went over more political or legislative aspect; more so, this was a college seminar in which a lot of the students were second semester seniors, so there was no reason for it to be that difficult ; finally, the class discussions were not that interesting because clearly no one did the lengthier theory\/historical readings (only the contemporary journalism) and it was just everyone throwing around their personal opinions or anecdotes",
                "I personally did not like the apportionment of class time in this seminar. Interestingly, the instructors said that the current structure was in response to past student comments. At the beginning of each week's 1hr 50min class, the instructors gave an introductory lecture for 20-50 minutes. Then, a preselected pair of students summarized the readings, laid out themes, and posed discussion questions, which took another 10-20 minutes before we could finally start class discussion. What this essentially meant was that you could get away without doing any readings except for the week where you presented on them. Plus, I usually felt that discussions did not go deep enough as a result of the limited time.\r\nI much preferred the structure of CSBF 350 that I'd taken the prior semester, where the instructors assumed we had all done the readings and did not waste vital discussion time going over them again. \r\nOne definite strength was that the instructors were both obviously knowledgeable and super keen to share their learning with us  especially during the class field trip that showcased New York's resiliency. Additionally, Mat and Manasvi worked great as a teaching team  obviously good friends (and *nothing* more) and with skillsets that complemented each other.",
                "Strengths: I like how each class begins with a lecture about this week's topic. Mat and Manasvi often give a history and great examples. I also appreciate how every week there are two students who present this week's readings to summarize and start off the discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1) Timing. Tuesday 7 pm - 8:50 pm makes it really difficult to concentrate and actively engage in discussions. I do understand why the timing is set like this, but if you know you can't concentrate for two hours on Tuesday evenings, consider carefully if you want to take this class. \r\n\r\n2). I wish the instructors can talk more about their insights and thoughts during lectures, instead of just giving a very fact-based presentation. I know they are experts in the field and I wish to hear more about their thoughts. \r\n\r\n3). Discussions are too long and sometimes not engaging. I wish instructors can facilitate the conversation better, because sometimes people just talk ab about examples or things they want to talk about, instead of answering the discussion questions. \r\n\r\n4). Size of the class. Seems to be a bit too big for a constructive conversation."

                "No, don't do it. It is easy but you won't get anything out of it besides a few fun facts about cities and urban planning. I guess you can take it Credit\/D but you can take other classes that will be more exciting.",
                "In its current structure, I think you'd be better off taking a proper urban studies course for more serious, focused learning. That said, for seniors like a lot of us in the course were, it was a relaxing way to spend Tuesday night and earn a course credit.",
                "Yes - if you want a light workload class (except the 15 page paper at the end), and don't know much about urban studies - this can be a great intro seminar and interesting discussions \r\n\r\nNo - if you know you can't concentrate for two hours every Tuesday evening"
