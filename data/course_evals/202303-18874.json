                "I developed an important skill of how to read academic papers with complex jargon and difficult concepts. I also continued to develop the skill of learning from differing perspectives in terms of different academic backgrounds and areas of interest.",
                "I learned a lot about astronomy and physics, but also a much better understanding of science and science research in the U.S. and a much better idea of what science is and how it works.",
                "Coming into this course I knew nothing about astronomy or cosmology. After just one semester I have a very good grasp of all the basic concepts and more. I also learned how to write scientific papers and how to present like a physicist. This class has inspired me to become an astronomy major. At the beginning I didn't understand what anyone was saying and I felt very lost and behind, but at the end I could answer any question and I knew how to form my own questions.",
                "I learned a lot about cosmology - things like the nature of the expansion of the universe, dark energy, dark matter, etc. I also learned how to digest and analyze scientific research papers.",
                "I developed an extensive knowledge of astronomy and cosmology. I had no previous knowledge of astronomy coming into this course, so I definitely feel like I was able to learn about cosmological history from the Big Bang to the present. I developed a great appreciation for astronomy and the necessity of the field. Some of my favorite topics to learn about were relativity, the Cosmic Microwave Background, nucleosynthesis, and the multiverse.",
                "I learned a lot about different aspects of the universe, which I found extremely interesting. I can say that after taking this course, I will definitely look into taking other astronomy courses for science credits.",
                "I gained systematic and frontier knowledge about time and space, special relativity, general relativity and cosmology. To be specific, I learned about different theories in astronomy and celescial objects and phenomena like supernovae, blackholes, gravitational lensing, etc. Aside from the scientific knowledge, I also learned about how scientific educational systems work nowadays, fun historical stories about scientists, and how professional astronomical research is carried out."

                "Strength: Really interesting material, topics were broken down into chunks that were understandable for someone who had very little experience in astronomy.\r\nWeakness: Canvas was disorganized after we were behind a few days, leading to assignments being due sometimes at unclear times.",
                "I love how much ground the course covered, but sometimes I felt like we glossed over some key phenomena because other students had some background info on it already",
                "The topics covered are very interesting and Professor Urry is very good at explaining these difficult topics in a way that is easy to understand",
                "I really enjoyed the way this course was taught. It was a good mix of discussion and lecturing; this made it relatively easy to engage in the content, which generally made it easier to understand. Moreover, Professor Urry was a great instructor in terms of going slowly through the difficult parts of astrophysics, encouraging engagement by allowing us to try and derive equations and concepts, and keeping this STEM course relatively open for all areas of interest.",
                "The course is incredibly inventive and engaging. It can be disorganized at times, but Prof. Urry is wonderful and you can always talk to her.",
                "The strengths of this course were the speed we were able to cover the topics. We were given articles that were very easy to follow and discussion in class was fun and engaging. I didn't see any weaknesses.",
                "A strength is its accessibility for students who do not have a lot of prior knowledge on the subject. I appreciated the variety of the teaching style as well - presentations, guest lecturers, seminars, etc.",
                "The strengths of this course are Professor Urry's effective classroom discussions and lectures. The weekly writing assignments are also a great place to express questions and opinions. The weakness of this course is the weird flow of the final assignment. Although, while in the class, no one would prefer that the final paper be due before the final poster draft and presentation, this makes more sense for preparing people for the presentation. Also, a 5000-word paper really is quite time-consuming, even in comparison to most English classes' assignments.",
                "The strengths of this course were the readings because they allowed me to have some knowledge of what was going to be discussed in the lecture. Plus, I really enjoyed the discussions of this course because I was able to have different perspectives of the content.",
                "The strength is the professor's amazing understanding of the subject and intriguing story-telling. She structured the course very well and gave us enough information to make us half a professional in the field. It could be improved by adding more field content or hands-on materials."

                "Yes absolutely great class!!!",
                "Yes, this course was very interesting. I think this course is what Yale is trying to present in terms of exploring courses, as this course was introductory, yet still explanatory. While I don't believe myself to be an astrophysicist, I do think that it is something I could end up doing. Physics is generally a difficult course for most people to grasp, yet this class was welcoming, encouraging, and I felt like I was able to enjoy thand is class despite its roots in difficulty.",
                "I would definitely recommend it. Take it if you can. It's so rare and special that you get to take such an engaging science course with such a wonderful professor in a small environment, though you should be warned that it can be a lot of work.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. No matter what your major is, it helps you understand the value of science and makes you rethink the way you view the world. I wish I could take this course again, it was that good.",
                "Yes. For anyone interested in cosmology, you will leave the class having learned a lot about the field.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody who wants an introduction to the world of astronomy and astrophysics with no prior experience. This is also a great opportunity to meet other freshman.",
