Also, in other universities the process of making the capstone project is the opposite of what we did in class: study and develop a chemical process and have everything work -then, you do the economic analysis. You do not do the project for the sake of the analysis.",

Overall it was not as challenging as I thought it would be but I still feel like I got a lot out of it and am proud of our project in the end.",
