    "Basically refreshed Spanish skills after a couple years away from the language.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of some of the nuances of Spanish grammatical structure, which I will be helpful as I apply my language skills in the future.",
    "My Spanish language skills declined throughout the year.",
    "Grammatical and writing skills improved significantly, as did reading comprehension. Oral and listening skills improved somewhat, but I felt that these aspects were neglected in comparison (NOT in terms of grading - I would have appreciated more low-pressure opportunities to develop these skills not more tests\/ presentations\/ grades in these areas)",
    "My speaking greatly improved and I got pushed out of my comfort zone to speak more.",
    "I reviewed my Spanish grammar and practiced speaking.",
    "A better grasp of advanced spanish grammar and reading ability.",
    "I gained increased fluency, fluidity, and confidence speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish.",
    "Literally nothing just got graded harder than Spanish 3",
    "I gained more knowledge about Spanish culture and more in-depth grammar."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths include the use of a variety of learning methods including reading, conversing, watching videos and presenting. Weaknesses include the large amount of work to do each night for class the next day. To improve this course, there should be a greater emphasis on \"quality\" over \"quantity.\" A curve should be applied to average out the grades across all sections to make up for grading discrepancies and inconsistencies across professors.",
    "This course was not organized well  to facilitate learning. The homework completed the night before class was usually completed for a second time in class the following day.",
    "Very rigorous course (much more than SPAN 130) - your Spanish skills will definitely improve at least somewhat in all aspects of the language. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the course can be incredibly time-intensive, and that is something to be aware of. Class five days a week, as well as daily homework (which is divided into two sections - \"homework\" and \"preparation for next day\", seemingly just for the purpose of being able to assign more work). Some days it may be very light (not more than 20-30 minutes) and then other weeks each night homework for this class takes 2-3 hours (multiple assignments each night, on top of preparing for presentations, exams, etc.). I think a better effort to evenly distribute the workload, or be more flexible in this aspect when students are overwhelmed with exams for other classes as well, could help make the same amount of work much more manageable.",
    "There needs to be a standard of grading throughout the entire course. Our teacher graded according to the rubric, while other teachers graded very easily, almost \"handing out\" good grades.",
    "I think the course was pretty well designed but the instruction wasn't great. The course could benefit from more collaborative in-class activities.",
    "Any course that provides this many opportunities to speak in Spanish will improve one's proficiency with the language. The workload is extreme, and I saw it demoralize some students in the class and decrease their engagement with the material. Many of the students in my section also struggled with the professor.",
    "The course says it is speaking centered but the opportunities to talk were limited and the few presentations did not even compare to the influence written grades had on final grades.",
    "The strengths were the number of materials presented to help the students engage with the class. It contained a lot of activities, some more helpful than others. The weaknesses were the lack of exam preparation-- would like to have had more exercises.",
    "Incredibly stressful; instructors could be more well-versed in what they teach and be better trained to respond to questions with actionable answers."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No, I would not recommend this course due to the great amount of work that must be put in for only small percentages of the grade. I strongly suggest Spanish 130, though.",
    "Yep. Learning another language is good.",
    "As a whole, L4 Spanish reinforced a lot of important learning that is fundamental for the progression of Spanish, and for students seeking advancement I would recommend this course.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course. If you must take it to fulfill a requirement, it is worth it to wait for a professor with great reviews.",
    "If you are serious about wanting to improve your Spanish and are willing to invest the amount of time, go for it. It will definitely pay off. If you already are going to have a busy semester though (either from the workload of other classes, extracurriculars, or a combination), it might be better to wait for a less intense semester to take this course.",
    "I would, but the department-wide issue of fair grading needs to be addressed.",
    "I would recommend the course, but not with this instructor.",
    "Read professor reviews carefully. It's a fine way to fulfill a language requirement, and I think being able to speak Spanish is super important. But also, college is hard, and I don't think that L4 Spanish should ever cause as much frustration and misery as I saw it cause this semester.",
    "Literally never. I will discourage anyone from taking it unless they have to and unless they are sure they will test into L5 to take L1 Spanish.",
    "Yes, if the student is particularly interested in learning the Spanish language and wants to challenge themselves. No, if the student does not have time for a lot of busy work.",
    "Absolutely not - take SPAN 140 with literally any other professor except Professor Vazquez. She maintains a vindictive atmosphere in which the student is berated and humiliated with little explanation for their failures and how to improve. This class was the source of 90% of my academic stress, not even because of content, but because of how the class was run. I felt like I couldn't ask for help without retaliation for not understanding the material on my own the first time. Instructor also repeatedly singles out and heavily criticizes specific students."
