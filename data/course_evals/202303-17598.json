                "My ability to analyze and engage with theories and discussions on a fairly wide range of questions about Latin American nation-building was significantly improved. In addition to learning a lot of important content not just about various historical events and trends in different regions in Latin America, I learned to think critically about the actual study of Latin America, and the ways that various historical theories and scholarship have affected these events. This course was incredibly important in developing the way I understand international political and economic engagement in general, in allowing me to learn about a lot of relevant content in class discussions and weekly readings, but providing the freedom and guidance to study more specifically what I am interested in on a personal level in the final research project.",

                "The syllabus for this course was really well-constructed, with all the readings providing relevant new insights that enabled class discussions to be informed and engaging. We were able to identify thematic continuities in the material provided each week, but the ideas in the articles were also thought-provoking on their own. The weekly discussion posts\/response essays really helped to contribute to this engagement, although at times the noon deadlines the day before class were a little tricky, especially because they were not open for late submissions if you needed flexibility for partial credit. Overall, however, I think all of the assignments were strategically chosen to help us strengthen analytical and practical skills, which I know I will use throughout the rest of my time at Yale.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in looking at the unique way that ethnicity factored into processes of nation-building and independence in Latin America. While the course material is quite specific, I found that much of the content also created space to identify theoretical or more abstract historical questions that are relevant for any history class one might take. Additionally, Professor Echeverri works with students to make sure they have experience in approaching historical research and understanding the more practical skills a historian needs in the course assignments which included a book review and research proposal with a complete literature review and bibliography.",
