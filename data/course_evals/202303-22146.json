                "Fall DS Literature is a wonderful crash course in close reading and literary analysis. Even just by virtue of working through the reading list, youll gain an immense understanding of literary developments and trends across early Western literature. In seminar, youll be put to the test intellectually with a professor and classmates that care deeply about the material and about pushing each other to come up with the best ideas possible. I learned how to be a better reader and writer from this class, yes, but I also learned just how impactful a good seminar can be.",
                "I learned how to approach ancient texts from other cultures, and the nuances of analyzing texts in translation. I how to do literary analysis as a group, as well as alone, and how to be a productive member of a seminar. We worked closely with each text and often referred to our copies, which was a different way of engaging than I had tried before. I also developed my written interpretation skills in a less thesis-driven and more question-driven format with the course papers, and got better at considering the different useful ways of approaching a text. \r\n\r\nI got to cover an amazing range of important and fascinating texts across a large time period and several cultures, and learn about what connects and divides them! That was the best part.",
                "While I did learn a lot about the texts themselves, the main takeaways from DS are the close reading and discussion skills I nurtured in reading, attending seminars, and writing papers.",
                "The ability to compose a close analysis paper based on very focused passages. Meta interpretation of literature across the western canon. Most importantly the ability to do quick thinking in tackling certain parts of the text in discussion seminars inspired by other's ideas."

                "Strengths: Professor LeVen. If you get the opportunity to take this class with her, DO IT. She is not only sweet and caring, but also deeply knowledgeable about the material and excellent at giving written feedback. Taking fall DS with an expert classicist makes a real difference, and PLV is the best of the best. Weaknesses: as with any DS class in any semester with any professor, the reading load is quite high. But if youre doing DS, thats what you signed up for! Ill also add that, of the three tracks in the Fall, I found literature the most enjoyable to do the reading for.",
                "The syllabus was absolutely a strength of this course-- it wasn't an overwhelming amount most of the time, and each text felt like we could have spent the whole semester on it. I thought the different works were well integrated with one another and part of the fascination was seeing things like how Sappho responded to Homer with the 'double consciousness' of womanhood as opposed to how Virgil did so from a Roman imperial perspective-- really building a picture and giving me an idea of what I wanted to explore more. The seminar format was also a big strength of this course because everyone had different knowledge to contribute, whether of Latin or of architecture or of Arabic culture.\r\n\r\nProfessor LeVen was an enormous strength of this course! It was a pleasure and an honor to learn from her, and she did an excellent job directing discussion and keeping us on track while also pursuing interesting points and keeping things lively. She teaches with an amazing combination of directness, humor, professionalism, and incredible expertise (don't miss the Sappho lecture, I beg you). She brought out the best in us and gave specific, concrete feedback both informally in seminar and on our essays. She made each text so much more interesting and accessible, while also being unafraid to tackle abstraction and nuance. I highly recommend taking any class taught by her. On grading-- she didn't coddle us, but she wasn't harsh by any means. I found her to be scrupulously fair and clear about what she wanted us to improve, and she prioritized our actual education without destroying our GPAs. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can really mention was the exam. It feels kind of ridiculous to have that kind of final in a course like this, and it asked us to do basically the opposite of all the things we learned to do with the course-- a timed essay from memory rather than close engagement with the text, regurgitation of topics rather than close-reading and questioning, etc. It was only a small part of my experience in the course, but it was exhausting and stressful, and I think DS exams should be reduced or eliminated. Maybe some close reading of passages by itself would serve.",
                "Strengths: Professor LeVen completely changed the way I read literature. She also gives you very detailed feedback for papers and looks out for all of her students. DS in general will greatly benefit close reading and discussion skills.\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any.",
                "Strength: a pungent potpourri of the ancient literature texts. Professor LeVen is a master in steering conversations during seminars and even more of an expert in guiding people voice their own precious analysis. Sometimes the discussion would be so hard-hitting and unforgettable that it sticks with you even when you encounter another text.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Common to all DS classes. All of the texts could be food for thought enough for an entire semester but we dapple through them with only a week or so."

                "I absolutely recommend taking Fall Lit. With PLV. She is my favorite professor at Yale so far.",
                "Absolutely. This was probably my favorite DS track, largely because of Professor LeVen, but also because of the syllabus and the amazing lectures. Literature presents a different challenge than the other two tracks-- we have to understand the works in their own context, but also bring ourselves to them and consider what they do in a contemporary context and how modern ideas like our notions of gender sort of reach back to create a different form of the text. It's not really possible to find a singular or reductive answer to the questions we ask, but it's pretty cool to distinguish useful from unhelpful ways of approaching texts and try to find new interesting ways of exploring them (like eco-criticism of Ovid)! The close-reading that you do in this track is invaluable.",
                "I cant recommend enough Professor LeVens class. I learned so much about how to read these ancient and medieval texts that are difficult at first but have so much to offer once one learns what to pay attention to. Professor LeVens research interests also bring unique perspectives of sound, metamorphosis, etc. to the table.",
                "DS is a whole package and no in-betweens. It's like driving a car for the first time and choosing to start with Manhattan in a 2005 prius. I mean sure, bruises and bumps and weird discouraging shouts from people twice your age with accents from all over the world (in LeVen's case, French) are bound to follow you, but hell, you get to see times square and Hudson river and all the hits in one tour."
