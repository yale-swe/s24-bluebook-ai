                "You learn how to draw and not give up on the drawing. It is hard to explain but you learn alot more than just drawing - just another perspective.",
                "I learned the basic skills of drawing and how to accurately depict scenes in real life on paper.",
                "This course provided consistent practice with line, gesture, value, shape, and more. Most classes were structured in a way where we were assigned an exercise (such as drawing gestures of a model), and Kern routinely provided helpful feedback. By the end of the class, I felt that my eye was better trained to see the relationship between various drawing techniques.",
                "How to draw better mostly, and also just about some artist concepts in general",
                "In the course, I was able to continue practicing my drawing skills, including my approach to line, value, and perspective. Since I had a background in drawing before the course, I wasn't introduced to any new techniques. Instead, I was pushed to work bolder and on a larger scale.",
                "I was able to enhance my drawing skills and help me realize that I want to be an art major",
                "There was a lot of freedom in this class. As a result, it required much more critical thinking . The prompts were extremely open-ended, which put more pressure on me to interpret them in a way that was authentic and unique. This is important to me when Im taking an art class. \r\nThe class was structured in increments of looser drawings, which were dependent on larger arm movements and quick strokes and then, longer intensive studies, before sharing our work at the end of class. With this structure, I was able to warm-up, loosening my body and allowing me to pinpoint/depict the subject accurately before a more sustained observation. If I didnt have these 10 1 minute drawings routinely, I dont think I wouldve grown as much.\r\nWe studied an array of topics such as perspective, shadow/light, contour drawings, and portraiture. Ive never accurately drawn a face from a live model. With the pressure of the time constraints, it actually helped me to reduce the figure into abstract shapes and proportions. In fifteen minutes, I was able to accurately depict my classmate. Im pretty proud of that.",
                "This class honestly opened my eyes to the world of art. Before taking this course I had not thought much about the life of artists, nor had I given much thought to the intentional decisions in made in art works, but after having taken this course I only regret not having taken it earlier."

                "The strengths of the course was that we got to explore how to draw and which drawing style fits us the most while being pushed to a higher level of drawing. There was not any real weaknesses.",
                "Overall, this course was very well put together. The skills taught through experience were very important.",
                "I enjoyed how open-ended the assignments were, creating room for experimentation. Kern was also very available and approachable, so his presence was a huge strength of the course.",
                "Strength was the instructor, very nice and lenient.",
                "Before the course, I rarely drew, opting for other mediums. The course illuminated the power of drawing as a medium to approach realism and the playfulness that accompanies the practice. A strength of the course was the freedom to explore with assessments and put our own spin on assignments. A weakness of the course was the frequency of drawing practice and lack of specific instruction. Without a background in drawing, the lack of feedback could leave one feeling lost. Since there was no homework assigned, progress from practice drawing regularly was diminished.",
                "Strengths: room to fail and mess up and try new things \r\nWeakness: fluid class allowed for lack of effort at times but it was really in the student.",
                "As I mentioned above, those are some of the strengths. Kern and Jonathan were extremely helpful as well. With each drawing, from classroom exercises to final projects, theyd comment and direct us without initiation. I think sometimes it can be hard for me to ask for help, but their constant engagement was thoughtful and critical for growth. \r\nThe classroom was structured in a way where everything was predictable. As a result, I felt extremely comfortable in the classroom.\r\nSomething that I disliked was the lack of homework in the class. Although we were expected to practice outside of class (and I did), I was disappointed by the lack of overall final projects. However, this might just be a bias given that I am an intended art Major, who has had rigorous drawing classroom experiences in the past. I know that once I take more advanced classes, the number of personal projects assigned will increase and workload.",
                "I think that as an intro course, the class has the challenge of teaching to students with a wide variety of experience levels. In my opinion, the professor and the TA did a good job at giving personal feedback and still encouraging growth, but occasionally the instructive portions were somewhat simple. I do not know if there is a solution to this because the explanations were necessary for those who had not taken drawings classes before, but may have been less useful for more experienced students. The course is a required prerequisite for art majors, so it was necessary that I took the course and I did find it beneficial. Having the opportunity to draw from live models, get instructor feedback while drawing, and just having the class time to focus on practicing different techniques was definitely worthwhile and improved my drawing ability.  My one suggestion would be to have more, smaller assignments that would be completed outside of class to help practice new material. Our only outside-of-class assignments were the midterm and the final, but I believe that more frequent assignments could have been helpful, such as a few hours of still life drawing, drawing a portrait of a friend, practicing value/line/perspective, etc. so that we would spend more time per week drawing.",
                "The course will most likely vary depending on one's professor, I had friend taking this course with a different professor that had a much higher workload, so that could perhaps be a weakness. But aside from that this course was perfect for me (I was taking a lot of STEM classes this semester) because it let me clear my head and just focus on my work before me."

Its a good foundational course that allows all artists of any level to practice in a safe, respectful environment, where all are able to grow. The workload isnt intense, which is beneficial for non-art majors because art is so time consuming and makes it manageable so that students are encouraged to take it.",
