                "This class was so well organized. Not for a single second did it feel like I was learning something just for the hell of it. Truly, the structure of the course, from the lectures to the lab, felt like Professor Gee and others who may have designed the course actually valued our time and were invested in us as students. It was nice to feel human in a course this way.",
                "More analysis of SPSS in lecture",
                "For me, the pace of this class was great, although there were some lectures that felt overdone and unnecessary. The homework assignments were fun, like puzzles, and they held interesting studies. I also really appreciated the structure of the exams, since I felt like I could focus on interpreting data rather than worry about my writing, during the class periods.",
                "Professor Gee is fantastic! She really does her best to make lecture as engaging as possible and the TFs are generally pretty helpful as well. The workload for this course was extremely manageable. There was a pset due every week that took maximum an hour and a half to complete. In addition, the midterm and final are very straightforward. There really were not weaknesses for this course at all and would highly recommend this course for anyone needing a QR credit.",
                "Strengths: pace was very manageable, prof was very approachable, midterm and final reflected the course and past assignments very well. Weaknesses: the content was very surface level and I feel that the course could have been more engaging if we went a little deeper.",
                "Strengths: Dr.Gee is a very engaging professor. She's very kind and she really cares about her students. She's always willing to help and she will go out of her way to help students understand the material. \r\nWeaknesses: Some homeworks were a little long.",
                "Strength: professor and TFs are all great\r\nWeakness: easy to lose interest",
                "Strength: great content, great testing strategy\r\nWeakness: the intro week or two were a bit slow",
                "Strengths include the organization of the class and the clarity of the lectures, as well as Prof. Gee -- she is so very kind and caring and really tries to make the course as effective and painless as possible for each student! I'd say the main weakness is that the lectures and sections sometimes feel pretty disconnected since we discuss the analyses during lecture and only learn how to run them in SPSS during section. That said, after the class mentioned this in mid-semester feedback, Prof. Gee made a big effort to merge the two more! Also, the amount of content to be covered in different sections was somewhat inconsistent, and my section sometimes had to rush through the content.",
                "This course was great. The Professor and TAs were very helpful!",
                "Strengths--Lectures are recorded, and Professor Gee is an excellent and engaging lecturer.\r\nWeaknesses-So much time was spent on statistical tests and not as much on policy recommendations and the true application of stats in the real world. I learned what test to use in a certain situation, but not how to critically develop my own policy recommendations based on those findings. Both of those skills made up a significant portion of the grade in this class",
                "Strengths of the course are its connections to psychology and how it can be applied to scientific reasoning, as well as Dr. Gee's kindness and the interactiveness of the class. Weaknesses are that the grading is a bit unforgiving and specific for psets, but it ensures that you don't make the same mistakes twice.",
                "I thought the class was terrific. every single change I wanted to see, Dylan implemented after the midterm.",
                "Well taught course, Prof Gee is a great lecturer and ensures a thorough understanding of statistical concepts",

                "Strength: Dr. Gee and the TF\/teaching team; organization of powerpoints and lectures; projects; content\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the HW assignments were way longer\/harder than others but all weighed the same",
                "Strengths: Professor Gee is lovely, lab sections were very helpful for the homework.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Material sometimes did not feel well-explained conceptually, and individual attention was very very limited.",
                "A great QR course for everybody and for majors!",
                "I thought this course was really great because we learned and were tested on the real world applications of statistics. It wasnt like I was just learning random tests and numbers for the sake of itbut I learned why statistics are important and through exams and lab was tested on and got to practice how to actually apply what I learned to real life.",
                "This was one of my favorites courses this semester. Learning about the various statistical tests was one of the strengths of this course.",
                "I think that sections need maybe an extra ten minutes. Often, we are able to finish on time but I know that sometimes there were limitations to the fluency that a teaching fellow could provide as a result of the time constraint. However, the strengths of this course are endless. You could tell how much the professor and teaching fellows truly cared about our success. They were incredibly responsive to any needs that we had for the course and the way that the course was taught to facilitate optimal student learning.",
                "Sections could be more personlised, but the files on canvas were very useful for recapping",
                "Weaknesses: none. Strengths: the layout of the course itself is extremely conducive to learning and success. There are no tricks; if you show up to lecture and section, you'll understand the content for the weekly problem sets and feel well-prepared for the exams. It's that simple. You put in the work and you will reap the rewards. The teaching team is also super helpful and genuinely cares about you as a student. The course as a whole is just really well organized, and the lectures are actually rather engaging.",
                "Great introduction to statistics for the discipline of psychology. Low workload, really well-facilitated for learning, and Prof Gee is an incredible, caring instructor.",
                "Strengths: easy to follow material, clear explanations. Weaknesses: does not go in depth, only surface-level, pragmatic knowledge",
                "The topics are quite simple to follow, especially if you are a STEM major, and the homework are very clearly explained. Honestly, this class is \"easy\"--mostly because everything is explained very well and the content is quite enjoyable. Professor Gee is also really wonderful, all the time. I'm pretty sure she knew every student in the lecture by name??!!\r\n\r\nMy TF was nothing to write home about, but it didn't really affect my engagement outside of section because all sections are spent filling in a worksheet that you can always access later on. They were also very very helpful with providing feedback.\r\n\r\nAlso, the midterm and final format for this class are straightforward and very easy to prepare for, as long as you treat it like a take-home.",
                "Fast paced, I didn't find it very interesting or engaging. It was difficult to understand. The lab\/sections were also fast paced and a whir.",
                "This course was extremely organized and well-taught. There were many opportunities to seek out support and extra help. The assignments and exams were very reasonable and applicable.",
                "organized lecture slides and I liked the set up of the final\/midterm where we can see the test a couple of days before but don't get the data",
                "This course really made statistics interesting and approachable! The division of learning between lecture, section, and homework really helped solidify every concept. Additionally, I felt very prepared for both the midterm and final and really appreciated the grading policies. One weakness was that section often went very fast and left students very confused. I often had to raise my hand and ask multiple questions per section, and advocating for myself (and most likely other students) in this way was the only way to slow the pace and receive clarification. If you missed one step or couldn't see what was going on in the tiny projected screen, you fell behind and were lost. I think that in the future section should be recorded for future reference. It was helpful to receive the lab key afterwards for clarification. Another weakness was the final group project. Initially, we were under the impression that this project would live up to its name and be something that was completed as a group. However, after choosing our hypotheses and data set as a group, we were then told that we would be penalized for any collaboration. It felt pointless to make this a group project when it really was almost entirely individual. I feel that many of the other weaknesses of this course were reported by students in the midterm report and were noticeably improved in the second half of the semester! It was great to see that Professor Gee took our feedback very seriously and adapted the learning environment to best suit our needs.",
                "Strengths: \r\n-No memorization of formulas \r\n-Very understanding professor \r\n-P-sets weighing 30% of the final grade put less pressure on the midterm\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Lab sections are too short to cover the content and answer students questions comprehensivly",
                "The course was taught incredibly and the information was very easy to pick up. I think the labs really helped with this. The only thing I can think of in terms of improvement is I wish we talked a bit more in class about how to write a scientific report (which was required for the final project).",
                "The course was very organized and I always knew what to expect. Prof Gee was very open and communicative about how exams work, when assignments are due and what we need to know. I thought it was a great class where I never felt left behind.",
                "This is a course for non-math people to learn a tiny bit of math  about enough to understand some of the statistical undergirding of social science papers, but not enough to understand the theoretical underpinnings or generate any particularly interesting original knowledge.",
                "One weakness is that it is extremely fast paced, but Professor Gee and the TFs were very open to help.",
                "A strength of the course was that it was very accessible for students coming from all levels of statistics experience. Additionally, the way the course was designed with starting with the very basics and breaking down each topic each week with the lectures and reinforcing it during the lab sections. I think what could be improved is having the lecture content including more of examples on how we apply each topic in SPSS as a preview to what will be discussed is section and would also be helpful for the psets and what is expected on the midterm and final exams. I think also for the future having the psets due at 11:59 pm instead of originally 8 (then moved to 11 pm) would be helpful and more accommodating for students.",
                "The course is structured in a way where if you don't understand a concept, there are many more chances to learn it, which was helpful. The labs were also super helpful for learning SPSS. A weakness was that it was pretty easy to fall behind because everything built off the concepts before it, but i think that was just a me problem",
                "Strengths were great teacher, compelling material and helpful sections. Weaknesses were sometimes lectures were too fast or repetitive.",
                "The TFs were helpful and provided feedback for homework. The professor was very understanding but her lectures could get boring at times.",
                "This course was very well structured. Prof Gee was insanely receptive to student feedback and input. She would use polls and personal surveys to gauge how the class was doing. She always kept us in the loop about any changes and made sure to let us know when solutions or assignments were posted. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness to this course was at the start when the pacing of the lectures felt a little too fast, but after the midcourse review Prof Gee made sure to slow down and gauge how the class felt during every lecture.",
                "I'm not sure if there are weaknesses with the course itself, it may just have been a little fast-paced in the beginning. This could be improved by establishing a basis and core understanding in the beginning about how to succeed in the class. Strengths of this course are the lab sections and the option for feedback. The lab sections help to understand what we learned in practice, and they also help allow us to ask questions and clarify things we weren't able to before. They were very fast-paced in the beginning, however, which can be improved by setting more of background in what lab sections are for. The availability for feedback helps cater the class more to the students.",
                "I think one of the biggest strengths of this class is the use of real-world examples to display the practicality of what we were learning in many different fields. I also appreciated that the homework assignments directly aligned with thee expectations on projects and test that way we had lots of practice in advance. There were also great class notes provided through out the semester so students could always go back and reference how to solve problems ans instructions on how to use the appropriate computer programs.",
                "Strengths: clear, reasonable assignments and exams; Prof Gee (!!); lectures\/section notes\/review materials all available on canvas; manageable workload (no reading!, weekly ~1-2 hrs of HW, two exams, project)\r\nWeaknesses: none? though the lectures can sometimes have superfluous info - most of the skills needed for HW and exams are taught in section"

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone looking to gain basic stats knowledge for their own research or to anyone who wants to become a more educated consumer of statistics. Prof Gee and the TFs are incredibly approachable and provide helpful feedback for learning the material. The workload was never overwhelming, provided that you don't wait until the last minute to begin assignments. This is a course that you get out what you put in. It's possible to coast through this course, cramming material in the days before the exams, but those who have the desire to learn the concepts have the opportunity to go above and beyond.",
                "Yes! Great QR for non-stem majors.",
                "Yes, its a great stats course as you learn many different ways to analyze data. It is not your traditional Stats course",
                "Yes, this course was genuinely useful, and Professor Gee is extremely sweet and dedicated to helping her students.",
                "Yes. Professor Gee is definitely a highlight. The course load is very manageable and the midterm and final exams were very straightforward. If you are in need of an easy QR, this is it.",
                "I highly recommend this course - I learned a lot about statistics in very practical ways. Every assignment applies what you learn very well in real-life situations. I learned more in this course than many others without too much workload!",
                "Yes! It's a very manageable course and even though I'm not particularly interested in stats, I found this course to be enjoyable. Even though the course is targeted towards psych majors, I'd recommend it to students of other majors too.",
                "Yes, its a great class taught by a great professor",
                "Definitely, especially if you plan on doing research in the future.",
                "Yes, it's a good QR credit with a good workload. It's a really clear, simple introduction to statistics, and Prof. Gee is incredible. She's really one of the kindest professors I've ever had. I'm really interested in psychology so I liked that many (but not all) of the examples we used incorporated psychology research, but it would search as a solid introduction for anyone. It is pretty basic, though, so I wouldn't recommend it for a student with a background in statistics.",
                "Yes,  it is a great course- i learned more than i thought i would",
                "Yes, I learned a lot of new information and the topics were interesting",
                "Yes, but only as a psychology major. I took this as a social sciences major looking to fulfill a QR, but I think I may have been more fulfilled looking elsewhere for a QR more relevant to my future endeavors.",
                "Definitely! Dr. Gee and the TFs are super helpful and it's a great intro to statistics as a neuro\/psychology major.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, if youre interested in an intro stats class this is a great choice. Its pretty easy, homework doesnt take much time at all, and theres no reading because all the material is covered in class.",
                "Yes if you need to know the basics of statistics",
                "Yes. Nicest teacher ever",
                "YES! It is the best way to get familiar with stats. Dr. Gee is fantastic and the data we are working with is applicable and relatable",
                "Yes, it was a decently pleasant QR if you're a non-STEM student.",
                "yes! great intro stats class. easily manageable and well taught.",
                "Yes!",
                "Of course! Its a great introduction to statistics!",
                "Yes, if you want to understand all those scientific studies you read and be able to think critically about data and conduct your own studies, this course is essential!",
                "Take PSYC200 with Professor Gee and you would not regret it. I learned a lot about statistics without being overly stress or overwhelmed. The material is also very useful if you are planning to do research.",
                "Absolutely! I think that the content that you engage in with this course is incredibly relevant to any discipline and has a very prominent focus on applicability. It has real-world as well as academic applications that I believe any student will be able to benefit immensely from. Not to mention the fact that it is a quantitative reasoning credit. I do think that if you take this course and it is still being recorded, don't dip out on the in-person instruction! It's tempting to stay at home and dedicate some later time to watching the lectures, but I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial it is to be there in person for this class.",
                "Yes - good starter stats course and if required for your major, take it!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Gee is one of the best instructors I've encountered at my time at Yale, both engaging as a lecturer and caring as a person. The class is really consistent and reliable, you know exactly what to expect and there are no surprises. The weekly problem sets aren't very time consuming at all as long as you paid attention at section for the week, and the exams aren't take home, but they are open-note, and you can be well-prepared for them in advance to the point where they aren't a source of major stress. The teaching team is also really great at giving feedback on problem sets and exams, so you know exactly what mistakes you're making and can be sure not to make them again.",
                "Yes, I think the information learned in this course is very valuable to real world situations and places of employment. It's a great intro course to anyone wanting to explore statistics!",
                "Definitely. Easy class where the professor actually wants you to learn the material rather than arbitrarily assigning grades.",
                "Yes -- very useful to learn how to use SPSS, basics of statistics for research!",
                "Yes! Take it with friends. It's a great QR\/Math requirement and Professor Gee is so awesome!",
                "If you have a background in statistics? Yes. If you don't? It's going to be rough. Not a gut.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to any student. The skills taught in this course were invaluable and Professor Gee was a wonderful professor.",
                "only if they were interested in SPSS or needed for their major",
                "Yes! Great whether or not you are a psych major or not if you have any interest in statistics or are looking for an enjoyable and not too difficult QR",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! As someone who had never taken a stats course before, I feel like I got a lot out of the class and never felt overly confused. It's a pretty easy class, but you also learn a lot from it.",
                "Yes. I think it is a great way to get acquainted with stats if you havent had much exposure.",
                "No. If you're a STEM person, take a real STEM class. If you have the brain for it, take a real statistics class. If you're looking for a gut, you can probably find an easier one. Although to be honest, as a humanities person, this is only the latest in a long string of failures to find good STEM classes.",
                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this for students who want to learn more about statistics.",
                "Yes, if youre looking to fulfill an introductory statistics requirement.",
                "I would recommend it with the caviat that it isn't easy and to get anything out of it you have to be focused and put work in, but it is a very useful course.",
                "Yes, very fun and fair course.",
                "Yes, I learned a lot about the data collecting process and how this contributes to research which I believe is a valuable skill.",
                "Yes! It was really cool to match the tools and methods we would learn in class with \"real-life\" examples of problems or questions that statistics could help answer. Likewise, Prof Gee has a very well-structured and student oriented course that made this class easy to manage and plan out with other courses.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it was a great way to be introduced to statistics, especially if you are planning on majoring in Psych. It gives you a good foundational and structural understanding of statistics and it isn't too much of a difficult pace to follow.",
                "I would recommend this class to another student. I enjoyed this class quite a bit and I think it's very helpful for anyone who wants to continue taking psychology classes so that they can better comprehend the result of different studies and interpret their conclusions.",
                "Depends on what you're looking for - if you're looking for a intro to how to use SPSS (or a QR that requires literally no math), definitely take this class!! But if you want a theoretical understanding of statistics beyond just running tests (or if you want a greater focus on the math\/coding side of stats) then maybe take the Spring 200 course or one of the S&DS options"
