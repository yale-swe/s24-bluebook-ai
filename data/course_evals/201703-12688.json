    "Learned so much about the history of Indonesia, from the conception of Indonesia as a nation in the post colonial years, to Guided Democracy under Sukarno, to authoritarianism and corporatism under Suharto, and to the years of Reformation in the 2000s. There was a lot about the meaning of Indonesia, which really points to the wider issues related to nationhood as well.",
    "Source evaluation, argumentation, insights on Indonesia from pre-colonial times to present.",
    "Historical research, evaluating primary sources. I also learned, of course, a great deal about Indonesia's history and politics, knowing very little about this beforehand."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Generally speaking, the readings were quite interesting. I had already seen the film \"The Look of Silence,\" but watching it a second time with much more background knowledge was worthwhile. The guest lecture from Dr. Annie Pohlman was also a highlight. The only downside for me was that the course did turn out to be more politically-focused than I had expected.",
    "Strengths: Jess is really knowledgeable about Indonesia. Her choice of sources was extremely well tailored to the topics we dealt with in class, E.g. we got to see actual CIA reports revealing US awareness (and complicity) of the '65 Genocide, two weeks before the news reported on the issue! The guest lecturer, Dr. Annie Pohlman, was also amazing, and we learned a lot about gender and waria culture in Indonesia. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Probably not the most engaging seminar course at times, although Jess has gotten better in managing discussion as time goes on. Although there was some feedback on historical writing, I felt there could have been more.",
    "I liked the richness of the readings, and a focus on primary sources in particular.",
    "Strengths - well organized, comprehensive. Focus on primary sources allowed for presentation of material to be objective which I think is critical for a history course. The framing as a course about how today's Indonesia has been imagined in the past was unique and, to me, helpful for organizing and evaluating information.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\/improvements - to me, it felt that there was a bit of a formulaic expectation of how the papers should be structured, which allowed for a little less creativity than I might have liked. But perhaps that simply reflects the way academic articles are written. Might have also been good to have more discussion of present-day Indonesia, although this topic was covered well with regards to Islam in the final week."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I definitely would.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to know more about Indonesia, as it will give you a thorough overview of its political history. It will also give you a new perspective on current events.",
    "If you have a regional interest in Southeast Asia, definitely take this course as Indonesia is a key player in the region. More generally, Indonesia is an interesting case of nationhood at work. Given the sheer diversity of its cultures and populations, it seems initially almost ludicrous and arbitrary for a nation to be formed out of an archipelago this big, so even if you're not a historian, if themes of nationhood, ethnic separatism, religious politics, and the legacies of colonialism interest you, Indonesia is a good case study to look at in depth.",
    "This is a great gateway to understanding Indonesia in an interesting way, with great foundation texts!",
    "Definitely. For its size and population, Indonesia is a country that I feel is discussed very little, so it is excellent to have a well-taught course by an extremely knowledgeable instructor on it. This course (and Indonesia's history in general) also provides interesting perspectives on many topics in 20th-century history e.g. decolonization, the Cold War, post-Cold War democratization."
