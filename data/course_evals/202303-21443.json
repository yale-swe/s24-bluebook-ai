                "I learned a lot about the US's Public Education system and reflected a lot on my previous knowledge as well. I took away much more from this class than I expected. I learned how to interview others, write an op-ed, edit audio, and complete a cohesive podcast.",
                "A much deeper context  especially historically  about education fights. Also I learned many more audio editing skills than I expected, which was helpful.  Definitely a very relevant class to take in current education climate.",
                "I absolutely love this class! This class was perfect for me---reading current event articles about the debate on public schools right now, everything from critical race theory to sex ed to textbook and book banning to religion to private vs public to charter schools to school to prison pipeline! There is a lot of readings, but they're all super interesting and NYT and news articles so they're easy to read.",
                "I learned about the current landscape of education in the US, and about all the controversy surrounding the topics in the field. I learned about skills for journalism (interviewing, op-ed writing, etc) and how to create a podcast. This included how to write a script, record my audios, interviews, and editing.",
                "Wow! So so many skills and insights. I developed a wealth of knowledge about Public Education, but also practical skills like interviewing and podcasting.",
                "I learned about the debates in public education, and I also learned how to use Adobe Audition by myself for the final project.",
                "I definitely learned a good overview of contemporary issues in public education. I also had a great chance to improve my public speaking skills through podcasting.",
                "Insight into the controversies that face public education in the present, and over the course of American history. This course looked into present-day battles over what should be taught and how disagreements affect public education. It also looked more broadly into public education as a principle: Is it working? What's the point of public education? Et cetera",
                "journalism (writing opeds, writing analytical and argumentatively)\r\ninterviewing (reaching out, doing research to prepare, asking good questions, how to use interview quotes in writing)\r\npodcasting (how to write a script, etc)",
                "This course truly revealed to me how complex the public education system is in the United States and how important it is to consider various aspects of the system in assessing current issues. I also learned how to create a podcast!",
                "I've come away with a vast understanding of the structures of public schools and their vulnerabilities which American lawmakers and lobbyists are well into destroying. This class is also tailored to the actionable : what we can do to protect our public schools and make them more resilient and responsive to student rights, interests, health, equity, justice. I've come away with a greater ability in storytelling, journalism, podcasting, op-ed writing.",

            "comments": [
                "Sometimes class periods felt long, it would have been nice to have a break in the middle. I loved everything else about the class! Readings were always interesting and class discussions were quite enjoyable.",
                "Great discussion, interesting projects. I really like the assignments because I think they're all tangible and useful, like real journalism. Prof Berkshire has great knowledge and connections in the field, and is very willing to make connections for her students, to help with projects or otherwise.",
                "Strengths: readings are current-event, Professor Berkshire is the best, journalism is so cool even though I had no prior interest in it, conservative guest speakers bring interesting angles to debate. Weaknesses: heavy workload, half of the class is journalism (if you don't like it)",
                "Strengths: topics were all diverse and interesting, several guest speakers made class interesting, workload was manageable but i was still able to learn a lot from the assignments, discussions were very interesting and interactive, Professor Berkshire did a great job breaking the seminar into smaller sections so that the class didn't feel super long\r\nWeaknesses: lots of readings",
                "One of the most interesting aspects of this class was the \"frenemies\" Professor Berkshire brought in to speak. We had the opportunity to read the opinions of academics on both sides of the political aisle, and then hear from them in person. It was really fantastic.",
                "This course had some good readings and it ended up being interesting to hear from guests who came in to talk and were on the conservative side of the public education debate. Otherwise, I think this course could be strengthened in the in-class discussions. It often felt like we were just reviewing the main points of the readings rather than having a discussion about them or challenging them in any way. There were some interesting readings, but I did feel that some of them felt a little elementary in their approach to the public education debate. I thought it would be more like the Education & Culture Wars class which I think is more of the historical and philosophical debates, and this was more of a simple discussion. I think the class could benefit from a more explicit focus on journalism covering education to get the best of Professor Berkshire's knowledge.",
                "This class is great in not feeling too in the weeds, while also providing time to explore topics that you might be individually interested in. The readings can be a lot if you try to do all of them, but there is some wiggle room and you can get away with not doing all of them. The weekly assignments are also relatively low stakes, and quite enjoyable to do if you allow yourself to be creative.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings and podcasts we listened to for this course. This was a very well curated syllabus with an interesting array of viewpoints and ideas. Professor Berkshire's insight, experience, and framing was definitely a major strength of the course. I also really enjoyed the unique assignments, like the final podcast, which made this course stand out from others I have taken in the PLSC department. I think my greatest issue with the course was some of the engagement of my classmates. Some people talked far more than others, and I felt like some students often cited their own public education experiences as making them better or worse than others in the class. I would have appreciated more structure to prevent the echo chamber in class discussions.",
                "great course, the once a week schedule is really nice because all of the conversations never felt like they were cut short bc of how long class was\r\nloved how many guests we had come in and share their experiences and expertise, robert pondiscio was a definite standout to me",
                "I thought that the structure of the course was very conducive for student learning. Weekly discussion posts were a great way to reflect both before and after class on the materials, and students gave presentations each week to practice podcast/presenting skills. I also loved how Dr. Berkshire spread out assignments so that we got consistent feedback. I can't think of any weaknesses of the course.",
                "A million strengths in this class. Biggest is that Prof. Berkshire gives you a lot of autonomy to build your own semester-long editorial / journalistic deep-dives into a particular issue (or two, three) close to home (literally... almost 2/3rds of the class or more ended up doing a final project based on the politics of a particular educational issue from their hometown). I did, and it has played a large part in my political growth this semester. If you are eager to explore the politics of public edu in the USA (inextricably linked to models worldwide) and of protecting the most important institution of this country.... take this class !! No weaknesses. She had lots of guest speakers (friends and frenemies! :), but they were all fantastic, interesting, thought-provoking... and good gracious, even famous ! Oh, and Prof. Berkshire herself is one of the most outspoken journalists defending public schools in America right now, so...",
                "All strengths. Jennifer is phenomenal. The readings are fairly short and phenomenal. Grading is so patient and understanding, she knows we're just trying to learn. Class was always engaging and goes by quick. Even the guest speakers were interesting to speak with."

                "Yes!",
                "Yes, most definitely! You learn so much about education and gain many tangible skills as well. It is truly an enjoyable and though provoking course.",
                "Yes absolutely! The content is very interesting, and I think the assignments are a nice switch up from the average schedule definitely still a hefty workload, but really fun to do interviews and be a little more creative.",
                "Yes! If you like storytelling and journalism, take it! If you're interested in the debate on education, take it! I had no prior interest in education and journalism, but it made me spark an interest in it! There were some times where I would have a lot of readings and a journalistic article due the same day, so the workload was a bit too much at some points, but it was all stuff I enjoyed, so I don't mind very much.",
                "Yes, it was a great class and you can learn so much about education. The focus on the controversial aspects made it even more interesting. Professor Berkshire was amazing and super supportive of her students. I loved the class and definitely recommend it.",
                "Yes! This is one of my favorite classes at Yale. The assignments were creative and engaging, and our discussions were thoughtful. I'm so glad that I had the opportunity to learn from Professor Berkshire.",
                "Yes! Anyone can take this class and have an amazing time.",
                "If you are interested in public education and discussing its challenges and goals, this is the class for you! It definitely leaned more education studies than political science, but provided a good foundation of the issues for those of us who weren't as well-versed in the EDST world. Professor Berkshire is great and does really interesting work as a journalist, and I enjoyed getting to know her and meeting with her about my podcast and journalistic writing.",
                "absolutely. this class was really interesting and wasn't the biggest workload ever, but it was the sort of class that i was just so intrigued by that the readings and papers felt very additive to my life and didn't feel burdensome to get through. i definitely walk away feeling much more knowledgeable about the subject base as a whole, and had a great time every week in class talking to my peers about the topics.",
                "If you are looking for an education studies or political science seminar, I would not recommend this course. But if you are interested in improving your journalistic writing you should take it. While an interesting topic, the course never genuinely felt like a \"seminar\". While the readings that were assigned were interesting, discussions on said readings felt superficial at best (e.g. \"what is the main point of the article?\"). This course sets out to not only improve your understanding of politics of public education but also expose you to journalistic writing. Quite frankly, I think the course just sets out to do too much in a semester that it leaves you feeling like you internalize a whole lot. I don't think I really learned how to write journalistically because seminars were often spent just going over readings.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that it is very important that students understand the education system that they are a part of, and as someone who has pursued my entire education in the United States, I found this course to be incredibly enlightening.",
                "Absolutely!!! Every student at Yale should take this class. You delve into the 1) century-to-present efforts at reshaping / undermining public school education and 2) the modern campaigns to keep public schools accessible, equitable, and empowering. Protecting American public schools and students within them (not to mention improving their functioning) is one of the most pressing (and existential ahhhh) issues in contemporary politics. There's no way to ignore the fate of public schools... this class is so important !!! It will likely change / reshape your perspective of democracy, education, child rights radically. And it will lead you to have many passionate conversations with friends, interviewees, experts, family, etc.",
                "Absolutely. You'd be crazy not to take it especially if you need a WR. It's such an interesting course and you learn so much."
