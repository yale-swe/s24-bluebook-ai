It's definitely rock-heavy, but this feels like a good foundation for other natural sciences. Some of the content feels relatively similar to AP Environmental Science but with a much deeper dive into the geology side.

                "Strengths: The course was fun, and I was able to learn a lot, and the final project was very nice, as we got to choose a place in the world to study. I think that was a great idea, since that piqued my interest in learning more about the location's geology. I also believe that the amount of work was fair, as this is not an advanced course but merely a taste of what Geology and Planetary Sciences are like.",
                "Each to follow, homework is kind of at your own pace, really enjoyed the class overall",
                "This course was taught well and the google forms sent out were a fun way to measure attendance. I don't think there were any weaknesses of this course.",
                "Professor Evans is incredibly engaging; the final project which enabled us to dive deeply into the geology of a place meaningful to us is really fun! No weaknesses!",
                "Prof is very passionate about earth science. PSETs are very clear. great class overall",
                "Strengths - great instructor, low workload, you choose your portfolio area so there is a personal connection to homework, interesting classes, no exam.\r\nWeaknesses - in the end, your final project is so small (5 min video + 1000 words) that, given that you have 3 lectures a week, are not able to engage with most of the material covered, so you may have a tendency to not concentrate, knowing that you will never be tested on the information taught.",
                "I enjoyed the relaxed but inclusive setup of class. The learning was not too intensive but attendance was mandatory and measured very seamlessly with a a QR every time, I thought this worked well.",
                "Interesting content that stayed fresh",
                "great instructor, and good that there is a grade for showing up to class",
                "Dave is a fantastic lecturer and clearly puts in a ton of effort into making the class engaging. However, I honestly think this course would benefit from an in person attendance form as even with the QR code, most kids never went to class.",
                "The strengths of the course is that it covers a wide variety of topics. However, although I understand that it is a science class, I wish there was more focus on the later subjects, especially anthropogenic climate change and its impacts. Another weakness is that the slides sometimes do not contain enough words, so it can be difficult to follow along or take notes sometimes.",
                "dave evans is awesome. my idol.",
                "I loved how Prof. Evans made us identify our homes geology. It really made me focus on the material.",
                "Strengths: Professor Evans is a very engaging lecturer and devotes a lot of time to making sure students understand the material. I also really enjoyed the final project: it was honestly quite fun to research the geological history of my location. Problem sets felt mostly reasonable and interesting and I especially liked the assignment on stratigraphy. Weaknesses: some PSet questions, especially those note related to the final portfolio, weren't super enjoyable and felt more like busy work. I especially disliked the PSet in which we got graded for how well we measured the width of a volcano in Google Earth Pro; it just felt somewhat arbitrary.",
                "The professor is great, and I enjoyed the course a lot.",
                "Strengths: It was really cool to learn how to evaluate a location based on a whole series of geological markers and build a story around how the location came to be. Weaknesses: Some of the HW assignments were significantly harder or more tedious than others and it felt like often times graders would nitpick without explaining their grading criteria aforehand, which made those assignments not as transparent as they could have been.",
                "No weakness; Strengths, prof is great, TFs are generally very good, lectures are good + slides are engaging, psets are interesting, using google earth for much of the work in the class makes it one of the best science classes --- you get to focus on a location of your choice all semester and view it from a lens that you simply would not get in any other course.",
                "Strengths: the portfolio assignment was really interesting and brought together a ton of stuff from the semester; I feel like I really internalized a lot of what we had been learning by doing the portfolio. Professor Evans is a fantastic and funny lecturer and keeps things interesting, and the homework assignments are definitely manageable (almost all the homeworks are quite short and generally pretty informational).\r\nWeaknesses: lectures can definitely get a bit dry talking so much about slow-moving rock systems if that's not your thing. Lecture attendance was tracked but it would have been pretty easy to send the QR code to friends who didn't attend that day, so it's not universally true that people were gaining a lot from the class. Also, while most homeworks were interesting and understandable, homework 9 was dramatically longer than the others and did not have sufficient explanations for many parts of the assignment.",
                "Strength: Passion from Professor rubs off on you.\r\n\r\nWeakness: for an intro class, most of the TAs are too harsh in grading; the level of grading by TAs seems to require at least a PhD level understanding (I doubt even someone who won a hypothetical Nobel prize for Geology can get 100 in the PSETs) that seem to dock points ridiculously for formatting errors and technical approaches that were never covered in class.",
                "BEST class ever. Strengths: Great teaching, right level of science credit where the minimum is extremely manageable, and you can enjoyably learn as much as you want above that. Class is engaging, homeworks are interesting and it was so fun to learn about my portfolio area in the final assignment. Really one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, don't let anyone dissuade you from it. Weaknesses: The only thing I could recommend is having the TAs offer later office hours (think 7 am slots 5 days before HW is due), and be a bit more clear about grading to avoid mix-ups.",
                "strengths: final project is done throughout the term, get to learn about your hometown or other location through final project",
                "A major strength of this class is that the lectures were very engaging and the homework assignments were very clear. I also really enjoyed the portfolio location project at the end of the course.",
                "Strengths: low-stress environment, really interesting course material, super engaging professor. Portfolio assignment also makes it fun and made it feel like I had a personal stake in the class",
                "Often times the homework assignments would be unclear and only understandable by going to office hours.",
                "Strengths of the course: pretty well-organized, virtual lectures offered, engaging, uses a variety of different engagement styles to teach like incorporating YouTube videos into the lecture slides as well as graphics from the textbook. Attendance is taken by scanning a QR code and filling out a google form every class. No tests or quizzes, only an average of one homework assignment per week and a cumulative final project due at the end of the semester that you work on each week as part of your homework assignments. I don't have improvement suggestions.",
                "The psets were very particular and were sometimes difficult to understand because the content was slightly different than lectures.",
                "Strengths - project to explore class topics in a portfolio location, engaging lecture content, good outline of many geology topics; Weaknesses - Lecture content was not tested or otherwise returned to, taking away incentive to review topics",
                "Its fun, broad, and introductory, but is not always engaging and does not demand attentiveness.",
                "Strengths: Fun lectures, really liked how the homework connected to the final project. Weaknesses: I feel like at some points it was unclear where we were going/how we were moving through the course material",
                "Course is fairly informative, the greatest weakness is its TA Wyatt. He seems to lack basic quantitative reasoning skills and as such sets absurd grading standards for each problem set. The largest challenge I had with this course was never with the course material, which is quite comprehendible, but instead with predicting the preposterous criteria by which Wyatt would grade my work. He appears to be unable to understand simple scientific principles and punishes students for his failure to apply common sense. He also graded inconsistently and gave my friend and I different grades for the same numerical answer.",
                "The Professor is super energetic about the course but a lot of the time the psets had very little to do so  the material covered.",
                "Great professor who organized his lectures very well. The office hours system was not consistent, confusing, and inconvenient.",
                "this is a great course, super well organized. sometimes it felt like the pset material didn't quite correlate with the content from class, so maybe that could have lined up better.",
                "Strengths: Professor is extremely easy to talk to and makes the lectures digestible to someone who knows nothing about geology, the format of the class is easy to follow\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes hard to stay engaged if a topic doesnt directly apply to your final project place",
                "The strengths of this class encompass several key elements. Firstly, the captivating weekly classes led by the outstanding professor provided an enriching learning experience. The mandatory attendance requirement proved instrumental in fostering my active engagement. The well-crafted homework assignments were instructive and enhanced my understanding of the subject matter. The weekly portfolio served as a cohesive thread, interconnecting all components by the course's conclusion. Lastly, the engaging textbook readings contributed significantly to a comprehensive and insightful learning journey.",
                "I actually wish there had been some graded assessments such as tests or quizzes on the lecture materials because they were very interesting but I found it hard to find motivation to truly learn the material without a graded component.",
                "Maybe the powerpoint presentation slide decks can be shared with students after lecture?",
                "The biggest weakness of this course was the lack of substance. While I understand that Prof. Evans believes that an examination would decrease interest in the course, not having at least a midterm exam meant that there was no incentive for students to review material or gauge whether they mastered the content. This was made worse by the fact that the homework assignments were far removed from lecture and one did not need to pay attention in lecture to complete them or earn a high grade in this course. Thus, unless you were truly fascinated in Prof. Evans lectures, one could zone out or just work on assignments for other classes with no repercussions. This is truly a science gut. If this course wouldnt have fulfilled a major requirement, I definitely would not have taken the class. I found the lectures dull and boring. Although Prof. Evans is fascinated about Earth Science, it does not translate in his lectures. I recommend including more engaging activities in class, perhaps a project per unit where students can better form connections across units. This will certainly help during the final project. The problem sets started off greateasy to follow, easy to do, and fun. Over the course of the semester, they got progressively more confusing, harder to do, and more tedious. Dont leave the stratigraphic column problem set for the last day; that one takes a while to do. I liked the idea of the culminating Portfolio Final Project. Unfortunately, my portfolio location was just a boring American town. While the professor promised that each geologic location is fascinating, most of my answers on every problem set (e.g., nearby tectonic craters, volcanoes, earthquakes, major bodies of water, and a variety of rocks) were N/A. In the end, I had very little to say in my video. To make matters worse, when I went to discuss it with Prof. Evans, he told me I was missing a whole bunch of information on my state that was never covered in class. With the TAs skimming the problem sets and the professor never checking in with students on retention of course material, I felt like no one was making sure I was on the right track until the very end of the course. Also, unsurprisingly, very few students in the class even watched my video, likely because so many students had portfolio locations like mine. You feel like you put all this hard work into a video and then no one ends up watching it, whereas more exciting portfolio locations like Australia and Ecuador have upwards of 10 views. So much for all locations are created equal. I think each student should have 1-2 designated viewers so everyone can get feedback on their video.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, good structure, approachable professor. Weaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: The homework was organized and informative and I love how it all helped contribute to the final project which felt like a cohesive conclusion to the course. Zoom lectures are really helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the homework grading seemed a little funky / my peers and I frequently misinterpreted what questions were asking (the diagrams of rock types in our portfolio location were particularly confusing)."

                "Definitely. As someone who isn't necessarily gifted in the science realm it is a very fun and interesting class to take and get a science credit. I also found that David's calm nature made the students able to thoroughly enjoy the class.",
                "Yes, it is a great course - especially for EVST majors",
                "Yes, Great class, didn't realise rocks were so cool!",
                "yes",
                "Good class, work is very manageable and consistent, and Professor Evans is great. Science isn't really my thing, so this was not my favorite course I have taken at Yale, but I don't think that had much to do with the course itself. Honestly would recommend for a science course",
                "Yes, especially if you will buy into it! This course is whatever you make of it- if you want to just do the work for the psets and final projects and never engage in classes you can get away with it, but going to class and actively participating is a really rewarding experience. If you are not a science person this would be great for you because this course is just kind of about the effort you put in not really any natural skill- if you go to OH you can easily get 100s on every pset.",
                "This course is not difficult, but lecture attendance is recorded with QR codes and a part of the grade. Since you have to attend, and the lectures can get a bit dull (especially towards the middle of the semester, when they tended to become very list like),  I would only recommend this course if you are actually interested in the material. If you are, youll enjoy it. Otherwise, youll get bored in the lectures and feel like you wasted your time.",
                "Yes, I recommend this course for any student who struggles with science, especially because most science classes at Yale can be demanding. I think the course is challenging enough that it isn't necessarily an \"easy\" class, but is still flexible enough in its structure that it puts less pressure on students.",
                "Yeah! But on the off chance you're an EPS major who has already taken classes like Global Tectonics or Earth Surface Processes, this class is redundant, so if you'trying to maximize the amount of different material you're exposed to, consider not taking Dynamic Earth for your intro EPS requirement. But I think Dave Evans makes it worth it even so.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a manageable science credit that does not require any background. As long as you show up to class, I think it is a class you can get an A in but you do have to be willing to put in the work on the homework assignments.",
                "Yes! This is a great class to learn important aspects of the world that all people should know. Also has a very low course load, so anyone looking for a science credit, this is a great course!",
                "Would recommend, especially if in need of a science credit, as I was. Good class, workload isn't insane, and Professor Evans is a good lecturer. Definitely go to lectures though: they're honestly interesting, even when they don't relate super closely to the final project, and the daily participation quizzes are a highlight (especially if you do well on them and win a prize!).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is a great science course if you are not a science major, and overall, it is very interesting.",
                "Good science credit for anyone interested in geology and how humans think about the locations we occupy. Definitely not a gut in terms of workload (there is very consistent amounts of work) but is a gut in that the content does not require as much prior knowledge as some other intro science classes.",
                "Yes, for a student needing a science credit, great choice. Prof knows a lot of students in the course are not in STEM, and he makes sure to engage you in an accessible way.",
                "I would recommend this course -- it's valuable background information for many other natural sciences, and in-depth exposure to geology is relatively rare for most students. The portfolio assignment was really interesting and educational, and Professor Evans is a great lecturer. There are some moments that do get relatively dry if geology isn't your thing, and there are some ways the course could be a bit more engaging in the homework and lectures, but overall it's a solid class that teaches valuable content.",
                "Not really but EPS and EVST kids have to take it so just try your best to enjoy it. Professor really cares and makes class so interesting.",
                "ABSOLUTELY. Great science credit, great teaching, absolutely amazing.",
                "Yes, it was a fun intro to geology that culminated in a final project that allowed me to learn more about my hometown",
                "Yes. This is a great course for learning some introductory material about the planet we live on. I felt that I learned a lot and was able to further research a location that I have close ties to.",
                "YES!!!!!! A million times yes. I took this class as a gut and it ended up being like one of the top 10 Yale classes Ive taken so far. I never wouldve known how interesting geology could be!!! Intellectually stimulating but also very low stress and very fun!",
                "Yes, if you want to take an interesting science credit.",
                "Yes. Please",
                "Absolutely. This course is interesting to those that enjoy learning about natural sciences in an approachable way, very surface level depth about things like rocks and minerals, the water cycle and bodies of water on our planet, the structure of the Earth, energy and resources, etc. The workload is minimal while still encouraging some level of engagement with the material. Head Evans is a great professor and has clearly had plenty of time (I think he's taught this course for like 15 years??) to organize the course in an easily accessible way (lectures are all live-streamed and recorded, attendance is taken with fun daily quizzes with prizes offered, homework assignments are all structured in similar ways with an instruction doc and clear questions).",
                "Good science gut. Wanted to give geology a try and learned its not my thing. So it goes!",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It is interesting to learn about the world around you and why it is the way it is today.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Though the material from lectures wasn't tested, it was engaging nonetheless, and a helpful introduction to Earth science topics.",
                "Yes, its fun, easy, and interesting.",
                "Yes! I think it was an interesting class without a super high workload and is good especially for students whose strongest suit isn't science. Professor Evans is such a kind, engaging, and passionate professor!! If you are looking for an interesting but relatively chill class, I definitely recommend!!",
                "Yes, it's pretty fun and not stressful",
                "The course is an easy science credit with the one obstacle being the TA's incompetence. Wyatt fails to adhere to the simple wording of the homework sets when grading your work and enjoys pulling grading standards out of thin air to deduct points. On multiple occasions, Wyatt had to post Canvas announcements defending his grading criteria, and any reasonable scientific mind would find the logic he outlines to be quite troubling. The course overall is not so bad, but be warned that Wyatt will take points off your homework for any reason he decides is relevant that week. His incompetence knows no bounds.",
                "Definitely a good intro course without a crazy amount of burden.",
                "Yes, great introductory course with a very kind and hardworking professor.",
                "i would recommend this class to other humanities majors because it's a super approachable science credit.",
                "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to any Yale student. In my entire academic experience, I have never encountered a class that facilitated such profound learning in science without the stress of traditional exams. Instead, this course provided a supportive space where I genuinely enjoyed the process of learning and gained a deep appreciation for the subject matter.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student with any interest in the world they live in.",
                "Yes! Not only is the content presented in a digestible way, but the lack of stressful assignments (like exams) allow for a relaxed approach. That way, I could just enjoy the class and learn without the pressure of an intense sit-down final.",
                "No, I would definitely not recommend this course to another student unless they were majoring in Earth & Planetary Sciences and wanted an introduction to the field. Even then, I would tell them that they should take ample notes and treat the course as if they were going to be tested on all the content. Otherwise, it is very easy to fall into a habit of not paying attention and then one might as well have not taken the class. As a STEM major who finds Earth Science, on the surface, quite boring, I was disappointed by this class. I particularly dislike gut classes like this one with no structured assignments. While I believe in learning for the sake of learning, in this case, I wasnt engaged with the content. As a result, it felt like I had to attend a 50-minute seminar about rocks three times a week. I was never excited about class. It felt like a waste of time. Maybe this would work for a Humanities major who needs a gut science. STEM majors should skip it.",
                "YES! IF you are lucky enough to get into this course, TAKE IT! This course has been one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. It's an amazing SC credit!",
                "Yes strongly",
                "Yes! If you're looking for a science class that won't stress you out and is entertaining and interesting, this is the one!",
                "Yes, it is a fun and interesting course about the planet."
