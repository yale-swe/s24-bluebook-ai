                "I thought the participation in the class could have been facilitated more by the Professor, but overall everything was good.",
                "Strengths: very low workload. Readings were really short and usually pretty interesting. Professor Gonzlez-Prez is really friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful especially for the final paper. He also grades generously. There was also no pressure to participate as the class was basically a lecture (I enjoyed this but others might not). Weaknesses: quote tests were ambiguous and most of the grade was based on the midterm and final paper. I wish he could have given us more guidance on our final paper, such as having mini-assignments to turn in a proposal or partial draft.",
                "Strengths: The material was so interesting, and I have left the class feeling like I genuinely have a solid grasp on literary movements on the 20th and 21st centuries. The class was really fun in that regard. I also enjoyed the final writing assignment as an opportunity to explore something specific to my interests, and the workload of the course allowed me to engage with the readings and my final in a fun way. Anibal is very kind and was always willing to meet with me after class or during office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I have no idea what grade I will receive in this course or what standards warrant a certain letter grade. I wish the class were more like a seminar. Students were rarely given the opportunity to speak during class about the readings. Anibal certainly encouraged us to provide our comments, but his teaching style was not conducive at all for discussion.",
                "I liked the opportunity to read so widely, I wished it had been more oriented toward discussion. The students rarely got a genuine opportunity to discuss the texts.",
                "The strength of this course is the material. I'm so happy there is a course here that goes through all of this must-know material.",
                "Profesor Gonzalez was passionate about the material, cheerful, and interesting to listen to. The course material was drawn from a diverse set of authors around the Caribbean. It would have been more fun and engaging if there was more discussion between students during classes."

                "Yeah, it's a low work-load course (except for midterm + final paper) with interesting readings and a lovely Professor.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone needing an easy 300 level Spanish course for the certificate. Super low workload (2 quote quizzes, a midterm, and final paper) and readings are quick and easy. Also, Anbal is such a kind person and is very knowledgeable about literature. You can clearly see that he is passionate about the material and he is very helpful in office hours. The final paper is definitely tough (15-20 pages in Spanish) but if you meet with him he gives you a lot of advice. I will say that after the midterm, there is not much incentive to keep up with the readings or even take notes given the organization of the course, and also that it is a lecture rather than a seminar. I personally liked this because I never felt any need to participate, but my oral Spanish didn't really get any better over the semester.",
                "Yes!!",
                "If you want a relaxing class with an interesting reading list, yes. Just be aware that you won't get to talk at all, and that the class time can be pretty boring. If you're trying to improve your Spanish, this isn't the right class.",
                "Yes I would, but you really need to want to learn about Caribbean history. It's not a difficult class, but it's kind of weirdly structured. It's the only literature course I've ever taken since high school that has given quizzes or tests, which was pretty frustrating at first, but it makes sense given just how many authors we study. It was nice after the fact having memorized all these authors and stuff. Then the final essay of 15 pages is kind of crazy. That didn't really fit with how the class was conducted.",
                "Yes. It was enjoyable to listen to Prof Gonzalez's lectures and the readings were interesting and of reasonable length."
