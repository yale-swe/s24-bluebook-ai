                "Speaking in a seminar setting",
                "This course pulls the veil off what we mean when we call things \"powerful\" or \"moving\". Influence, authority, and persuasion are the building blocks of getting others to do things they would not otherwise do (without force), and are critical to understand for anyone interested in political science, history, or just being an informed citizen. \r\n\r\nThis was my first seminar style course at Yale, and I am so glad I took it. I learned how to read effectively, approach topics I was unfamiliar with, and respond to unique prompts in class.",
                "Concepts of power, hard and soft power, leadership, influence, the Supreme Court and dissent, authority, the conservative legal movement, case studies of two presidents and power",
                "I learnt about how to think about the various factors influencing power, how the US supreme court functions and uses power, and how to look at real world situations in a way that evaluates and understands the use of power.",
                "I thought this class was interesting and gave a varied way to think about the topic of power. Not every piece was super interesting but I think some of it really hits and that makes it worthwhile.",
                "Great information about power and politics.",
                "Analysis of political works and political philosophy and its application to current events.",
                "I learned a broad range of skills including the ability to recognize the principles underlying concepts such as justice, persuasion, and influence. This class was quite broad and introduced us to a variety of source types such as books, articles, movies, plays, and court cases. I found that the level of conversation in class is highly advanced, and much of the knowledge you learn from this class simply comes from being present and absorbing the fascinating comments of Professor Silverstein and your classmates. The readings provided some insights but they tended to be so long that the best way to learn material was often just listening to class discussions."

            "comments": [
                "A bit disorganized, much of the seminar was student-led but it did not feel as though we were learning new information. It felt as though students were just offering their perspectives on current events but it did not feel so much of an academic class with new, unique material to explore than a casual discussion about politics",
                "Strengths: This course was brand new, and Professor Silverstein was more than accommodating with changing readings or topics around to make the course flow better or if we wanted to spend longer on a specific topic. Readings were easy to manage.\r\nWeaknesses: Your very first reading in this class might be tough, but don't stress! It's meant to get you thinking what information is important and what is not when you read.",
                "A lot of readings for this course felt very helpful in my general political science understanding, with the exception of a few that felt like a waste of time. The weakness of this course is that sometimes the readings and discussions are too vague, so I didn't always actually gain an understanding of political history and it sometimes felt more like a political philosophy class. However, I frequently left the class feeling energized and like I had successfully argued my position during class.",
                "Strengths: Very interesting and relatable content, papers are fairly flexible and open to interpretation\/whatever the student is interested in exploring\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the discussion peters off, and students often don't do the readings because it's easy to get away with",
                "This course was amazing! The discussion based approach was great, and the texts that we read were very interesting. However, I wish we were able to discuss each text in greater detail rather than just spending one session on each.",
                "Some of the readings were great, others less so. Perhaps a little sharper focus especially early on would be helpful as often it would devolve into outside topics people brought up that werent directly in the readings. But discussions were interesting and engaging throughout.",
                "Great course overall.",
                "The readings for some weeks seemed a bit unbalancedthere would be really heavy readings one week, while others were relatively light. This is both good and bad, but I generally wished it was more predictable.",
                "This course provided an excellent discussion environment -- although some comments were highly sophisticated and discouraged the more shy members of the class from engaging as much, the majority of our class participated multiple times each day. Another strength of the course is Professor Silverstein. His knowledge is incredible in its range and depth, yet he makes each person in the class feel intelligent and values their comments. One weakness of the course is that it seemed to lack clear direction at times -- although the concepts were interesting, the overall takeaways from the course were largely left ambiguous. Maybe this will change over the years, as this was the first year it was taught."

                "Not really, the class felt like something one could learn on their own just by reading the news, etc",

                "yes, absolutely, if you have any interest in political science and studying power in America and beyond",
                "Yes! Professor Silverstein is amazing, the course material is very interesting, and I learnt how to think about power in ways that I had never considered before.",
                "Yeah. Its a fun first year seminar that gives an intro what a poli sci seminar is like",
                "Yes absolutely a great seminar.",
                "Yes, as the professor is very hands-on and open to students",
                "I would definitely recommend. It provided a great overview of power in an academic environment. For me, it was a nice introduction to political theory, too.",
                "I absolutely would recommend this course to anyone with a sincere interest in American politics. However, I definitely would not recommend it to someone who is not very passionate about this topic. Even though the name of the course sounds broad, 90% of readings and discussions center around deep analyses of the American political system. This is a very heavy political science class, and if that suits you, take it."
