Conversation enlightened a number of interesting interpretations of the texts. Does what you would expect from a Yale English seminar.",

                "Professor Deming was very intentional about making each one of us care about the texts, and made us interrogate how and why we were participating in the way we were. Of course, the readings were also a huge strength: I am so grateful to have gotten to read these texts, which will stay with me for life.",
                "The course is amazing! The only (very minor) improvements I would make are about pace (we could read way more Dickinson and Emerson but go fairly slowly through them and on the other hand we race so fast through Moby Dick that its basically a fire-hose of whale trivia and soaring prose that flashes by so fast youre left wishing you had more time to digest things) and the final paper (which is very long and requires us to cite at least 3 sources: a book, essay, and item from the last decade. Given that this is a 200-level course, I think a shorter paper more centered around our own thoughts would be better for our learning than a full research paper). Overall, this course is darn near perfect. Highly recommend.",
                "Deming was very helpful and clearly an expert in these three authors. The seminar structure was also quite liberating, as students could choose the direction of discussion.",
                "Great course with interesting readings and awesome professor",
                "Strengths  the reading list and Prof. Deming himself. He is an excellent instructor who strikes a good balance between leading discussion when necessary and encouraging high quality class discussion",
                "Strengths: Student-led discussions with essays and questions very useful for spurring debate in class. Appropriate amount of reading for each class (perhaps except Moby Dick...but such is always the case with Moby Dick). Interesting texts and, this year, a particularly good group of thinkers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Often difficult to tell what connects the three authors beyond time period and some general themes. As per usual, a lot of material to cover each class period, so an explicit focus for each class (what to pay attention to while reading) would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Demings discussions and feedback, the range of texts, writing and responding to each other with our assigned responses. Weaknesses: I would have spent slightly less time on Emerson for more time with Dickinson.",
                "wonderful selection of readings, seminar environment",
                "I think the seminar was run really well overall, especially for the sections on Melville, I think the sections on Dickinson could use some more secondary materialI really enjoyed the poems but with the demands of the semester I think I usually ended up reading them all just in the 30 minutes before class, sorry!",
                "Strengths: class discussion, reading selection, professor engagement \r\nWeaknesses: organization (lack of clear syllabus or paper instructions)",
                "Strengths: quality of texts, syllabus structure of three interconnected authors, expertise of professor, intelligence of peers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: professor's unreliability in guiding discussion, lack of Whitman",
                "This course was intimidating. At first I didn't know if I would like this class  I was intimidated and a little scared of the professor and my fellow classmates. But, by the end I had a great respect for them all, while also feeling like I belonged in their midst. Its definitely a course that expects a lot of you  I spent innumerable hours dissecting each page, each poem, so I felt prepared coming into class, and it felt like a class where I couldn't speak unless I had something truly thoughtful to say. It was a course of rigor  of rigorous thoughts and ideas. Everyone seemed to really care about what we read  like there were stakes. I've never felt so much in a classroom that what we read, and the conclusions or non-conclusions we came to, were life and death. \r\n\r\nThis all being said, I do think the environment was a little nerve wracking, and I feel like it could we adjusted to make it feel more inclusive. I was definitely  scared every time I spoke for a longgg time, and could see how for people already nervous talking in class, it could feel impossible to do so."

                "Absolutely! Each writer you read is absolutely brilliant and has wisdom relevant to everybody. You will learn so much about life and yourself from reading and discussing them. This was a favorite course of my time at Yale, and I highly recommend it.",

                "Yes! A great introduction to the American literary spirit. And what a gift to read Moby-Dick in seminar together!",
                "Yes and no. Yes because of the material. No because of the way the class was taught. Personally, I don't love teachers who just sit back and let the conversation just turn in circles so we end up talking about the same thing for an hour. Deming just wasn't really my style; weird vibes.",
                "Yes absolutely! This is a fairly chill course for a junior seminar, but the readings are excellent, the professor is excellent, it's a lot of fun and you will learn a lot about early American literature.",
                "YES 100%",
                "If you are interested in these authors and their works, you will get a whole lot out of this course. Discussions are supplemented by critical pieces on the works and casual mini-lectures on the author's lives, both of which I found helpful in building my knowledge of the period.",
                "I absolutely would. For anyone who wants to stretch their mind and fall into the page - this is the perfect class for them."
