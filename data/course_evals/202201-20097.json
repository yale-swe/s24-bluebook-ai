                "This class is an estimation class. I learned about how useful it can be to quickly estimate the magnitude of something as an exponent of 10. I don't think I actually learned that much about astronomy, though.",
                "I learned how to do order of magnitude estimation as well as apply basic physics concepts to real world applications.",
                "An introductory knowledge of astronomy.",
                "I got pretty good at doing Fermi problems about just about anything within the solar systemrocks, oceans, stars, lifeand also some estimation techniques for stuff on the scale of the galaxy and the universe.",
                "I learned how to approximate big numbers to get a pretty accurate answer. Also learned how orbits work, the formation of the planets and the stars, and more.",
                "I learned a lot of interesting things in this class, from how to use order of magnitude estimation, to how things like climate change and solar flares occur.",
                "I learned a lot about the planets and especially Earth. The main skill I learned was how to make order of magnitude estimations which I think will be helpful in the future for other coursework and projects.",
                "knowledge about the earth and estimation tactics",

                "More confidence estimating things and using common sense to figure problems out, rather than just searching things up on Google! \r\nDeveloped more knowledge of HOW the solar system has developed, and how it functions the way it does. Really cool stuff!!",
                "This course covered a vast variety of topics, but also taught important life skills that are certainly applicable beyond this course. We focused on our solar system (the sun, our moon, tides, eclipses, etc.), as well as our galaxy and interstellar objects. We then applied this to a study about gravity, orbits, etc., and evaluated if the SpaceX Mars mission is likely to work. We then circled back to our Earth, learning about climate change, renewable energy sources, and what constitutes life. Throughout this entire time, we also placed a significant focus on order of magnitude estimation, so we could simplify calculations and apply them to anything we may need them for. Hence, the coursework was certainly very interesting and engaging, and despite focusing on Astronomy, felt incredibly applicable to our everyday lives."

                "Perhaps more review materials posted online?",
                "This class has a lot of support. Every week there was office hours, two sections, and a ULA help session. I wish I had started going to the sections earlier, but once I did it was a big help to any tricky pset issue. I really liked the content of the course. The lectures and psets are often quite related which is nice and an incentive to be at every lecture since it is all connected!",
                "PSETs were very engaging but sometimes didn't line up very well with course material in terms of scope. Maybe just allow students to drop one question from each PSET so that grade-related stress isn't there.",
                "Strengths: low workload and mostly interesting lectures\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the class could have been better as sometimes the units would just jump around and studying for the final therefore became somewhat confusing as to how to go about it",
                "Strengths: Professor Laughlin is a very engaging lecturer, on the whole. Sections are optional, which was incredible. Also, the material was sometimes wacky, which was fun (can Elon Musk actually travel to Mars, other random and complicated questions to estimate). Also, estimation is an important skill, and you get a lot better at it.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets are hard and long, although the grading is fairly relaxed. I think expectation-setting and a few more guidelines would be really helpful, especially at the beginning of the class.",
                "For a science class that doe not also fulfill a QR requirement, most of the coursework is math, which is not what I was looking for in a non QR class. I wich there was more science and less math.",
                "I think it was strong in that it provided a nice overview of a lot of concepts related to physical sciences, but it often felt ddetached from reality in clear ways. I am not a scientist, and scientists often have a difficult time proving why their work matters, even (paradoxically) in the case of climate scientists. I think it could be improved either through a more pihlosophical investmment in some of these themes, or by discussing their politics more critically.",
                "There were definitely some interesting lectures however many classes were drawn out to explain math-based concepts.",
                "This course is an interesting intro to Physics with some other concepts from Chemistry and Biology. The content is cool but not overly challenging. The Pset every two weeks proved to be a good length in between homework. One improvement that could be made is getting a digital puck. I had to watch a few lectures online due to travel with the Track team, and a lot of them were low quality both audio and visual-wise.",
                "Strengths: Greg is a great lecturer. He's really funny and he knows how to roll with the punches (punches being a sparse and largely unresponsive audience of students). \r\nWeaknesses: The assessments for this course are a mess. PSets took me easily 30 hours each, and that was when I worked with a buddy. Hard to know how to study for the exams, although it was good to have a sheet of topics to review. The slides, when he uploaded them to Canvas, were entirely unhelpfulthey rarely included any text at all and the accompanying lecture notes were few and far between over the whole semester. His lectures are all that saves this class from being a huge hassle and not that good at all.",
                "This class is super weird. It's a very enjoyable lecture and Greg is funny and the topics are fun. HOWEVER, if you are taking it for a grade you will be beyond stressed. The stuff you learn is not easily testable and so he'll teach you some very specific things (like the phases of the moon) that are easy to test, but you won't spend any time on in the homework or in class.",
                "It is all around fun.",
                "I don't think there were any weaknesses to this course. This course is meant to be easy / approachable, and it managed to do that while remaining extremely fun, engaging, and rewarding.",
                "I really enjoyed the structure! Perhaps it can be more clear exactly what are the general concepts which we will be tested on.",
                "Final test were a bit harder than I thought it would be",
                "Strengths: Some of the lectures were really cool, Professor Laughlin is a good guy and makes some of the classes interesting. There are also relatively few assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the lectures were math heavy and physics-based. Not only was this a bit difficult and unexpected, as the class in not a QR. credit, but i found these particular lectures to be far less engaging.",
                "It sometimes felt a little all over the place which made it hard to study but everything was very interesting.",
                "Sometimes lectures felt long + more math than expected for parts. But really loved the topics and they were very interesting.",
                "The biggest strength of this course is engaging subject material. It is also designed to appeal to those who are not STEM majors and are not accustomed to astronomy, or any science class for that matter. One small weakness is that the problem sets didn't always seem to correspond to what we were learning in class, which could make them more difficult.",
                "I think that this course is really engaging if you attend the lecturesProf. Laughlin is an engaging speaker and picks topics that are accessible and fun to learn about. The homework was sometimes hard to follow but office hours were always very useful and the grading was very flexibleas long as you make an effort to answer, you'll get credit.",
                "Strengths - we learned cool stuff until like the final 3 weeks when things got kind of rogue and boring (in my opinion)... discussing life in computers and bits and stuff? it was just a lot less fascinating then learning how the sun works and how the solar system developed, or lava pushing the continents farther apart, etc etc. So strength is that it was mostly super interesting class content! \r\nWeakness - the PSETS had nothing to do with what we learned in class which meant that it was incredible tempting and easy to skip class... also the PSETS were sometimes unnecessarily long and confusing for seemingly no reason? Final Exam was  more reasonable, so maybe make psets more like that?",
                "This course covered a variety of topics to just the right amount of depth, so I felt engaged but not overwhelmed by the complexity of the subject. It also gave challenging homework sets, but at the same time provided just the right amount of support from the Professor and Teaching Fellows. Therefore, it was the perfect amount of challenge, while still being super engaging. The professor also made it very clear what exactly we needed to know for exams and what we didn't, which helped facilitate my studying. Finally, there was a good mix of lecturing and participation in the class, so I always felt very involved."

                "Yes! I am really glad I took this class to fulfill my last science distributional requirement. It is not a QR course though, and it is VERY math heavy. I read the reviews before, thought it can't be too much math since it's not a QR, but it is honestly as much math (if not a bit more) than the actual QR courses I took (coming from a humanities major though)! I didn't mind the math though, and it is all very deeply connected to the concepts of the course. The math is essential to understanding the astronomy, but you should know before going into the course that you will have ample opportunity for both mathematical calculations as well as writing short essays on your thoughts about climate change, SpaceX, clouds, extra-terrestrial life, and more!",
                "Yes--wonderful, fun science credit, but the amount of computation and class scope might be more intense than non-STEM majors might want.",

                "Yes but be prepared to have long sessions grinding out the problem sets.",
                "Yes, Prof. Laughlin is a fantastic instructor and guy.",
                "Yes! This is a fun and pretty useful science class that sits on the cusp of being a gut (section is optional and grading is easy, although the psets are long, complicated, and challenging). If you want a fun lecture and to learn a lot about outer space, astrophysics, geoscience, and estimation, this is a good class. If you're not STEM (like me) and big and convoluted estimation questions sound like your worst nightmare, I'd avoid.",
                "We have to take science classes, even if they don't really teach science, and they all largely feel the same.",
                "I would if they were willing to do math here and there to learn a little background into our earth and solar system, then yes.",
                "Yes, I think it is an excellent introduction to a series of science courses or a more accessible course for those who find the concepts of space travel intriguing but do not have a science background.",
                "It really depends on the person. This class is much more of an estimation class than an astronomy class so be prepared for that.",
                "Good gut, interesting topics, and useful skills learnt.",
                "Probably not. Despite the fact that I loved Professor Laughlin's lectures, don't expect him to actually talk about astronomy all that much. It's mostly a class about estimation in a vaguely astronomical context, but also the course occasionally veers into the realms of biology, population dynamics, and other largely unrelated fields. And those PSetsthey really, really sucked. They're a huge time waster and they're hardly even evaluated by the TFs after all that work you put in.",
                "If you're looking for a very fun credit-d class and you're NOT a stem major, this is good. If you're worried about grades it may stress you out about. It is definitely NOT for STEM majorsI took this as a senior and I still remembered how to do a bunch of stuff we learned from AP Physics.",
                "Yes, it is really fun.",
                "Yes absolutely! Especially if you're a humanities / not science major, this is a really fun and rewarding class which will get you your science credit.",
                "Yes! So cool!",
                "Yes",
                "I would but with caution. While the workload is pretty light, it is not really a gut if you are looking for an easy science credit.",
                "Yes I would.",
                "Yes, I think I developed great critical thinking skills and the information was presented in a way which facilitated thinking rather than memorization.",
                "If you are looking for a science credit, I would definitely recommend this course, as it never gets too difficult but still remains quite interesting.",
                "Yes! It was a fun science credit that didn't take up a crazy amount of time and doesn't require memorization the way that a lot of science courses do.",
                "Yes if you want a chill science where you learn cool things about outer space and the solar system but in a chill NON PHYSICS fashion! But be prepared for weirdly complicated psets. (but psets are only every other week and grading is super easy)",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, as it is a fantastic non-QR science credit that really gets you to think about the world and universe around you. Professor Laughlin was incredibly engaging and clearly very passionate about the subject he was lecturing on. The problem sets were unusual but very fun to do - for instance, we had to evaluate the SpaceX Mars mission, draw the four cardinal directions from a high vantage point, and calculate how many chocolate bars worth of energy it takes to send a chocolate bar into orbit. The entire course kept me engaged, as the variety in topics was vast, ranging from gravity to the environment to computer intelligence to what constitutes life. This course was the best I took this semester, and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to learn a lot and have a lot of fun in the process."
