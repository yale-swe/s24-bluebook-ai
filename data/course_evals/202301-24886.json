                "I learned more about all the intricacies of food systems in urban areas on four different main parts of the food process.",
                "I learned about eating, growing, selling, and recovering food - all stages of the food system. The course incorporates system-based thinking, something that Professor Koch encourages us to use as a lens for considering how socioeconomic factors influence access to healthy foods, how the supply chain and food sales vary across landscapes, why food scarcity exists when we produce so much food, and how food waste impacts the environment. I also came away with a better sense of how my personal consumption habits factor into the food system, and how food growing strategies can be adapted to spatial constraints. Whether you have or haven't used the Adobe creative suite and GIS, you'll also gain improved graphic design skills from the course and methods to portray your information in a concise graphic manner.",
                "Mapping, making all types of persuasive and informative visual displays, using ADOBE suite, and so much about how food operates through different systems in a city.",
                "I learned about how food systems are designed and function within varying government structures. We specifically looked at the different perspectives of the food system which included growing, eating, and recovering food.",
                "This course is designed to give students a comprehensive understanding of the food system in an urban environment. It covers various stages involved in the food supply chain, starting from growing to the final stage of waste management. One of the most important takeaways is the understanding of hidden systems that exist to ensure city residents have access to the food they need. We explored the complexities of food distribution, identified various players involved, and understood economic and social factors influencing how food gets from the farm to the table.\r\n\r\nThe course also teaches students how to create engaging, concise infographics. These infographics are useful in communicating complex information in a visually appealing manner -- as advised by the TF in the architecture school. Assignments included a memo to the mayor, a map, an analysis of a grocery store, and a farm crop plan.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the course, we had a much deeper understanding of how the food system operates in urban areas and how different components of the system interact with each other. The course will be especially useful for those interested in sustainability, urban planning, or food systems.",
                "I learned better about how cities are constantly evolving and being made - cities are ever changing.  We looked at cities through the lens of food, which revealed to me a lot of processes and dynamics I've never thought about, such as the foodscape.  I learned about the nuances between food security, food justice, and food sovereignty, and how just food security (e.g. food pantries and soup kitchens) isn't enough.  I find myself thinking more deeply about where the food I eat comes from and what routes it took to get here.  I think about food waste more deeply, as it is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions.",
                "food systems, a bit of gis, board design and presentation",
                "I think the main skill was design thinking and the ability to translate ideas into visual form. The assignments were all different (a policy memo, a crop plan, representing a grocery store) but they all asked us to present information in a way that would appeal to someone who only had 5 minutes to glance at it. This course taught me how to use space, and word things concisely. \r\n\r\nI also was introduced to a lot of big questions about food policy and the systems that distribute food (e.g. what is the consequence of customers wanting the same produce year-round?), more so than details about how they work in practice.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of the food system as it relates to community governance, sustainable agriculture, markets, and more.",
                "Learned to communicate and present information for an expert and broader audience, learned about the journey of food before it gets on your table and after it leaves, learned to think more like a food policymaker",
                "How to use adobe indesign, photoshop, and illustrator, as well as understand the complexities of the food system",
                "We learned a lot about different food systems- really interesting information that I totally would not have thought about but is really important to the way cities function. We explored different aspects of how food is grown, made, transported, sold, and consumed",
                "I gained thorough skills and insights to food policy throughout the United States, seeing how food organisations are organised, and understanding through real life applications of food policy (i.e. grocery stores, farms, high schools)",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: class was always fun and different, and we did a variety of different activities (even taking field trips to the yale farm, common grounds elementary school, and grocery stores). Jacob is an amazing professor. Id take whatever class he teaches, no matter the topic. Hes so great about creating a great set of readings, a variety of assignments and in class activities, and vests a lot of interest in the success of every student. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses, this class was near perfect. If I had to say something Id change, I wish that assignments 3 and 4 were also on large posters too!",
                "The strengths of this course is that it gives everyone an opportunity to bring in their own personal relationships and stories with food to the class, which makes for really rich discussion. You also gain new technical methods for assignments which is different from many courses at Yale. Workshops like the GIS one were VERY helpful. It would be great to have a Photoshop\/Indesign tutorial period for the first few weeks that the TF runs in addition to class time. We had an extra 2-hr \"section\" for a previous Urban Lab that I took where we hashed out ideas, worked through technical issues, used it as work time, and the TF often had presentations on how to use the Adobe creative suite. It was a much smaller class size though, so it could be split into two 1-hr blocks throughout the week or people could opt-in to section for the week if they need a jump start for certain assignments with either technical or idea help from the TF. Add a section & maybe make the actual class time slightly shorter \/ cap the class at a slightly smaller number.",
                "Thought overall it was great. Maybe add a break in the middle of class since it is three hours. But readings were great and the field trips were super fun, but also great learning experiences. The assignments were also incredibly engaging; with each one, I got to learn something new, develop a new skill, look at food from a different lens, and most importantly see myself improve from the very first one to the last one. Also the amount of feedback we got on each assignment was incredible.",
                "Prof. Koch is an amazing resource and lecturer. His professional knowledge enriched class discussion and he was able to help us break down big concepts into smaller, understandable chunks. The way the class was structured, with lectures, small discussion, pin-ups and critiques, and field trips made the class feel continually exciting and innovative.",
                "The course was new, so there were some kinks in organization, but overall I think it went very smoothly. In my opinion, the biggest strength of the course was bringing in people from organizations relevant to the course material, as well as the \"field trips\" to Common Ground High School, an assigned grocery store, and the Yale Farm. Overall, we learned a ton in these applied sessions, and I think the lecture-based classes felt a bit dry in comparison.",
                "Strengths: great discussions in class on relevant topics, peer critiques on our poster assignments, amazing site visits to supermarkets, common ground high school, and Yale farm\r\nWeaknesses: It was a 3 hour class on Fridays, so I (along with  many others) was often restless after an hour or so.  We did start instituting breaks towards the end of the term which I appreciated.  Also for the assignments , we received little guidance about what to do.  Many people in the class already were highly proficient with illustrator, arcGIS, and so on, which meant there was a huge skill gap within our class.  I spent hours and pulled two all-nighters perfecting my posters - I wouldve appreciated more help.",
                "strengths: helpful, insightful field trips and guest speakers\r\nweaknesses: limited perspective (obviously very urban-centered even though food making is a process that has to include rural and suburban communities).",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\n1. Assignment Structure. I thought the format of 4 projects was perfect. Each felt manageable but also meaningful and they were spaced out. The fact that they were visual seemed more appropriate for an urban studies class than conventional essays. I also loved the \"food snapshots\" that we shared.\r\n\r\nThe feedback on assignments was also very helpful and I liked doing class critique. \r\n\r\n2. Field Trips. The highlight of this class for me was visiting Common Ground (a high school with a farm) and visiting a grocery store as an observer. This made the course way more engaging and interactive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n1. Lectures. Professor Koch is a great presenter and is really passionate about topics but it's really easy to lose focus during the slideshows. I also felt that the content itself was mixed; some of the topics (e.g. the structure of city government) are very important but not necessarily what most students are curious about. I personally am interested in urban policy so the government part is useful but I don't think it appealed to most.\r\n\r\n2. Assignment content\/guidance. I really liked the assignments and Professor Koch was always willing to meet but the assignments sometimes seemed a bit intimidating. Maybe it would help if the class had more of a workshop component so we could develop the design skills a bit in class. The GIS workshop, for example, was really helpful but, with the crop plan, I felt more blind.",
                "Strengths: such a great topic with so many engaging field trips and inspiring speakers \r\nWeaknesses: long class periods that didnt often include class collaboration or small group discussion unless discussing an assignment",
                "Weakness was the three hour lectures we had at the beginning. But, the lectures became more interactive, like a big seminar, towards the end",
                "The course was very interactive and you had the freedom to do projects about topics that you were passionate about. No weaknesses",
                "Strengths: pretty chill class where we got to learn a lot about the food system ans New Haven in particular \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we didn't actually use the readings in class or on the assignments, class felt unstructured at times, more actual observation in the city would be nicer. It also at times didn't really feel like an urban studies class but more like food studies- had very little to do with the built environment\/ the actual cityscape",
                "This course's strength lies chiefly in Prof Jacob Koch who was a thoroughly engaging professor. The amount of effort he put in to helping his students personally was astounding. Prof Koch also assembled a fantastic team of practitioners to give students maximal insight into food in the US, and also designed very innovative assignments. The course has no weaknesses.",
                "I think Jacob is a great professor - he clearly loves what he teaches, and it shows. The assignments made sense, but given that 4 assignments determine our entire grade, it would be nice to have more time to work on them. Additionally, more critique would not go amiss - having a draft due one week, and the final assignment due the next (where both - or at least the draft) go under some sort of critique would be significantly more useful in terms of skills development and learning. Every assignment someone would misjudge the sizing of the print-out, make bad colour decisions or something similar, and those could be easily rectified and thus result in better assignments. That all being said, all in all this class is 99% strengths - it was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.",
                "I think more policy focus would be good. I would also like if assignments had the details released a bit sooner, so I could begin basic preparation earlier."

                "Yes! Yes! A million times yes! This course was so well structured and had such an incredible, kind, caring, passionate, energetic professor. While a 3 hour class might seem like a daunting timeframe, Jacob always kept class activities varied and exciting, and gave valuable feedback on assignments. We had lectures, seminars, guest speakers, discussions, pinups, group breakouts, and even field trips! Every day was new and exciting and I was always enthusiastic about whatever we were doing. If you have the opportunity to, take this class!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to students, especially Urban Studies! Even if you're not an Urban major you'll still have so much to contribute to and gain from the course. If you're looking to learn Adobe \/ GIS, it's a great way to develop technical skills in context and learn how to present your ideas graphically.",
                "Absolutely. Jacob is a fantastic professor, and the course is just so engaging. You are constantly learning something, and so much of it is relatable to our lives. I was never bored in class, and I had a lot of fun doing the assignments. They were a bit demanding if you really wanted to produce an advanced board, but I found the amount of time and effort I put into them to be rewarding when I saw it all come to fruition.",
                "Yes!!!! The class structure allows you to experience New Haven in a rare way that not a lot of other classes allow you to. Prof. Koch is an incredible source of knowledge and an engaging teacher. I am incredibly happy to have been honored with taking this class and I recommend any student to take this class regardless of your academic background or interests. This class was a joy.",
                "Yes absolutely. The course is great for anyone interested in public policy. environmentalism \/ sustainability, and urban planning.",
                "Yes! It is an amazing class to learn about food justice, environmental justice, social justice, urbanism, and so on.  I decided to take the class coming in from an environmental perspective, but quickly grew fond of concepts within urban studies and even architecture of the \"built environment.\"",
                "yes! prof koch is wonderful and has so much insight into city governments and food systems.  the workload is pretty light--only 4 assignments throughout the semester.  i understand that this an urban studies course, but it was often frustrating how much the course and discussion ignored rural areas and their contributions and problems within the food system.",
                "Yes! I wouldn't take it because you're interested in food necessarily but it's a really good fit for someone who is interested in policymaking and especially appreciates the hands-on component of urban studies.",
                "Yes! Jacob is a great professor who doesnt overwhelm you with work, but you get as much out of it as you put in",
                "Yes! If you are interested about the food system (in an architecture, public health, or government way) I highly recommend this course. Professor Koch is excellent.",
                "If you are really interested in the food system yes. If you are looking to get a methods urban studies course that would help you gain skills in urban studies and you're not that into food, maybe- you may just find you actually really are into food, we also learn a lot about graphic design (probably mostly because the TA was very experienced in that), and we do some really interesting readings on urban design",
                "Yes! Super fun",
                "Absolutely! It's a fantastic course and I would recommend it to all",
                "Yes. If you're considering an Urban Lab you're probably well aware of what they are, and in this lab you will learn a lot, but without drowning under an insane amount of workload."
