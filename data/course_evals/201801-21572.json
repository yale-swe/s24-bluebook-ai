   "comments": [
    "The course is interesting and the research project was cool. The class could have been better organized.",
    "This course did a good job at exposing students to a variety of techniques and teaching us to write a scientific paper. However, the course was often disorganized and it seemed there were no clear instructions at times. Students were often told different instructions, and it seemed there were too many different projects going on at one time. I would recommend having clearer guidelines in the future protocols and also ensuring greater uniformity in the students' projects.",
    "the course was really poorly taught. The TA's had no idea what the professor wanted. The professor could not articulate what was going on or what was expected. And the course required more hours of work than any other class I am taking, for half of the credit.",
    "I wish there was a little more organization within this course; even just a simple outline we could look at before class of our goals for the class would be helpful. I felt like the procedures would be straightforward, but I would come to class and be surprised about how they related to the overall project. It's one thing to understand the procedure, and it's another thing to understand how the procedure fits into the goals of the course of the project\/overall day.\r\n\r\nI wish Dr. Moreno had explained more about the project at the beginning of the course; I understand that not telling us was to facilitate our own research during the process. I felt just very confused during everything and I wish there was a little more clarity.\r\n\r\nSome of the quiz questions had wrong answers, and sometimes the TA's didn't know what was going on.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I did love the course and how flexible it was and how we got to do molecular biology to receive real results.",
    "The biggest and most terrible weakness of this class was the lack of organization. I was super confused at all times throughout the course, but in a very very distressing way because it felt like I was getting behind everyone else at all times. The quizzes were difficult, even when reading through all the material. Even though Professor Moreno lectured on how to write scientific papers, it was really hard to do for the first time by yourself, especially when you got graded on the drafts. I think this class is great but needs to be organized much more in terms of us actually knowing what we're doing with our project from the beginning, and not just getting a bunch of instructions 2 days before the lab. I honestly wished I had just taken an easy lab course because this class caused me so much distress.",
    "This course had very little direction. I often found myself very confused by what we were supposed to be doing and not having clear instruction. The assignments in particular were difficult because there was no clear instruction either. But, I think I still learned a lot, especially technical skills.",
    "Project oriented, which is cool, but a little too dependent on our results for an intro lab",
    "This class could have been better organized. Students oftentimes found themselves lost with little direction.",
    "Strengths included how more \"real\" this lab felt since I was actually doing research for a real project for the iGEM team. Strengths also included having two TAs for the lab and amazing lab resources and supplies considering this is an undergrad lab course. Weaknesses included confusing\/unclear directions when standard protocols were modified, and also the TAs and the professor often gave different directions.",
    "A bit disorganized, but helped us be independent of a given class protocol."

    "This course is one of few introductory MCDB labs. If you want to learn some basic lab techniques, this is a fine class.",
    "absolutely not.",
    "Yes, but you have to be willing to struggle and fail a little bit to learn.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you really need to take it. I think you learn valuable things in terms of writing papers, but if the organization stays the same it's really torturous.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have to take it. You spend a lot of time on this class and it's pretty stressful. I know there are other less stressful biology labs out there.",
    "Its neat if you want to do biology research",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone interested in getting experience in real biology research, especially those wanting to work in labs over the summer or outside of courses. The in-class research topic and techniques very relevant to any biology lab, and the writing assignments were very manageable. There are just a few drafts of different scientific report parts (e.g. intro, discussion, results) due every 2-3 weeks and you can just compile them into the final paper. Writing these was really useful for understanding the purpose of each experiment and the overarching goal of the course - which you will have to know how to do in any other (non-course) bio lab.",
