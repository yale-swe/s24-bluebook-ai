                "I learned so much about the history of trauma, the ideologies which inform the function of medical institutions, and how to apply these ideas to empathy-driven medical care",
                "I learned so much. It almost feels like this class rewires your brain to make you a more caring, sympathetic, far-seeing thinking. You come out having thought about the most important aspects of our world a million different ways. You learn a ton of history, philosophy, and psychology.",
                "I learned an entire history of the construction of trauma and its study. This class was unlike any I had taken at Yale in that it was the first time in a long time that I didn't read the same authors and things over and over again.",
                "This course provided a thoughtful and well-rounded approach to trauma scholarship and studies over time. Using historical sources, as well as contemporary analysis, it offered a way to consider how understandings of trauma have changed over time. With a particular consideration how race, class, and gender pertain to trauma, this course was also useful for developing students' writing/reading techniques, and critical thinking. It provided a place to think through issues that affected all of us, in community.",
                "Such a holistic approach to understanding trauma. We studied different histories of trauma, different embodiments of trauma (how it is felt, rememberd, experienced, expressed), different approaches to trauma (in academia, in medicine, in society as a whole). Covered a lot of different readings on trauma as wellSTS/STEM pieces, government studies/reports, articles, news pieces, media pieces (songs, artwork, movies, influencers, etc). Just a wonderful, incredibly intentional syllabus that I feel like everyone, across disciplines, should work through.",
                "This course provided a unique and compelling tour of trauma in its many varied expressions both historically and today. One develops an acute sense for evaluating challenging medical and theoretical primary and secondary literature that are often left out of historical analysis.",
                "A lot of conversations about trauma and healing and ways people cope with trauma that has not been brought up outside of class or in other academic settings.",
                "I learned how to not only synthesize information from complex texts but also discuss intense ideas with peers.",

                "This was a phenomenal class. The professor, the content, the discussions were some of the best I had at Yale. There is a lot of reading, but nothing abnormal for history seminars. The prof also makes them very digestable!",
                "The class has only strengths. I've been sitting here trying to come up with weaknesses for quite some time, but I got nothing. The grading is fair, the assignments are all fascinating, and Ange is maybe my favorite professor ever.",
                "No weaknesses. Literally none. I have never taken a course led by a graduate student that was done so well. The strengths range from the syllabus, the assignments, Ange's incredible intelligence, their ability to facilitate discussion, and their care for their students. She could have been teaching me how to tie my shoes, and it would have been the most interesting thing I ever heard.",
                "Strengths: Professor Clayton is spectacular--offers clear and kind feedback, and knows so much about her subject area. They are very available for student needs, including office hours, writing hours, and quick response times to emails. Students ranging from first years to seniors were able to thrive in the class due to her flexibility and expertise in trauma studies. Incredibly incisive conversations came out of this class, and it provided a place for many of us to reflect--not just academically but personally. In a class about trauma, things could have gotten too intense, but that didn't happen, due to the classroom parameters and community agreements that Professor Clayton facilitated.\r\nWeaknesses: Truly, none.",
                "strengths: literally everything!!\r\nweaknesses: the only thing I would subtract/rethink are the presentations students do on readings; it could be more impactful to have students find a more engaging way to share what the readings meant to them/what they took away from it (like maybe a piece of media or something that shows others how they can connect to the reading). i would add some things as well, like more art/interactive sources on the syllabus (some videos/artwork/music etc).",
                "Amazing professor and material. Clear organization of content. A must-take!",
                "Discussions were great!",
                "I really enjoyed the weekly readings responses/lower-stress writing. I felt that I had the opportunity to sit with the material without the pressure of class discussion or major papers. One weakness of the course was the amount of reading per week. Although understandable, I wish that we could look at other forms of media, such as excerpts in movies/documentaries, literature, etc., instead of just readings. I felt like the readings became difficult to read through and I felt that I did not get as much out of them as I could have.",
                "One weakness would be its frequency! I wish we met twice a week. There were many strengths including the size of the seminar, organization of weekly topics, and order of readings."

As a premed, this class was really informative to my future practice and all pre-meds should try to take it. There were a ton of non-health sciences students who took it as well, which made for great discussion",
                "Yes yes yes. Ange might be the coolest person ever. Please take this class. This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale. You learn so much and come out looking at the world differently. Ange creates an environment where you can test out new ideas and really think deeply about the subjects.",
                "Yes. I would more strongly suggest it for upperclassmen only because the readings were difficult for the first-years and sophomores there, but I think it served as a great opportunity for them to grow their ability to engage with scholarly material. I would recommend any class Ange is involved with without any hesitation.",
                "Highly! Professor Clayton is an outstanding instructor, and you should not miss the chance to learn from her. This course provided me with the means to articulate concerns and thoughts I had been having for years, as well as benefiting the development of my senior thesis. The syllabus is thoughtfully constructed with an eye towards interdisciplinary approaches. Overall, this course engages critical trauma studies in a way that allows for academic creativity while also retaining clarity.",

                "Yes!! Super informative and delves into discussions previously not touched upon.",
                "Yes. This is my favorite class that I have taken so far at Yale and I thought that the space created was the most enriching environment that fostered great conversations."
