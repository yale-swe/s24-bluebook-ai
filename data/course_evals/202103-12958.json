Information was interesting but not necessarily useful. The content of the course felt outdated and unsuited at times to the actual professions and practices the majority of people are pursuing in the course, i.e. graphic design or commercial and\/or digital practices."

The time of day (night) also didn't help with the energy levels in the classroom. I feel like if you get a really engaged, active class it might be a better experience.",
                "This course is obviously required for Art majors, but I would say that it is a welcome shift in pace and learning from a studio setting. Steiner is a force of nature with whom you should try to take this course if you can. Like most courses at Yale, but especially this one, you will only get out what you put inbut putting in time and effort will yield self-discovery and rediscovery of curiosity in ways that may surprise you."
