                "The cultural projects should not need to be memorized. You should not be able to read a pre-typed script, but why should students be forced to spend hours memorizing a presentations worth 1% 3 times per semester? I would recommend allowing notecards in the future.",
                "Weakness: the class varies significantly depending on your professor for your section\r\nStrength: it is a nice continuation of Span I and you learn a lot of concepts and tenses.",
                "Professor Santos could help teach us more material instead of expecting us to teach her like she would say.",
                "The course is certainly rigorous, but that helped me greatly to learn the language.  I had taken language in high school but I hadn't learned this quickly before.  The combination of speaking and writing was helpful.  I think perhaps there could be more of an emphasis on spoken exams.",
                "The course seemed to rush through the material without making sure the student understood each concept in the textbook. Additionally, the material students were responsible for was not covered during class and the activities of class rarely aligned with assessments.",
                "The course is demanding and fast paced, but I felt like there were no weaknesses to this course. I believe that Professor Santos is an amazing professor and I significantly improved my Spanish fluency in this course."

                "I would not recommend this course if you are taking it with professor Santos. While she can be nice, I think she (understandably) struggled to teach this course over zoom. Moreover, it was felt that she expected you to learn the information all on your own and provided no review or general summary of concepts. She simply put students in breakouts room to do work which often just felt like a waste of time. She also spoke in english often to clarify logistics, which meant that spanish was barely spoken in class. I felt like I did not learn as much as I could have in this course.",
                "I would but not with Professor Santos. She was unpredictable and hard to understand what she wanted from us as students.",

                "I would not recommend this course to another student because I think that it felt very hectic and confusing with minimal practice speaking and comprehending the language in class. Additionally, I think students are expected to know more information than they learned from L1 because many students placed into this class or had some background in Spanish before taking L1, so if someone has not taken the language before, I would recommend they not begin.",
