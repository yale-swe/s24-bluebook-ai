                "Strengths: The class is taught in a way that covers a lot of material but still makes you come out understanding it at the end of the course. The labs are engaging and interesting, and the TFs are amazing. Weaknesses: Lectures could be dry at times, and sometimes hard to follow. Also, weekly psets in addition to prelabs, lab reports, a midterm, and a final are a lot, so you may need to set aside more time for this class than you think you need.",
                "I think that more time could have been given to hand in lab reports because a lot of the time I scrambled to hand it in while the next lab was a week away.  The teaching was also pretty unclear at points, especially the transistors portion and the transient response portion of the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Han, problem sets followed the book\r\nWeaknesses: Labs sometimes had unclear instructions",
                "Professor Han did not explain concepts too well, and I felt like I had to do my own research when completing psets. Overall, the course feels very rushedwe were often behind a lecture, and Professor Han had to skip over many examples to be able to finish all the material. Exams were open-note, but I do not think the professor adequately prepared us for the exams.",
                "I love the format and content. The weekly labs are super fun and engaging, though challenging, and always help to lock in concepts from lectures and the textbook.",
                "Strengths: good comprehensive introduction to essential circuit analysis/elements for future classes, lecture slides are great\r\nWeaknesses: instructor teaching quality, lab reports take forever, inconsistencies in grading, overadjusted curve",
                "Strengths: teaches and covers a lot\r\nWeaknesses: moves very fast at times",
                "The material was extremely interesting but the lectures and overall structure could be redeveloped. TA's not coming to office hours or professor using other person's slides.",
                "I think the class covers a lot of important material in a fairly short period of time, which is a strength and a weakness. The labs are interesting and fun but weren't too useful for the class and exams.",
                "The course is extremely fast-paced, which makes it easy to fall behind. The difficulty of the exams is, unfortunately, quite unpredictable, but the curve should save your grade. The weekly homework is pretty short and sometimes interesting. The most stressful part of the course, however, is definitely the report-writing. Save a lot of time for those.",
                "Overall, I think the course is well-taught and organized. It gives students broad exposure to numerous different electronic devices. In comparison to equivalent courses at other universities of Yale's stature, it is quite a bit more challenging in terms of the breadth of knowledge required. I don't really have anything negative to say.",
                "class time needs to be longer, it is very hard to learn the material week by week, people usually learn the material right before the exams. if the exams were not open book i would have failed for sure. also the professor gives a generous curve so as long as you can live through the brutal lab reports you will be good",
                "Labs are great, lectures are not very engaging",
                "I found the lectures to be a bit difficult to stay engaged with. It would also be really great if homework solutions could be posted after grading - a lot of the homeworks were pretty difficult and would be really useful to learn from for the exams, but if the answers weren't in the textbooks then we'd never really get an explanation of how it was done.",
                "I felt as though I could have not attended the lecture and I would not have missed out on much since the lecture notes essentially covered everything the lecturer spoke about.",
                "Strengths: Lab was fun and helped me understand the course content. Problem sets were reasonable.\r\nWeaknesses: I found the lectures difficult to understand. I had trouble engaging with the lecturer and was very confused when I tried to do the psets. This could be improved by adding a summary slide (or two) to the end of each lecture that includes every equation, model, or analysis method that we learned in that class.",
                "Strengths: Material is overall pretty logical and lab is cool to get some practical experience. I also really liked my TF Thomas. He was always super nice and helpful during lab!!\r\nWeaknesses: Classes were pretty confusing despite the content not being too difficult. Content also isn't super interesting, but I'm also not an EE major. Also the slides never seemed to get finished in the class time, resulting in the need for supplemental videos",
                "Assigned material was often not comprehensively covered in allotted class time. Labs were vital in both gaining hands-on experience and solidifying theoretical understanding. I suggest doing three things simultaneously:  make lectures 75 minutes rather than 50, add additional labs, and make the class 1.5 credits.",
                "This course could have benefited from more clearly worked out examples that were similar to the psets and exam questions, with slides that communicate how to solve them better. A lot of the slides were about general theories/ways that things work, but did not explain what was actually assessed. The teaching was not very engaging, and difficult to follow.",
                "A strength is the labs which are straightforward and not too time consuming while teaching practical applications of what we learned in class. A weakness could be the lecture format which is disengaging at times which could be improved by more examples in class.",
                "Strengths: depth and breath of topics covered provided a good foundation in electronics, professor was deeply invested in students' learning, teaching staff were very helpful (lab TA Thomas was very helpful during lab exercises, lab manager Kevin was very helpful during open lab hours)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I like how its only necessary to understand the basics and not every single detail, so it felt like I learned a lot relative to the amount of time I spent on it.",
                "Labs are interactive and engaging, office hours and help is readily available, however lectures can be hard to follow at times and don't always teach the necessary knowledge to understand homework and exams. Using less lecture slides that are more relevant and explained more in depth could help.",
                "I really enjoyed the labs and being able to work with a partner on the material! \r\n\r\nLectures were not the best. The timing and covering of the material wasn't good and review lectures alone was better than actually attending lecture.",
                "Strength: covered a wide range of topics so served as a good introduction to almost everything in the field\r\nWeaknesses: due to the volume of material there wasn't that much depth during the lectures so about 70% to 85% of the learning happened outside of lectures",
                "Strengths: I appreciated the lab periods that are a part of this class. The labs help solidify material and provide a hands-on experience of building circuits.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: be prepared to review lecture material outside of class, because 50-minute lectures were almost never enough time. It is often the case that you only get through 1/2 the slides for a given day. To compensate for this, Prof. Han released supplemental material recordings which I found helpful.",
                "This course has several people who can help with psets, labs, and anything else needed. The course moves very quickly and covers a lot of material. The labs helped me see how everything connects and how the material can be helpful in the real world, but sometimes the psets or exams would have problems and topics that would be barely covered.",
                "The strength of this course is that it gives students a broad overview of circuit analysis through lectures and labs, with the labs in particular giving students the opportunity to kinetically internalize lecture material by building and testing the behaviors of various circuits. The wide variety of topics covered in this course is in my opinion very valuable for anyone interested in circuit analysis as you will be able to see many different aspects of the field. A weakness of this course is lectures most often do not cover everything that are in the prepared slides, making it so that learning from the textbook is often necessary. I think the main reason for this is that lectures have more material than can be covered in the 50 minute time slots, so maybe for future semesters, the length of lectures can be increased.",
                "This course needed lectures that better explain the concepts. I appreciated the professor's knowledge, but I did not feel like I learned anything in the lecture because there was too much information thrown at us at too little time, and most the information was not really relevant to solving problems that we needed to solve."

                "If you are a STEM major in need of a writing credit, this class is marginally worth it. There is very little writingthere are only 3 written lab reportsand labs are graded very, very leniently. Labs shouldn't take long at all compared to a humanities paperthe only tricky part might be using R, Matlab, or Python to generate graphs (since Excel graphs are not accepted). However, for any other reason, I would definitely not recommend this class. Lectures are dry and hard to followyou do most of the learning on your own with little help from the professor's lectures.",
                "Yes! EENG 200 is awesome and I really feel comfortable with all sorts of circuit analysis now.",
                "Overall, I would not recommend this course for fun, but I do think it is a necessary and foundational course for most people taking it (i.e. MENG and EENG majors). You learn a lot about circuit components and how they function, and my circuit problem solving skills definitely improved significantly throughout the semester. However, this was not due to Han. He was not the best lecturer. One class, he got through 3/40 slides in the first 23 minutes of our 50 minute class. I began to review the slides on my own time, which were well organized and very informative, instead of attending lecture, and I would say this was a useful strategy. I would say that this course was my heaviest workload this semester, although it varied wildly week by week. Labs were mind numbing, and honestly the worst part of my week. Lab reports added an additional 10-12 hours if we had them that week, but psets were relatively short and only took ~1 hour. Midterm and final studying were significant as problems on the exams were notably harder than pset problems, and questions of that difficulty were not covered in class. However, Han claimed that he would curve the class so that 70% of students received an A or A-, which alleviates a lot of the pressure around exams.",
                "It is needed for the major but it does give a good basic overview of circuits. Helps to have taken Phys 181 before",
                "If there were another professor or if there was a restructure of the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand the basics of circuits or if it is a major requirement.",
                "Although I enjoyed the content of the course, I would recommend against taking this course unless it is required for your major or you are interested in electronics/considering a related major. There is a huge amount of interesting and amazing material covered, but the pace is so fast and the teaching quality is somewhat questionable, so it can be easy to fall behind.",
                "I would recommend this to a student who wants broad exposure to electronics (or a stem-based writing credit, though it is a lot of work for a writing credit).",
                "No, unless you have to for a major its not worth it",
                "As a first-year who took this class their first semester---wanting to major in EE and jump right into the core requirements---I would not recommend any first-year students do the same. This class is very independent in the sense that you must learn everything on your own (studying lecture notes, reading the textbook, etc.) and constantly go to office hours to succeed. Unless you went to a college prep or private high school, it will take a while to figure this out on your own, which will probably leave you feeling hopeless and lost in the class until you find the right learning strategy. It's an awful experience to spend constant days reviewing for the midterm using the textbook, only to realize that it didn't help and covered only three topics out of the many studied.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this class is not structured to promote learning the content easily---talk to a lot of people who took the class previously and be open to changing your study style if you want to succeed. Strength-wise however, EENG 200 was a great intro to not only circuit analysis (which was supplemented effectively by the labs) but also the teaching style of EE at Yale. I'm coming out of the class with a good idea of what I could do differently to succeed in my next EE classes, and many people say that if you can survive 200, then navigating through the next classes with similar structures and styles will be relatively easy.",
                "I would but I'd recommend them to proactively get help when they find themselves not understanding topics - you won't get clarity next lecture if you were confused about a previous lecture, you'll have to catch yourself up. The TAs and Kevin are great resources but really try not to fall behind and try to read the textbook after every topic in the lecture is covered, or else it's easy to fall behind and get very confused.",
                "Yes, I think it is an important introduction to the field of electronics for any student interested in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science, etc.",
                "As a mechanical engineer, I wouldn't recommend this class. I thought that for people in my major, it tried to cover more content than was necessary and it was hard to learn it all. But, it's required for mechanical engineers, so I hope that they consider the suggestion of removing some of the course content, such as MOSFETs.",
                "Only if required or you have a passion for electrical engineering",
                "Yes-if you read the textbook and pay thoughtful attention in class, the course provides a rigorous intro to EE.",

                "If you are interested in electrical engineering then this introductory course will help teach you basic circuit components and configurations but does not get deep into math, physics, or theory of anything.",
                "Absolutely, this course exposed me to a wide variety of interesting topics in electronics and the course had a great professor and great course staff.",
                "yeah its a chill writing/science credit, given that only three of the five/six labs required a writeup of a couple pages, and the practical lab test just makes sure you can build a basic circuit they give a diagram for. The psets took about an hour or two max per week, and the problems don't feel redundant at all. Grading was extremely lenient on assignments, tests kind of hard. Did around average in the class and got an A-, and I think around 70% of people get A/A- so don't stress too much. Overall as a non eeng major, I feel like it wasn't too painful or hard and I still learned a decent amount .",
                "Yes, fairly understandable introductory class that offers a ton of resources to those new to the topic",

I took this course as a non-EE major with some background circuit knowledge from high school physics, and I found this class and the labs very enjoyable. This class does not require background knowledge of EE, as the first few weeks of class provide sufficient foundational material. The class is not meant to overwhelm you; weekly homework assignments are quite short and the exams are open note.",
                "Yes, most people who take it take it for a major, but if you like messing around with circuits and want to learn how to better understand circuits, then this course would be helpful.",
                "I would only take it if you need to for your major or if you are interested in circuits. It's also a good way to obtain your writing component if you're a STEM major since the writing isn't overkill.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to students interested in learning about basic circuit analysis.",
                "This course needs more support. There were not enough teaching assistants for the lab. We had WAY too many students trying to get help during lab and there was only one assistant there. Furthermore, I think it would have been better if we had two ULAs for every office hours session. Many students don't show up to office hours because they know that it will be very hard to get help"
