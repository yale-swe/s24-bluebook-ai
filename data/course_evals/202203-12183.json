                "A broad overview of the system of language, covering topics including but not limited to phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics, grammatical relations, bilingualism, and language acquisition.",

            "comments": [
                "Some of the content was presented in a way that I did not feel like I was best equipped to answer the PSETs, but a strength is that the professor and TA were very reachable so I did not feel like I was drowning alone in that class in any way.",
                "Strengths: the class was very engaging. I liked the material. Prof Pinango is extremely nice and responds promptly to emails. Students got to do a final project, which I think was a great way of integrating the material. Weaknesses: It was poorly organized. Prof Pinango switched constantly between printed handouts, digital handouts, and slides. Some readings on the syllabus were not discussed until the week after or were skipped entirely. Some readings are also unnecessarily long. Midterm grades were not given back until weeks after.",
                "The main strength of this course is Professor Piango herself. The attention that she requires you to bring to each topic enables an intense learning experience. The weakness is that the course meets three times a week, and all three meetings are generally lecture-style. The resulting time commitment was strenuous, and in combination with the weekly homework assignments (which seemed completely fine at first but became far more time-consuming as the semester went on) this course was somewhat overwhelming. Additionally, I felt like this course should not have been advertised as an introductory survey course. I felt like the course assumed a prior knowledge of syntax, which benefitted some students but definitely left other students floundering a bit at the beginning.",
                "Pretty confusing at times, and it didn't seem like classes were very well organized. It could definitely be improved with clearer explnations, notes and expectations of the material.",
                "Strengths- The handouts go along with the lectures so you can study them after the fact, and Professor Piango is more than happy to answer any questions during class. Both of these factors helped me to master the material even though I felt lost a couple of times. \r\n\r\nWeakness- It would have been nice to receive quiz grades/feedback more quickly"

            "comments": [
                "No. The course structure is too disorganized and Professor Pinango meanders off topic frequently. The course provides a very abstract but also somehow narrow view of language that feels outdated compared to contemporary linguistic literature and other linguistics courses here. This course serves as a decent \"Intro to Linguistics\" for a very small population of students that prefer a very specific teaching style. If that's you, then you'll enjoy this class. If not, then you'll hate it. But statistically speaking, you're probably in that second group.",
                "I would recommend this course if you need it for credit. Unless you are into linguistics, I do not think this class was super enjoyable because I wasn't engaged with the source material in the slightest. Of course, this may just be a personal issue, but really evaluate your interest in linguistics before taking the course.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class. The information across the classes builds upon itself, so you need to ensure that you don't fall behind in class. Some familiarity with cognitive science I found quite helpful, but it is definitely not essential.",
                "If you're really interested in the material and don't mind a slightly disorganized instructor, take it. Be prepared to Cr/D it, because the exam questions are a bit weird. The course topics are interesting. Prof Pinango is also an extremely nice and approachable person. Also be aware that you are required to attend a section (even though it is a small lecture), and she uses most of the sections as an extension of her lectures.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone who is deeply interested in language and is willing to devote themselves to this course. I wouldn't recommend this as a fun survey course to take on the side of a heavy course load.",
                "I would not recommend this course. It was unclear what exactly we learned and what the expectations were. Many of the projects had little guidance, and it seemed as if a lot of knowledge that was evaluated was presumed, but never taught in the class.",
                "Yes, if you are prepared to study linguistics in great detail. This class is more than theory; you will be expected to understand phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics, grammar, and linguistic theory well enough to apply them. In doing this, you will learn a lot. I loved it, especially in conjunction to second-language learning at Yale.",
                "Yes and no. This course occupies a strange niche in that for a linguistics major, a lot of the material is fairly introductory for the first half or even 2/3 of the semester. Its more a linguistics class than a psych class for the most part, and the workload if you dont have any linguistics background can be kind of a lot. I would recommend it if youre a non-linguistics major who wants a rigorous, thematically coherent introduction to linguistics. The course expectations were generally pretty clear; the finals and midterms even had repeat questions, and the final paper rubric was very extensive. If youre a linguistics major, the last third of the class on language acquisition will be new material for sure, but it felt somewhat introductory for a course at the 200s level."
