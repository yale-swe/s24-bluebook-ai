We reviewed all the tenses and learned some specific grammar structures I did not learn in high school. I learned about various themes from a Spanish perspective, such as analyzing art, film, and societal issues. We investigated ideas such as Black invisibility, indigenous worldview, and Latinx identity."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course were its content. All of the readings, topics, and mediums were engaging and interesting. They were highly diverse and encouraged students to think deeply and critically about their preconceptions and societal pressures. It dived into my unknown areas and spurred my desire to learn more. My favorite part of the course was the opportunity to speak with a student from Peru with whom I will be continuing our conversations after this course has ended. The weaknesses of this course were the often very vague instructions on assignments and projects, a lack of grading throughout the course, relatively slow response time, and the extreme time commitment expected. Assignments almost never came with a rubric and were instead left open to students, which would have been alright except that there was little feedback throughout the semester. Having most assignments marked as complete\/incomplete left me feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with my work in the class. There was also a conveyed unreasonable expectation that this class is prioritized over all other coursework. Projects were assigned suddenly without notice and expected to be completed before class the next day. For example, a three-minute four-person group presentation about a specific art piece was given during class on a Monday and expected to be completed by Tuesday morning. Other students and I found this very frustrating since we had work and exams for other classes and struggled to shift our schedules to work on these assignments. Also, I found the regular group projects to be more stressful than exciting. Groups were assigned by the professor, which restricted the opportunity to work with students with whom I shared a similar work style. To improve these areas, I suggest that all coursework have a 1-2 week turn-around for grading if possible with specific feedback given that targets improving individual student performance. With regard to the vague instructions, I believe providing a rubric or example responses tends to make it easier for students to complete assignments and reduces stress. Try to avoid general phrases like answer the question or write a report since these have many forms. With regard to the workload, I would suggest significantly reducing the number of assignments given in the class. This would ease the burden on both the students and the professor. It is generally hard to comprehend readings longer than five pages in Spanish at our level. Try to give students a one-week notice for projects and essays. A syllabus was given at the beginning of the course, but students were expected to continually check back into the syllabus to know when projects and essays were coming up, which I believe is unnecessary. The syllabus should be a helpful guide but not the primary schedule for students to follow. This can be solved with a regularly updated schedule in Canvas. Additionally, I struggled with the written exams since they seemed to deviate from the course content and lacked space for student creativity. One final weakness of the course was that it often seemed as though students were not excited by the idea of speaking Spanish in class, which led me to struggle in connecting with them. I am unsure as to why that was; however, it definitely hindered my personal experience as I felt that my peers did not share my enthusiasm for the course."

                "I would recommend this course to another student only if they would much rather do one semester of Spanish than three semesters of another language at Yale. If the improvements in instructions and grade transparency are made, I believe that the wonderful discussion, fascinating readings, and opportunity to converse with a student from Peru make this course a fantastic continuation for an advanced Spanish speaker. Overall, I am grateful for my improvement in Spanish and may take another class later on in my time at Yale."
