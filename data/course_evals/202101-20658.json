                "Yes! Regardless of major. This class was super engaging and even though it was online, it was super conducive to the formulation of friendships and getting to know others in your class which is great for your first year. I was remote and I was able to do that so I imagine an in person experience will be even better. This class is an interesting survey of various critical theories such as capitalism, feminism, imperialism, homonationalism, etc applied to the context of travel but can be applied elsewhere. I will say though that this was a lot more work than I expected though and I averaged 10 hours a week spent on this course with more being spent when writing papers. I feel like my writing has improved in the clarity of my argumentative writing but drafting was often a time consuming process. TZB is also a fantastic resource in making everyone engaged, supporting everyone, creating an inclusive classroom environment, and being a great resource for one on one meetings.",
                "Yes! I would 100% recommend this course. It was one of the best decisions of my semester. I had so much fun in the class, and found the material very stimulating and interesting. Professor TZB is wonderful and this first-year seminar is as well.",
                "101%, out of the 8 classes I've taken so far this is by far my favorite. The topic is surprisingly applicable to most of life, it's interesting (the first week of content might be rough but its foundational) & TZB is an amazing professor.",
                "Yes yes yes!!! It truly challenges your perception of why we desire experiences such as study abroad, etc.",
                "Yes! Please take this class, if you have absolutely any interest in the rest of the world, at all, or if you've ever heard about it, again at all. It provides such a great perspective on the world, one which would be so easy to miss if you don't have access to these readings or this professor to show you. I think also as the world globalizes and as you have opportunities to engage with people of different cultures and perspectives, it is also incredibly important to be mindful of what that means and how to do so. Finally, I do think there are elements of this class that have the potential to make you a better person, if you're willing to think about what that means and work towards it.",
                "Yes! This course was absolutely wonderful. Professor TZB truly cared about helping her students improve their writing and close reading skills. The readings were always pertinent and interesting. It completely changed the way I understand race, sexuality, gender, and other aspects of identity that inform the way individuals move throughout the world. If you are at all interested in travel and other forms of colonial knowledge production, this is the course for you! Even if you are simply interested in travel, this course will also transform the way you view the world and how you travel in the future.",
                "Yes if you are good with doing readings and want to be exposed to a good learning environment where you can really think about culture and contemporary power dynamics in the world.",
                "Please take this class or any with TZB.  TZB is such a wonderful professor and although I was very  interested in the material we were learning, I can excited every day because of TZB's energy and teaching chops."
