    "In Early Modern Devotional Poetry, I learned how to read strange poetry. I learned how to sit with a weird poem and comment on its weirdness with others, and to wonder what the project of talking to God might be all about. I also learned how to compare and contrast authors within a similar poetic movement, which I hadnt done before this course.",
    "I learnt a great deal about Early Modern Devotional Poetry, a short-lived intellectual tradition in the English Renaissance.",
    "Developed reading and writing skills, especially critical reading of older texts",
    "How to read and respond to difficult poetry. How to derive meaning from the text of early modern poetry. Also, a historical picture of what poets cared about during the period and what people thought of their poetry.",
    "Kept practicing analyzing poetry, I guess. We spent enough time on each devotional poet to get a taste of his (or, her, if you count the ONE female author we read in depth) individual style.",
    "I learned how to think and write critically (and sometimes, uncritically) about devotional poetry. I also learned how to think about themes such as affliction and power beyond literature.",
    "This course tracked major trends in 17th Century poetry from Donne to Traherne. The class also drew parallels between early modern poets and contemporary writers like Anne Carson, Louise Glck, and Aaron Kunin. The course improved my skills as a reader of poetry and broadened my appreciation for early modern literature."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think one strength of this course was John Rogers, who began each class with a helpful introduction to whichever topic we would be discussing that day. I also appreciated the syllabus: we took relatively deep dives we took into just a handful of poets, along with the contemporary poets that really did enhance my understanding of devotional poetry. One weakness of this course was a bit of asymmetry in airtime for each of my classmates; I felt that some students talked for far longer than would have been ideal for a seminar setting.",
    "The discussions in this course were very high-level but also very enjoyable in that respect. I really enjoyed how discussion-focused the entirety of the class was, and also how Professor Rogers guided the discussion in a way that was enriching but also not overly intrusive.",
    "Professor Rogers is a great instructor and knows how to get his students to understand the material at a substantive level. Writing one more paper might have been helpful.",
    "Discussions weren't conducted well by Professor Rogers. He's a lecturer. Every time someone said something, it was often Professor Rogers who would respond; the student who originally spoke would respond to the professor's question or clarify their own initial comment. After that, the next student would raise their hand and get called on etc. Because the discussion was constantly filtered through Professor Rogers's responses, it felt choked and disconnected.",
    "I wish we could have read another female poet! But our discussions were so interesting.",
    "Prof. Rogers is the greatest poetry professor I have ever had and is the coursess greatest strength beside the fact that we read Herbert and Glck and Carson. Some students may have found some of the material dry but I dont think that makes the dry poets any less important to read. Personally, I feel it is important to also learn about the not-as-famous poets, so we can think critically about the difference between, say, Crashaw and Herbert.",
    "This is an intriguing course. It served as a great opportunity to explore a niche region of the English literary tradition. I was encountering most of the poets  covered in the syllabus for the first time. The syllabus' focus on poetic influence between the early modern and modern periods of devotional lyric kept the material fresh and accessible. The class, overall, was very impressive. It is a solid course -- highly enjoyable and educational. The reading list was phenomenal and the professor was excellent."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend Early Modern Devotional Poetry to another student, especially someone whos interested in studying religion and literature in tandem. Unfortunately, this is the last time Professor Rogers will be teaching this course, but I think its a worthwhile subject and the readings are sure to bring confusion, surprise, and delight.",
    "Yes! The course provides a very rigorous exploration of a very specific area of Early Modern poetry, so it is a very good way to learn about the English Renaissance. Religious poetry is also just a very fascinating aspect of poetry that is definitely worth studying to enrich your understanding of the English canon.",
    "If you have any interest in poetry - wild, crazy, sexual, religious poetry - take the class!!!",
    "No. Only do it if you need the Renaissance requirement.",
    "Yes!! Professor Rogers is great but the reading, if you're not well versed in 17th century poetry, will be a bit difficult.",
    "YES. My life would not be the same without having taken this course. This is Prof. Rogers at his best. My one regret in life is that I will not be able to take this course again.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Rogers is an exceptional teacher and the reading list will expose you to new forms of literature you might not otherwise engage with at Yale College. It's a great English class that has something to offer for everyone."
