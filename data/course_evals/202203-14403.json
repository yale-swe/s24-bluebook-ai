                "I grew in confidence and ability in terms of reading both primary and secondary sources. Class discussions deepened my understanding, and I grew as a writer.",
                "In-depth knowledge of the complex, interwoven causes behind the American Revolution\r\nSkills developed in critical analysis of primary/secondary historical sources as well as historical analysis writing.",
                "Knowledge: Various economic and political drivers behind the American Revolution. Though, in high school, I was presented with a quite simplistic view of the Revolutionnamely, the Stamp Act and Proclamation Line upset the colonists, who subsequently rebelled against BritainProf. Hill revealed that the calculus was more complex. Centuries of political tradition, military reliance on British forces, and shifting domestic authority, all dictated whether Britain's colonies revolted or stayed loyal.  \r\n\r\nSkills: Secondary-source analysis and essay composition. My previous writing background was firmly grounded in Englishwriting analyses of prose or poetry, for instance. I suspect that this is true for most incoming Freshman, and this class eases the transition to history-based writing. Whereas my previous English instructors focused on both style and substance, Prof. Hill prioritized the latter, helping students construct concise arguments that deepened our engagement with the source material. As well, any humanities course at Yale will likely incorporate secondary scholarship. The assignments in HIST 014scholarship about England and America from the thirteenth to eighteenth centuriesfamiliarize students with secondary sources and the requirements for analyzing them.\r\n\r\nInsights: While this course offered a range of fascinating insights into the Revolution, I feel compelled to touch on the Caribbean. Prof. Hill is an expert on the area, which is often neglected in surface-level overviews of America in the eighteenth century (e.g. AP US History). Resolving why Jamaica or the Barbados eschewed the Revolution was especially interesting, and helped broaden students' knowledge of Britain's colonies across the Western Hemisphere.",
                "The course really does change your understanding of how the American Revolution came to pass, as well as some English history in the time period. Its also a good introduction to history courses because there was a good amount of feedback on the essays.",
                "I learned about many of the underlying causes of the American Revolution. We studied a lot of British history and early colonial political thought. It was very interesting but also a bit different than what I expected. We barely focused on the American Revolution itself and for many weeks we barely touched on American history. We talked about Britain and the West Indies. A lot of the secondary readings are by white men, unfortunately. But there aren't as many female scholars in this field.",
                "The course provided an in-depth examination of British colonial history and the many ways it connects with the revolution. It taught me the fundamental skills needed to be a historian and how to craft a research paper with a sound argument.",
                "I definitely learned how to read historical readings better and how to debate and talk about historical pieces.",
                "I developed a generous amount of knowledge concerning what caused the American Revolution. I learned much more about the trends in history in the colonies and in England. I also developed writing skills, as I wrote different essays, for which the instructor wrote feedback. I learned some of my mistakes and what I should watch out for when writing.",
                "- A well-rounded, interpretative look at the long and medium-term causes of the American revolution\r\n- Better writing and critical thinking skills: I struggled a bit with writing a longer paper but I learned from it\r\n- Many common folk interpretations of the American Revolution are inaccurate, and there are an abundant number of factors and trends one must look at to critically evaluate the roots of the American Revolution"

            "comments": [
                "I really enjoyed this course. All of the readings were very interesting, and I learned a lot. I would have liked slightly more small group discussion, as I sometimes felt drowned out in the larger group conversations. Some people were much more comfortable pontificating than I was.",
                "Strengths: gentle introduction to historical analysis writing, course was geared to thought-provoking discussion that encouraged the development of original ideas\r\nWeaknesses: took a while to get used to the level of reading required for the course. \r\nSometimes it was difficult to ascertain why we were reading what we were reading until in-class discussion, making it hard to determine what to focus on when reading initially.\r\nI felt like the papers were somewhat back-heavy. Maybe the due dates for paper 1 and paper 2, or at least paper 2, could be pushed up to space things out a bit more.",
                "Strengths: the instructor and the readings. Prof. Hill is kind, engaged with the assignments, and quick to resolve any questions. His knowledge of pre-modern historyencompassing British political tradition, parliamentary conflict between Whigs and Tories, slavery across the West Indies, and assemblies in the British coloniesis quite impressive. It was fascinating to hear his insights in class! Moreover, the readings were well-selected for each unit, building off of each other to create a cohesive overview of particular drivers behind the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none with the class itself. However, if readings were a bit lengthy, some of the seminar could be slightly underprepared for discussion. This will happen in any seminar-based class at college, and often didn't greatly detract from our class time together.",
                "The readings can be a bit of a slog but theyre worth it because they allow you to engage in the discussions. The discussion-lecture mix is was well handled by the instructor and allowed people to share their own ideas while also get the benefit of a historians perspective.",
                "Strengths- Professor Hill is very approachable, relatable, and funny. He definitely makes you feel welcomed and cares about your time. A few classes were canceled or cut short because he felt that he did not have enough content to justify taking up that much time and I truly appreciated that. I loved that we went to a restaurant on the last day. The professor really cared about us and it showed. Regarding the course material, I appreciated the different opinions from the readings about what caused or didn't cause the revolution. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- The readings. There were a few hits but many misses. I simply found them to be very boring. Especially frustrating were the primary documents which were incomprehensible and unhelpful. I did not learn much from them. Some of the secondary readings were nice, but most were repetitive and could have been cut down more (or perhaps we could have read fewer pages from more scholars). \r\nAnother weakness was the class discussions. I did not feel like the professor facilitated an environment for real discussion. It felt more like we were asked a bunch of questions and had to come up with the best answers to prove we are good students. Each time a student spoke the professor would say how much he agreed. Sometimes that was good but often it made me feel bad about my answer. Also, I wish there was more effort to contextualize each week and have a bit more of a content overview as he did toward the end of the class with the imperial crisis. Not all of us, unfortunately, have U.S. colonial history background knowledge and this course felt like that was very much expected. \r\nLastly, the assignment had such short prompts and they were simply really hard to write. I struggled with doing research and saying the wrong thing because the readings were too hard to completely understand. I wish the assignments were clearer and that there was more guidance. It would have been helpful- especially because this was taught as a first-year seminar.",
                "The course is fairly straightforward in terms of class structure: readings outside of class + discussion about readings within class. It was a very well-organized first-year seminar.",
                "I really enjoyed our in-class discussions about the readings.",
                "I think that the seminar format was very useful for this class and it was quite engaging, however some of the readings were quite dull.",
                "The reading list was great, and I felt that every journal article or book chapter contributed to my understanding of the roots of the American Revolution in some way. \r\nMost classes were discussion-based, but Professor Hill would jump in if there were any knowledge gaps."

                "I would recommend this course to another student. I feel as though it was a great introduction to history courses at Yale, which is exactly what a first year seminar should be.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone with a genuine interest in history, no matter the major, who doesn't mind writing historical analysis papers (for a writing credit). It helps to have experience with the history of the time period and with historical analysis writing, but neither is absolutely necessary in full for success.",
                "Yes! Prof. Hill is outstanding; the readings are insightful yet manageable; and students are prepared to explore further history courses at Yale. Though Prof. Hill directed conversations when necessary, he encouraged students to often participate in discussionsthis, in turn, helped students refine their ideas, challenge their convictions, and hone an ever-deepening knowledge of colonial U.S. History. If you clear the lottery for the course, be sure to keep your place; if not, attend the first few seminars to hopefully snag a seat.",
                "Absolutely. If youre interested in the topic I think this is a great course to take. You learn a lot without it being incredibly stressful and you have a great Professor to work with.",
                "I would recommend this course to anybody interested in colonial English history (mostly during the 1600s). The course does a great job of overviewing these deep-rooted causes of the revolution that originated in England and its colonies. However, I think you must have some existing knowledge of U.S. history (either an AP or honors course in high school or another history course at Yale from a similar time period). \r\nAnyone can do well in this course, but prepare to take a leap of faith in terms of writing assignments. You will struggle at first, but it will get better. Overall, take the course if you're very interested in the subject. If you're hesitant, take a different course- there are definitely better ones.",
                "I would highly recommend this course for any incoming first-year who wishes their APUSH class was more nuanced and gave themselves room to think critically about the historical sources being presented to them.",
                "Yes I would. Professor Hill is a great teacher and is always very helpful in providing feedback and answering questions. He also directs discussions very well.",
                "I would, but only if you are interested in the topic. There are quite a good deal of readings to complete (about 60 pages a week) and they can be quite dull, so if you are interested in historical readings and the American Revolution then definitely take it. To be honest, you can also get away with skipping some of the readings, especially near the end of the semester, but definitely do not get into that habit for all of them.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is a great introduction to college and Yale and the course will build confidence over time on workloads and writing essays.  I also think it is an amazing space to get to know your peers and have the chance to speak freely on different topics.",
                "Prospective history majors, yes. I feel like this is a good introduction to what a college-level history course would look like."
