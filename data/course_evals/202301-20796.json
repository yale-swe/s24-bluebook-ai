                "The instructor and TA are great, and the material is super interesting. Class was always a blast and basically involved learning a new security definition, coming up with a protocol that met the definition, proving its security, or breaking an unsound protocol. The HWs were also fun and helped us understand the material, but a few of them were incredibly time consuming and hard. More could be done to standardize the difficulty and length of the PSets.",
                "This was the best CS course I've taken. It completely transformed my notions of what computer security is and introduced me to a field in which I hope to continue to work. The small class became a wonderful community of learning with a nice mix of CS and math backgrounds, and I think this course really exceeded everyone's expectations. The course was definitely very oriented towards the mathematical foundations of cryptography, rather than the implementation, and was presented fairly rigorously compared to other CS courses I've taken. When Yale issued new network certificates at the end of the semester I was very excited to be able to understand what the various things were referring to. The problem sets varied a lot in difficulty but were generally doable and quite interesting, and the grading scheme was very honest: no curve, but not harsh.",
                "Strengths: relatively approachable without knowing much about cryptography\r\nWeaknesses: could be a bit more technical or mathematically rigorous; would have enjoyed more \"projects\" where we actually implement some of the ideas we learn about, rather than just treating them abstractly, but we already do a bit of this on some homeworks",
                "Excellent teaching. Assignments were pretty strong, but the difficulty was very inconsistent (started off extremely hard and then by the end of the semester was significantly easier). Midterm is pretty doomed, it felt like a 3 hour exam and we had 75 mins. Don't think anybody finished. Overall, take the class if it sounds interesting, Babis is a great professor!",
                "Strengths: the typed lecture notes were very good (and they said which sections in the book we could look in which was EXTREMELY helpful), Babis is a engaging lecturer, topics were interesting, no final exam\r\nWeaknesses: In the beginning homework took a lot of work but then towards the middle and end the homework did not take very much time at all. Office hours were a hit-or-miss on how helpful they were. It felt like you had to already know most of the answer to get any help. Grading was a little bit sketchy at times for the homework. Sometimes some students in the class went on long tangents (or should I say arguments with the professor) and I wish some of them would have been reeled in. The questions on the midterm were fair, BUT there was not enough time to complete the midterm.",
                "Babis is a fantastic lecturer and his course notes are great. The homeworks could vary widely in difficulty however and the first few homeworks were definitely more difficult.",
                "Babis is an excellent lecturer! He is adept at explaining challenging concepts and providing motivation for new ideas and definitions. The problem sets were interesting and added greatly to the course experience. As for weaknesses, I personally was not a big fan of the programming questions, but there are not too many and should be fairly doable for anyone with a solid programming background. I also thought that the lectures regressed somewhat as the semester progressed, but this was not a huge issue.",
                "It was very organized, but in the end i did not like the content of the lectures. Also, we had to do a lot of assignments. But the professor was very helpful.",
                "This course was fantastic, but there were not enough office hours. I was unable to attend any of the office hours offered due to weekly commitments and classes and because of that, I could not receive help on the problem sets often."

                "Yes! This course is really fun and interesting. I found myself really stimulated and often smiling during each class. Its an elegant application of math and discussion of algorithms.",

Be prepared to work hard especially in the first half but then you will see the rewards later in the second half of the course. It was a very engaging course and I had fun and learned a lot.",
                "This was hands down the best course of my semester and one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Babis is an amazing lecturer and he takes time to present and really work through definitions with his students. I learned how to break cryptography into basic definitions and the basics of how cryptography is applied throughout the internet.",
                "Absolutely! Cryptography is such a fascinating subject and this is a well-crafted introductory course to the field with an excellent professor. If you're a CS major who enjoys theory or math, this is definitely the class for you! I'd also recommend the course to non-majors who are looking for a math-heavy computer science elective.",
