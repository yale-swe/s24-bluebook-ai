During class and the readings that we were assigned, I was learning more about virtual reality in an interesting variety of fields, especially during my 3rd Paper where I was able to learn about virtual reality specified towards a specific topic.",

                "The strengths within this course would the amount of student engagement, there were many students participating during class discussions. Each reading was always something different than last time, so it was nice to constantly gain some knowledge about virtual reality. Also, there were meetings held for each person individually with the teacher that helped students within the class. Something that could be improved would be the inclusion of more visual examples of VR. There were a couple of videos throughout the semester. I feel like this would have been nice to include once in a while.",
                "Strengths: Especially given the online format, Prof Doyle was so sweet, kind, and understanding. She had expectations for us but always ensured that they were within reach. I also liked the topics that were covered - virtual reality and the concept of virtuality are fascinating, pertinent topics.\r\nWeaknesses: The progression of writing was inconsistent. I feel that I could have had been taught a better foundation of how to craft arguments earlier on. Instead of having only a few bigger essays, more small-scale assignments that focus more narrowly on crafting different aspects of an argument would've been more helpful.",
                "The course is very accessible. Everything that you need to know for the class is introduced in class, and I feel like this makes it easier to improve your writing during the semester.",
                "I thought that this was a very engaging English seminar that introduced me to the expectations of college-level papers. Each paper assignment was clear and provided freedom for the student to fully express their own thoughts and synthesize the information they learned from the sources. One thing that I would improve is that before diving into the first paper, it would be better to get a little more class time to learn about the standards of writing.",
                "I think that towards the end the readings were somewhat unecessary as when we read them we went over them in class once and then never saw them again. I enjoyed it more when we workshopped our papers in class rather than discussing long readings",
                "I found it a very helpful course. The readings were adequately varied and provide much useful information.",
                "Strength:\r\nThe material was very interesting and the pacing of essays and projects was good. Very good for learning some basic skills related to doing research in the first year.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nI did feel like it was more focused on teaching about the essay writing than about the content that relates to the title of the course (Virtual Humans), but I guess that's normal for a first year writing course."

Along with this, the changing of research groups for each paper was a good way to make friends in the class, which did prove to be difficult during this time of covid.",

Providing a more rigid structure to our essays earlier on could help us understand the fundamental elements necessary to our argument for later essays, which would have more freedom in terms of structure.\r\nThe online discussion format was also not engaging. The zoom was very quiet and not many people were willing to express their opinions.",

It is a class that goes step by step in the college writing process and helps set up well for the rest of college writing. Also, the readings are very interesting and the classes are pretty small, so you'll be learning new things about a topic and be able to interact with most people in the class.",

The workload is clearly laid out and very manageable if you allocate a bit of time regularly to keep up with the reading and writing. I enjoyed the topic of our course on virtual humans and the freedom of our 3rd and 4th papers.",
