    "I gained a greater understanding of the grammar of the language and learned how to comprehend and respond to French texts.",

   "comments": [
    "All of the content of this course was great, but it was a bit challenging to do over the internet. I think OWL was generally good for the tests, but there were some glitches.",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the texts we read and our class discussions!\r\nWeaknesses: I wish that we spent some time in class focusing on writing. I also think that essays should be due at the end of the week even if the tests are earlier, because having to write a composition on top of all our other weeknight homework was a LOT of work.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Koundi is amazing. You will learn a lot very quickly, and your french will improve 100x if you put in the work.\r\nWeaknesses: extremely fast-paced, keep up with the work or you will drown. This isn't something that can really be fixed, however.",
    "Strengths: Books and movies were a key role in developing an understanding of the language\r\nWeaknesses: Super fast-paced and work-heavy and can catch up to you really quickly"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes, you should definitely try to get your language requirement out of the way during the summer!",
    "It's very intense but you will learn a lot. This is the course that'll take your french from beginner to proficient.",
    "Yes! definitely. The course is a fun course to take especially with Madame Koundi. Although the course is fast-paced, the books and films are super enjoyable. They keep you engaged in discussion and in the class overall. Everyone struggles so you won't be alone. But there will be no growth without struggle, so you get the idea."
