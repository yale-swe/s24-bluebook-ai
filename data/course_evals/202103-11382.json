                "I learned how to read the intentions of filmmakers, interpret visual narratives in the form of photo albums, and how to understand and appreciate performance. I also was introduced to a wide variety of films that broadened my understanding of the medium, and allowed me to enter into the larger discussion of Black Cinema.",
                "I learnt a basic understanding of how to read and analyze films, especially in conjunction with texts studied as part of the weekly readings. I learnt a lot more about documentary and experimental filmmaking and how to think critically about films, especially in a wider social and political context. I learnt new ways of studying non traditional marks of history, such as photographic archives, and how those fit into the practice of filmmaking and Yale's historical archives.",
                "How to read films, and to play close attention to how the filmmaker constructs their narrative. i learned to deeply question the purpose and audience of films, and to explore their political agendas and effects. i developed skills in writing and engaging with film theory, ie how transitions, voice-overs, photographs, interviews, staged scenes, impromptu scenes, etc have an effect on the way a film represents race, class, gender, history, power dynamics, artistic elements, emotions, etc.",
                "I learned more about how artists integrate their own experiences with their family into their work  even when the stories arent solely their own to tell  and how I could use aspects of my family narratives in my own fictional work."

                "I think it was a great course! Possibly my favorite part was the discussion aspect. Both within the class, and also in the company of directors of films we watched, the discussions we had were extremely generative and I am grateful.",
                "This course's seminar format was a strength, it really allowed everyone to get the most out of it and contribute in a non-pressurized environment. It was a really great synthesis of topics. The readings were focused, relevant, and varied depending on the content of the film and were a great backdrop. There was lots of flexibility regarding our projects\/papers\/blogs and how we displayed them. Professor Harris and Josie were really supportive and knowledgeable. There were few weaknesses. It was at times inconvenient to hold the screenings at 4pm on a Sunday, and sometimes the discussion was not focused on the readings at all even though we had spent time going through them. There were also no indications of any sort of grade going throughout the course - I never got a number mark back for any work I did. In a way it emphasized the learning and the process, but would have been a reassuring marker of progress.",
                "I love that we all watched films together on Sunday nights!! this homework was the most engaging, educational, and fun compared to my homework from all other classes.",
                "A strength is that the discussions were very well conducted. One thing that couldve been improved is perhaps giving more of a background on film terms for students who were not film majors."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students trying to expand their definitions of normal, and attempting to redefine the rules of the narratives of their lives.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to any other student that is available to take it, and who finds it vaguely interesting! I think you definitely have to go into it committed to the class and be prepared to do some work with your own family history, which can be challenging at times. The seminar format is invaluable and the discussions are really thought-provoking. It's one of the best courses at Yale I have taken!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. i loved being able to watch and learn from Black artists, queer artists, women filmmakers, and more. it was a huge privilege to also have many of these filmmakers as guests in the class. so many incredible opportunities and so many special guests!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students. I really loved the selection of films we had."
