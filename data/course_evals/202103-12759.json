                "The seminar style was amazing; focusing the first half of the semester on theory and the second half on practical application was perfect for my learning style. I really encourage more instructors to try it out and see how it works for them\/their students.",
                "Professor Wexler is amazing  so kind and so knowledgeable (she is quite literally one of the leading scholars in this field); you really feel like she wants you to learn and succeed. The visits to the archives were absolutely amazing, and I also enjoyed the inclusion of guest speakers and current issues. The first half of the semester is very theory heavy, however, and it was quite a struggle to get through a lot of the readings, and at most times, it seemed like only the grad students understood what was going on. However, Professor Wexler does a great job of summarizing and highlighting key points of texts (especially when you remind her to do so, and she generally is super receptive to feedback), but the content can be very challenging and overwhelming at times."
