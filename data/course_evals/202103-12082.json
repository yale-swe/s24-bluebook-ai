                "Professor Partin was a fantastic professor. He was very encouraging while also pushing us. I also appreciated having access to the lab to edit and print my photos.",
                "The course is wide open in terms of your focus. This can be good or bad, but for me it was really refreshing. I did sometimes wish it had more structure to motivate me to shoot more often.",
                "Strengths: I really love the open-endedness of the course and how chill Ted was with our critiques, I had a lot of fun just messing around with photos and didn't often feel like I was doing work for the class because it was fun\r\nWeaknesses: You have to pay a $150 course fee + the cost of printing materials ($70 retail for the recommended pack) and secure your own dslr camera if you don't already have one; but I say it's completely worth it if you know you are going to be engaged with the class"

                "Yes! It is very different from other courses in the sense that your work is in the form of photographs, not assignments or exams. It helped me get out and about in New Haven, exploring new parts of the city, while also giving me a creative outlet. Would recommend!",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was so different from most other classes I've taken at Yale in a good way. I think every student should take a course like this before graduating.",
