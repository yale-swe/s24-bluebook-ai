    "Spanish!",
    "I developed a better understanding of the Spanish language, how to use it, and the Spanish culture across the globe",
    "The level of improvement I saw in my own Spanish-speaking abilities was amazing. I got so much better at it and I really understand the grammar better after this semester. I learned two major grammar structures--the imperfect and the subjunctive. Even though it was a lot of work, I really felt like I learned a lot about the language and some of its literature.",

    "Basic working knowledge of Spanish language",
    "I developed skills in Spanish speaking, reading, and understanding.",
    "Ability to think on my feet and develop a greater profiencey of the Spanish language aswell as a deeper understanding of the culture",
    "Learned how to read, write and speak Spanish.",
    "I significantly increased the amount of Spanish I knew. We learned a lot of vocabulary and more advanced verb tenses.",
    "How to speak, understand, read and write Spanish. Also elements of Spanish-speaking world's culture."

   "comments": [
    "This course, like Spanish L1, is very organized. The day-to-day syllabus is easy to follow and is very helpful. One thing I would say to improve the course is to put estimated times on some of the at-home assignments. There were some times when I would give myself one hour to complete something and it would end up taking three. Having an estimated time would help in preparing students to dedicate the right amount of time to some assignments.",
    "Everyday means you learn faster but all of the work is annoying.",
    "More day to day assignments with written feedback",
    "I felt that there was a large bit of gap between times of learning the past perfect and going into the future tense. I feel that I would have preferred to finish with the textbook, then move onto all the readings as a way to really practice all that was learned and put it all together.",
    "A well organised course. Maybe some additional worked examples for grammatical revision",
    "More listening practice should be incorporated.",
    "The textbook for this course was very good. My teacher was also amazing. This course would improve if the structure at the end was changed to incorporate fewer extra activities and more time for content review.",
    "I think this is an excellent course. I wish there was a list of outside resources (e.g. music, movies, books, etc.) that are on-level for the student provided."

    "Yes, I highly recommend this course! This course isn't just about grammar and memorizing vocabulary. You get to read really interesting articles and excerpts and learn about the history of Spanish-speaking countries. It was really engaging!",
    "Yes, if you want a language credit for Spanish.",
    "Yes I would as I learned a lot of the Spanish culture and language. I had a great time in my class and with my professor at office hours.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if you want to speak Spanish. I feel I have learned a lot",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. Well taught",
    "If you want to learn Spanish or need to fulfill the language requirement, take it. There are a lot of good professors in this department and if you take the class seriously it shouldn't be too difficult. You will need to spend a significant amount of time studying if you want an A, but it isn't unreasonable at all.",
    "Yes, they will learn a great deal of Spanish."
