I also got a basic understanding of important computational frameworks to interpret neuroscience with (e.g. Bayesian inference, high/low pass filtering).",
                "I learned a lot more about neuroscience as this was a fun elective I took in the MCDB world.",
                "I didnt really learn anything useful. Some of the material was interesting but the clear lack of instructor-student relationship was clear.",

                "As a non-neuroscience major, I actually learned a lot from this course! Review of neuroscience basics i.e. basic brain anatomy, action potential, parts of a neuron, etc. It was so neat to be able to understand how our sensory systems work at the microscopic level and I enjoyed this class (which had brief demos that students could participate in) overall.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This class was awesome!! The concepts were very clearly organized and explained, and I really loved going to class every day. The psets were relatively straightforward - with office hours to get help - and the exams were fair. I loved looking at all the illusions, and we did lots of cool demos in class. Overall, this course was amazing (as is Prof Clark) and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.",
                "Strengths are that the professors were nice and the material was interesting. The weaknesses were that the material was very confusing and taught too fast without any review. They tried to cram in too much material resulting in never really understanding much. I found myself disadvantaged from only having taken the intro bio sequence and missing a lot due to lack of bio foundations and jargon.",
                "Slides and lecture moved at a fairly quick pace -- didn't fully digest information until I sat with it for a while outside class. Often had to do independent research in order to understand a concept.",
                "Strengths: I love how each lecture is connected to explaining some type of illusion. It made the course very engaging, and some of the illusions were really fun (we got to try miracle berries/miraculin that made lemons taste like lemonade!). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the olfaction lectures were really difficult to understand. I also did not really feel like the class presentations were that useful, especially since some groups got very difficult-to-understand papers while others got really easy papers to present on. I didn't really engage with the student presentations when I was watching them either, and I know a lot of people just skipped class on those days. I know that the format was changed slightly because the class was a lot larger this year, but I think it would have been more helpful to form small discussion sections and go over figures together rather than present on the papers to the whole class.",
                "Great class, wish the lectures were recorded",
                "Professor Clarks lectures were not engaging and he didnt really seem to care about the students in his class. He changed the timing of the 2nd midterm from December 7th (last day of classes) to December 20th (last day of finals) halfway through the semester. He did this because he said we needed to learn through the last day of the semester, but we ended up reviewing everything during the last period and not learning anything new. Many international students had to change their flights, cancel their trips, or make other alterations to their plans. When a course says no final exam it should remain as such.",
                "The class was reasonably paced, the psets were usually not too difficult, and the exams were fair. The professors were some of the better lecturers I've seen in STEM and presented the content in a way that usually wasn't too complicated. Overall, a nice class with no major complaints.",
                "Strengths: homeworks every other week that were helpful for studying for the exam but also not too long. Weaknesses: the teaching; both professors went through a lot of material every class (especially O'Donnell) and it was difficult to follow along at times. Exams were a time crunch and some questions were very specific and not discussed much during lecture",
                "The slideshows need to be uploaded without animations so there are not several pages in the pdf for a single slide. Attendance for paper presentation days needs to be more strictly enforced. I found that a lot of the exam questions were vague and could be answered in many different ways, leading to confusion.",
                "The professors did an incredible job of providing strong structure to the course and creating interactive lectures that maximized student learning.",
                "I think we didn't really know what our grade was as we never got paper presentations back and also didn't know what the new denominator for the first midterm was, so a little more transparency about grading would be appreciated. Otherwise the slides were really clear and the homework was relatively straightforward except some questions would be worded in a confusing manner sometimes. I loved starting on the homework early, but sometimes the TAs would not be able to help in advance on particularly hard questions the week before it was due, and I felt like having more discussion sections earlier in the week rather than only at the end when the homework was due could be more helpful if I had busier Thursdays and Fridays.",
                "I wish this class was recorded to help with review since we cover so much content in one period. Additionally, itd be helpful to use ED discussion or something similar in this class so we can all learn from each other's questions and answers.\r\n\r\nThis class was very engaging. And I like the content that we covered!",
                "I wished the instructors would eliminate the fancy (and frankly, unnecessary) PowerPoint transitions in their slides, because it meant that when the students downloaded the slides to take notes, there would be 100 - 200 slides that were only slightly different from one another and would sometimes crash digital note-taking platforms. This made following the lecture frustratingly difficult as there would be near-duplicates of the slides. Please resolve this or at least have one of TFs trim down the slides. This was a complaint that many of my peers shared and resolving the issue would have made it easier to follow the material.",
                "strengths: great lectures, super interesting content, good TAs, the PSETs are helpful, do a paper presentation (its one of the assignments)\r\n\r\nweaknesses: i had no idea what my grade was going to be. it turned out fine but definitely stressed me out to the point of almost C/Ding!",
                "Strengths are Dr. Clark/Dr. O'Donnell's passion for the class topics and the illusion demos at the beginning of class, which informed our understanding of the sensory systems being taught. I particularly enjoyed the miraculin berry demo.",

I really felt like he just wanted us to learn and fall in love with the topics, as opposed to trying to trick us. I felt super supported in this class, and looked forward to going every day. Please take this!",
                "Probably not, unless they had an extensive background with MCDB or NSCI before the course. It was just too hard and not enjoyable because I was confused most of the time.",
                "Yes. It was a really interesting way to engage with the field and they started off every class with an illusion which was really fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend it! This has probably been one of the best science courses I've taken at Yale since the material is interesting, the teaching is pretty good, and it doesn't have too high of a workload. There are only 6 PSETs, which help you stay on top of the material so you don't have to do as much review for the midterm/final.",
                "Yes, one of my favorite classes I took. Really interesting concepts that explain everyday life.",
                "No I would not. Dont take this class unless it is a requirement for your major.  There is a severe lack of communication from the professors and the TAs gave consistently conflicting information about both the course material and the format of the course.",
                "I would recommend this class. The workload is not too intense (A pset every 2 weeks and 2 exams) and exams felt pretty fair. Since most concepts were relatively easy to understand and you repeat numerous concepts from Human Brain, the class did not feel feel difficult. This class also gives you a nice basic understanding of all the sensory systems if you're a pre-med or plan on taking the MCAT.",
                "No. Especially if you are MCDB instead of NSCI major. Some of the people in class had never taken a NSCI class before and really struggled.",
                "Yes! I learned so much about our sensory experience, which we often take for granted.",
                "Yes, great course to learn about sensory systems in an interactive, structured environment!",
                "Yes I thought it was super interesting and the demonstrations of the illusions were very interesting.",
                "YES please take. I didnt take the human brain class beforehand and I was fine so don't worry about that. This is one of those classes where if you want to learn then you will. Its super fun material and I got a strange sense of satisfaction after mastering it by the end",
                "Absolutely - it is a fantastic class and I feel like I learned a lot from it. I very much enjoyed the intellectual challenge of it--but it definitely requires a lot of time to digest and you will need to understand how all of the sensory systems work in detail.",
