   "comments": [
    "i'd say the most knowledge I gained in this course regarded the trajectory of music theory as a discipline. There was much focus on discourses adapted in the field since the mid-1990s (e.g. focus on mathematical and especially geometric modeling), which was a useful counterpoint (ha) to the more basic things we're taught in Music 211, etc. Otherwise, I feel like my abstract pattern-recognition has significantly improved, especially pertaining to music, though I'm not sure I've developed much concrete knowledge other than on principles of tuning theory (this isn't necessarily bad - some humanities fields, I've found, are heavily reliant on analytical skills that can only be developed indirectly and with experience, and that seems to be a focus here).",
    "My understanding of the intersection between music theory and set\/graph theory definitely improved, and I think as a byproduct my theoretical music analysis skills also improved.",
    "I developed substantial knowledge of musical set theory, and spacial reasoning skills regarding the geometry of music.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of cyclic set theory as applied to both rhythm and harmony, as well as an introduction to different ways of modeling harmony and voice leading on graphs.",
    "An understanding of the many ways in which math and music interact. Cyclic universes 1-12, with their rhythmic and pitch-class ramifications and some set theory thrown in. 2D and 3D representations of harmonic space, a fascinating introduction to tuning theory, and an in depth analysis of various scales and their relationships and qualities. In addition to the content of the course, my analytical writing and use of supplementary figures improved.",
    "How to represent music graphically, and use mathematical models and concepts to analyze rhythm and harmony.",
    "This class really expanded my spatial sense and also how interdisciplinary music theory can really be."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Each unit was fascinating on its own, but we often stopped short of more general application of what we'd learned to broader bodies of musical works (perhaps bc of the sheer amount of content) and rarely had time to stop and carefully examine all consequences of the models\/theories we were considering. There was also sometimes the impression that not much held the disparate units together (they seemed mostly self-sufficient). I would appreciate a larger perspective on certain issues and a narrower focus on others, depending on the material in question.",
    "I have no complaints. I found the course very difficult, but not because of any logistics issues; my classmates and I had fun collaborating on psets and workshopping them in class. Professor Cohn did a great job of explaining difficult concepts throughout, and I always found the reading and class notes engaging. However, the final was really, really hard! I definitely think the final could have been more calibrated to where we were as a class.",
    "This course is well organized, and passionately taught. The material is fascinating, if quite abstract at times. I think some of the more geometrical subject matter would benefit from greater levels of mathematical precision, although I understand if that's outside the scope of the course.",
    "I loved this course--I thought the material was always engaging, and remained challenged throughout. Professor Cohn does an excellent job of balancing challenge while making his students still feel comfortable with the material. I now genuinely feel as if I can have a conversation about the course material, and look forward to applying the material in my musical career.",
    "I think this course is well organized and excellent overall (see #4). My only quibble is the emphasis on exams relative to other music theory classes. Perhaps this is simply something that I had to get used to, but I would have preferred at least the option to write a final paper instead of take an exam. The analytical papers spread throughout the class were the perfect way to engage with the material, while the exams were more stressful and inevitably more based on memorization. Prof. Cohn's class on 19th century music theory, which I took last fall, had several small papers throughout the course and culminated with a final paper on a topic of the student's choice, subject to approval of the professor. This class presents a wealth of topics that could work for a longer paper, or perhaps we could've chosen to expand one of our shorter papers into a more in-depth analysis. I recognize that exams are typical (and maybe even required for a QR credit), but one only needs to go through the course materials and our assignments to see that we were very much engaged with quantitative reasoning.",
    "The material was very interesting. This is a great for anyone trying to look how to analyze music in a unique perspective. The course is well-paced for people who don't have extensive experience with math but have a solid background in music theory. The problem sets weren't overbearing, and they were helpful to understanding the math material on the analysis assignments and midterm\/final. Perhaps it would be helpful to do more musical analysis in class, since a large portion of the grade is based on musical analysis."

    "Fascinating material and entirely novel (to most) perspective on music theory. Well worth the time spent and the QR credit. That being said, lots of work - 5 papers planned ALONG with midterm, final and psets every other week - but it was never overwhelming unless I didn't plan effectively. Cohn is an extremely enthusiastic instructor and I often had the sense that he was learning along with us (not in a bad way - it was just clear that he was completely engaged in the material and that the subject matter was quite recent to the larger field). Don't expect to do well unless you're very comfortable with more abstract analyses or feel like you could gain this capacity quickly while taking the course. Otherwise, go for it!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in the connection between music and math. That intersection is real, not fabricated, although I'm not sure if there are any practical applications to knowing whether one or another kind of set is isomorphic to a hypertoroidal Tonnetz graph. In my opinion the material is challenging unless you have a strong music theory background, an ability to visualize weird-looking objects in your head (hypercube, anyone?), and a relatively good grasp on certain mathematical processes like modular arithmetic. However, I had none of those things and still enjoyed the class. I may not have secured a good grade, but I learned more about music than I would have ever dreamed, which was more the point.",
    "Yes! I'd recommend this course to any music student who wants to learn new ways of thinking about and analyzing music.",
    "Yes, I would, but only if the student has a strong interest in the subject and is willing to put in the work.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in music theory, take this course and do not be scared off by the math-related label. This is a fantastic way for music majors to get an advanced theory class and a QR in one go. Prof. Cohn is a great teacher, the content is interesting, and the work is fairly well spread throughout the course (that last one is more personal preference).",
    "Yes, definitely. If you're interested in going at looking at music theory and analysis in a unique way, this course is perfect. It can seem kind of esoteric at times, but overall  the course really expanded my conception of how math can be used to represent music.",
    "Yes. It was certainly challenging in great ways!"
