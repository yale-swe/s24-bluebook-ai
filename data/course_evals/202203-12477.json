                "Professor Wallace is an excellent professor. He is incredibly kind, funny, knowledgeable. I learned so much as an actor and a director through his teaching. There were times when assignments and their due dates were a bit unclear. But on the whole, an excellent class.",
                "The best acting class I've ever had.  The course was organized and taught with so much thoughtful planning and practical techniques from the professor's life-long experience.",
                "My favorite thing about this course is that, in contrast to most advanced acting courses I've taken at Yale, it is not just a masterclass format, but involves full group work. I think this both allowed me to learn more things and fostered a better sense of community with the full group. We obviously were constantly running behind schedule, but I don't know that it would have been worth it to cut things short and push ahead, with possible exception of the presentations. I do think the directions for singing the other could have been a little clearer. (I didn't realize that we would be a cappella, and if I had I might have gone about things slightly differently.) Overall, though, this course is fantastic.",
                "This course is a strong studio class. The teacher and environment makes you want to work harder and get out the ego of acting to truly love in the moment and deliver to an audience. I think the scheduling could be improved a little; because of the attention we bring to each scene, we werent able to finish sometimes, so some scenes & groups got more attention than others."

                "YES.  Highly recommend.  Whether you pursue a career in acting or not, this course can help you explore how to express feelings and connect with the audience on any stage with nothing but yourself.  The course helps explore how to use your own body, voice, and thoughts as instruments to achieve the objectives needed.",
                "Absolutely. This was hands-down the best acting course I have taken at Yale. I learned a lot, but I also enjoyed the community and environment that was created from day one, and that is where this course stands out.",
                "Absolutely. This is a great advanced acting course. Take it if you have time, though. It is tough to schedule outside rehearsals."
