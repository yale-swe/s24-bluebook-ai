We spent almost no time reviewing grammar, and although a lot of class time was dedicated to speaking in Spanish, there was almost never any feedback when I mis-conjugated a verb or used the wrong word, so I couldn't really learn from these exercises."

                "Meeting every day (except for asynchronous Wednesdays) and having a large amount of writing homework definitely helped me improve my Spanish communication abilities! Also, in-class discussions, which focused on a large variety of topics, GREATLY improved my conversational skills. However, the supersite homework, which was our sole manner of learning the grammatical concepts tested on exams, wasn't very helpful (harsh grading), and sometimes, many of the homework assignments were insanely time-consuming and felt like busywork. Additionally, sometimes I wished that group project members were assigned randomly so that I could work with\/talk to different students, rather than merely those who sat next to me! This class was difficult, but very rewarding in the end.",
                "The asynchronous day is essential - having each Wednesday to catch up and review made a world of difference to me. I didn't feel that I gained anything significant from many of the classroom activities - it is difficult to hold a large group or small group conversations about relatively abstract topics because I often didn't know the words I needed to describe something like \"urban sprawl.\" For me, the biggest challenge I faced while studying Spanish was correctly conjugating the verbs, and we spent almost no time practicing this in class - in some ways, I felt my ability to conjugate verbs regressed from L2."

                "Yes, if you're cognizant of the fact that the workload is quite high and time-consuming! Additionally, if you're coming straight from high school Spanish and haven't had much experience speaking in Spanish in the past, you'll have to quickly adapt to the \"seminar style\" of Yale spanish classes. Overall, though, L3 spanish was very rewarding and I'd recommend it for students willing to put in the work!",
                "I think there are a lot of compelling reasons to study Spanish, so I'm glad I studied Spanish at Yale, but in my opinion the structure of this class is more often an impediment to learning Spanish than a guide."
