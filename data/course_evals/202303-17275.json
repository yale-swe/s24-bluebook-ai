Very often, we would deviate from the traditional introductory curriculum (while still learning everything from that curriculum) to talk about higher-level topics (such as the Stackelberg Duopoly) that are simply not covered in Econ 115.",

                "Strengths: Tolga is really good at explaining concepts using relatable metaphors and analogies\r\nWeaknesses: I wasnt a huge fan of the seminar format but thats my bad for not taking 115",
                "Definitely take this class if you want a unique experience at yale while learning economics. Tolga has been the highlight of my semester. The curve is worse compared to the lecture, but the interaction in a smaller class allows you to make up for the hard grading if you are passionate about the material.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is Tolga. In fact, if Tolga were not teaching this course, I think taking the lecture makes much more sense. Tolga is an excellent instructor, providing clear explanations and numerous funny examples that help you remember topics better. Because the course is essentially taught in the same way as a High School Math Class (I.e. a small lecture), youre able to ask questions directly to the professor, which is very useful, and the professor grades your midterm and final exams. I also think you simply get a better understanding of microeconomics by taking this class. Another strength is the reduced workloadthis class is not easy by any means, but (only with Tolga) the four Psets and one midterm, as opposed to the lecture, did away with a lot of tedium, which I appreciated. Tolga also provided us with significant resources if we needed help, including tutor hours (which I believe he funded himself), office hours (with him), lecture videos, notes, practice problem sets, and more. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness is that the curve is a little worse than the lecture, but dont let that dissuade you! Itd be great if the curve for 110 didnt need to be so strict, but thats a departmental decision. Either way, you will almost never be curved down.",
                "This course is fantastic because of the small seminar size and the professor. Being in a small class made it possible to talk to the professor and other students really easily. This made it easy to form study groups. Professor Koker was amazing because he was super approachable and always willing to help and offer solutions to any problem that arose. He also had office hours that were very helpful for exams, p-sets, etc. The only weakness of this class is the speed at which it needed to be taught. Certain critical pieces of information only received a few seconds of time in lecture."

                "No, I would recommend 115",
                "Definitely, it really comes down to if you are passionate about learning or keeping your GPA high. I would take this class over Econ 115, simply because the class format is so much more engaging and allows for better learning.",
                "With Tolga, YES! He rocks, simple as that. I actually looked forward to his class every day, as it was always a blast to hear his stories while learning about engaging topics in microeconomics. This class is fun and more informative, so essentially the best of both worlds. Besides the four psets and one midterm, there really isnt any other work, so the course is not especially burdensome either (though it is not a fifth course). Dont be dissuaded by the curve or the first classthis is a course that is definitely worth taking, but Id say only with Tolga. The other instructor seems good, but she essentially transplanted the lecture, with all of its topics, and thus didn't teach the same extra material. Of course, the lecture-seminar format can be nice, but Tolga really made this course what it is.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in taking intro econ (or just need to take it) and have the opportunity to have Professor Koker, please take it. Professor Koker is amazing and being in his class is an experience I will never forget here at Yale."
