This built upon past ASL I and II's coverage of literary devices commonly used in Deaf storytelling, like parallel structures, making signing space, role-shifting, and similes. Near the end of the semester, we also learned about the histories of Deaf theater and cinema."

                "I would highly recommend L3 with Professor Conlin. She's an incredibly kind, understanding and engaging teacher with amazing amounts of knowledge. She makes an effort to connect with each of her students. I was genuinely excited to learn from her every day! If you've taken L1 and L2, the workload and expectations are similar (maybe slightly higher in L3). It was also the semester that I feel I learned the most!"
