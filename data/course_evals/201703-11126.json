    "Strength: the intensity of class: since I have class every morning and exams every weak, I was never allowed to be separated from French. Thanks to this, I could improve my skills in French at an unbelievable speed.",
    "The class went a little fast, but that's expected given language classes at Yale. Having profs speak only in French is great with the whole immersion thing."

    "Yes. The class is intensive and usually demanding (class\/homework everyday and exam\/composition every week), but it surely deserve your efforts.",
    "It's French!",
    "Yes. The course allows students to learn a lot in a short period. It is well structured, and the instructors are more than happy to help the students with whatever they need in order to improve."
