                "This course was a great experience and I am glad I have taken it. Although I already knew\/heard of most, if not all, the topics discussed in this class, I had many missing perceptions, links, or knowledge gaps that this course has offered. I now have a better perception of abstract ideas in science and a better grasp of the different topics pertaining to forces. I would now speak more confidently about forces to a colleague or even in my research.\r\n\r\nAlso, the \"talk\" element of the course was a nice addition. Giving a technical presentation in a field that the audience is not fully familiar with is a challenging task. I had the opportunity to tackle this challenge through the end-of-semester talk, and the feedback on this was constructive.",
                "I learned about how intermolecular forces are derived and how this relates to their relative strengths.",
                "How forces at small scale can govern many interactions in the world.",
                "I learned a variety of aspects of forces on a smaller scale. This includes what drives the fundamental forces of nature, chemical bonds, and dipole interactions. Also gained insight into membranes and at the end of the course, got to see the real-life applications of the material we studied. Lastly, gained valuable insight in how to give a talk or presentation at the end of the semester."

                "I wish we had more time in lecture to cover the topics. We covered so many different topics I got lost.",
                "Homework could be better tied to lecture material. Moreover, the timing of the office hours and the homework due date was very poor, especially considering that the professor said that the office hours were necessary to complete the homework.",

                "Could have covered a little bit more of surface",
                "One of the strengths of this course is that it started with a very abstract basis and tried to build the momentum for more involved ideas later on. This gave a good grasp of concepts and where did they originate from, even though this was neatly done without the involvement of heavy math, which many students would appreciate.\r\n\r\nAlso, the history flavor that is weaved within the lectures and notes beautifies the delivery of the course. It is not always about the ideas in science, but also the scientists that were behind these discoveries, and the professor does a great job at this.",
                "I don't think homework should require an extra TA session to be explained, of course the TA sessions were helpful but the homeworks were just too far from the lecture content.",
                "It was really engaging and enjoyable! I think that talking about the applications and connections to the real world are fun.",
                "Strengths of this course include the handouts which are very helpful and the fact that everything is compiled into a neat document makes it easier to understand and review. The course is very nicely structured and most material is presented on the board which keeps me engaged. Another strength is the amount of math presented and the approach to the material. Even though we were working with some math, it never got overwhelming and was kept simple so the emphasis could be placed on the concepts with only the required math being presented to understand them. Another strength of this course is the manageable workload."

This is close to what my ideal engineering elective would be like where the focus is largely on the content and its applications instead of a lot of derivations. It helps someone who may not have as much experience or in depth knowledge in some of these areas understand them and the content can be applied to many different things in the real-world, for example, how microwaves heat food but not the plate."
