I wish I would have had the time to go to more of his office hours, because I always came away feeling a bit better about things academically and a bit more confident in myself.",

                "I learned the vocabulary to speak about art and learned how to compare art and literature from the same time period. I developed a lot of insight into pre-Civil War America, which I had never studied before.",

I wish there could have been a bit more feedback as sometimes I didn't really know what I was doing, and I'm not sure exactly how I did, but Professor Wolf is great.",
                "I wish the assignments had a bit more structure and clarity. While I am very grateful for the amount of creativity they allowed for, I just wish that I had had a clearer sense of what was expected, especially for the second assignment.",
                "The course was incredibly interesting and Professor Wolf was very knowledgeable. He always offered lots of context for each of the pieces we viewed and had so much to say about each of the texts we read.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wolf (kind, knowledgeable, and understanding -- also interested in his students' interests), interesting material, engaging class, very manageable workload \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes too much material to tackle in a class period",
                "This course featured a great breadth of materials that provided a welcoming yet expansive foray into art history studies for a beginner student. The flexibility of the assignments made engaging with the materials that much more exciting and that much less daunting for a first-time art history student.",
                "This course has really good discussion and the material we work with is very interesting. The assignments are really creative and you can tailor them to your interests. The only thing I might change is giving slightly more detailed instructions for the assignments, but Professor Wolf is very supportive of different approaches.",
                "Course was phenomenal. Professor Wolf is wonderful, kind, and brilliant.",
                "This course is a great survey of the most important pieces of art and literature in pre-Civil War America. I also loved that Prof. Wolf used modern art as a comparison, speaking to the influence of those early artists on our modern art landscape. We were often behind on the syllabus, which I loved because we got so caught up in class discussions, but I guess the only weakness of this course is a little bit of unpredictability from being less organized.",
                "I wish we had had clearer instructions as to what to read before each class. I would have enjoyed all the links to readings on the syllabus, and for there to be more variety in readings but perhaps less length. Every day in class itself was absolutely wonderful, though. It would have just been great for everyone to feel a little more cohesive on readings / the themes of each week going into class day.",
                "You get to learn a lot about a lot of different moments in American art history, and then you have tremendous freedom to explore whatever topics you'd like. It is a structured class, but it has the most flexibility of most any class I've taken. I really, really enjoyed it. Professor Wolf is the greatest strength of the course.",
                "All strengths, it was a great class. The only thing was that I think there was not very much classroom participation because the questions could sometimes feel like he was looking for a specific answer, and because the class started on Zoom, there wasn't participation from the beginning so it became awkward later in the class to start participating."

                "Yes. While there aren't many assignments for this course, the lectures and weekly readings are incredibly interesting. I found myself engaged with all of the course material and genuinely wanted to participate in class.",
                "Yes! A great class with a great American studies scholar. Professor Wolf runs an engaging class with plenty of interesting material. It's also great to just go to office hours and speak with him. I definitely gained deeper knowledge and appreciation for American visual art and its relationship with historical and present culture and history.",
                "Yes--interesting look at many different areas of early American media. The assignments are fun and a good chance to creatively apply the concepts we talk about in class. Not too much work overall but a very rewarding class.",
                "Yes! Professor Wolf is so kind and a font of art history knowledge. I learned so much from him every class---his analyses of the images we studied were all so nuanced and fascinating. I would 100% recommend to another student!",
                "Yes! Very great overview of the artwork of this particular period and will also give you a foundational knowledge for analyzing art of any kind. Professor Wolf is wonderful and the assignments are very open and inventive.",
                "YESS! One of the best courses I've taken. Absolutely amazing.",
                "Yes!! I think Prof. Wolf is a very kind professor and extremely knowledgeable about the topic material. He is also so understanding with deadlines and the most stressful times of the semester, and is willing to accommodate literally any changes you need to make. The workload of the class is also very manageable and centers around a final project which is an imaginary exhibition that you get to create from scratch. Take this class if you're AMST or HSAR or just need a humanities credit.",
                "Absolutely yes. It is not hugely difficult but I got SO much out of it.",

                "I really loved this course and would definitely recommend it--I think it was my favorite at Yale. The material was extremely interesting but Professor Wolf was a really amazing teacher which really had an impact on my experience.",
