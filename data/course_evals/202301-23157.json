                "The course provided very few insights into Caribbean Coastal Development, none of which could not have been found by reading a scientific article. The professorscombinedlectured for a total of seven class sessions, on such a wide-ranging series of topics (the first day of class, soil erosion, sedimentation prevention, coral reef ecology, wastewater/sewage treatment) that it seems the only thread was the professor's own interest in the topics. Even geography (the large region of the Caribbean) was not a major thread that tied these topics together, since the lectures didn't focus on the region. The professors delegated the rest of the \"teaching\" to guest lecturers whose areas of expertise were neither in the Caribbean nor in coastal development, as well as to students: half of the semester was dedicated to student presentations. During all student presentations, the rest of the students were on their laptops. These professors demonstrated that they are not experts in the topic, cannot foster learning, and are uninterested in excellence.\r\nI have taken many courses at Yale and have a strong desire to learn. As a Yale student, I have curiosity, grit, determination, work ethic, and a desire to make the world a better place. I am very frustrated by this course and the professors, which reflect so poorly on Yale. The class atmosphere throbbed of mediocrity and tiredness,  a \"lets just get this over\" mindset that crushed excitement and passion.",
                "this was a great summary of different issues related to the Caribbean! I enjoyed the format of the course and felt like it was really set up for student learning",
                "This course almost functioned as a survey course of various management related issues in the Caribbean as well as threats to ecosystems, types of ecosystems, and policy measures/conservation efforts for each.\r\n\r\nI learned how to analyze management strategies and conservation efforts to see what was effective and what could be improved in future cases.",
                "I learned a lot about the political, scientific, and social impacts that different climate factors have on the Caribbean. My understanding was broadened and I had a better scope of the way the environment impacts everything around us.",
                "As a non-environmental studies major, I went into this course with a very open mind. Unfortunately, the lectures in this course felt like a series of guest speaker sessions--not only in content, which was arbitrary and disjointed, but also in format. The professors on the syllabus lectured for less than half of our total class meetings, and most of the semester was occupied by student presentations on the previous night's readings. The topics each week spanned a variety of topics, but rather than creating an expansive picture of the environmental challenges facing the Caribbean region, it felt like each class meeting was the introductory course to something more complete. The guest speakers had little to do with the Caribbean region, though their content was at least more interesting than the student presentations.",
                "I learned a lot about a broad variety of topics concerning the ecology of the Caribbean and what unique environmental issues the region faces. I also gained insights about what solutions can be used to tackle the region's environmental problems.",
                "I learned about the nuances of Caribbean islands and the problems they face in the coastal environment, such as erosion, nutrient eutrophication, coral reef damage, climate change and ocean acidification, plastic pollution, etc. I also learned the social and economic factors that lay the ground for the many problems that lay in the ridge-to-reef system.",
                "I think that students developed meaningful insight into environmental preservation related initiatives in the Caribbean, and the severity of the current environmental crisis being faced in the region.",

                "This course was the worst class I have taken at Yale. It has failed in all aspects of what make a course great (or even good). The course was poorly organized. The course was boring. The course did not teach me anything new. The course required lots of work with little payoff (i.e. little learning). \r\nThis course could be improved by (1) being taught by experts who are (a) interested in pedagogy (b) good at lecturing/teaching (2) a syllabus that engages with the geography, ecology, and history of the topic region (3) course assignments that align with the lectures/taught material  \r\nTo summarize, the course was like a meeting that could have been an email. It was, ultimately, a waste of everyone's time. It wasn't a gut that taught cool information; it was just a class that didnt teach anything.",
                "strengths - format, content, professors were all lovely and engaging! weaknesses - I felt like there was a bit of a lack of feedback on assignments. it was nice to have things be open-ended, but it also made it a bit tricky to plan for the final project when there weren't any examples to go off of",
                "The strengths of this course is that it covers a LOT of different topics related to environmental management and various ecosystems/population considerations. You really come away feeling like you have a great overview of the struggles that SIDs encounter. However, it feels like you don't really get very deep into any one topic, and there is little guidance on the research papers (mainly an independent project). The student presentations in the second half of the course generated some interesting discussion but it took a while for people to get comfortable and in the best interest of the course, it might be best to keep it as an instructor lecture that they facilitate.",
                "this course was absolutely wonderful",
                "The student presentations were a very poor choice for this class. It seemed pointless to review material that everyone had already read, as the presenters (understandably) did not go beyond the information contained in the readings. It felt like we were teaching ourselves, and while many students made an effort to bring in other information during the discussions, I signed up for this class to learn from the professors. By the midterm point in the semester, most people spent the entire class on their laptops. Furthermore, the final project was incredibly unstructured. Under the guise of giving us academic freedom, the professors provided no information on how to approach our topics, nor on how to do well on the assignment. While I had initially been excited to explore this discipline, I ultimately spent as little time as possible on my final paper, because I simply had no desire to continue teaching myself. Never have I been so uninspired by a course.",
                "The course was fascinating and student engagement was high, which meant that discussions were always lively and interesting. There were many components to the course and I loved having such a broad introduction to many environmental topics.",
                "Strengths: engaged class discussions. Knowledgeable and passionate instructors.\r\nWeaknesses: could benefit with everyone in the class facing each other (instead looking forward to the whiteboard) to allow even more engaged discussion.",
                "Strengths: none other than decent discussions \r\nWeaknesses: general overview, no in depth learning. Professors barely taught - mostly guest lecturers and then student presentations."

                "As it's taught right now, I'm not sure I'd recommend. The first half of the course is lectures by the 2 professors and guest speakers, while the second half of the course is seminar-style but entirely taught by student presenters/discussion facilitators. If you're interested in science/policy but not a STEM major, this is a great science credit.",
                "Absolutely! A wonderful learning experience!",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. For EVST majors, the content is likely too fundamental to be of great interest. For non-majors, the course involves a lot of busywork and very little learning.",

                "Yes, it was a fascinating course and I learned so much!",
                "Yes. You will read scientific primary literature and learn to think critically about the problems at hand. The course is backed by science and a few guest speakers; come in with an open mind and a willingness to learn both negative and positive information.",
                "Definitely not. Was not set up for student learning - covering a different topic each class session meant that we skimmed over so many topics, never going into depth. The professors were not all that engaged, given the style of the course (predominantly guest lecturers and student presentations). Their expectations of us as students were so high which did not match the level of engagement by the professors. I was hoping to leave this class inspired by work happening in the Caribbean but instead, I am feeling disenchanted and let down by the quality of the course. I don't think this class should be taught at Yale any longer, especially without the field trip to the Caribbean. Felt like a cop-out class to teach on the professors parts given the structure of the course."
