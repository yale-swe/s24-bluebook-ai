She makes an effort every day to make sure students are engaged and learning the material. So I'd definitely say the daily class engagement in this course is one of its main strengths. This is where I was able to improve my fluency the most and catch my mistakes when speaking. The workload sometimes felt like a lot, but it was definitely worth it. I feel as though the homework was where we could put our skills to practice and improve the most. Overall, I think this course is great. I don't think I'd be able to learn so much of a new language in such a short span of time anywhere else. The only weakness would be that for oral tests we don't receive much feedback. I understand that the TAs put in a lot of effort to grade these tests, but we aren't informed about how to access their feedback."

It certainly isn't easy, but I'd say regardless it's a very rewarding experience. Especially if you have a good professor, this class can be super fun. For me, it was something I looked forward to every day, despite it being early in the morning."
