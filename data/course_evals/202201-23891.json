                "A great survey course of European Christianity focusing on the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. Extremely interconnected with other courses Professor Eire teaches, highly recommend it. Workload is very manageable, and the course structure, exams, and paper are aimed at student success",
                "I learned about the religious, political, and social world of reformation-era Europe. We also read a wide range of texts from very different authors, so I learned how to work with a wide array of primary sources. The content is especially useful in thinking through how the era lingers in our current political and religious world.",
                "Learned about history of the European Reformation... learned a very underrated piece of the puzzle of how we got to where we are today  how we transitioned from medieval society to Enlightenment.",
                "Through taking this course, I gained a thorough knowledge of the Protestant and Catholic reformation, their actors, and their effects on the modern nation-state, culture, and society today. It was amazing to see that events that are so easily glossed over by world history courses are perhaps some of the most influential in history. As someone who came into the class as non-practicing, don't let the theological readings and lectures scare youprofessor Eire is brilliant at contextualizing everything that was happening within the history and philosophy of the time, and in a way that makes it seem like you're learning philosophy instead of theology.",
                "Learned how to analyze primary sources and use them to understand the conflicts, discussions and historical context of the Protestant and Catholic reformations.",
                "Developed a thorough understanding of the history of early modern Europe and the intellectual currents of the time.",
                "A diverse understanding of the reformation",
                "I learned about the reformation, the counter reformation; and how different historical perspectives shape ones understanding of the early modern time period.",
                "This is a great course to learn exactly what the title describes. You learn a pretty in depth history of Christian intellectual thought and the human stories behind its development in this time period.",
                "survey of reformation and its impacts\r\nlots of engagement with primary source material",
                "How to read primary sources and to think deeply about religious, political, and social disagreements",
                "I learned about the reformations and how to study history",
                "I learned about the history of the Reformation(s), their consequences, and key figures that contributed. I learned a lot- not only about just the actual events of what occurred but about the intellectual history that occurred concurrently with the events.  It was a great course on how authority shifts, how individuals can shape traditions spanning centuries, and the interplay between the individual versus a \"greater being\", whether that be a divine figure or a church. It was also a course where we learned about the major conflicts that can arise from what we see as fairly trivial issues, such as the role of free will in salvation or what exactly happens during the Eucharist.",
                "I learned about reformation history, which was actually really helpful in understanding how we got from the Catholic Church only in early 1500s to so many denominations today and how religious beliefs were formed. I also got insight on how the modern world and the enlightenment era came directly from the reformation era.",
                "You learn about all things Reformation, the thought, the politics, the social dynamics, and the impacts.",
                "Learned about the Protestant and Catholic reformations, understood past and current Christian doctrine better",
                "I learned an overall history of the early modern period, which is to say, a history of religion in Europe during that time. I really appreciate the genuine interest and lightheartedness that can be used to approach history.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Lectures (Professor Eire is seriously amazing), the structure of the course (just two exams and a final 10-page paper), the scope of the content (I came out feeling like I had a solid grasp of this period in European history). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Section engagement at times was low (through no fault of both amazingly dedicated TAs Colin and Alexander!) just due to the students. Not sure how students not doing the readings can be fixed, though.",
                "Strengths: Professor Eire is a brilliant lecturertake the class just for him. I was also surprised at how crazy some of the class material really is. I hadn't expected to read so much humor in 16th-century propaganda or the habits and ideas of the leaders who affected change. I also thought the exams and essays were very fair. Weaknesses: None! It was a great history lecture.",
                "Strengths: The lectures are so engaging and fun. I fall asleep in most classes, but not this one. Carlos tells the story in such a gripping way you forget you're in class and not in a movie.",
                "Strengths: Professor EireI took this class (partially) because Professor Eire is Cuban and I am too, but the man is truly a legend in his field and his scope of knowledge is incredible. His lectures were always active and covered everything we needed to know for exams in an organized fashion, and he was an overall funny and pleasant lecturer.\r\n\r\nThe TAs: Both were exceedingly knowledgeable and supportive throughout the class, and I feel like everyone got to know each other on a personal basis, which always strengthens the course experience.\r\n\r\nThe class organization: Everything was neatly organized into succinct lectures that went with readings, all of which were covered in class. I never felt lost in what to study or review for exams, and that alone was a huge help.\r\n\r\nTextbook\/Readings: The textbook was perhaps one of the best-written textbooks I've ever read (almost to a fault because sometimes I'd skip out on doing primary source readings to read the textbook...)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only thing I can think of is that sometimes it can feel like a lot of reading, especially because 16th-century texts tend to be dense, but in many cases, the most important parts are covered in lectures and in sections, so it doesn't feel overwhelming.",
                "Strengths -- great teaching by Professor Eire who really knows his stuff. Primary source readings were also really interesting and helpful in understanding the history of the Reformations.\r\nWeaknesses -- Professor Eire isn't the best at getting straight to the point. Lectures start off a little slowly and so when it comes time for midterm review you realize there were some things he didn't cover or go into very thoroughly in class. Also -- 250 years of European history is a lot to cover in one semester so if you're looking to explore a certain part of the Reformation more closely, or to study theological differences between denominations, this is not the class for you.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is its reading assignments. Professor Eire's textbook is at once all-encompassing and easy to read; it provides excellent navigation through the history of early modern Europe. The additional readings are all primary texts from the Reformation era; students read Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Francis de Salles, Teresa of Avila, Pascal, etc. Grappling with the primary texts is intellectually enriching.",
                "It gives a good overview of the reformation; however there could be more emphasis on the counter reformation: additionally I think a section concerning Jews during this time period could be interesting",
                "Eire is a great lecturer. Very engaging and humorous to learn about thousands of people killing thousands of other people over ideas that no one really believes today. Many of the readings are easy and very relevant to the course. I mean, its a great course to learn what the title says youll learn, a good pick for religious studies majors or history majors who need a pre-industrial credit. A fine option for a 5th class if someone wants to finish a distributional requirement, but if youre looking for a gut I would avoid a class that requires a well-researched 10-page final paper and a final exam.",
                "no weaknesses\r\nprofessor Eire is fantastic\r\nlots of reading but its manageable",
                "Strengths: Carlos Eire is an amazing professor. Lectures are super engaging. Discussion sections were very intellectually stimulating. Workload is not too high. Course content very interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes too much reading.",
                "strength: great readings, workload, and teaching",
                "Strengths: Dr. Eire is a great lecturer, and the TAs were also fantastic during section and the few occasions in which they lectured. We studied from vaguely the 1300s to the 1800s, so we covered a lot of content. I liked that we talked about the traditions of the medieval church and the consequences of the Reformation- he did a good job contextualizing the events we actually studied.\r\nWeaknesses: We spent much more time talking about the Protestant Reformation than we did the Catholic one- which is understandable, since the Catholic Reformation was a response to the Protestants, but I would have enjoyed talking more about the Jesuits.",
                "Strengths - Professor Eire is a fantastic professor and the TAs (Colin and Zander) were super knowledgeable about the era as well and super passionate about the topic at hand as well. The course is well organized and in section you actually go into depth of the various reformers' theology. The readings are also really interesting. You would not expect something written in the 1500s to be particular interesting, but they are very accessible and fun to read. Genuinely enjoyed reading and discussing them in section. \r\n\r\nWeakness - Grading was really tough! That could just be me being bad at school though.",
                "Strength: great content, great lectures, great TFs. Weakness: perhaps a bit too much reading some weeks.",
                "Strengths: professor was great, readings were interesting, my TA was amazing\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were incredibly long and could definitely be shorter",
                "This course is perfect",
                "I think the course works well as it is. Maybe a bit less in the last few weeks on the 18tg century and some more focus on the theology of each party?"

Professor Eire is one of the great professors at Yale, and learning about this period with him and his wonderful teaching staff was a great experience.",
                "Highly highly highly recommend, especially if you're interested in early-modern Christian thought or if you've taken Professor Eire's classes before (Catholic Intellectual Tradition, Christian Mysticism, etc.)",
                "Yes! A great history lecture with crazy content you won't learn anywhere else and a brilliant professorwhat else could you ask for?",
                "Absolutely, take it for the professor. Carlos is a goofy and extremely accomplished scholar on the Reformation but also is just such an interesting and wise dude. If you're at all interested in the subject, you really can't go wrong by taking this.",
                "Absolutely a fantastic course.",
                "Absolutelythis was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale thus far. The professor and TAs were extremely successful in creating a welcoming and pleasant course environment, facilitated by a course structure that made it easy to study for exams. Besides this, the course content was extremely interesting (the Reformations have a lasting effect on society and culture, even today), and the class contextualizes it in a way that makes everything enjoyable to learn about.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any Yale student with any interest in religious history. This was my favorite class I have taken at Yale and it was incredibly engaging.",
                "Yes! Professor Eire is amazing!",
                "Definitely!",
                "Anyone interested in understanding the modern Europe, European intellectualism, or the Enlightenment should take this course. Also, for history majors looking for a pre-industrial credit, this is an excellent choice (regardless of what region you are specializing in).",
                "Yes! Lectures were great and TFs were knowledgeable.",
                "Yes, however it was difficult competing with classmates who already knew a lot about Christianity.",
                "Yeah, this is a great course for religious studies majors, philosophy majors that want to dive into Christian intellectual history (not super deep but pretty great context for the rest of your studies) or history majors that need a preindustrial credit. It teaches reformations from 1450-1650, focusing on the individuals and the thoughts of the era more than an economic  or social history. So if thats the kind of class you want, I think its great",
                "For sure. Great course to better understand theological, social, and political causes of the Reformations and the effects today.",
                "yes",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! Dr. Eire is extremely knowledgeable, and I really enjoyed the way he taught. I learned so much- this is my favorite history course that I've taken at Yale. There's a lot of readings on certain weeks (especially during the second half of the course, where the syllabus says you have to read around two hundred pages of the textbook on top of sources from the period), but you don't always have to do them very closely, so it doesn't end up being too much work at all.",
                "Yes! 100%. Even if you are not from a religious background, I think it is super important to understand the reformation period because it has impacted our modern world in so many ways that we do not realize. It was also really cool to read stuff from over 500 years ago and realize that people were just as contentious back then. They were also struggling with many big life questions too that I think was super relatable. The teaching staff and Professor were very engaging and funny as well, and I would definitely recommend this class and Professor Eire to any of my friends.",
                "Yes, you should learn about the Reformation and how it created the modern world in many ways. Also, you have to take a Carlos Eire course before you graduate. He is great.",
                "I would recommend this course! It definitely is not an easy gut to get an A in, but I really enjoyed learning more about the reformations since I did not have a basic understanding of them going in. The readings can be incredibly long, but there isn't that much work otherwise.",
                "Yes. Besides its generally interesting topic, Professor Eire is extremely engaging and kind. It is the best class I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes. It does what it says on the tin: if you take it, you will come out knowing what you need to know about the Prptestant and Catholic Reformations."
