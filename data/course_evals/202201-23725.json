                "I learned to look at documentaries more critically, with a deliberate eye. I also feel like I learned a lot about different environmental issues by virtual of watching docs on so many topics, from nuclear to dams.",
                "I learned about the progression of Western environmental documentaries throughout time, and the way in which this reflected the cultural, political, and environmental priorities of the time. I also learned how to better criticize and analyze dicumentaries.",
                "how to analyze documentaries!",
                "Taking this course allowed me to learn about the different approaches that are taken to documentary filmmaking. We watched a broad range of documentary styles, and discussed the motivations of the different films and how they may have been received by their respective audiences.",
                "I didnt know a huge amount about filmmaking going in, but I feel like Ive developed a much better vocabulary and understanding of documentaries. Its been useful to learn how to place films within the context of their directors larger bodies of work.",
                "I developed an appreciation for how far documentary has come in addressing the most pressing environmental issues plaguing our society. It was very interesting to see the drastically different styles each documentary used to put forward their beliefs and their shortcomings when doing so. Through our discussions, we actively considered what the purpose of a documentary truly is and voiced our critiques on how the films addressed their subject matters. Moving beyond documentary as a mode of expression, the class offered an introduction to many environmental issues which rarely receive attention in the US media.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Good documentaries towards the end\r\n\r\nWeakness: I personally found the first films shown a bit boring, but I understand this is due to showing films in chronological order, with older films being black and white and often with no narration.",
                "I enjoyed how engaging the class was this semester! I consistently felt that the discussions were incredibly fluid and people were truly engaging with the course material. There were some logistical issues with screenings and canvas, but they were all minor and I personally was able to overcome them.",
                "Loved the syllabus, wish we had more rudimentary film understanding so we could talk about more technical things during our discussion (not a fault of anyone, just only non-film majors took the course).",
                "The strength of the course was that great docs were assigned, many of which I never would have seen without the course. I feel like most of the learning from the course happened while watching the docs, as opposed to from class discussion. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course I would say was Professor Musser as a seminar leader. I think in the first few classes, discussion lagged, and as a result engagement in class discussion dropped off. Professor Musser did not do a great job of inspiring\/enforcing group discussion - often he responded to each comment in a way that kept conversation from developing organically. It was too instructor led, as opposed to allowing it to be student led.",
                "good discussion. good readings. sometimes class lacked structure but it was always interesting.",
                "I like the film selection in this course, as it seemed to give a good overview of environmental documentary.\r\nI think that there could have been a better introduction to documentary filmmaking, as the introductory text required a lot fo previous knowledge in order to understand it. Additionally, I think the class could've benefitted from more small group discussion so that the class could get to know each other better and feel more comfortable sharing, because the semi-lecture semi-seminar format did not feel the most conducive to good conversation.",
                "Strengths: This course offered a good introduction to documentary film studies, teaching us the basics while also challenging us. Our weekly Canvas conversations were lively, and I appreciated the perspectives and knowledge that Professor Musser and all of my classmates brought to class discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I very much enjoyed our class discussions, but it mightve been nice to have a bit more variation in the structure of in-class discussions. For example, we could have had students create discussion questions for certain weeks, collaborative assignments, small breakout-style activities, etc. I think these extra activities would also have the additional benefit of helping the professor learn each students name and allow all of the students to officially meet each other, neither of which ever really happened.",
                "The selection of documentaries we watched were strong. They focused on a great diversity of environmental issues worthy of discussion. The readings, for the most part, were quite interesting. I especially enjoyed when they gave additional context on the filmmaker or the subject matter being discussed. On most days, when students were willing to participate, discussion seemed to flow nicely, but in some cases it felt like we could have used a more concrete direction to what we were discussing. I very much enjoyed the open-ended prompts for papers, since they allowed me to focus on topics of great interest to me.",
                "strengths: the syllabus was fantastic -- we watched a good spread of films across different time periods, film styles, and environmental topics. \r\nweaknesses: the class can be a little unstructured sometimes and hence less conducive for discussions. \r\npotential improvements: it would be helpful to have guiding discussion questions for each film \/ class so students know what to expect for each class. It would also be helpful at the beginning of the semester to explain if this class hopes to take a more technical or environmental angle (or a good balance of both) during discussions. I found myself being unsure of whether I was approaching the films and readings correctly in the first half of the semester, so I think establishing the focus of the course at the beginning will be helpful.",
                "It was a good workload.",
                "The discussions during class didn't always feel like they had a purpose and they could have been facilitated a little bit better."

                "Yes! This course is an excellent introduction to the ways in which documentaries can be used as a communication strategy for climate change and other environmental issues. I think it's a great class for EVST majors and other people interested in the environment.",
                "Yes, especially if you have knowledge on film things you can gain a lot out of the   readings.",
                "The answer would be: it's complicated. I don't think another student would get much from the class discussion, but I did get a lot from the movies we watched. However, I can see that the incentive structure of the class could easily lead to someone not watching the films, since they wouldn't necessarily be called upon to engage in class discussion. If someone were to take it as a fifth class it could be good.",

                "Definitely! Please take this course if you are even remotely interested in environmental issues or documentaries. The assignments are fairly open ended, so you can really focus on what actually interests you. The readings are very reasonable and there is a great selection of documentaries for the entire semester.",
                "I would recommend this class if you enjoy watching environmental films and would want to learn more about filmmaking. Professor Musser is extremely knowledgable in that aspect. However, if you are looking for discussions that dive deep into environmental issues, this might not be the best class.",

                "This is a pretty chill course and I really enjoyed watching these films. Sometimes weeks can feel repetitive, and sometimes I felt no motivation to engage with what was going on"
