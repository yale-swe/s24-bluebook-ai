    "This course provided an engaging environment for students, even those who dislike learning other languages in general (such as myself). The only weakness was that it didn't help with understanding spoken Spanish very much, since very few Spanish speakers speak as slowly as the teacher. However, this may have been a struggle for me specifically because none of my high school Spanish teachers ever spoke the language in class.",
