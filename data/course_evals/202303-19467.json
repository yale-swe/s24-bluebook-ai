                "The basics of pricing options (puts, calls) and forwards contracts and understanding how their prices would be impacted by changes in the underlying stock's interest rates, expected dividends and borrow fees. Also, how the price of a stock is affected by an expected dividend or merger event. Basics of pricing bonds and convertible debt taking into account what the market thinks the borrower's (in the case of corporate credit, a company) chances of defaulting on its debt are. Pricing CDS. And the put-call parity equation and how it allows you to synthetically recreate a stock (without buying it) using options and calls. Throughout class we learned a lot about current events and things such as Open End Funds, Close-End Funds and ETFs. We also learned about different ways that a company can go public (IPO, SPAC, Direct Listing).",
                "Tons of different information about the way hedge funds operate, including the different types of strategies they run as well their merits and drawbacks. This course gives you a toolkit of how to critically think about the markets, investing and different kinds of trades. Prof. Pascutti's effort to research and bring out new topics to teach in class also teaches the necessary due diligence required for developing any meaningful investing thesis.",

                "Learned about a variety of fixed-income instruments and how industry professionals assess investment opportunities. Further, given Professor Pascutti's experience in the industry, he emphasized applicable skills and not just theory."

This often made me really stressed and I never felt on top of the content.",
                "The strengths are the energy that professor and Alice bring to the class. Something that could be improved is providing more problem sets and practice problems as well as a weekly discussion section.",
                "The biggest strength was definitely the professor. Prodf. Pascutti is a veteran of the hedge fund industry who has considerable experience and therefore has a lot to offer in terms of industry and market knowledge. Not sure if I can call it a weakness or a stylistic choice but the lectures can be a little disjointed in terms of flow because Prof. Pascutti jumps around a lot in between lecture slides to different topics. This results in one \"lecture\" being covered across multiple slides.",
                "The course was great, from lectures it was a little unclear what was going to be on exams but that was well clarified in section.",
                "Strengths: fascinating material, interesting reading, really dedicated professor and student body. Weaknesses: the problems sets often covered things we hadn't yet addressed in class so I felt like I didn't get a ton out of them until the solutions came out.",
                "Very practical course with theory mixed in. Could benefit from weekly discussion section to go through more material / explore the existing material in more depth."

As someone who is interested in the aforementioned topics, this is the best course I have taken throughout my time at Yale. It can be challenging at times because of the 4 midterms (yes midterms and not quizzes!) and a final but it is well worth the effort. Also a great way to get the senior requirement out of the way for Econ if you're an Econ major but I'd suggest it to other majors as well.",
                "Yes if you have an interest in hedge funds/finance etc. It covers a lot of theory and mechanics with real-world examples and was super interesting.",
                "Yes - if you want to become an investor (even if not in hedge funds) or learn more about different niches of finance, this is the class. It's my favorite class I've taken at Yale.",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the best courses at Yale. Though many of the people who take this class plan to go into finance, this course is also helpful for those looking to understand how these securities behave and how investors react. Since the entire course is based on the present and future, it also goes into a good bit of current affairs and how the Professor is thinking about them in terms of the market."
