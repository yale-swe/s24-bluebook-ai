                "Strengths: Small sections, so you really get to know the other students and the professor. Lots of little assignments that help you improve your skills and your grade without much stress (i.e. no giant essays, presentations exams, etc.) Good resources for reviewing the material through the website and canvas (I didn't take notes, and I wouldn't have found it helpful to do so).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Emphasizes writing & pre-prepared speeches rather than conversational skills.",
                "I enjoyed this course for the most part. I think that there could be fewer group projects, as I sometimes felt as though my classmates were putting in less effort than was fair.",
                "- Too focused on rushing through the material (vocabulary, grammar, culture) and not enough practice in class\r\n- Good review/study guide worksheets",
                "Too much work",
                "Strength: VHL\r\nWeakness: I didn't find the actividads we did on the async days helpful because it was really just a matter of memorization in a short period of time rather than learning material",
                "A strength of this course is that it is taught with a very small class size as to facilitate class participation. A weakness of this course was that I believe most of the class time was used for speaking in spanish, rather than learning tenses. I had to learn the tenses by myself.",
                "A lot of the material is supposed to be learned on VHL, which was not a helpful means of developing new skills, particularly after having had to learn from a pre-recorded video. There was little room for variation, and resulted in a lot of correct answers being marked wrong. Also, the workload consisted of almost weekly major assignments that did not feel proportional to the amount of material we were learning. A strength, however, was Professor Gutierrez Barajas. She was super accommodating, and good at fostering a friendly, collaborative work environment, which made it a lot easier to participate in her class, learn from peers, and use the corrections she gave us in future work.",
                "Motivation of students and teacher, good organisation, weakness was the start where grad students did not know about the advanced test",
                "I think that the course of 120 has guidelines that are far to strict. For instance, I could not even go to the bathroom during class, nor could I make up certain work if I was sick or had an excuse."

So no, the class isn't as easy a language credit as hieroglyphics or ASL, but the workload is only what you should expect from a credit and a half course, you really get to know the other people in your class, and the language itself is very useful.",
                "It depends. I personally would not take a language if it wasn't required by Yale. So while I wouldn't recommend it to someone who finished their language requirement already, for those who still need to complete theirs it would be good.",

                "I don't know that I would recommend this course, it was necessary to continue learning Spanish at Yale, but it was difficult to understand why we were learning what we were learning very often which lessened participation and engagement."
