                "the course is generally quite interesting, and functions well in its current format. \r\n\r\none tiny complaint: with respect to the recorded modules, I'd appreciate if more information was conveyed visually rather than by audio alone.",
                "While the live lectures were interesting, they would often go off on tangents that didn't feel very applicable to the assignments.  Watching a pre-recorded lecture along with attending a live lecture is quite a time commitment.  Other than that, I enjoyed the material of the class very much.",
                "Strengths: recorded lectures were succinct and to the point, allowing for a broader understanding of the GFC. Paper 2 and the final paper allowed a chance to dig deeper into course content. Prof. Metrick is awesome & really engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: live, in-person lectures were not really necessary to attend because very little content was covered; it was largely geared toward answering complex theoretical questions from graduate students. The grading of assignments is quite nebulous and subjective. The writing credit should not be optional considering the four memos and three papers that must be written. The first paper assignment which required reading a book was not particularly helpful in understanding of the crisis.",
                "got very repetitive after the halfway mark of the course",
                "Strength: Professor Metrick is a fantastic teacher and is a really interesting and dynamic lecturer. I also think the assignments (though slightly difficult) are also really good at making sure that I understood the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Writing the memos are a bit stressful in a short time frame, but was mostly manageable. Being graded out of 8 leaves fairly minimal room for error, though.",
                "No weaknesses! I loved everything about the course. Professor Metrick and his TAs were spectacular. I appreciated how the class lectures weren't just a repeat of what we learned in our Coursera lectures, which we sometimes watched for homework (so no, you aren't just paying Yale tuition to take a Coursera course). Rather, Metrick would often make the class session interactive, answering our questions as they came up. He did a great job tying in current events, too. I liked the assignments. The quizzes and community contributions were pretty straight-forward and kept me engaged. The memos and papers were definitely more difficult, but I learned a ton during the writing process.",
                "Strengths: Class attendance not required\r\nWeaknesses: Obnoxious students in the class; Geithner only shows up like three times",
                "Strengths: Really interesting content for anyone who wants to learn about the 2008 crisis. Given the historical importance of 2008, I think it's great for anyone to learn more about what caused the crisis and how we can deal with crises when they arise. I liked the prerecorded lectures on Coursera and the guest lectures from Timothy Geithner were great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course can be a lot of work and grading seems arbitrary. You write a minimum of 4 memos, but a maximum of 9, and then keep your top grades  even though the memos are short, they take a lot of time to write. Also, expectations for the memos are confusing, since writing workshops encourage brevity, but then grading favors pieces that are more verbose. Furthermore, there are two longer response papers and then a final paper, all of which take a ton of time to finish. Plus, you have to watch prerecorded lectures and take a quiz before almost every lecture, and then still attend in person live lecture",
                "Well organized course.",
                "There could have been more TA feedback to help us improve our writing. The class was well structured with online lectures though, and Professor Metrick was extremely engaging.",
                "Metrick is an amazing lecturer. I wish he would be more understanding of student circumstances when imposing harsh deadlines (especially given the pandemic).",
                "Strengths: it's great to hear Sec. Geithner's first hand experience, and Prof. Metrick's more academic analysis.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wasn't a big fan of the \"watch the lectures beforehand\" way of teaching. It's cool that class time is devoted to asking questions, but I'd much rather preferred live lectures where the professor discussed the material and not just answered questions.",
                "I thought it was an outstanding course",
                "The class could be tremendously improved if the pre-recorded lectures were actually taught during class time. This would allow for greater class engagement and make live lectures more important to attend. Otherwise, the live lectures are just question and answer sessions between the prof and grad students.",
                "The main strength of this course is that there are multiple ways to learn the material. There are the asynchronous lectures you are required to watch before class, the opportunity to post questions to the discussion board which may be answered in class, readings, and several writing exercises. While there is a lot of work for this course, a lot of it covers the same material and\/or reviews older concepts, allowing you to take away - at the very least - a general understanding of how financial crises originate and spread to the financial system and real economy. The other strength of this course is access to some of the leading thinkers\/researchers on financial stability. I also liked the fact that there are multiple opportunities to improve your grade (e.g. write 4\/9 memos, several opportunities to get participation points, drop 2 lowest quizzes, etc.). Theoretically, this incentivizes students to keep trying to improve their grades and gain even more proficiency in the material. My problems with the course were mostly with how the assignments were spread out during the term, but I think that came down to poor time management on my part."

                "All of them succeeded! At the beginning, Metrick said that the course had been taught in a somewhat hybrid fashion even before COVID-19, so transitioning to fully virtual wouldn't be tough at all. He was right. Even pretty late in the semester, there was a fair amount of class participation; people were still asking great questions and, to some extent, giving Metrick pushback whenever they thought he said something incorrect.",
                "I think it would have been better to have either live virtual lecture or prerecorded lecture, but not both. Since live lecture was just about answering questions, it felt less engaging than the prerecorded lectures, which contained the bulk of the course content",

As a result, I do not think this course is worth one of your Yale credits. While Prof. Metrick is a great professor, the course structure is not the most interactive and the grading can be a bit strict as well.",

If you come in knowing nothing about the financial system like I did, there is a bit of a small learning curve, but it ends up being a really interesting and rewarding course, since I found that I could discuss the subject pretty coherently at the end.",
                "Absolutely! I learned a ton about the global financial crisis, which is more relevant even now than you might think. Professor Metrick is amazing, and you should definitely try to take a class with him before you graduate. It was nice having a bunch of SOM students in the class, since they have such interesting backgrounds and insights. Also, the TAs are great (and highly qualified).",

                "Yes! As someone who grew up during this recession but did not really know the inner workings of what actually happened, this was a great course. I also think this class helps you understand the political narratives that popped up as a result of the crisis while also looking past them and evaluating events in a more objective way. I had taken intermediate level micro and macro before this course, and this course gave me the opportunity to see how those concepts play out in terms of policy. However, if you have a lot of other high-workload classes and\/or are not good at time management, I might wait to take this course or take it when you have a lighter load."
