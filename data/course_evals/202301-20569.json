                "The strength of this class is its concept, and its weakness is its execution. The idea of using the techniques of scientific writing to discuss topics which, though they may not classically be considered scientific, are still very much involved in the state of science today, is an excellent one. However, this class as it currently exists is not the way to do it. Logistics were consistently awry, and it was often unclear what we were expected to do, or how failure to do it might affect our standing in the class. Attempts to create a relaxed atmosphere failed, resulting instead in the constant feeling of insecurity and untetheredness. The lack of a central plan also made much of the activities undertaken during class time feel either pointless or poorly conceived, with little connection to anything else.",
                "The amount of feedback on our projects was a strength. It could maybe be improved by more focus on the semester's overall topic.",
                "Strengths: small class so you get to really know everyone and the professor. Dr. Miranker is very very engaging and allows for independent leading of the project. Also, you see everyone 3x a week which really allows for strong bonds.",
                "Strengths: personalized learning environment, deeply passionate instructor, and fascinating, individualized course material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: course could use a TF; Miranker was on a bit of an island sometimes and could have benefitted from written feedback on drafts."

                "I would not reccomend this class to another student under any cirucmstances. Though it may sound appealing in theory, as it currently exists it is simply too disorganized and poorly run to be worth the effort. Too much time is spent on activities which do not matter or whose purpose is unclear, and in many cases students will feel as though they are responsible for running the class, rather than the professor doing it for them.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to a student who wants to improve their science writing.",
                "Yes, for sure. Unique class and it was really fun to have such a small cohort of students. I loved my learning experience and can't recommend it enough."
