                "I learned so much more about Cuba and the Cuban Revolution. The final paper allowed me to dive into a really interesting topic regarding the revolution, and it encouraged me to take what I had learned throughout the class and use it in a different context. It also inspired me to learn more about Cuba outside of the classroom\/zoom room.",
                "I thoroughly learned about Cuban history from an academic perspective. I also learned about how nuanced and complex history can be. I gained a thorough understanding of most time periods within Cuba. Lastly, I left with a plethora of readings that I can continue engaging with on my journey to learning about Cuba.",
                "In high school, Cuba was a second of the curriculum, so it was amazing to actually learn about the complexities of Cuban history. Narratives on race, gender, foreign relations, and the revolution from the Afro-Cuban, the female, the refugee, the colonized perspective.",
                "I developed critical thinking skills relating to history while also gaining a comprehensive base of knowledge on Cuban history and its unique place in relation to the topics of imperialism, colonization, and socialism.",

                "The amount of reading was very challenging in general even though the class was very engaging.  Also, the discussions were really productive. I feel like it can be more efficient if there is less reading assigned and more analysis.",
                "Although the lectures were extremely interesting, they were hard to follow at times, and I think using a presentation or having more focused lectures could be helpful. I also found the readings to be fascinating, but they were often long and dense. This caused many students to skim and then not feel comfortable speaking about the readings because they had skimmed them. I think shorter readings with more casual articles mixed in would improve the quality of the discussions.",
                "Readings towards the beginning of the course were extremely long and did not contribute much to our knowledge of the course material. I feel that student presentations were not the best use of class time since presentation covered readings that class members did on their own time. I think that time could have been spent engaging more with Cuban culture throughout the time periods since this is the one component that I felt the course could have contained more of. While I do have many critiques, this course was a robust introduction to Cuban history from an academic perspective and left me with many more questions and resources to answer these questions for myself.",
                "Could have given more feedback consistently throughout the semester because I didn't know how I was doing until the end, but other than that a great course! The readings and lectures were powerful, and we had great discussions",
                "The course was amazing and Professor Eller was engaging despite the drawbacks of COVID.",
                "Professor Eller is extremely knowledgable about the subject, and her enthusiasm is clearly evident throughout class. The one weakness I would say this class has is a pretty overwhelming amount of reading, especially for a first year seminar.",
                "More feedback from the professor throughout the semester, we received none.",
                "Readings very repetitive and monotonous. Professor seller is very nice and brings up exciting topics that are related and unrelated to the course which keeps it engaging.",
                "Loved the syllabus! The readings were sometimes a little too dense.",
                "One major weakness in the course is that was difficult to gauge whether my writing was improving over the course of the semester due to the fact that we received very little feedback.  A strength of the course was the largely interesting reading material which contributed to productive and lively discussion during class. The material the professor would speak of in class to us was fascinating, but on days where there were no students presenting it sometimes felt more like a lecture. Having guiding discussion questions, I felt, really contributed to class engagement."
