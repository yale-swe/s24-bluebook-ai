We learned about the cryptographic primitive of a One-Way-Function, and how these can be used to build Pseudorandom Generators, which can in turn be used to build Pseudorandom Functions and Pseudorandom Permutations. The latter two can be used to create CPA-secure and CCA-secure encryption schemes, respectively. We studied these extensively in the context of Private-Key Encryption, and we also moved on to Public-Key Encryption. We studied Message Authentication Codes and Digital Signatures. Throughout the course we wrote proofs of security. These proofs of security typically relied on technical assumptions such as FACTORING, DLOG, DDH, or RSA. We also often saw examples of insecure schemes and protocols, and discussed how an adversary can break them. In the last few lectures we discussed some advanced topics such as post-quantum cryptography and cryptocurrencies.",

The homeworks were a lot of work early in the semester, but the teaching staff made them a bit more manageable in the second half of the semester. The class is really well organized and you get detailed feedback on your homework one week after submitting it. If you're willing to put in some time, you'll learn a ton.",
                "Strengths: Pretty interesting course, teaches you the fundamentals of cryptography, teaches you how to think critically, offers problem sessions for students to get help\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of help for people without a background in number theory. Furthermore there is not a lot of resources provided to help students learn better.",
                "Its a great course!",
                "The professor is the biggest strength. He learns everyones name and is super enthusiastic about the material. The psets are also great, they are super fun and engaging. The midterm was a weakness it was out of nowhere and hard because we had no time, it would have been fair if time was not a problem. This was fixed in the final exam. Overall very few weaknesses",
                "Perhaps there should be one lecture explaining oblivious transfer and garbled protocol, since they are \"complete\" for MPC, and then go on to explain ad-hoc solutions for problems like zero-knowledge, etc. The Byzantine agreement part is perhaps \"too classic\", there are significant progresses in this field since the 1980s.",

I have difficulty understanding which actor is conducting which step. Who is issuing the challenge? who is issuing the m_0 and m_1? the narrative is sometimes hard to follow\r\n- a curve :)\r\n\r\nThe workload was a little low toward the end but too high at the beginning; the class could use some rebalancing",
                "The material was very interesting and the psets were engaging. I think the lack of flexibility in grading was the big frustration of the class, we should not get zero credit for turning in a pset 5 minutes late, that and other things really decrease how seriously I take my final grade in this class as a reflection of my mastery of the material.",
                "It was overall a great course. The information was presented clearly and the homework assignments were useful for solidifying our understanding of the concepts. It was clear how the different units tied together, so we were able to form a cohesive understanding of the material in the course. However, there were occasionally errors in the supplementary lecture notes and it would have been beneficial to have more office hours."

The content is interesting, but it's very hard to actually practice anything. The feedback on hw is almost non-existent, and we didn't have any practice problems at any point.",

                "I would only recommend this course to another student if they do not care about their grade, are genuinely interested in cryptography, and are adept at math. This class was very challenging for me and the workload was very intense. The class moves at a very fast pace and assumes the students is already good at things such as proofs. If the student wants a big challenge, I would recommend this class.",

                "Sort of. It's actually quite interesting to learn about cryptography in this proof/math-based way, but the exams are graded super harshly and are not straightforward at all.",
                "Yes! You will learn about a really interesting and mathematical topic as opposed to just writing and debugging code. (We didn't do any coding after week 2 if I'm correct.) Cryptography is a really important topic in Computer Science. If you have taken cs 202 and are familiar with proofs, I highly recommend this course.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in Theoretical CS or just wants to see a bit more math in a CS class. It is a good introductory Cryptography course, and you get to learn about a wide range of topics in Cryptography (with some depth, though the textbook includes more details that we didn't cover in class). The workload of the class was considerably higher in the 1st half of the semester (requiring a lot of time), so I am not sure what the workload will be like when the class will be taught again."
