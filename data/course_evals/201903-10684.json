    "You learn about cryptography, authentication protocols, network security, and other things.",
    "How to think critically (and skeptically) about systems, networks, applications, and computersmore specially about their security or lack thereof.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as secure information.",
    "information security, cryptography and cryptosystems like public key encryption and symmetric key encryption, malware",
    "You learn a lot about the details of encryption algorithms and how they have grown and evolved use.",
    "information security in the real world is often flawed and overlooked. learned broadly about information security and cryptanalysis",
    "I learned about different ways digital information can be secured.",
    "Learned about information security and listened to some cool speakers in the industry",
    "I learned about ciphers, protocols, and malware.",
    "I learned the elementary elements of information security, from cryptography to networking to software vulnerabilities.",
    "The course gave a good overview into the world of information security.",
    "A gained a better understanding of the field of information security from multiple perspectives.",
    "Different components of information security, such as cryptography, network, protocols and software.",
    "I found this course to be incredibly fascinating, it provided a very broad but complete understanding of a large variety of concepts relating to information security. I learned a lot from basic cryptography to much more advanced security measures.",
    "Learned about cryptology, networking, protocols, etc. and the additional issues introduced when humans are added into the information security equation.",
    "Learn about cryptography, networks, and cyber attacks."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a bit more practical programming exercises would have been nice, or perhaps looking at security protocols as they are operating on a real computer system. Dr. Slade did say that we shouldn't attempt to write security, but rely on trusted libraries in practice instead, because our code will inevitable not secure enough for real-life use, which makes complete sense. It's just that the vast majority of the course was theory, and it would have been nice to know some practical skills for working in the information security field.",
    "stengths: straightforward, linear course. No surprises; easy to follow\r\n\r\nweaknesses: lectures are a retelling of the textbook rather than an expansion of it.",
    "Strengths - Slade is nice and gives off good vibes, the guest lecturers that come in are pretty interesting and are pretty important people, and it's really nice of each of them and Slade to give up their time to have dinner with a couple students at Mory's each time there is a guest lecturer\r\nWeaknesses - topics taught can get a bit dull or complicated at times, at least for me",
    "There was A LOT of content. Sometimes the details felt unnecessary. However, Professor Slade also adds his own stories which are very interesting, and the guest speakers were awesome.",
    "strengths: well-organized, clear layout, reasonable workload\r\nweaknesses: slade is great but also he speaks so slowly--it was kind of hard for me to follow and pay attention because of this",
    "The slides in lecture are pretty much directly from the textbook so it feels like you could learn a lot on your own. The material can get a little tedious because of the detail but the textbook and Slade throw in some funny quips. The material is overall interesting though since you now know you can't trust the security of any technology lol.",
    "Very textbook and lecture heavy. Not many activities besides infrequent homework assignments, a paper, and 2 exams. Maybe some more smaller assignments that reinforce some of the concepts would be helpful.",
    "The amount of guest speakers, the engaging lectures, and the responsiveness of professor Slade and the teaching fellows.",
    "Lecture was ver dry and hard to stay engaged. Problem sets had some unecessarily difficult coding problems that went beyond the prereqs.\r\nHowever, the content itself and the book were great.",
    "It gives us a very comprehensive introduction to cyber security. The textbook and slides are very detailed, and the homework helped to review the concepts a lot. There are a lot of opportunities to hear from speakers working in the field.",
    "I think the structure of the class, starting from very simple ceasar hashes and such, and working up to larger concepts was very intuitive and helpful, however I do wish there was more time to go into coding of more advanced hashes and maybe less time on the foundationals.",
    "Very interesting subject matter not often discussed in other courses.",
    "It's a good class. First half is on cryptography, very interesting and fun. The second half, on networks, wasn't very interesting to me. Workload is very very manageable. Minimal coding skills needed. You never learn how to code in class or are tested on code on exams; there are just 1-2 (out of 10) homework problems that require simple coding on each pset."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Perhaps: the course does teach you the basics of information security and how it's used, but mostly in an abstract, high-level way.",
    "No. The course is at once a vague, mile-high overview of security, and an overly detailed examination of some intense math.\r\n\r\nNOT A GUT",
    "If you are very interested in cryptography and security protocols, then I would recommend it, but if you just want a brief introduction, this class may feel a bit boring at times",
    "If you are interested in learning about cybersecurity, yes. If you need a 5th class and do not mind a little coding at times, yes. If you need a QR and are not too familiar with CS, no. This class is not a complete gut as you need to study for exams a bit and you need to spend a decent amount of time on psets (but not anywhere even close to what you would spend on a regular CS class). I think it is a good class to get some foundation on the material, but it also does not count for the CS major so make sure you are aware of that.",
    "I would recommend this to a student looking to get a shallow overview of cryptography",
    "Yeah, its not needed for anything but you learn about some cool concepts",
    "I would recommend this course mostly to non-CS majors for learning more about how the Internet and other applications work, plus how your data is actually encrypted. CS majors may know some of the material already, but it is still interesting, just not super difficult.",
    "Yes, as a general introduction to information security.",
    "No. You could just read the book and understand everything.",
    "I would recommend if the students have great interest in cyber-security. Moreover, I feel there is more focus on  memorization or concepts and protocols for this course, so its more suitable for students who are more used to this learning style.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in computer science, the basic information learned is applicable to any field and the style of thinking it provokes is highly useful to any future programming.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course if you are at all interested in the subject matter. I thought it was fascinating, and I now enjoy reading and understanding articles about information security and data breaches. Information and personal data is everywhere, and this class teaches some of the strategies used to protect our privacy. Also, this class had cool guest speakers from Microsoft, the National Security Agency, Yale, the Law School, and there was potentially going to be one from Facebook that didn't work out. Hearing from them is really cool and there's a lottery to have dinner with them. Even if you don't win the lottery some of them were available for lunch."
