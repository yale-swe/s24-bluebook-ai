                "This course was an excellent one, and also the first true \"political science\" class I have taken (I have taken 10 PLSC classes). I built an understanding of expertise's modern challenges and its historical context. I also gained an appreciation for reading research\/chapters of books and comparing authors. I have never been held so accountable to do readings, I am so much better for it.",
                "We did a deep dive into the theory and philosophy behind expertise and its role in the democratic process. What is an expert? Why do certain groups trust them and others don't? Is there a shortage of expertise nowadays? What implications does trust in experts have for the democratic process? Etc etc etc... overall, a thoroughly interesting and relevevant subject matter in today's polarized politics.",
                "I gained insights into the intricacies of expertise as a social concept, as well as scholarly and popular debates surrounding the role of experts in society and politics. After taking the class, I can more critically analyze what it means to be an expert and assess the important roles that experts can play in decision-making."

            "comments": [
                "I was certainly challenged in this course, as were my peers. We worked with high level concepts and they were hard to ground sometimes -- but I would change nothing. I gained an unspeakable amount of knowledge through working to bring myself up to the level of the readings. The Professor did an excellent job of comparing readings and concepts, and the syllabus put the material in a very cohesive order.",
                "Strengths: class discussion was often lively, readings were interesting, and very useful for the term paper. Class was well-organized, and the workload during the semester was manageable. The only weakness I can think of is that occasionally, we didn't discuss certain required readings, but this was more due to class discussion running over than a fault of the course.",
                "The course did a great job of mixing in-depth seminar-style discussions with thought-provoking readings from a wide variety of perspectives.  It was well organized to provide a view of the contemporary debates surrounding expertise as well as some of their historical roots. One suggestion for future iterations of the course would be to invite different experts to speak to the class, reflecting on their roles and activities in conversation with topics discussed in the readings. I think this interactive component would help further engagement and shed light on the real-world relevance of expertise."

                "I could not recommend this class more, especially to those who seek to go into politics or public policy. Expertise is such a complicated field, and learning how the public responds to it is fascinating and helpful. I also felt very close to my peers in the class; having a smaller section, and a group genuinely interested in learning, made for a wonderful experience. I walk away with friends and knowledge.",
                "Absolutely! The material is of such high importance today, and I feel that I came away with an understanding of political theory that I may have never had the opportunity to investigate otherwise.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any Yale student, especially those who aspire to become experts themselves. The topics discussed are relevant for understanding the operations of all sectors of society, from industry to government, and hugely important for discussions about power, truth, and the future of democracy. The course gives plenty of opportunities to discuss these issues with other interested students, and guided by a diverse group of fascinating readings (and films!)"
