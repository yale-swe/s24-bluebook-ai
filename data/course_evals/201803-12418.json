   "comments": [
    "I learned a TON of information in this class. I loved this class. It was extremely hard, but I still had fun learning about a lot of different aspects of classical mechanics. I took the best notes in, did the most studying for, and was intrigued the most by, this class over any other at Yale.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of what I learned in 260\/261, but nothing completely new.",
    "You learn hamiltonian and lagrangian mechanics, central force motion, non-inertial reference frames, moment of inertia tensors, special relativity, and some other stuff.",
    "Exactly what it says on the tin. Pretty good sophomore mechanics class.",
    "Interesting to approach classical physics problems that are much more complex from different angles.",
    "Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, Special relativity, Generalized force & momentum",
    "I learned about Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, harmonic oscillation, calculus of variations, circular motion, scattering, moment of inertia tensors, etc. This course goes beyond the classical mechanics of any of the introductory physics classes.",
    "I learned how to do problems with energy, also learned about orbital mechanics.",
    "It really helped me to review special relativity from my introductory physics course.",
    "In this course you will study classical mechanics at a sophisticated level: essentially, this is Newtonian physics and its various formulations, such as the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian. You will learn how to describe the classical motion of a particle in arbitrary reference frames, and how to quantify the way an objects asymmetries affect its rotation. Examples include rockets and orbits, particle physics, and other standard physical setups. The course also covers Einsteins special relativity and Lorentzian mechanics towards the end.",
    "In this class, classical mechanics becomes more interesting. You learn about Lagrangians and Hamiltonians, and you learn to think about physics in a new way",
    "We learned all about classical mechanics - a considerable extension to the material covered in PHYS 180, 200, or 260. We basically covered the whole textbook \"Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems\" by Thornton and Marion.",
    "Beyond Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics, the what topics are covered is largely up to the professor.  With Baltay we covered central force motion, noninertial reference frames, dynamics of rigid bodies, and special relativity.",
    "We learned about the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics, which are much more powerful than Newton's formulation. We also learned in depth about topics not covered in introductory physics course, such as rigid body motion and non-inertial reference frames.",
    "Insight into the foundations of classical mechanics.",
    "While I had encountered Lagrangian mechanics in PHYS 260, I feel as though I now have a much more thorough understanding of energy-based mechanics. The same goes for orbital mechanics; while I don't understand all the aspects of central force motion in complete abstraction, I do feel much more confident in my understanding of orbital mechanics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is very well structured. The professor's lectures align well with the textbook, which facilitated my absorption of the material.\r\nSome of the homework questions were really, really hard, which at times usurped my sleep and monopolized my evenings. But in terms of structure, order, and sequence, the class was great.\r\n\r\nA midterm and\/or final exam review session, or just an outline of material on Canvas, would be a great addition to the class. Also, formula sheets that go beyond trigonometric identities would be great; the tests now either require the memory to regurgitate numerous important formulas, or the mathematical genius to quickly derive them in the short time span allowed.",
    "At times it felt repetitive from what I learned last year, but it definitely went deeper, so I don't know how to improve that.",
    "Pretty standard physics class. Baltay is a good lecturer, and the tests are fair.",
    "This is a straightforward lecture-style class, and Baltay is a decent lecturer.",
    "Minimal use of Canvas, 1 TA.",
    "This is a very good course. The only weakness might be that it has introductory level courses as a prereq. It should not, and should and be can taken directly after high school level physics.",
    "Baltay is a good, clear lecturer. I never left lecture confused. I would have appreciated more organization and information about preparing for exams, but I was kind of used to the drill from Physics 260\/261.",
    "I think the course is a bit slow at times and really fast other times. We go painfully through pretty simple material and then race through the new stuff very quickly. I think the material is interesting, just needs to be taught with more regard to how the students learn.",
    "The instructor didn't really seem to care if we learned or not and just did his thing. I wish he had gone slower or reviewed the material more.",
    "The course is great as it is. For most students, the material is not fundamentally novel. Most people in the course had seen classical mechanics in one form or another before. Instead the course, from the pedagogical perspective, is an attempt to try more difficult problems, and add a greater degree of flexibility and sophistication to students approach to the subject. In line with this, I think the course could benefit by adjusting more finely to the level of the students in the class. A quicker pace and more new material would have made the class more engaging, and less a repetition of introductory physics.",
    "This class was strong because the content is very interesting and important. The weaknesses are that Baltay isn't the best lecturer, you have to memorize all formulas for the exams, and sometimes the homework is just a lot of heavy\/difficult algebraic manipulation instead of actual physics concepts.",
    "Overall the course covers material that is undeniably relevant - classical mechanics is the foundation of physics. I believe the course would be better if it had peer tutors or an involved TA because the lectures were fine but when it comes to problem sets you're basically on your own.",
    "The strength and weakness of this course is the depth in which it goes into derivations. Specifically, we learned a lot about the mathematical derivations for important equations, but often the intuitive explanations were neglected.",
    "It relied a little too much on long derivations on the board instead of interesting examples.",
    "One major weakness of this course, at least as taught by Professor Baltay, was that students were never allowed a formula sheet on exams. His reasoning for this was something along the lines of \"Oh, well these formulas are pretty simple, so I would expect you to be able to remember them. I mean, if you can't remember F=ma, you're going to be in trouble,\" which is all well and good for remembering one simple equation, but for the final, where we had to remember around a hundred equations that could have come up, memorizing all of them becomes significantly less trivial of an endeavor. For someone who's been living and breathing physics for decades like Professor Baltay, I'm sure many of those equations are second nature, but for students who are seeing them in this course for only the first or second time, again, memorizing all of them becomes significantly less trivial."

   "comments": [
    "I'd highly recommend this class to another student - especially one stuck between 401 and 410. I almost took 401, but 410 was really interesting right away. I'm sure 401 is great too, but 410 captured my attention on the first day. We talked about a lot of cool - conceptually mind-boggling and headache-inducing, but cool - stuff.",
    "If you have to take it then yes, you'll learn something. But maybe your time could be better spent in other ways.",
    "This is a pretty good physics class. It's not easy, but you learn a lot and the professor actually teaches and cares whether you understand the material.",
    "This class is pretty good, and I would definitely recommend it over 401. Baltay is a generous grader and you shouldnt have much of a problem with it as long as you keep up with the psets.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who was majoring in Physics or a related major. The material was presented in a very understandable and well-organized way with lots of examples. The problem sets generally do not take too much time and mostly emphasize and supplement the concepts learned in class.",
    "Yes- pretty solid\/in depth overview of familiar concepts, but at a more advanced level.",
    "Yep, it's a requirement for the intensive major but it's also cool.",
    "Yes, if you're a physics major you need to take it, but it's a good course for a math or engineering major who wants a more rigorous treatment of topics from the introductory sequence tracks. Classical mechanics isn't the most glamorous physics subject, but it is foundational, and Baltay is a good professor to take it with.",
    "No. I wish I could go back in time and take 401.",
    "The topics were interesting, but sometimes I felt lost that some of the stuff was going over my head.",
    "Yes, if youre interested in physics and want to spend more time studying classical mechanics before moving on to quantum mechanics or other more specialized subjects. The course is a great bridge from introductory physics to real world physics. Dont take it unless you know why you want to take the course. It is in many regards similar to an advanced introductory approach like PHYS 260.",
    "Yes, you have to take if you are an intensive physics major",
    "Yes! This is better than all of the intro physics courses so if you already know the basics of calculus based mechanics you should go for it! You definitely don't need to have taken a physics course here at Yale already - AP Physics C is fine.",
    "Yes",
    "You may be confused for a lot of the semester, as the course covers difficult material at a fast pace, but if you're alright with a bit of self-teaching, there are some really interesting topics in this course that make it worthwhile."
