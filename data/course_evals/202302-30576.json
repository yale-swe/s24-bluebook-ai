The course discussed the matters of negotiation in arbitration, mediation, and conciliation that function within the realm of private law, specifically arbitration at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. This course also enlightened me on the practice of game theory to understand contract enforcement by applying the strategies within simple games like prisoner's dilemma and transactional exchanges of Hohfeldian entitlements between two parties.",

                "I thoroughly enjoyed the mixture of teaching styles embedded in this course that allowed students to engage with French and American professors. However, I think teaching styles varied in a confusing manner. It may be helpful for all professors to have the same teaching style: a few readings before the class and a lecture with slides during the class. Also, I wished there was more transparency about the grading of this course. The short time span to receive feedback and questions about the material in response to that feedback made it difficult to grasp the course material. \r\n\r\nAlso, the fundamental aspect of having a coalition of American and French students in this class made this class unforgettable and an incomparable experience. Learning about what is included in a typical French eduction compared to American education was beyond fascinating. I had the opportunity to learn and ask questions to the French students about the course content and the greater experience of spending the summer in Paris. The greatest strength of this course is undoubtedly the opportunities for the French and American students to interact.",
                "Strength: beautiful location (Paris) for the summer, very easy to connect with French students\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of transparency, course organization could use a little more effort.",
                "The professors were strengths, weaknesses are maybe lack of peer tutors",
                "The strengths of this course are that it teaches very interesting legal material by legal professionals which makes for a unique experience. However, this course was highly disorganized in terms of never getting our grades for assignments back, no clear dates for things like exams (our final exam schedule was changed and we were told the change less than 24 hours before our exam which it had been increased and made for harder exam preparation). Also, this course is taught for 4 hours every day with very few small breaks 4 days a week. Given this time schedule, there was too much information crammed into sessions. The material is all very new and can be hard to digest so it made the class hard to follow because there were too many things being taught in one day, every day. I would suggest keeping students updated and providing feedback in a timely manner for class assignments so they can properly prepare for exams. I also suggest providing the class syllabus ahead of time and making it more detailed so students can be aware of how much each assignment is weighted as well as exams (we were never given this information). Also, the professors should be more prepared when coming to class, as great as some of them were, there were a few professors that did not explain their material well, went too fast, and did not have slides prepared. So, while having multiple professors is a strength of the program, I do believe there should be a priority on making sure they come to class prepared.",
                "Well structured, highly thoughtful content and practice with different professors from around the world.",
                "The variety of professors was greatly appreciated to see so many different perspectives, but the amount of class hours was rather long.",
                "Upload all course material to canvas for digital access. Shorter class time (10-1pm recommended).",
                "I think that a strength of this course was the professors who prepared magnificent lectures for us and challenged us to really implement the knowledge we were learning. However, I think a weakness of the course was the lack of feedback we received. We went through most of the course not knowing how we had done on our psets or what the exam would look like and I think it hindered our performance on the final exam.,"

I met wonderful people who were also interested in the intersection of law and economics. In addition, I had the opportunity to learn about French Law  in comparison to the U.S. which was incredibly captivating."
