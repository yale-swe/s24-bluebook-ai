                "By taking this course i started learning vocabulary, grammar, and typical practices for communicating in American Sign Language. The class also-introduced me to different aspects of deaf culture including architecture, literature, and holidays such a the the international weak of deaf-people."

            "comments": [
                "strengths: really accessible for so many students who don't have any familiarity with ASL, definitely a lot better paced than most language classes here. ASL is just so absurdly cool too. So not just a great language, but a really cool community here at Yale, also super interesting if you're interested in disability studies, education studies, and\/or linguistics. \r\n\r\ncons: the group project was horrible. This is college, we should not be required to do large group projects that count for major parts of our grade, it's not fair to be relying on other people that much. Also there was just such poor communication of deadlines and expectations and the assignment changed mid-semester with no explanation. Super frustrating and wayyy harder than any other assessments during the year. I also think we did too much review, I wish we would have gone a little farther in terms of vocab.",
                "The voice-off classroom is a strength of this class as immersion helps facilitate learning. The pacing of the class was good, but the final project as a whole was a mess. It was clearly being made up as we went, often changing without any notification, and we as students often were left guessing with each other.  There was also little feedback. I still do not have any of my quiz grades from any point in the semester back.",
                "Strengths: Professor, comfortable classroom environment, course content, interacting with D\/deaf community\r\nWeaknesses: Quizzes\/assignments often left ungraded",
                "One strength of the course was the voice-off environment. This allowed us to practice our signing skills consistently and ensured that we left the course more knowledgeable than before. Another strength was the instructor's teaching style. It was easy to understand each concept that was taught and the professor promoted a low-pressure environment as well. I felt comfortable asking questions and felt very engaged during class.",
                "I think these class makes learning ASL a fun and engaging experience while students are learning vocabulary and grammar. In class we only communicate in ASL so I think it would be helpful to have forum where students can ask questions and get answers more casually than email."

                "Absolutely. ASL is so dope and it's something everyone should know at least some of. Definitely the best language I've taken at Yale by far (and I've tried several lol)",
                "Yes! ASL is a really important language, and I think more people need to be learning it if we want to create an inclusive world.",
                "I would absolutely recommend taking ASL. The community at Yale is so lively, and you also get to interact with the D\/deaf community at large. ASL is Ann extremely rewarding and beautiful language, and it is something that everyone should learn.",
                "If you are looking for an easy language or genuinely interested in deaf culture I would 10\/10 recommend.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course provides a low-pressure environment to learn ASL and about Deaf culture. The voice-off class setting ensures that students grasp how to communicate with their peers in sign language and leave the course more fluent than they were prior. Additionally, I found the class rewarding as I got to experience the beauty of Deaf culture and participate in a service project designed to raise awareness about the Deaf community.",
                "Yes! The ASL program at Yale, despite it being so new, is amazing! I loved being a part of the class and having the opportunity to learn from such passionate professors.",
                "I would definitely recommend ASL to other students it was one of the most fun and meaningful class I took during my semester and I'm so grateful to have had to opportunity to take it. I really enjoy communicating using sign now that I have a better understanding of how to do so. I also learned a lot more about accessibility and how hearing people can contribute to make spaces more inclusive of Deaf people."
