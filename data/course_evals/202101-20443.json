                "I learned a lot about educational policies. There was definitely a big emphasis on the political realm of things, which I felt like wasn't in the description of the class but was reasonably interesting. I got to read a variety of philosophers and I feel more prepared to discuss broad educational systems and feel more prepared to be an informed voter in this arena.",
                "The more classes I take at Yale, the more I learn to appreciate nuance in discussion of important topics. This class was no different, and I was able to appreciate the different ideas we discussed while being taught how to think rather than what to believe.",
                "I learned a lot in this course both in terms of vocabulary  and insight into a really good syllabus of reading material, but also improved my ability to discuss. I thing we talked about a lot of participatory readiness, and this class helps give you that. The books we read were awesome. Du Bois' \"The Soul's of Black Folk\" is unforgettable and I really enjoyed reading Carter G. Woodson's kind of attack against it. That was definitely my favorite part of the syllabus. I loved reading about ideas, thinking about how they were relevant today, and then seeing how other thinkers disagreed. It felt like we were always understanding more.",

                "Strengths-- interesting reading list, Prof. Stanley is great and engaging. Weaknesses-- some lack of communication on due dates\/what readings are expected each week, poor and disengaged TA made for weak discussion section",
                "Strengths: the content of the course. The content of the course is truly fascinating and the readings we did are very interesting for anyone remotely interested in education and its purpose.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Oftentimes lectures felt very disorganized and did not cover the material we were assigned to read in its entirety so we kept falling behind as the semester went along. Slides would have been VERY useful. We spent a lot of lectures that were just Stanley scrolling through a PDF of the readings and providing commentary (that was sometimes useful but often not). I think communication surrounding logistics could be vastly improved. Oftentimes it was unclear when things were due or what we were actually assigned to read for the week (again, because we constantly kept falling behind, the reading amount kept changing throughout the semester).",
                "This is a very enjoyable course, but it's helpful to know what you're getting into. \r\n\r\nThe course name is a bit misleading; it's much more of a political science course than a philosophy course. The presentation of information is not particularly discursive -- it's offered more as a historical record of truth than an open debate. Which, considering the content of the class, is actually very fair; the overall takeaway from the class is that the information presented has historically been omitted from educational curricula, and is now finally being its fair worth. None of this is criticism of the class, just understand if you're considering taking it that the format is less debate-based and more historical.\r\n\r\nThat said, in that context, it is extremely valuable, useful, and enjoyable. The information is important and the readings are engaging without being overwhelming. I would recommend the class to everyone interested.",
                "This course covered a range of very interesting material, and the professor was insanely intelligent. The only thing I'd add that might improve this course would be a slightly less reading-heavy workload.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, manageable workload and assignments, not too many essays, participation really necessary in the small section. Weaknesses: Professor Stanley is definitely a little disorganized, which some people might be fine with but which also may frustrate some people. The op-ed assignment, which could be turned in at any point in the semester, wasn't really introduced until quite late in the semester. Assignments are sometimes unclear or not posted on time. Professor Stanley also sometimes cold calls.",
                "I really enjoyed the readings and lectures. Section was a free discussion, which made for an exciting time.",
                "The strength is in the syllabus and also Professor Stanley's personality. He's a goofy dude, and it made classes engaging.",
                "The readings of this course are phenomenal, but its impossible to read 4 books in the final 4 weeks. We would learn much more if the readings were shorter at the end of the term.",
                "Strengths: fascinating material and discussions. Weaknesses: the assignments were unorganized in terms of deadlines etc. We also only had grade back by the time classes ended (so it was difficult to track progress)."

It is definitely more about educational policy than classroom methods, which I didn't realize beforehand. Come to class with a thick skin, and you will be fine. If you want to contact Professor Stanley, go to office hours rather than email. If you are truly interested in philosophy itself or education itself, this may not be the class for you, but if you want to learn about U.S. education systems and curriculum, this will be a good class for you.",

It was really centered on education, and I think that made discussions less annoying (sorry philosophy classes). Readings were amazing. My mom even went to the library and got Soul's of Black Folk by Du Bois after I talked about it so much.",
