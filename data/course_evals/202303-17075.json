The course also focused on application of the facts that can be learned in a textbook onto real world scenarios through clinical vignettes and exam questions (that made you think critically about how to apply your knowledge on certain physiological systems).",

It'll go through most of the major bio content you will need for it including the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the kidneys, the endocrine system, etc. Would highly recommend if you don't want to self-study these concepts for the MCAT (though this class will go into more detail than is on the exam).",
                "Gained a lot of insight into the way that we function as humans",

            "comments": [
                "It is great that we can cover so many different systems in their complexity but simultaneously this is difficult because a speed is required to accomplish this that doesn't necessarily give time for the proper depth of discussion that would lead to clearer understanding of the material. The variety of teaching styles was also a little difficult to keep up with as we change professors regularly. A strength of the course is that the professors and TFs understand this and do as much as they can to accommodate us both in the grading of quizzes and exams.",
                "Too much information taught, cut it down by a few systems",
                "Strengths: This course covers a lot of material, rather quickly, however it also felt very relevant and interesting so it was exciting to learn about each topic. I think the TAs and Peer Tutors supported our learning well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is so much content that I wonder if having four exams rather than three would be beneficial. That way each exam has less content on them, and the fourth could even be given in the last week of class to avoid an exam during finals week. I do think that recording these lectures or providing old recordings would be highly beneficial to learning as I found the slide insufficient to review lectures that I had attended. Additionally, it would be helpful to have more clarity about grading cut-offs for undergraduate students.",
                "The class was well designed and delivered interestingly every time (especially for 9a), and the distribution go work was nicely allocated in a fair way (esp. with quizzes, section, and the exams). Im not sure if I have anything to say against the class or say that could be done betterthe class is a well oiled machine!",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of content that is very interesting. Lectures on endocrinology were a great example of how most lectures should have been taught-they were lengthy but clear and w/ interesting clinical vignettes. Probs good prep for med school. \r\nWeaknesses: Tests can be brutal and material overwhelming. Grad labs feel poorly guided and not super useful without proper explanations.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures and the discussion sections were super super helpful!",
                "Strengths: The textbook was very helpful. It is one of the better written textbooks that I have used and offered a lot of interesting facts that are not always covered in lectures. It is a great extension of lecture materials while also succinctly explaining key concepts introduced during lecture. The grading scheme for the graduate class facilitated hands on learning (during the discussion section).\r\nWeaknesses: While the exams were structured to be more focused on applying facts and the key concepts, there were still multiple choice questions and true or false questions that tested your brute memorization of the material. Sometimes, it felt like the multiple choice questions were intentionally worded for you to make a simple memory mistake.",
                "Strengths are the learning resources (slides, textbook, office hours, discussion section), the graduate lab section, and the quizzes as an opportunity to practice / test my understanding in a non pressure way. Weakness are the exams, which were often a time crunch and included questions that relied on rote memorization of facts, but alas, I guess that is the study of physiology / biology.",
                "weaknesses: lectures sometimes difficult to follow, final so much more difficult than midterms\r\nstrengths: best TAs ever, interesting content",
                "The strengths are the learning objectives which are listed at the end of each lecture. I would highly recommend being very comfortable with those as you approach exam time. The kidney lectures did not have any, so in the future, that might be helpful to have.",
                "Discussion section was a huge part of the course. It was a great review of everything that we went over in class, and served as a way to emphasize points that may have flown under the radar in lecture. I don't like the fact that I felt like I'd be hanging on for dear life if I didn't go to a discussion section for a class that already meets 3 times a week, so I feel like the lectures could do a better job of emphasizing key points but aside from that it was a fair course.",
                "I thought the course was really great in general. I wish the graduate labs were a bit more diverse than just running code on computers, but overall the information covered was really interesting and the course requirements weren't too harsh.",
                "I think the lectures are quite poor. The slides are impossible to study from. If you're someone like me who has auditory processing disorders or has quite simply never learned well in lecture style environment and prefers to learn through office hours and independent study, I don't believe I should be penalized for that. AND the fact that the lectures ARE recorded but not given is dumb. I feel like they are trying to make the class harder than it needs to be because it has that reputation of being a hard class. Its ridiculous that you get ONE shot at getting down the lecture material for a topic that is known to have loads of information. Physiology is not conceptually difficult. There is just a lot of information. so not having adequate study materials for outside of class just puts students at a disadvantage for?? what reason?? . it helps no one.",
                "conceptual focus was very strong, level of detail and speed was inconsistent between different systems - some felt too fast, others too slow, others incompletely covered and others too in depth.\r\nexpectations for level of detail on exams was unclear.",
                "Strength: the logic flow is good, and the concepts are good\r\nWeakness: Length of exam",
                "The organization of this class is good, and the teaching of professors and TFs is professional. However, I feel like there are too many things I need to focus on, I understand there are many points in physiology, but I still hope that we can focus on the most important things, for other things, we may study by our interests. For example, it would be great if all exams had required questions and selected questions like the final, the most important questions can be covered by the most important points, while other deeper questions can be covered by selected questions, and we can select the part of them to answer. Because it is really difficult to memorize everything in a week or even shorter time.",
                "This was a really great course. The strengths are that you really do get to learn a lot of physiology in one semester but it is a ton of information to really process and comprehend in one semester, especially for the exams. I feel like this course should be two separate classes. It often times feels like we jump from one topic to the next without a smooth transition. It becomes hard to keep up as the semester goes on and there is a lot of memorization you need to do, in my opinion, in order to do well on the exams. It would be nice to have the exams be open book as it'd be a testament that a true understanding rather than the ability to memorize is what's needed to do well on the exams.",
                "I would normalize the grading for quizzes across TFs. Although the TFs grade using the same rubric, some tended to take off more points for certain things than others.",
                "Weakness: No recorded lecture, difficult to review slides on their own. Would prefer if recordings were released a week before exam to encourage attendance but also provide opportunity for review.",
                "Strengths: The focus on applying physiological principles (not just memorizing facts). The lab section for grad students was very useful for understanding the underlying biophysics and definitely removed the pressure to do very well for exams. The weekly quizzes were very helpful in making sure we revised concepts regularly and got feedback on the areas we did not understand very well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course tries to cover too much content in the time we have. I appreciated the units where we did multiple lectures per system (lung, kidney, heart) as I was able to gain a deeper understanding. Some of the other lectures (like reproductive physiology) were important but very rushed, so maybe other lectures could have been cut to allow more time to expand on these topics.",
                "Strength: amazing professors and TAs who are very knowledgeable, kind, understanding, and willing to help you. They also listen to feedback and actually enact change in response. \r\nWeakness: first exam was long, but they fixed it immediately.",
                "The lectures were variable in quality. Some were engaging, but in others it felt like the instructor was just reading off slides that contained regurgitations of the text book material.",
                "Strengths: INCREDIBLY engaging content. VERY well taught with kind professors. Learning objectives are very helpful. Realistic expectations for students. A very challenging but rewarding class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Professors' office hours are all virtual which made them intimidating to attend. Would prefer to have had these in person.",
                "This course is very engaging and well taught. While the pace of the course is high as there is a lot of content to cover, the professors do a good job of clearly communicating each lesson and providing opportunities for students to seek help. Also, for students who are interested in medicine or are passionate about physiology, it is easy to put in the effort to keep up with the class. One thing I particularly liked about the course is that, by attending section, your grade on the weekly quizzes can be boosted to a 100% if you score above a 50%. This is helpful because it takes the pressure off of the weekly quizzes and allows you to view them more as a learning challenge/opportunity than a stressful assignment. The material in the course is already challenging, so having an opportunity to practice your learning in a low stakes context and then ask questions at your discussion section is very helpful and much appreciated.\r\nOne weakness of the course is that, apart from exams, students do not have opportunities to receive feedback on their learning. However, they can certainly seek feedback if they wish on the weekly quizzes, which is good.",
                "The course material is too much! If you take this course, intend it to be the primary focus of your semester.",
                "Strengths: Assignments were all helpful for studying material, Labs were super helpful in understanding information, Weekly quizzes were a great way to review material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: On quizzes and long answer exam questions it was unclear what answers were expected. Even if you were right and answered the question, you would only get all points if you psychically anticipate what terms would be included in the rubric. Maybe a word bank or more specific questions would be helpful if you continue to grade this way. We spent so much time on the kidneys and so little time on more complicated systems like sensing.",
                "This course had VERY comprehensive lectures with uploaded slides, which were helpful for review. I would have appreciated lectures being recorded as well. I loved having sections, as the TAs were very helpful in explaining concepts. More review sessions led by the professors would have been helpful.",
                "The main weakness of this course is the pacing of the lectures. Most of the lectures were rushed and the instructors seemed like they did not have enough time to cover all of the material they intended to. Overall, the amount of material that students must learn in this course is much greater than other undergraduate courses. This course would be greatly improved if a separate course was made specifically for Biomedical Engineering. This could help the course have pacing that is more appropriate for an undergraduate prerequisite, rather than a graduate or upper level undergraduate course. The course could also be improved by changing the weekly quiz assignments to facilitate students learning at the depth required for exams. The quizzes were typically broad and open ended, while the exams required students to show very detailed understanding. It would have been beneficial to have additional practice to help students prepare.",
                "Strengths: an amazingly comprehensive summary of our biological systems, save the immune system. You can tell that Saltzman and Campbell really care about making sure students understand the content. \r\nWeaknesses: I really wish this class were lectures of 75 minutes as opposed to just 50. Even though I never felt like I was learning meaningless content, we simply never seemed to have enough time to cover all of it, and at least half the lectures felt too rushed. The difficulty and format of the exams also differed quite a bit from exam to exam, something that definitely could have been improved to support the students.",
                "Lots of student support to facilitate learning."

This class is already very hard as is, but having Mark and Stuart as the dynamic duo + Peter for the renal classes makes the class much more bearable.

                "It is a very useful course, but I would only recommend this to students with a genuine interest in physiology (not meant for students who are just curious). Students would also need to be able to dedicate 4-5 hrs a week to studying and doing the weekly assignments-- it is not easy to take this course if you are unable to dedicate the time to it.",

The professors are also very good instructors and are clearly passionate about the subject, so they are happy to answer any questions you might have.",
                "Sure. It was really interesting and well structured. It is a lot of work, so I wouldn't suggest it for fun.",
                "This is a really great class to learn how the human body works. HOWEVER, there are greater issues to taking this course than just the high workload. You should also consider how many bio classes you have already taken. This is where everything comes together, so I would recommend taking it towards the end of your Yale career if possible.",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student who isn't required to take it. It is extremely challenging, and the course is not organized in a way that facilitates learning the difficulty of the material. For students who are more prepared for this rigor, I do think the course offers a lot of information on human physiological systems that could be very beneficial for those considering medical/pharmacy programs.",
                "Absolutely. However, the class is quite difficult and if it is not required for your major (as it is for BME), I might recommend taking it Cr/D/F to reduce some of the stress of taking it.",
                "Yes, if necessary or particularly interested."
