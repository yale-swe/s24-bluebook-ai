The readings were insightful and Professor Lombard was incredible with every lecture. I learned about the anthropological process and ethnographic research while digging deeper into the law that Americans value so dearly.",

                "I gained a lot of knowledge about the various ways in which law functions within the context of so many cultures. In the pursuit of legal reform in the United States, it is invaluable to have knowledge of the many ways in which law is carried out and it was so fascinating!!!!",
                "In class, we explored cultures & case studies around the world in order to gain a better sense as to what law exactly means to them. Each week, we are given a different world to explore through readings, documentaries, guest speakers or otherwise. Because of this, the class always felt like we were getting a global scope as to what law is, as opposed to an often-jaded American perspective of law, which I enjoyed.",

They were basically just 30 minutes of going over the readings, and then she would tell us a story from her own research experiences, and then she would ask us if we have questions, which few people every did. Also some of the readings were just very obscure, so it just wasn't an engaging course.",

Prof. Lombard is a compelling lecturer, and she evidently cares about students' understanding and success. She's responsive, accommodating, and instructive, and she makes efficient use of class time to get points across. I also thought the organization was particularly well-suited to an online format, especially the mode of assessment (participation, reading responses, and group projects rather than exams).",

The only two projects are group projects so you rely on others for a majority percentage of your grade which is frustrating.",

                "Professor Lombard is amazing and the teaching fellows were fantastic. The material is very interesting. The only think I will say is that the lectures and discussion sections sometimes felt disconnected. In discussion section we only discussed the readings and didn't talk about anything we went over in class.",

                "This course overall was very enjoyable; one weakness was that it started at 8 am for me.",
                "Since it was a medium sized lecture, it was easy to actively engage during class. I also enjoyed the reflection papers quite a bit. They allowed leniency in interacting with course themes and readings. As a person not familiar with law or anthropology, I always looked forward to sharing my view in these papers.",
                "Really interesting course!",
                "Unfortunately the virtual lecture format meant lectures were difficult to completely stay engaged with although Professor Lombard made an exceptional and appreciated effort to consistently engage the entire class. The response papers were a low stakes means to engage with the readings and I really did enjoy them. One thing however was that both large assignments were group based, while this did limit the total amount of work done, at times the group project felt difficult to showcase your own individual work and as such was very dependent on the work of everyone combined. I would rather have had one individual based assessment to balance things out.",

                "lecture had barely any slides with words on it - just was professor speaking, which often wasn't engaging enough",
                "I really like Prof. Lombard's lecture style she was always so engaged with the students and seemed so interested in all the topics. Maybe a different structure for section to facilitate more student engagement.",
                "The course is a great survey into the kind of work that overlaps law and anthropology, but I think it could've had a clearer structure lecture to lecture in what it was we were trying to \"get at,\" which I now know is a thing not all anthropologists do, but still--never really felt like we got near the answer as to how law was culture as much as we just posited a lot of different examples.",
                "The strength of this course was the fascinating material, wonderful Professor and great TFs.",
                "The group assignments in the course were fun and a great way to meet peers. I learned a lot from the people I worked with, and I think bouncing ideas off of each other in this way was very useful. The readings were interesting and engaging, and the professor's enthusiasm for cultural anthropology is infectious. The one improvement I would make would be to provide more consistent feedback. I had no idea how I was really doing in the class apart from emailed grades on singular assignments.",

I also appreciated getting feedback on big assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to see less group work on big assignments because working with people who are in very different time zones made it very difficult to get work done and feel like we are producing satisfactory work because we are all rushing to get it done at a certain time. I also would have liked more clarity around big assignments because I felt that was unclear a lot of the time"

Projects also had very unclear expectations and we didn't receive super detailed feedback on them.",
                "Yes definitely. It's a great introduction into anthropology as a discipline and Professor Lombard is amazing!",
                "I would recommend this class to any student interested in challenging their assumptions about how law works both in the United States and globally.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to others. The other students in the class are so incredibly nice, so you meet a lot of great individuals. Professor Lombard is fantastic and the TFs were both insightful and fun to work with during discussions. The class is overall a fantastic course to take.",
                "Yes, this course is great, informative, thought-provoking, all while not being a huge stressor or time sink.",
                "I would! If you have an interest in expanding your knowledge of law at a cultural level, take it!",
                "Yes. This course is an excellent choice for a novice in the field of anthropology who wants to be encouraged to relate personal experience and observations to the formation and execution of legal systems and laws. Professor Lombard is a delight and somehow always makes an 8am zoom meeting a thing to look forward to!",
                "yes!! amazing class and Professor Lombard is great!",
                "I would recommend this to other Yalies whether interested in law, anthropology, or neither. Its a fun way to explore history and law and get a good grasp of anthropology along the way.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. The content was interesting and the workload was 100% manageable.",
                "I don't think I would. One would have to be very very interested in the subject matter to stay engaged with the course and want to participate in lecture. I found it a bit boring.",
                "If they were interested in the topic, yes.",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course to someone who is very interested in anthropology!",
                "Yes, to any students deciding between anthropology and law especially this is a wonderful class. Lots of knowledge I would otherwise not have known, and Professor Lombard is great.",
                "A must class take at Yale. If you are interested in law school, it is a must take. If you are interested in how our society works, also a must take.",
                "Professor Lombard is absolutely fantastic. I woke up every Monday morning excited for lectures as the material was applicable to everyday life and always interesting. If you would like to have a further understanding of the legalization of life take this course!!",
                "Yes, I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in law, culture, and anything in between. I think it would be especially helpful for people going to law school in order to help them understand that the law is not black-letter, but instead a set of informal and formal systems such as shared values.",
                "No",
                "This course was great and I felt it was a good introduction to a small portion of sociocultural anthropology. I enjoyed thinking critically of law and culture and law as culture throughout the course."
