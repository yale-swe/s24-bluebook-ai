                "I got a lot better at French really quickly. This course focused more on grammar than vocabulary, as well as on speaking fluency. It definitely also made me work on study skills. The beginning of the course is a lot, covering about a lesson a day to review\/learn through L1. After those first few weeks\/month, the pace slows. There is a still a lot of work, but the amount is lessoned and there are more writings. This course gives a a test every two weeks, so six tests with the lowest score dropped and a final exam. There are also eight writings due throughout.",
                "I better understand French tenses that I had previously learned but largely forgot. My speaking skills and writing skills have improved a lot.",
                "This course acts as a somewhat intense refresher of L1 level french, followed by the entirety of the L2 level curriculum. I felt like it focused on making sure the basic grammatical structures were in place, rather than developing vocabulary. The course uses the French in Action method, which uses fun videos to teach the techniques. We learned how to conjugate verbs in present, future, imperfect, and past tenses, as well as in the conditional and subjunctive moods. We also learned grammatical constructions like conditional phrases and the immediate past and future. In addition to our grammar and vocab, we also practiced conversation in live talks with students from France over zoom. This was a great chance for us to apply what we were working on in class. We also practiced writing and speaking in several assignments, like compositions, a presentation, and skits.",
                "This class dives deep into French grammar, so I learned a lot about the French language. Many of the compositions also encourage creative thinking skills. The workload is quite high, so it's also good for honing your organizational abilities.",
                "During FREN121, not only that I learned reading, writing, listening and speaking french, I gained so much confident with my use of French. The classroom environment was so engaging and encouraging that made room for everyone to confidently participate in discussion and french interactions.",
                "I developed my French vocabulary, grammar skills, and pronunciation in a range of topics. I also learned about French culture, both contemporary and traditional.",
                "Lots and lots of french, especially thinking\/speaking in french",
                "In this course, I learned how to effectively study for language exams, focus on practicing my skills outside of the classroom through homework, and practicing speaking, and also became more comfortable speaking and writing french. I feel like after taking this course I can formulate well structured sentences and have basic conversations in french."

            "comments": [
                "One strength is the teacher. She cares very, very much about students learning and about students themselves. She is also just really good at teaching, gives gentle corrections, and keeps class going. The amount of work needed to get through the class is a weakness. Because the class is everyday, having an hour to two of homework each night is exhausting.  Sometimes you are also assigned daily homework when you have a writing due the next day or a test, which is tiring.",
                "Because we meet so often it is good for maintaining your engagement with the language and being taught in all French is helpful. That being said, i wouldnt mind meeting 4 times a week instead of 5 because 5 sometimes felt exhausting and made things less enjoyable at times.",
                "I think the course does an excellent job of covering a lot of material in a short time without seeming awkwardly paced or rushed. Also, the french in action framework is quite well designed, if a little out of date in terms of content. The fact that the course meets everyday also helps with repetition and cementing the concepts, as well as, of course, practicing speaking. \r\n\r\nI think there are a couple things the course could do better. I often felt that I didn't get quite enough practice speaking, since there were quite a few people in the class for such a short time every day. We did to a fair amount of small group work, but I think maybe even more of this would have been helpful to me. Lastly, I think a minor issue is that the French in Action videos do sometimes get into things that are too specific to be useful to us at the beginner level. However, professor Skorupa definitely knew to avoid lessons that did this to a high degree.",
                "Strengths: I learned a HUGE amount of French. In this one semester I learned three times as much as I did in five years of middle\/high school. The writing opportunities are numerous, and there are plenty of resources to practice anything you might not understand.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the videos make for a good learning tool to contextualize the new examples of grammar and vocabulary, I think a little too much emphasis was placed on remembering the plot of the story, rather than the concepts it teaches.",
                "Strength: \r\n1. Wholistic curriculum covering different aspects.   \r\n2. Many interesting activities, classroom assignments and tasks that fostered the communication and learning process. \r\n3. The teacher was so understanding and patient with everyone, a very encouraging trait when it comes to learning. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. More focus in grammar and less focus on vocabulary. \r\n2. Heavy workload.",
                "The strengths are that having class everyday makes learning a language much easier than only having it a couple times a week, and that there were a good amount of speaking components. The professor also did da good job of keeping everyone engaged by asking quick questions throughout the class. I'm not sure about a weakness.",
                "Lots of book exercises to hone skills, but they're honestly very helpful. There is a lot of work, but you will come out of it with improved language skills. Would be hard to manage if you don't have a want to learn the language",
                "The strength of this course is that there are many opportunities to engage with the language in and outside of the classroom. In class, the professor encourages you to participate and talk to your peers in french. Furthermore, the homework assignments were effective in helping us articulate our thoughts in french and learn the proper grammar. Although the assignments were long, they were very helpful and helped us imporve."

                "Yes, especially those who have some French knowledge, the pace of this course was good for those in this situation.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. It is an intense workload, but I think it is worth it for the increase in french ability that is acquired. Also, though meeting every day does have downsides, it does create some nice regularity to your schedule and facilitates getting to know your classmates and professor very well, which in turn helps to create a space where it is easier to feel confident practicing a new language. I also think the course is very well designed, with components that all build on each other and give a very solid education in reading, listening, writing, and speaking.",
                "It would depend why the student is taking the course. Of course, you need to place into French 121, so you already know some French. If you're looking to take French purely to fulfill a language credit, I would maybe suggest a different language. French classes have an extremely high workload. However, if you have a genuine interest in learning French, and you don't mind the high workload, then this class is wonderful and you will learn a LOT. It is not hard to get a good grade if you do the homework and study. Genuinely do the homework--do not skim it, or you will find yourself very confused in class, because most of the learning will happen through the videos and textbooks.",
                "Yes, definitely but also after explaining to them its workload challenges. However, it is really an environment that encourages language learning in a fast and effective way.",
                "I would recommend this course to any motivated students that want to learn French. However, I would not recommend this course for students hoping to casually learn a language without having a lot of daily work.",
                "I loved the class, but if you are on the fence I would consider another language. The department is intensive in its courses (for good reason, you learn a lot!) but you will only succeed if you are pushing yourself to keep up with the work.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is seriously looking to learn French. Overall this class was very fun and engaging, however, if you are not willing to put in the work then you may not have the same experience. In order to feel confident and prepared throughout the course one must practice and study hard. In the end it is all worth it!"
