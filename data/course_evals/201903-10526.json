    "I gained greater mathematical and physical insight into various model systems in quantum mechanics, such as particle in a box, harmonic oscillator, and hydrogenic atom. From this perspective, this is essentially a slightly faster, more math-based version of CHEM333. It went further as we also learned principles behind basic approximation techniques such as variational theorem and perturbation theory to a greater extent than CHEM333. Finally, we had cursory discussion of Hartree-Fock and some of the more rigorous methods used for quantum mechanical calculations.",
    "I learned the basics of quantum mechanics and a tiny bit toward the end about quantum chemistry.",
    "basically a review of quantum chemistry from second semester physical chemistry"

    "The class is essentially optimized with respect to what it hopes to accomplish. Professor Hammes-Schiffer is excellent and organizes things clearly. The problem sets are often fairly straightforward, yet insightful, and the workload is relatively light, especially compared to CHEM333. The exams are entirely fair as long as you understand the problem sets and the big ideas of derivations. Moreover, the textbook is good and she follows it fairly well. This lets you catch up if you miss or class or don't get something. She makes it very clear what you need to know and what you don't. This is very useful when the math behind many of these concepts can be extremely hairy at times. That, however, leads into one of the weaknesses of this course. While you don't have to know the math background, it certainly helps and some concepts are extremely difficult to understand without it. In particular, variational theorem and Hartree-Fock require intuition with matrices. She does her best to provide minimal details to prevent stuff alleviate this, but be warned",
    "The strength of the class is that Hammes-Schiffer is one of the only good chemistry lecturers, and I really enjoyed having her teach me. The biggest weakness was that the undergrads really struggled in comparison to the grad students, and it was very difficult to do well and understand the material. The midterm and final were quite hard in particular, and I felt way less prepared than the grad students going in."

    "If you want to be a computational or physical chemist, this is an absolute must-take. Its a great class to learn quantum fundamental. If you aren't a PChem person, but liked CHEM333 or are good at math, you will enjoy this course. This class also grades fairly nicely.",
    "Ultimately, I regretted taking this course. After the horror show that was CHEM 333 with Vaccaro, I was excited to take a class where I could actually learn the basics of quantum mechanics for the first time, since there was no way anyone learned anything in 333. However, since I was really underprepared from 333, this class was much, much harder for the undergrads than it should've been, and, since it was such a small class, I felt quite stupid. Hammes-Schiffer is a great lecturer and a really nice professor, which is incredibly rare in the department. While I do regret taking this class, most of the other Chemistry electives are atrocious, so it was kind of a losing battle no matter what you choose.",
    "It's a good elective to take if you want to review physical chemistry but it's honestly hard if you don't have a good foundation."
