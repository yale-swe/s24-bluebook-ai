You will by no means be fluent, but L1 Japanese will give you a strong basic introductory foundation.",

However, there were some things that worked within an online space better than others, and just due to the nature of the course, I believe it made the course a bit harder."

Also, it may speed up class to simply call on students, that way ensuring we all participate and everyone is given a chance to practice.",

Very high quality audio is necessary in order to discern nuances and pitch necessary for Japanese, so that is an area that needs improvement if this course is to be taught virtually again.",
                "One thing that I really appreciated was the ability to sign up for a language clinic appointment with a TF to further practice my skills beyond class time, since it helped with boosting my Japanese conversation skills slowly but surely. Another thing that made the course more accessible in this online space was how the professor treated quizzes and other assignments. Initially, we would take the quizzes within class, which didn't exactly work out as intended just due to the nature of zoom. So, she made the quizzes take home and we did them asynchronous to the class session within the time frame allotted, which was really helpful."

                "If they're interested in learning Japanese, then yes. This course will really teach you and give you a strong basic foundation for further study in the language. However, the workload commitment is high (not difficult, just a lot of work, because learning a new language takes lots of practices), so do keep that in mind.",
                "I would highly recommend taking this course to anyone trying to figure out what language they want to learn. While Japanese is definitely not a very easy language to learn, it is really interesting and fun to practice once you get down the basics, which is a what you focus on in this course. The online setting makes it more difficult and you will need to put in some extra legwork to practice on your own or with other peers in order to get better, but once you look past the difficulty, Japanese can be pretty cool to learn."
