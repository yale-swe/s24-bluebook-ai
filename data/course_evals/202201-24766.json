                "Lovely reading assignments and writing assignments. I always felt incredibly engaged with the work we were doing and seminars were full of interesting primary sources analyses, intimate discussions, and reflection.  No weaknesses!",
                "strengths: professor, readings, assignments\r\nweaknesses: none",
                "Strengths: I do like the structure of having to contribute discussion questions weekly and the series of small assignments. Additionally, I thought the readings were an amazing selection. If anything, Id like to potentially see more primary sources (if possible??) from women\/POC, but the class does quite a good job of representing these viewpoints in the secondary literature. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that students in the class were often quiet, leading to quite an uneven set of contributions (myself included... students like me sometimes talk a little too much in the silence!). I wonder if there could be smaller individual assignments (like maybe a 10 minute opener?) to engage more of the class more regularly.",
                "I felt like we jumped around a lot each week and sometimes it was hard to follow where we were going and why.",
                "Strengths: easy to communicate with classmates and professor and each week we had really interesting conversations and readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: seminar feels a bit long and draining sometimes. Some of my other seminars had a 5 min break in the middle of class, and I found this to be extremely helpful in terms of engagement and just resetting.",
                "Professor O'Donnell, her witty teaching style,  enthusiasm and expertly curated syllabus are the course's strengths!! \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses :)",
                "Strength - interesting material \r\nWeakness - lack of discussion among peers, it felt like everyone was talking to the Professor rather than each other",
                "Overall this was a very good class! I thought the readings the first couple of weeks were a little boring but for the whole rest of the semester, the readings and discussions were very interesting. I also think Professor O'Donnell is a great professor and was very supportive. I really enjoyed the topic and our conversation. I would've liked more feedback on our essays but that's a small critique."

She challenges them to think about course concepts in new ways and puts a lot of emphasis on historical skill development.",

                "Yes definitely. If you have taken classes like the History of Reproductive Health, then there is a bit of overlap but its interesting to apply and discuss this information in a seminar format. The seminar may have been very different if there had been more make voices, as our class was entirely composed of female-presenting students.",
                "Yes, absolutely, 10000%.",
                "Yes, I love O'Donnell. She's a great teacher. Highly recommend her.",
                "I would definitely recommend! Professor O'Donnell creates a really lovely classroom environment and I think the topic is very interesting."
