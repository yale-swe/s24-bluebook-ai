   "comments": [
    "I really improved my ability to communicate in Spanish.",
    "This course helped me develop better speaking, reading, and writing skills in Spanish. I learned much about grammar through reading and writing and am more competent at communicating in Spanish as a result of taking this course. I learned new, more advanced and specific, vocabulary with regard to many different topics. Through writing multiple papers, I learned how to communicate my thoughts and information in Spanish.",
    "Profesora Ramos-Ruano exudes energy and is truly dedicated to her students. Having her as a teacher was such a pleasure and is what made the course so helpful. I'm much more comfortable sharing my opinions in Spanish now than I was before. I do think there is a lot of homework that's just busy work, but overall, the readings and lessons will improve your confidence and ability to voice your ideas.",
    "This class was great practice for speaking in Spanish and discussing everyday issues. It also focused on oral and written compositions.",
    "The class helped stamp out a lot of errors in my writing and speech that I had picked up over the past few years.",
    "My skills in speaking, writing, and reading Spanish improved during this course. I also learned about cultural differences between the U.S. and Spain and about current issues facing the Spanish speaking world.",
    "Grammar review, vocabulary, Crnica de una muerte anunciada, debating skills",
    "I learned a lot of grammar and speaking skills, and close reading skills.",
    "My Spanish skills improved dramatically.",
    "I gained a new awareness of every weakness I have in my Spanish-speaking skills. I became more attentive when I speak and write. Additionally, I developed a more intense passion for the language, and hope to pursue it further in the future."

   "comments": [
    "The course was pretty comprehensive in my opinion, spanning a wide range of topics. Sometimes it felt like we jumped around a bit and the homework assignments were not always clear.",
    "This course is very strong in that it prepares students to be able to communicate in Spanish at a level that is pretty much all they would ever practically need. While it does not necessarily cover literary Spanish or more advanced academic studies of the language, it is a great course for those looking to master their ability to communicate in Spanish in a way that will be practically useful. To this end, the course materials are very pertinent and interesting and the assignments are well thought out and helpful. One weakness might be that the readings are often dry and use heavy jargon that is difficult to understand. The course could be improved by selected more relevant texts and videos, but this is just a subtle suggestion.",
    "Profesora Ramos-Ruano as a teacher added so much to the class, and the fact that it is a small seminar makes it easier for students to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts (which can often be intimidating when speaking another language). A few weaknesses were a few unnecessary homework assignments and the fact that it wasn't always clear which assignments were due.",
    "The class was occasionally unorganized, and it was not always clear what our weekly\/daily assignments were without an email of clarification form the professor.",
    "The course does well encouraging students to become comfortable with writing and reading in Spanish. However, more speaking practice on a daily basis would be helpful.",
    "Juliana is an amazing professor. Her personality, energy, and devotion to her teaching, her subject, and her students is extraordinary. I would like the course to have more of an oral practice component.",
    "It has a significant amount of work, but you will learn a lot!",
    "I appreciated how there were many different aspects of the class - we read, discussed, had mock debates, wrote, watched films, and learned about the Spanish-speaking world's history and culture. In my opinion, my speaking skills did not improve as much as my reading or writing skills, so in the future the course should shift its emphasis slightly.",
    "Strengths\r\n- incredible feedback\r\n- collaborative environment (small group)\r\n- energetic professor \r\nWeaknesses\r\n- not the most organized\r\n- syllabus assignment changes are made almost everyday \r\n- reading material may be too challenging at times"

    "Yes, Juliana made this course great! Her enthusiasm and care for her students made the class awesome.",
    "Definitely! If you feel comfortable having discussions in Spanish, it might be too easy for you, but if you still struggle with speaking with ease and accuracy, this course will help you immensely.",
    "Yes, this is a great class for any student interested in becoming conversational in Spanish.",
    "Highly recommended! Especially if you get to take this with Juliana Ramos-Ruanothe sweetest teacher you will ever have who gives extensive feedback to help you improve.",
    "Absolutely. The class was what I hoped it would be--a good course to improve my Spanish skills. the teacher was really what made it outstanding (Juliana Ramos-Ruano).",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If you want to learn spanish and receive feedback on your work, then definitely take this course!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend SPAN150. With such an energetic professor and intense course work, anyone with an interest in the language will excel. It truly deconstructs your speaking and writing, and helps you build them back up."
