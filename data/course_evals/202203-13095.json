                "this class gives a comprehensive study of america's greatest president, lincoln. you will read his letters and speeches, studying lincoln's rhetoric.",
                "I gained a more in-depth understanding of Lincoln the man and theorist than any other historical figure I can think of! I also learned a ton about the intellectual climate in the US in antebellum America, until Lincoln's death.",
                "I gained a broad and thorough understanding of Lincoln's political thought, how he expressed it in his writings (both well-known and not), and how he was viewed by several of his contemporaries. Having taken the class, I have a broader appreciation for Lincoln's complexity.",
                "Awesome deep dive into Lincolns political landscape, contemporaries and his own views and strategy.",
                "Intermediate knowledge of Lincoln, beginner experience in reading political speeches, improved knowledge of philosophical ideas throughout history.",
                "I learned how to process current political information by comparing it with what politicians did in the 1800s. I learned how to incorporate the post-Socratic philosophers into my thinking when doing an exegesis or evaluating a particular writing or speech."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: pulls from an array of sources to offer a full historical context of the issues discussed \r\nWeaknesses: too much reading to be meaningfully discussed in class",
                "Lectures are phenomenal as are, of course, the readings. While taught in a lecture-style, the class felt small enough that students could engage with the professor and the material in an seminar-style manner.",
                "a strength of this class is how much we learn in a single semester. you will read all of lincoln's major speeches and letters, and see how he is able to use his rhetoric to gain the hearts of the people. he is truly a masterful rhetorician.",
                "The readings were quite interesting, especially the writings by people other than Lincoln. The deep dive into Webster, Fitzhugh, and the transcendentalists fit nicely into the course. Professor Smith's lectures were also quite engaging, with frequent opportunity for questions, and he offered important historical context. Finally, the section allowed for extensive discussion about more particular aspects of the readings / course themes.\r\n\r\nI think the final exam was a bit weird. Why not have a third paper? Why the emphasis on identifying passages and authors? I get it as a reading check, but didn't the weekly response posts accomplish that? I personally am not a huge fan of memorization for a humanity / theory class!",
                "Too much history, more than half of each class was used to talk about persons and what they did, instead of motives and strategy. This class was literally a history class, at least with readings from Lincoln, and it reflected in the exam. Sections were a little too philosophical, not enough strategy driven analysis, just high level views.",
                "Overall, the course was strong and I was very engaged throughout. Professor Smith's lectures were routinely interesting and insightful, and I emerge from the course feeling that I have learned something.\r\n\r\nMy only feedback\r\n- I think the expectations for essays could have been outlined a bit more clearly. I think there were some discrepancies between the expectations outlined by Prof. Smith and the way that essays were ultimately graded.\r\n- Having a final exam AND a final essay due on the same day felt a tad overkill.",
                "I generally like the course. It's just so early in the morning that I didn't engage with it as much as I otherwise might have. Is it unreasonably early? Not really. But it does mean that some students, including me, will engage with it less.",
                "The professor has a poignant delivery that increases the value of this course. The TA was always well-prepared and guided the section discussions toward the stated goals of the course. \r\n\r\nOne weakness: Having a final exam and a final paper was a bit overwhelming."

                "If you have any interest in Lincoln, or political science/theory, or America (!), this is an amazing class to take -- Professor Smith is a phenomenal lecturer who cares very deeply about political theory and Lincoln himself, and you will learn a lot! Also a fun and somewhat unusual opportunity to take a class that is focused on a single individual and their work. Definitely a highlight of my Yale career.",
                "yes absolutely, this is a class that will help you become a better thinker and writer, just by virtue of seeing how abraham lincoln speaks and writes.",
                "Absolutely! Especially to anyone who thinks they understand Lincoln and/or the issues leading up to the Civil War!",
                "Yes, I would recommend the class wholeheartedly: it's a fascinating and thorough look at one of the most important figures in American (and arguably world) political history. Even for people less interested in political theory, I think there are valuable lessons to be learned, and I'm very glad I took the course. Just be prepared for a lot of work at the very end of the class, with both a final paper and a final exam (which requires lots of memorization).",
                "Yes for an essential opportunity to get into Lincolns head. All young leaders at Yale should take the time to go through this course and grasp at the essence of statesmanship.",
                "Perhaps. I wouldn't say it is necessarily the most important/useful relative to other courses I've taken at Yale. But it's interesting and well-structured to allow for students to engage and get out as much as they want.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I feel like I walked away from this course as a new, more enlightened, individual."
