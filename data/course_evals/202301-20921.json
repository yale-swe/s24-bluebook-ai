There is a bit of scientific writing in this class but since there isn't that much instruction on it and it's not terribly generalizable, the main skill you will be learning is just content knowledge and reasoning.",
                "I learned a lot about the anatomy of vertebrates and what classifies and separates each clade, as well as the reasons for many of these adaptations and the logic of how some of their functional systems work. It got me thinking about why animals look and are built the way they are.",

                "The end portion of the course felt a bit like an afterthought, and just had some of the most difficult concepts of the semester all crammed into the last few classes of the semester. Additionally, exams consist of mostly memorization-based questions, and based on the sheer volume of content in the course (especially on the final) it felt like more emphasis should be put on reasoning-based questions, and\/or the course should focus more on a smaller slice of content.",
                "strengths: Dr. Moyer! He made lessons really engaging and entertaining!",
                "Multiple-choice quizzes are just too difficult to have especially with the whole \"select as many that apply\", it just opens a bag of worms that leads to constantly second-guessing oneself. I would much rather prefer the whole exam to be open-answer questions, or diagram focused. I think it also tests our skills a lot more than multiple choice which is heavily dependent on one over the other",
                "The course is very memorization heavy, although Prof. Moyer did make an effort to highlight the functional relationships between different concepts. I think that the way assessments are structured pushes students to study more through memorization rather than logical thinking, which could be improved."
