I learned how to systematically identify and quantify design goals, and how to prioritize them based on consumer requirements. During the main design project, I got a ton of practice with CAD, using the software Onshape. It was a great experience of iterating a design until it was good enough, and of coordinating with teammates.\r\n\r\nNear the beginning of the semester, we had to dissect an old electric appliance and build a 3D printer. It was really cool to get to see the innards of those devices to see how they work.",

                "The format this course took for the pandemic was almost perfect.  Giving us 3D printers and having us just design projects by ourselves was an extremely valuable learning experience.  My one recommendation would be to change the design challenge prompt to be more concrete.  While I understand the idea behind having an extremely open design problem, I feel like it ended up really pushing us towards a design far more complex than should reasonably be expected from a course at this level.",
                "Having a 3d printer was a huge benefit, because it allowed us to quickly test lots of different ideas. Also, since I had the 3d printer, I ended up identifying and solving a few other small problems during the semester, which weren't directly connected to the class but built upon my design experience.\r\n\r\nAnother strength is the amount of hands-on experience that we got. I learned a lot from dissecting an old appliance and building a 3d printer, and from all the tinkering required to improve our design. \r\n\r\nIt might have been nice to get a little more guidance on how difficult our basic plans would be when we were thinking of problems to solve. Since it was still the beginning of the semester, it was hard to tell what would be easy and what would be very hard. That being said, the project ended up being reasonable.",
                "The strengths include the incredibly accommodating, helpful instructors and TAs. A weakness lies in the reliance on some things out of the students or departments control, such as when ordering items or shipping.",
                "The group projects were very useful as an introduction into 3D printing fabrication and the engineering design process as a whole. I appreciated that every student received a 3D printer, as they were very helpful for hands on learning. However, there was very little guidance for the group projects, and as a result a lot of the teaching of design concepts was put on the most experienced group member. In addition, the lecture material was often disconnected from the design project, and at times felt out of place."

                "Overall, I thought this class worked very well online. In terms of communication, we were able to accomplish everything through Zoom and Slack without too much difficulty, and since my design team was only three people, Zoom didn't feel much worse than real life. \r\n\r\nThere was certainly plenty of hands-on work in the class, even though it was remote. Getting the 3d printer was a great adjustment. It gave us a lot of flexibility to have constant access to the printer, which compensated for the lack of access to a machine shop. Also, the fact that we all had our own prototype meant that we could always be working on it, which I think is different from a normal semester.",

                "Virtual lectures were fine. Giving 3D printers to every student was great, as it enabled a lot of hands on learning despite the remote nature of the course. However, since all students had to leave campus two weeks before the end of the semester, access to the 3D printers became difficult for finishing the projects. Strict guidelines on the final result made it so that everything had to be finished early, giving only around 2-3 weeks for actually creating the project."

The design process was really hands-on in a way that many intro courses aren't, and it was nice that we were able to immediately apply most of the things that we learned in class. The main challenge for me was the workload. Once we started designing the actual prototype, both in CAD and then in real life, there was consistently a ton of work. It wasn't too bad, though, because the work was so different from most of my other classes. I assume that this also varies a lot depending on the project.",

As a result, a beginner will be able to learn a lot from the course, while more experienced students may not learn as much and may be overly relied upon to aid others in the engineering design project."
