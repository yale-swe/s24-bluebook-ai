It made you want to interact with the material and throw in your personal experiences too. No weaknesses I could even think of.",
                "As a survey-style course, the depth of engagement with any particular worldview was limited. I also wish more students in my class had participated actively.",
                "Strengths: TAs are very caring and enthusiastic, I appreciated the time they spent on the course. Weaknesses: Discussions could be a little dry.",
                "seminar style is a strength; weakness is the breadth / lack of depth of inquiry into each tradition",
                "strengths: discussion based, explores a range of perspectives, guest lecturers\r\nweaknesses: impossible to dive too deep into any one section",
                "The papers are a plus. I think they are a good time to sit down and reflect on what's valuable. I strongly disagree with the imbalance in the syllabus--this was a comparative religion course disguised as a general humanities, which made me very uncomfortable with contributing to discussion in class throughout the semester. There was also a lot of readings that were, for the most part, not illuminating at all--many times I found myself wondering why I was reading 70 pages of one sentence after the other saying why God is so great.",
                "Maybe better structured seminars for discussing the readings so there was no awkward silence.",
                "This course was great for facilitating interesting discussion and engaging in productive commentary on a variety of religions, practices, and views. I honestly do not have many ideas for improvement, which is a testament to the organization and depth of the course."

It helped me get a better sense of what I am looking for post-grad and Max was a huge part of the success of this class. He allowed for an open and free space for students to share their ideas and help each other learn, explore, and plan for what is to come in life.",
                "I would recommend this course! It is not a comparative religion and philosophy class, so if that's what you are looking for, you might want to take a different class. It is geared more toward understanding your own worldview than comparing others.",
                "Yes, with some hesitation -- I think the quality of this course depends on the quality of discussions in section, so you should definitely shop first and see if you enjoy the discussions first. I personally still enjoyed the course, but it wasn't as illuminating as I thought it would be, probably because many of the readings were hard to understand and our discussions of them were a bit surface-level. Max was a very kind and enthusiastic section leader though.",
                "Honestly it's very dependent on the section (leader + other students), but from my experience I don't think I would recommend it. I was warned coming into the course that it would be a lot of navel-gazing, but I decided to go for it anyway because I enjoy self-reflection; however, now I see what people meant. The discussions felt like they had very low stakes (i.e., completely theory and not practice-oriented in terms of what ideas might look like in our own life), and the organization of the course was such that we could not often get deep into the ideas of each tradition, instead skimming over major ideas at a surface level. Hyped but skippable course.",
                "yes. i always left the class with something to think about and definitely found myself thinking about and talking about topics we discussed in class. i feel like i have a stronger definition of my purpose in life after this class",
                "No as long as the syllabus is not made more secular. If you're a religious person you'll have a good time though.",
                "Yes! Great course for simply just learning and taking in information.",
                "Absolutely. As a STEM major, this was a welcome change in my course load. The readings were relevant and uniquely interesting, the essays had appropriate and entertaining prompts, and my TF was great at guiding conversation."
