                "This course provides an overview into the different theoretical approaches to \"populism\" studies, including historical perspectives and constructivist perspectives. But even beyond specifically analyzing the nature of populism, this course provides extremely useful insights into a variety of topics including US political history, European politics, and post-Marxist political theory. The essay assignments allow you to explore these different areas in more depth and pursue elements of populist studies of interest to you. Overall, I believe my understanding of debates in populism studies, as well as in various areas of history and left politics, improved greatly."

He is a hidden gem at yale.\r\n- Engaging readings that show a diversity of perspectives and writing styles\r\n- Very lively discussions that allow students to constructively criticize and challenge one another while keeping a very supportive community\r\n- Incorporation of videos and other multimedia elements into class",
                "The course was great. Professor Aslanidis is a great professor-- excellent job guiding the seminars, occasionally interjecting with his expertise, and supporting/engaging with the comments made by students. No real weaknesses.",
                "This course was great!",
                "I really enjoyed the readings. Sometimes the class discussions felt a bit more focused on summary of the readings rather than analyzing/debating them, but by the end we really got into a good flow of debating/discussing.",
                "Professor Aslanidis is excellent at moderating conversation in the class. He is very engaging, and you come to class wanting to participate because of the energy he brings. The workload is fair, and all of the assigned readings are worthwhile.",
                "Strengths: In-class discussions were excellent, feedback on papers was clear, papers themselves were a great opportunity to show understanding. Weaknesses: Readings could have been shortened to sections more relevant to discussion",
                "Strengths: The readings for this course were an interesting mix of political science papers, theoretical texts, historical analyses, and contemporary commentary. You will really get a sense of the ideological landscape in populism studies now and over time. You will learn to detect fallacies in arguments made about populism from all parts of the political spectrum, and how different political actors mobilize and characterize \"populism\" to suit their interests. Classroom discussions are always lively and exciting, and Professor Aslanidis does a great job balancing student discussion with his own input. Most of the class is led by student discussion, but Professor Aslanidis will guide the discussion and step in to provide useful context and background when necessary.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly can't think of many weaknesses of the course. If anything, I wish we would've spent a bit less time on US populism and more on Latin American & European populism."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about populism or who think they are populist themselves. However, they must be really committed to spending an entire semester doing a deep dive into a specific political phenomenon. If not, they will quickly find that the material builds and varies across regions and eras, but ultimately doesn't really go beyond the subject of populism. If that's something that interests you, take this course. Dr. Aslanidis is great and really wants his students to succeed!",
                "YES! If you are at all interested in politics and read the news, you need to have a better understanding of what populism means. This is a fun and engaging way to learn more!",
                "Yes. If you want to explore a deep dive into Populism, escape the noise associated with the buzzword, and evaluate the role of Populism in modern democracy, take this course. I came away from this course with new perspectives on majoritarian democracies, the degree to which the people should be trusted, modes of political strategy and organizing, and who truly represents the people.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student as it allowed you to explore an interesting phenomenon that is often portrayed inaccurately in the media. The readings and discussions were always engaging.",
                "This is a fantastic course for anyone studying political science, sociology, or any other related field. If you want to understand the theoretically underpinnings of movement mobilization, you should take this course. Plus, it helps to make sense of what seems to be the collapse of liberal democracy in the West.",
                "Yes! You'll perhaps be a bit more confused about populism than when you started, but that's the point. You learn about the misconceptions behind populism, and how various political scientists are trying to answer those questions.",
                "This was my favorite class I have taken at Yale. I would highly recommend it to both PoliSci majors and for non-humanities majors. It is very accessible to both. Professor Aslanidis is an awesome teacher.",
                "Would recommend if you are interested even a little in the subject of populism.",
                "Absolutely! If you're interested in studying political movements at all, I strongly encourage you to take this course. Populist discourse is a perpetual feature of politics across the world, and understanding what it is and how it is deployed will reveal much about politics in many different contexts. You will also learn to think critically about how history is written, and how theoretical understandings of populism serve different political interests."
