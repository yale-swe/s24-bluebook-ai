                "I learned a lot about Japanese and Yale history. Plus, I learned a lot about how to utilize all of our library resources, which is going to greatly benefit the rest of my Yale education.",
                "This class delves into the spirit of studying history. I find myself most appreciating the process of studying the lives of people of the past through the weekly viewing of archival materials. This includes delving into archival materials, looking into what information they provide and what questions can arise from them. From there, almost everything appears like a research paper. As for the subject matter itself, I have developed a interest in the lives of Yalies in the past. Because archival materials especially in the history we were examining surround the lives of Yale-affiliated people and Japan, we also appreciated the connection of how these materials got here. As I explained before, this class demonstrates what history is as a discipline, which helps me adjust as a non-history major."

In the future, it may be helpful to have one slide during each section with the readings we want to cover for that conversation and key people or events.",
                "The readings are quite formidable given there are a number of them and theyre quite long. I would have appreciated a ranking of which readings to do first / which are most important. Also, sometimes the weeks readings discuss multiple people, and it would have been nice to have had a little foreword or note on how the people are connected.",
                "The insights and brilliance of the team of Professors Shepherd and Botsman, the opportunity every week to browse through Yale's archival collections.",
                "Strength: we looked at archival material every seminar and learned how to use them.\r\nWeakness: our discussion was not always super in depth as much as I wanted it to be."

                "One thousand times, yes! Each week was a fascinating dive into the surprising connections between Yale and Japan, cleverly organized around inter-related readings and archival materials from the library's collection. You can't access for a more kind and insightful team than Professor Botsman and Professor Shepherd, who, between them, know so much about modern Japanese history. You don't need to be a specialist in either Japanese history nor Yale to appreciate and learn a tremendous amount from this class.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. The course is very interesting and unique from other Yale classes. Professor Daniel Botsman and Hannah Shepherd make the class interesting and very chill. You get to learn how to use archival material and write essays using them as sources.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students! Not only did I learn a ton, but the structure of the class created by Professor Botsman and Professor Shepherd really helps to facilitate growth in historical research and learning about Yale and Japan.",
                "I would recommend this course to students like myself who are interested in some shape or form in Japanese history. One the highlights of this course was that in class when we examined the history of Yale and Japan, we also examined the historical context--in other words the history of both Japan and Yale. In a way, this class was also like a crash history lesson of Japan--if you do the readings and think back to Japanese history. Of course, this does not supplement any courses on Japanese history, but it was nonetheless interesting and cool to see those connections in the archival materials. Also, the people who help teach this class but are not listed in the course registration are cool and you should meet them."
