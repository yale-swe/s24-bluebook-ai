Discussion centered on individual and mutual obligations, particularly political obligations like voting, obedience to the law, and taxation. Frequent discussion of collective action problems and recurring motif of life narrativism. Insights into the complexity, and according to some authors, impossibility of moral duties of citizenship. Questions of how best to contribute to the common good."

                "Strengths: this was really just an excellent course with many, many strengths. Jeremy is a great professor and talking with him and the class about these topics was incredibly rewarding. The syllabus was superb, with a ton of interesting and accessible readings. I particularly appreciated the fact that we returned to a topic for a second week after a three week interlude to discuss something else. Getting to see how those topics worked together was really fun, and I wish more professors gave us the chance to do that. I also just appreciated how a course on essentially moral philosophy didn't have anything that abstract. Everything we discussed and read felt like it had a palpable impact on how I want to engage with society. It's just so rare to find a philosophy course that feels so down to earth. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any glaring ones. There were some topics I wish we'd gotten to, but if that's a weakness, it's only because I thoroughly enjoyed discussions in the class.",
                "The syllabus is very well-designed. There are many topics, such as voting, tax, and philanthropy, that are less commonly studied as philosophy classes. The readings are interesting and not too heavy. The discussions are always well-organized and thought-provoking. There is no major weakness.",
                "I really loved the course.  The strengths were Jeremy as a teacher - he selected great reading, made interesting points about them in class before we all discussed them, and encouraged discussion well - and the small class of interesting students.",
                "well structured. asking the questions before class was helpful to make sure we had all thought about it properly before. I wish some of the units werent split up though (eg two weeks of voting, then some thing else, then another week of voting? a little disjointed).",
                "Strengths: Focus on contemporary authors, well-represented debate between proponents and opponents on most issues, interesting choice of weekly readings and excellent choice of books (Why It's Okay to Ignore Politics and Winners Take All). Manageable midterm paper and useful weekly discussions.\r\nWeaknesses: Some topics not represented in syllabus (i.e., civil disobedience, national service)."

                "I can't recommend this--or any course with Jeremy--enough. I am one of several philosophy majors in the course who think it was among the best philosophy courses we've taken at Yale. The classroom environment was excellent, the topic was engaging, and the professor was a joy to work with. It's also just an excellent way to think through topics that affect Yale students a lot as we're choosing how we want to spend our lives. The unit on philanthropy really forced us to confront whether that's a good way to effect change, for example.",
                "I would recommend taking a course with Jeremy if one ever gets a chance. It is very possible that this course will not be offered again, in which case it would be a loss to students who will not have an opportunity to take it. This is a very well-designed and well-organized course that touches on a lot of practical issues in our engagement with the state and others as citizens. I learned a ton from this class and it also changed my personal opinion on at least a few issues that were discussed.",
                "Absolutely. The course material was fascinating and expertly curated. Really enjoyed the way the course built on itself.",
                "Yes!  I really enjoyed being in a class with Jeremy and especially a seminar.  The readings are really great and the reading responses were a helpful motivator to do the reading.",
                "YES! super interesting, and accessible too",
                "Absolutely. This is a Philosophy course that links political and moral philosophy, ambitiously asks students to engage in contemporary debates, and opens questions of moral duties to fellow citizens rather than universal principles. And if voting and political action are important to you, as they are to many of us at Yale, this course will challenge you to explain why."
