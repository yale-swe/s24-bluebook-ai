I have much better grasps on the materials after she talks about them in seminars. She is also good at facilitating discussions so that everyone can contribute. I think the discussion starter is especially helpful. No major weaknesses.",

                "strengths: Prof. Thompson is an incredible professor who is very knowledgeable; the texts are fascinating; youll definitely get a lot out of it if you engage even with only 50% of the texts\r\n\r\nweaknesses: constant heavy workload",
                "Small class is good",
                "There were no weaknesses!  This was a terrific class!",

The weaknesses were definitely related to the online format of the class, which I believe prevented the class from having the dynamic it could have had if we were in person.",
                "Strengths: student-driven discussion with sufficient input from the instructor, texts often put in conversation with each other, wide variety of viewpoints studied\r\nWeaknesses: paced a bit too fast to fully delve into the material, could have applied material to contemporary issues more",

Despite its large workload, I think this course thoroughly prepared me for any political science courses I may take in the future, and helped me to become a better writer.",
