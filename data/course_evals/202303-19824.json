                "A strength of this course is that it is fairly easy to complete the coursework. However, a weakness is there is a pretty constant stream of deadlines and assessments in this class, which can be quite overwhelming at times. The nightly homework on supersite can be very annoying but with two attempts on each assignment it is not awful. Another weakness is that the content from the homework is not often focused on during class (at least during my section); it often felt like we were expected to fully know concepts after learning them the night prior which made this course frustrating at points. Otherwise, I felt like the writing compositions and in-class exams were pretty fair; definitely not incredibly easy but basically representative of what we've been learning.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially a first-year, looking to begin a language to fulfill the language requirements. It is very straightforward as far as grading, assessments, and expectations go. Be mindful there is a fairly large workload, but it is pretty manageable if done first semester, although you may have a few late nights of work if you're a bit pressed for deadlines.",
                "Yes, for people who are just beginning to learn Spanish, this is a great course. I loved that I was able to get instant feedback from my professor and that we had the opportunity to practice our Spanish in LinguaMeetings, in class and through the VHL site.",
