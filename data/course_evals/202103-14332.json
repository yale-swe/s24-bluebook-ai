                "Philosophical analysis, reading efficiency, how best to contribute to philosophical discussion, and how to manage academic stress. The material wasn't too overwhelmingly difficult to understand so discussion and analysis were easy to learn in conjunction with the text and concepts.",
                "Taking this course helped me practice identifying, understanding, and evaluating/responding to arguments in philosophical texts with rigor and precision. I developed a broad knowledge of the early Western tradition of philosophy from Plato to Aquinas.",
                "I learned to write clear and cogent arguments and consider reason over rhetorical style.",
                "Ive learned how to combine philosophical argument and the history of philosophy to better understand the development of western thought.",
                "This was a great course. It is hard to describe the knowledge and insights I developed, as I learned (on a basic level) all of ancient philosophy. But suffice to say I learned a  lot. I believe the most important skill I developed was being able to read philosophy. It is definitely a skill to read through and be able to understand the dense, complicated passages we are assigned, but by the end of the class I felt much more able to push through them and come out with a basic understanding. I also grew more confident in my own philosophical analyses. By the end of the semester, I felt confident criticizing the ideas of ancient philosophers, and the professor encouraged this.",
                "With Professor Della Rocca (\"MDR\") - and his handy chalk, bag, table, chair, and other workaday items - I (who had not taken philosophy before and was pretty skeptical of what I could learn) was able to come to an understanding of how philosophy has relevance to the inquisitive and well-lived life. MDR is an excellent seminar leader and is an expert at drawing out the larger underlying questions, as well as masterful at presenting complicated material in simple ways. (I particularly enjoyed the list of twenty things a skeptic could doubt! Really brought home Sextus Empiricus to me as unlike MDR, I believe that the Beatles' best song is Day in the Life.)",
                "This course vastly expanded my knowledge of ancient philosophy and introduced me into a whole new world of thought with the expansive overview of works that it covered.",
                "I developed in-depth knowledge of the philosophers we covered over the course of this semester and their arguments/work. I developed skills of understanding and critiquing different styles of philosophy and argumentation. I learned to compare different writers and their particular premises/conclusions in a way that better allowed me to understand the trajectory of \"western\" philosophy",
                "Grasped how asking questions about philosophy shows the true of a school of thought",
                "As someone with no previous experience studying Philosophy, I developed a solid foundation of the fall DS philosophers in this course. Professor Della Rocca communicated the philosophers' stances very clearly and made their philosophy feel applicable and relevant to my twenty-first century life. Professor Della Rocca also taught us how to write philosophical essays and how to reconstruct philosophical arguments.",

                "I felt at times that the foci of discussion were somewhat minute in relation to the overall purpose of the texts and would have appreciated more structured guidance of discussion from the professor, but overall my section was engaging and helpful for understanding the material. MDR's office hours were also extremely helpful in regard to clarification and essay feedback, especially compared to the feedback I received in writing on my assignments. Ultimately though I felt I was always able to achieve a solid understanding of the material and gained a lot of interesting philosophical insight and inspiration.",
                "I wish that the seminar had been more structured, but I liked the class discussions and debates. I wish I had known most clearly what would be discussed in seminar to help me in preparing.",
                "This class is a wonderful survey course but it its a bit rushed (even for DS).",
                "This was a great course with many strengths. It was a great introduction to philosophy, giving you a pretty deep look into the thoughts of all of these brilliant old philosophers. While the weekly essays were tough and exhausting, this requirement definitely helped increase writing skill and work ethic. Classes were also fun, being focused on debating the ideas, but this, I believe, was the one weakness of the class. I wish that the professor had used more of the time to explain his own thoughts on the topic, which he had developed over decades, rather than just allowing us to use the whole class debating the points ourselves. I feel that I missed out on some of his thinking, and I was always happy when he did critique a philosopher himself or deeply analyze the pros and cons of a particular philosophy.",
                "It felt as though we spent a disproportionate amount of time on Aristotle and Plato and went quickly through some others, though I'm not sure how this could be fixed, as our discussions on those two philosophers proved crucial to understanding the following philosophers. It felt as though sometimes we veered off topic, but for the most part, the Professor did a great job of balancing discussion and explanation",
                "Strengths, Professor is extremely humble and excited to talk philosophy, professor cultivates a welcoming question-asking environment. Could be improved by connecting the convoluted, complex arguments in some more challenging texts to the main points we debate in class - focus on reading philosophy.",
                "Although we could not spend as much time as I would have liked to on the philosophers we studied in the second half of the term, it was very gratifying to study for finals and realize just how many philosophers we'd covered and how we could track changing views about free will, etc. over the course of the semester. It sometimes felt difficult for everyone to have time to participate in every class, but Professor Della Rocca did a very good job of trying to get to as many raised hands as possible and our class discussions were always engaging and dynamic.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Della Rocca, intertextual connections/conversation, liveliness of discussion, rigor\r\nWeaknesses: lack of writing guidance (although Prof's comments were helpful): could be helped by better DS writing workshop(s) where they actually instruct us how to write a philosophy paper instead of crowdsourcing guidance",
                "This course was excellent in introducing philosophy in an exciting and accessible manner.",
                "Very engaging but a few too many people. It was hard to have discussions and the final exam seemed to contradict the purpose and edict of the program.",
                "This course was great as an intro to a lot of philosophers. I would like to have spent less time on Plato and Aristotle and more on the other philosophers. The class really improved for me when halfway through the semester we switched to a larger classroom with the desks arranged in a circle -- it became much more engaging."

                "I would recommend this course to students who find argumentation and logical analysis interesting, and who are highly comfortable with reading and writing.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was a crash-course in ancient philosophy, giving you a surface-level (yet comprehensive, with the insight of the professors') view of an entire epoch in philosophy. My professor was also great. You could tell he knew everything about what we were teaching, and was able to out-argue students in support of the positions of any of the philosophers we read. Like Maimonides, who said we could not fathom God but received only images/analogies of him, so I felt that my professor was only giving us a glimpse of his philosophical knowledge.",
                "Most definitely! Professor Della Rocca is an excellent and insightful teacher, at home with himself and gently self-effacing in such a way to make learning incredibly fun. As I wrote above, \"With Professor Della Rocca (\"MDR\") - and his handy chalk, bag, table, chair, and other workaday items - I (who had not taken philosophy before and was pretty skeptical of what I could learn) was able to come to an understanding of how philosophy has relevance to the inquisitive and well-lived life.

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It provides a fundamental basis of western thought and does so in an engaging manner that makes one think not only about what it means to live a \"good life\" but also ponder the metaphysical questions of life and how we should approach them.",
                "Yes. My ability to think about the world and critique argumentation has drastically improved--not to mention my fundamental knowledge of philosophy",
                "Yes, MDR is a lifetime philosopher and his enthusiasm is contagious",
                "Absolutely! Professor Della Rocca is clearly extremely knowledgeable about Philosophy, but he doesn't just lecture during class; he makes classes conversational and encourages our random examples and questions, while still steering the discussion to cover key points. He makes old philosophical ideas feel interesting and he also has a lot of great, random stories and funny examples. He also offers an abundance of office hours and gives very helpful essay feedback.",
                "Yes yes yes! I am a huge fan of DS, and Prof. Della Rocca in particular.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anybody who has the opportunity to take it, regardless of whether they have an interest in pursuing philosophy further. This is an excellent opportunity to engage with the fundamental questions of the human experience within a supportive and highly engaging instructional setting.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend the course if you want to study the evolution of western philosophy and understand philosophical concepts. Just don't expect there to be one philosopher who figured everything out."
