So ideally there could be fewer readings during some weeks which ensures the depth of the discussion, and Prof Adams could intervene or guide the discussion more.",
                "Interesting materials, and the professor is really kind and engaging. The discussions can sometimes be dull, but maybe it's just because it's a 9am.",
                "One of the greatest strengths of this course is the selection and order of the texts. By picking engaging and thought-provoking texts in a somewhat chronological order, we were able to continually make connections between the texts and expand our understanding.",
                "I liked the blog set up of the course, the format for class discussions, and the variety of the texts we read. My main complaint was that the volume of reading was too much to possibly read, so I often felt so overwhelmed I would end up reading less than if there was just less reading. If the readings were a little more contained/less I feel like I would be able to focus in more and offer more to class discussions!",
                "Strengths are the professor, the content, and the blog post format. Truly there are not many weaknesses of the class. I think that although the turnaround for blog posts is tight (pretty much within 24 hrs of the leader's post), it keeps the class engaging because we can reference each other's posts during class and was personally a nice accountability mechanism.\r\nWeakness may be that the reading quantity is pretty substantial. As in, after the first week we frequently were assigned over 200 pages per week--this means there's often a lot of content to cover during discussion, which might not directly reference the reading as well. I think the work is still very manageable, though, but I probably could have skimmed less and read them more in depth throughout the semester if not for it being easy to push doing the readings over the weekend + balancing workload from other classes.",
                "strengths:\r\n-the readings were interesting\r\n-the professor was clear and organized\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n-the readings were too long\r\n-the class structure was the same every time which led to a disengagement"

I actually think the class is made better through the inclusion of non-sociology majorsit was so exciting to hear the perspective of students in different disciplines. Professor Adams is amazing. Not only is she a fantastic instructor and deeply passionate about the material, she is abundantly kind.",

                "yes!",
                "YES! It s an excellent way to learn about sociology and modernity regardless of your level of familiarity with the discipline. There really is no barriers of entry, and what you make out of it depends a lot on your personal interest and level of engagement. It is a relatively low stakes way to learn about works by arguably the majority of the most important thinkers in sociology, and at the end of the course you would feel like \"modernity\" seems to be more under your grasp!",
                "Yes!",
                "This class is very well-organized and well taught, so if you are willing to critically engage with the texts and the in-class as well as the blog discussions, there is truly a lot to gain from this class.",
                "I would! I think it's a fun and engaging course, where you will learn and think a lot. And Professor Adams is the kindest!",
                "Yes; Prof Adams so welcoming and great at leading discussion. The work is engaging but not stressful, and there is so much to gain from the readings and discussion with other students in the class. The scope of the course--a things leading to modernity--feels really broad at first, but over the course of the semester I think the readings and discussion eventually narrow our focus of things to some common topics / throughlines, which is really cool experience.",
                "I would only recommend this course to another sociology major. I think it is interesting to anyone but most relevant to sociology majors. I think if you're not interested in the material you could become disengaged by the class structure."
