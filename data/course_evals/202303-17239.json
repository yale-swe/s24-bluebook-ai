                "Too much workload and content, so many papers to study and understand different topics, there was no reason to cover so many things, he did not concentrate on basic stuff. In each lesson, a different topic was introduced and the explanation was not so intuitive and expainable.",
                "There is too much information in one lecture and too fast to keep up.",
                "The course is quite interesting and new. I think this area will be prosperity in the future and I'd love to know more about it\r\nToo many knowledge points for a one semester course, can't go deeper into the models\r\nThere is little correlation between HW and course knowledge, I can still finish them if I didn't know much about the course.\r\nThe coding assignments can't keep up with course progress.",
                "This course is definitely more about breadth than depth. Much, much more material is covered in lecture than is ever used in assignments - this made it feel a bit difficult for me to truly understand some of the more complicated points of each lecture, since we would never explore them in any concrete way. The material itself is fascinating - I'm beginning to try and frame every machine learning problem in a graph structure!\r\n\r\nThere is pretty good staff support, but every single homework contained errors that were later corrected - the homeworks are usually released late anyways, so this quickly becomes frustrating. I imagine this will improve through future iterations of the course as the material becomes a bit more solidified.",
                "The course is very well taught and the slides are very clear. You could learn the content almost purely based off the slides, and the Psets teach you as you do them.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Ying is a great lecturer and extremely bright. The lecture slides are really well put together and easy to understand. The assignments and colabs are graded generously, which helps you stress less about them and focus more on learning. Overall really great class, no cons.",
                "Strengths: This is a state-of-the-art course, as it covers graph structured deep learning techniques, which are increasingly useful in today's AI domain. Also, it is a big plus that it offers both a mathematical and a (basic) programming understanding for these. Furthermore, I think that it includes information about almost everything in this Graph-AI area, offering an opportunity for someone to dig in if they want to.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As it covers almost everything under the sun for this Graph-AI domain, it offers very little information and insights on each subsection, making it very difficult to follow through and understand in depth. It would be better if the syllabus was reduced a bit more, so that the more \"important\" sections are covered better and more in depth, while limiting the more \"advanced\" sections in only a couple of classes. Also, as the size of the workload was especially large, it was hard to understand every thing that was asked, while struggling to complete the assignments in time.",
                "Reduce the amount of content by ~20%. Respond to Ed discussion posts (especially leading up to the final exam!). Focus on a handful of concepts rather than trying to cover every recent advancement.",
                "Prof is super knowledgeable, independent project is definitely a plus since you get hands-on experience, lectures, content, and class overall are well-organized. Lectures are dry at times. I think having two midterms each covering half of the material instead of one final covering everything could have encouraged me to keep up more with the lectures, since homework usually doesnt require lecture knowledge. I wish final tested knowledge more instead of being mostly brute force computation.",
                "It is an excellent course. I just think that the last coding assignment was much more challenging than the previous ones for a student without a CS background like myself.",
                "Lectures are thorough, but for some topics (especially early in the semester) it was difficult to understand how they all fit together.\r\nProblem sets are helpful for understanding the material, but they could have started sooner. Some topics were covered by lecture weeks ahead of homework practice.\r\nThe course exam was substantially longer than the previous year's, but I gather that the course continues to improve with each offering.",

                "good content",
                "Strength: very up-to-date and novel\r\nWeakness: too many topics to cover and not all topics are discussed in depth. Pacing is a bit too fast",
                "Strengths: very useful, reasonable workload, suitable for GNN beginners.\r\nWeaknesses: To many content and slides in each lecture and some overlap between. I hope they can be distilled and have a summary or review section to get the overall logic of the course.",
                "This is an excellent course! It covers a huge amount of material, all of which is highly relevant to the current state of the field, and the assignments are structured such that they reinforce the concepts from class without putting an enormous workload on the students. I found that the homework assignments and colabs complemented each other nicely, and I think this was a good structure overall. I liked that the course was based around a final project, as this encouraged real-world applications of the concepts we had discussed in class. The lectures moved quite quickly, but I actually think this was a good thing, since it allowed for much more content to be covered in the course, and the availability of the lecture recordings allowed for students to go back over things they may not have fully absorbed the first time. My only real critique was the use of a closed-book final exam: I certainly understand the necessity of having a final exam to encourage students to review all of the material, but since in any real situation students will have access to notes, at the very least I think an in-person, closed-Internet, open-book final would be more relevant.",
                "I liked it and i liked how chill the workload is while material still super interesting",
                "contents are very useful, but the teaching skills can be improved.",
                "The lectures are very well organized, but sometimes the pace was a bit too fast.",
                "The written assignment is not very related to the course materials taught in class.",
                "Strengths: the material is really interesting, and Rex does a great job of explaining why certain methods have been developed and how everything connects to each other. As a non CS major who doesn't like too much theory, I actually found the hw assignments to be pretty chill and mostly doable on my own. Also, the slides are amazing and have all of the material he talks about so you don't really need to take notes. Weaknesses: there is SO much material its crazy, and he has to go extremely fast through the slides. He said the final was lightweight but you definitely need to study a lot since there is so much material. The good thing is I think he grades chill.",
                "Organized, low-stress environment which encouraged learning",
                "There's too much content in the course",
                "The concepts are super interesting and cutting-edge, as they are directly taken from cutting-edge research papers. However, this also means the concepts can feel a bit scattered, and Prof. Ying throws a lot of miscellaneous papers/concepts at you without diving too deeply into any single one.",
                "It offered a very comprehensive map of GNN related knowledge, many of which are relatively new and up-to-date.",
                "This course covers a lot of topics in graph learning, and it can be challenging to follow the entire lecture. The written and coding assignment help me to understand the course material and TA office hours are very helpful.",
                "Strength: course doesn't require lots of prior ML experience (lectures review ML concepts), PPTs are very well organized, Professor Ying is a pioneer in the field, GNNs are a very modern and relevant topic in industry, final project is great for cumulative understanding\r\n\r\nWeakness: PPTs are on the longer side, so lectures may feel rushed at times",
                "Strengths: all the material is broken down into digestible and engaging graphics. all lectures recorded and available on zoom  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: i didn't learn anything about coding from this class at all (more of a theoretical class). Also grading was inconsistent w/ the HWs"

                "Depends. Good survey of GNNs and knowledgeable prof, so def useful if you want to do ai research. However, feel like knowledge learned here is highly specific with little generalizability to other areas of cs.",

You can learn a ton if you want, you could also get by just understanding the basics probably.\r\n\r\nThis course is also probably better taken as a second AI/ML course. I'd recommend many students to take it because it covers a field of ML that isn't really taught in other courses, and it does so in a very very thorough manner.",

                "I would absolutely recommend this course! It's highly comprehensive and extremely modern-- I'm confident that the material two years from now will be significantly different from what was covered this year, and that's a good thing which speaks to the fast-moving pace of AI research overall. Anyone with an interest in graph-based ML could not have a better course for getting up to speed on a wide variety of methods and applications. My only caution would be that students should have a genuine interest in the topic -- the course necessitates spending time carefully thinking through the (fairly complex) subject matter, so someone who isn't actually interested may not enjoy that aspect.",

I'm not a CS major and didn't meet too many of the prereqs, but I enjoyed the assignments and the material was engaging since it covered so many new topics. I feel like this would be a much more enjoyable class than Deep Learning with Applications, since it also covers deep learning but is not as difficult. The only thing I would say is plan your time because the class ended a little hectic.",
                "Sure, great way to learn about processing graph data",
                "Yes. If you are vaguely interested in deep learning, I think this is a cool intro survey course on various topics; however, if you are looking for a more structured and rigorous approach to deep learning, I would consider taking the other introductory courses instead. The course takes on very complicated concepts, but feeds them to you in a very surface-level and basic manner-- the lectures seem very scary, but the problem sets often end up being basic matrix multiplication and the coding assignments are very short.",
