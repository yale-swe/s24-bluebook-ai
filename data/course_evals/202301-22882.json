Class structure was highly interactive, allowing students to incorporate their own experiences to enrich class discussions.",

I also really appreciated the time Sophie took to focus on a specific writing tool/structure when we were working on our papers.",

Fun discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings are a bit dense, though that was only for the first 2-3 weeks of class.",

I was in office hours a good amount, and the conversations I had with Sophie about my writing style, the structure of my essays, dissecting particular paragraphs, etc., was the most feedback I'd ever gotten on my writing. Also, I really enjoyed the topic of this class and the way the curriculum was structured to hit a lot of different aspects of the topic (e.g. historical beauty standards, plastic surgery, men vs. women, representation in art, etc.) because it helped me feel like I got a very holistic overview of \"beautiful people.\" Additionally, as a very dedicated STEM major, I'm generally less excited about English/humanities requirements but I was always happy to attend class and, if anything, this class really demonstrated the value of distributional requirements.",

It is a wonderful opportunity to ponder and explain the beauty industry and societal stereotypes. The content is highly applicable to student-life and provides unique insight into our interactions with aesthetic conventions  it is also fun and quirky (we examined Calvin-Klein underwear advertisements, makeup palettes, and Beyonc music videos)!",
