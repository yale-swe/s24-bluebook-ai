But otherwise, this course was essentially centered around knowing the facts and the same facts were tested on  the exam. The topics covered were really interesting - we learned about ovulate maturation, IVF, reproductive assisted technologies, hormones and their actions, and we did some clinical studies as well.",
                "I learned so much in this course, on a wide range of topics since the class covers a huge range of material.",
                "Learned everything related to reproductive anatomy and reproduction in general. Content was super interesting and spanned a wide range of topics. Content also seemed relevant to certain MCAT topics.",
                "I learned SO much- I had zero familiarity with reproductive biology so most information was entirely new to me. I wouldn't say I developed any particularly new skills, it was more so just a lot of exposure to topics I had never learned before.",
                "knowledge about the reproductive systems, how reproductive systems develop in utero, the processes of fertilization, pregnancy and birth.",
                "I believe the class is a great class to take as a pre-med because various med school Professors teach you. You learn various aspects of the reproduction process, and the exposure to med school lecturers is great. You brush up on your memorization skills slightly as well.",
                "I learned fundamental scientific principles of reproduction, from egg development to parturition and everything in between.",
                "I learned a lot of necessary information about reproduction and what I can do to take care of my health.",
                "Many specific real world applications of the topics we studied.",
                "a lot of interesting knowledge about reproduction biology",

            "comments": [
                "a relatively easy course but quite messy and disorganized",
                "Strengths: straightforward lectures, interesting professors, great teaching team \r\nWeaknesses: can be hard to study for tests that seem very memorization based",
                "Most of the weaknesses of the course comes from the format with all of the visiting professors.\r\nStrengths -- Nice to have each lecturer present on something they are so familiar with and passionate about, especially when MDs present on research that overlaps with their clinical work. Even without real central organization, communication from Prof Guller and TFs was clear. Teaching fellows and review sections were fantastic. Assessments and grading was fair, and open note exams was definitely the best way to test understanding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- Made it difficult to have continuity between lectures and in each class we had to adjust to a slightly different teaching style. This was especially hard with the format of slides -- some were heavily image-based or schematics that then had no good way to review or ask follow-up questions in class. This was a bit frustrating but conducive to a 3x per week 50-min lecture schedule.",
                "I love that it is taught by all guest lecturers!",
                "This course is not structured well at all. The exams are a terrible evaluation of what you have learned. You have like 800 different professors and lectures so none of the content is taught in a connectable way and they give you no time on the exams to even think.",
                "The open note exams were really nice and took a lot of the emphasis away from knowing everything by heart, but still ensuring that we have a good understanding of the material.",
                "This course was very disorganized. The order of lectures did not make logical sense and were not fit for learning. The lecture styles were also vastly different, and some professors would repeat the same content whereas others would assume we had background information that we did not have. I would have appreciated it if the lectures were more standard and if there were fewer lecturers to make learning more digestible. Additionally, we had multiple issues with the exams this year, resulting in a somewhat unfair grading of the first exam and the last exam being much more difficult (in terms of number of questions asked and difficulty of questions) compared to previous exams. I felt unprepared for these changes and although the TAs did their best to support us, these administrative barriers made this class difficult to engage with.",
                "The only weakness is that it is very difficult to get any read of what will be on the exams or what the questions will look like as there are not practice exams or homeworks and each day is a different professor, so you only get to know what the exam will look like after the first exam which is 33% of your final grade.",
                "Strengths: Open note exams that are not that hard if you just take really good notes. Allows you to spend more time understand the material rather than just trying to memorize everything. Frequent change of topics made the course still interesting even if one specific area isn't particularly of interest.\r\nLots of professors that were open to talking about OBGYN.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  The fact that almost each lecture was a different professor meant that building a connection with any single one seemed harder. This also made the material sometimes feel disconnected and all over the place.",
                "The open-note exams were difficult even though they were open-note. I am not sure how reflective the actual class is by your exam grade.",
                "Strengths: interesting content, expert lecturers\/very passionate about their work and their field\r\nWeaknesses: having different lecture styles is a bit difficult to follow, and the order of the lectures this year was not at all intuitive in the beginning (for ex we started off on a topic that required a lot of basic knowledge\/terms but we didn't get to the lecture teaching those basic concepts and terms until later on)",
                "There was some inconsistencies in lectures because each lecture is given by a different person. Strengths were the TA's and review sessions, as well as the open-note format for exams.",
                "Weaknesses: Exams were more about time than knowledge. I don't think they tested our knowledge of the material. The exams were also on Canvas, and this led to many technical difficulties. Definitely not a gut or easy A.",
                "The exam format is very frustrating. Exams had technical problems during two of the three exams and there were so many questions (more than 1 per minute) that a good score on an exam often came down more to time management than material knowledge or preperation.",
                "The class structure, specifically the lectures, can sometimes be overwhelming and difficult to grasp. The class was only 50 minutes long, but we had lectures with over 150 slides. Thankfully, the TAs could break down the content, but some more organization on behalf of the professors would help in how we should approach the material.",
                "I enjoyed the course material, but I wish the course encouraged a higher level of engagement.",
                "Strengths: diverse array of lecture topics, opportunity to learn from folks doing some phenomenal work in the reproductive sciences, super supportive team of TAs (especially Derek!)\r\nWeakness: order of lectures did not feel intuitive at several points",
                "I really enjoyed learning the content from different instructors. Each instructor specialized in the content they presented, which was very cool. It was also really helpful that the teaching team was pretty flexible with the lecture recordings when the students presented a good reasoning to obtain them.",
                "The strength of the class is that each lecturer is a specialist in their respective field. The largest weakness of the class is the poor organization. The course is primarily run by the TAs as there isn't a main professor who is at lectures. The sections could be improved and the tests are mostly based on if you can take word-for-word notes on what is said during lecture.",
                "Strength is that we get to engage with multiple different professors that are all experts in their field.",
                "I wish the slides from the guest lecturers were more updated on the day of the actual lecture. There were some times when the lecture covered material that was NOT on the slides and this was just too distracting; I could not follow along at all, causing me to miss a lot of material at times.",
                "More practice exams and work would be helpful to understand concepts. In addition to this, content teaching and style was very different depending on the professor so a more clear outline on what is important to remember would have helped. In addition, there were many technical problems that arised during exam periods which affected me negatively in terms of grades and ability to answer questions.",
                "Strengths: broad overview of topics covered, with extreme specificity on certain topics while extremely broad understanding for others; Papers in discussion sections are very interesting; Derek is an amazing TA; Derek's review sessions and resources are extremely helpful\r\nWeakness: No lecture recordings, every lecture has a different professor -> professors have not evaluated whether certain topics have already been covered or not; course lacks cohesion",
                "I really enjoyed the different lecturers and the unique insight they brought into every lecture!",
                "Strengths: rotating professors, since during lectures you can really get into each topic\r\nWeaknesses: a bit difficult to study for these exams because of the difference of professors.",
                "I like that we had so many different lecturers in this course, but I really wish the instructors had been more accessible for asking questions.  It was basically impossible to get help."

                "Yes -- especially good as an additional personal interest course to someone in a medicine-adjacent major and with advanced understanding of biology. I think intro bio sequence is a pre requisite but would be very hard to succeed in the course without a B+ or greater in earlier Bio courses.\r\n\r\nDefinitely would recommend going to every lecture; since there is no continuity between lectures you can't count on a recording or review of the slides.",
                "YES! it was awesome",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you wanna to be a gyno specifically I guess. If you are in MCDB take another course I promise this isn't the gut you want and it is not worth it.",

                "Yes! This class is really interesting and a different format than I am used to since each class has a different professor. This makes sure that you are learning the topic from a prof who is an expert on that specific format.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Course wasn't that difficult and the content was interesting\/useful.",
                "Yes, great content and I felt that I learned a lot. I think having open note exams was great in the sense that I actually found myself listening to and enjoying lectures with the goal of understanding the information instead of stressing about having to eventually memorize it. All the lecturers were really passionate about their field, which was inspiring as a student.",
                "I found this a highly interesting course and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in reproduction or reproductive healthcare. The format is pretty chill, as long as you show up to lecture and pay attention you will be fine. The grades are entirely based off 3, not curved exams which are open note. There is no homework and discussion is optional if you aren't an MCDB major. Still, I learned so much and some of the lecturers are really good. Plus, a lot of them are practicing physicians and you can ask them questions afterwards. I loved this class and would highly recommend",

                "Yes! Great professors and instructors.",
                "Yes! Overall, I learned so much more than I thought because the material on the exams was exactly what was covered in the lectures, so if you paid attention and reviewed your notes, you would do good in the exams while also learning and retaining a lot of information.",
                "Yes, a great course to delve into reproductive bio and make a lot of connections.",
                "Yes! For students looking for their first MCDB class to take, I would recommend this course or the Genetics course because they are comparatively more well organized and interesting.",
                "Yes! I think more people should take this class! It was so interesting and everyone I talked to wanted to know more, so I hope more students take it.",
