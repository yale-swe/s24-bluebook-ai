                "Latin is a good language credit for those who are not good at the oral aspect of learning languages, and Latin 2's curriculum, albeit rather quick, is very fair and comprehensive. The class was repetitive at times, as are all languages, but the small nature of the class helps you get to know your classmates, and it is enjoyable. Overall, I would definitely recommend Latin to other students."
