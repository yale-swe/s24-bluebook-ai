    "I learned a lot about poetry as an institution and about various ways to read and think about poetry and the canon.",
    "Critical analysis of literature, and also the ability to tie different literature together across time periods.",
    "I learned to become an effective close-reader and I  about how poetry and the means by which poetry was was read\/analyzed\/appreciated developed from Pope to Dove.",
    "I learned a lot about the interpretation of \"the Poet,\" and how poems or poets are included in anthologies or the canon differently over time. This class is not a survey, but more so a close reading of several major poets and poetesses who have shaped and influenced the direction of poetry from around the 18th century to present.",
    "I learned how to appreciate poetry and criticize canon formation.",
    "I developed knowledge surrounding different periods, poets, and genres\/forms of English poetry."

   "comments": [
    "The course was great in providing historical background to the material. The readings were well picked as well.",
    "The pacing of poets is quite good you get a sense of each poet individually but also of the conversations between the poets, and cover a large time period well. The 4 papers are effective and well-spaced. \r\n\r\nI did not take 125, but I had a familiarity with Shakespeare and Milton before coming into the course, which I think is actually pretty important to engaging at the highest level with the class. Without that background, the discussion of canon and influence in 126 would be harder to have.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can pinpoint is that my section of 126 did not have the intellectual rigor that other seminars on poetry I have had, mostly due to the inexperienced nature of many of the students. I'm not quite sure how to solve this, except for perhaps asking more of students in terms of discussion, even if they are inexperienced.",
    "I honestly loved this course and I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "I enjoyed only focusing on six major poets, and dabbling with a few other poems here and there. I feel like I really know a lot about these poets, because each unit began with a great introduction\/biography to the author.\r\n\r\nI think that buying six different books can be challenging (both financially and because the Bookstore often ran short), but the library or BorrowDirect was always a great resource for finding what I needed.",
    "I don't naturally have a lot to say about poetry, so I enjoyed when we did small group exercises and \"presented\" to the class. I would have liked being forced to talk more.",
    "Professor Levine did an amazing job, gave great feedback and was an all around amazing person! She also gave us a lot of knowledge that one usually doesn't get in lower level entry courses, since these courses are intended more to draw you into the major rather than appreciate poetry, but Professor Levine did a great job making the syllabus cover the required topics while still being fun and rewarding. Do take it with her if you can, you won't regret it!",
    "I thought the course did a good job in not trying to cover everything, but instead focusing on a smaller selection of poets."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class. Wonderful poetry. And Professor Levine is insightful, clear, approachable, funny, poised.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to a student who is even vaguely interested in English.",
    "I would recommend it mostly because the poets are wonderful. I also really like that it spends significant time in the 20th century, and that there was intentional conversation about constructing canons. In terms of English pre-reqs, this one is quite fun although everyone should take 128 as a pre-req too, as it totally shaped the way I thought about this course and all of my academic life. It is also a great first English class for people who haven't taken any English or poetry classes yet. The reading load is not bad at ALL, and the 4 papers (which grow in length from 3 pages to 7-8 pages) are clearly delineated and well-spaced. \r\n\r\nProfessor Levine was wonderful she was always prepared with thoughtful overviews of the poet as a historical figure, of the time period, and of the arcs of poetic development throughout the course. She engaged us in a variety of different mediums, which gave the class a lot of energy. She also gave great feedback on papers, and made herself very accessible to students before and after the paper-writing process.",
    "Yes. This course is very useful for a future literature major, since it involves the discussion of canons and the evolution of literature. For others this course can also simply be a fun one where one can discover poetry and the stories behind such poetry.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students. It is a great course in the foundations of poetry and the poems we read were delightful.",
    "I took this class initially believing that I would major in English; I am not completely sure that I will continue with the major, but regardless, I think this class was incredibly important to my understanding of poetry. It's a fun way to explore an interesting, artistic form of writing. Not only do you read the poems and write about it, but you get to write a couple short poems for yourself and perform a recitation - two other great practices that allow you to get into the poetry. I really enjoyed this class, and it's definitely changed my perspective about poetry.",
    "Yes absolutely! Take this course if you want to get a quick overview of western poetry canon formation and its flaws as well as its strengths.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are an English major or want to learn more about later English poetry, since it provides a good grounding in an array of important poets."
