                "Very very tough exam questions. Really ruined my course experience.",
                "did not like having graded in-class exercises; some students have different learning styles and learn better through self-study outside of lecture",
                "Strengths: good slides\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: awful grading structure. Students receive no clarity even at the end of the semester where the median or average of the class falls. Quite concerning when the raw average is a C. Professors are inconsiderate regarding this. I would prefer there be some consistent standard coming into the course. Also, no hybrid office hours. Other MCDB courses employ this and made it much more accessible.",
                "only 3 midterms to determine your grade can make this course a little stressful. You do learn a lot though.",
                "Strengths: very interesting lecture content, both of the professors are great, engaging lecturers, no homework assignments, didn't assume that much prior biology knowledge; Weaknesses: questions on exams were very specific to the lecture slide details, mild disconnect between first and second half of the course",
                "Strengths: The instructors, especially Prof. Hatzios, are great. Weaknesses: the class only has 3 exams so your grade is based on what you get on those exams. The exams are very hard but there are great peer tutors and TFs that are willing to answer your questions.",
                "UGh everything was a strength as each professor actually cares about one's personal growth and explains as best as they can in the allotted time. they definitely do not go super fast just to get through content. Also, the grading could be less rigid since this is a concept-driven course.  Please change that",
                "The course was really good at explaining concepts especially in the second half and really facilitated student learning. I also really liked that you could ask questions during lecture despite being such a big class! Inalso really liked the in class exercises that made me think about the concepts taught in class in a very engaging way.",
                "Liked the pacing of the course but the exams sucked. The TAs host a weekly review session but only for you to ask questions, nobody went. Needs better method of supporting students since this is one of only ways students interact with the TAs. Liked the in-class participation assignments though.",
                "The course was structured very well and was well paced. The professor were very communicative and the teaching team was very accessible",
                "strengths: knowledgeable TAs, both professors Yan and Hatsioz were also very knowledgeable and excited to teach.",
                "strengths: the course is structured so that we learn the molecular content in the beginning and more applications in the second half which makes the content organized and more approachable, there are many resources for help such as office hours, review sessions, and peer tutors\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the grade is only composed of three midterms and 10% in-class excersizes, although the in-class exercises can help your grade, almost everyone in the class will get 100%, making it not change much for the curve, with only three midterms, there is not a lot of work throughout the semester, however, more work could be helpful to test our understanding of the content at the level that is expected, also, given the nature of the course, it can be hard to predict your grade (not much can be changed but it is something to be aware of)",
                "poor course. 3 heavily weighted midterms that rely on buzzwords and finicky information rather than understanding of material",
                "Strength: Lectures are great and the TFs are very helpful. The feedback was quite clear.\r\nWeaknesses: Too many exams and lack of other means of assessment (discussion sections where some papers are introduced might be very great)-- this might cause a very big workload during exam period.",
                "I think the teaching and the content are both strengths of this course. Every lecture was very interesting and the slides were quite informative. I also thought that both professors were very fair with their exam questions and the content they expected us to learn.",
                "Strengths: The workload was relatively low, considering you only had to study for the exams. As along as you reviewed early on enough, the exams were not that bad.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None, I liked the structure of the class",
                "I thought this was an excellent course overall.\r\nMy one comment is that the powerpoint lectures were very bulky at times, and as someone who prefers hand-written notes, they often too fast paced for me to keep up with note taking. Perhaps having more hand written notes in the future, or lecturing at a slightly slower pace would be helpful.\r\nAnother comment is that I am not fond of classes where exams are the central point, and this class graded us primarily on three exams spread throughout the semester. Small in-lecture questions graded for completion are alright, but I think that having actual homework problems that challenge us to think more constructively about biological questions would be much more useful for student learning, since doing few problems a week on our own time would greatly bolster how well we know the material. This would also help make sure that the course is not purely based on memorization and repeating information on exam dates.",
                "The course is very well-organized and taught. Professors Hatzios and Yan clearly care a lot about student success and offer a lot of resources. I found the lectures engaging and interesting, and the applications to medicine and the outside world really impactful.",
                "The course could benefit from more assignments and also more practice questions. Review sessions were always after exams which did not make a lot of sense to me. Even if they werent assignments I wish there were more checkpoints to check understanding from lectures.",
                "strengths: very low workload unless you're studying for the midterms. professors are incredibly knowledgeable. Hatzios is especially amazing. And, most importantly, SUPER interesting topic.\r\nweaknesses: exams are so, so hard. It is really rough that your entire grade (90%) is based on these exams."

                "No. Not in its current form. Very ambiguous and demoralizing course. Improvements to grading structure, and content proportions would need to be changed. Currently, this course focuses almost exclusively on bacteria and the research being conducted by the professors. They prioritized the minutiae of mechanisms over the big picture time and time again.",
                "Yes take it, its super interesting",
                "Yes!! I would highly recommend this course both to MCDB students and anyone who might be curious about bacteria and microorganisms. The topics covered in each lecture are quite interesting, and there are a breadth of topics so even if one or two lectures feel boring, the rest will be different. There is no homework, there are many opportunities for review through office hours and review sessions, and there are practice questions in class to see if you're on track. The only con would be that the questions tested on exams are quite specific and about details, but the class is curved anyway.",
                "Yes if you need to finish your MCDB requirements, take this one",
                "I would only recommend it to pre-med students and MCDB majors that need to take the class. It is a challenging class and can be really hard if you are not on top of it.",

                "Yes absolutely especially if you are a MCDB major!",
                "If you are willing to keep up with the material on your own it might not be bad. Lectures are packed and exams cherry-pick information so you really need to know everything ever mentioned.",
                "I think so. The exams cover a lot of information and they tend to be very memorization-heavy. But I think this is among one of the most well-organized MCDB core classes. The grading is very vague and little information is given to students about their performance",
                "Sure! A better MCDB class but still a bit high stakes given that 3 exams make up most of your grade.",
                "Yes, I would. Although this course was not easy for me, the professors did a great job of presenting the content in approachable and interesting ways. This course reaffirmed my interest in MCDB!",
                "no. exams were out to get you, rather than help you learn",
                "Yes, although I will say, if you are not interested in microbio, it might become boring",
                "Yes! This was my first upper-level MCDB course and I really enjoyed it.",
                "Yes, this is an interesting class that is pretty relaxed",
                "Yes, it's one of my favorite MCDB core so far! The content is very interesting!",
                "I would really recommend this course! It is a gem within the MCDB department and is the best core class I've taken. The professors and teaching team are very passionate, brilliant, and engaging. The material is interesting, and the class is very accessible and does not rely on heavy chemistry and biochemistry. Of special note is Professor Hatzios who has gone above and beyond in organizing the course itself and also in her portion of the lectures. She was so helpful during office hours and is a very passionate instructor who cares about her students' success: that alone is reason enough to take this course. Take it for the fascinating material, the accessible nature of the course, and the incredible structure and teaching team. Microbiology has hands-down been my favorite MCDB core class.",
                "I would. I learned so much about micro, but I also felt like I was unprepared for the exams to some extent. Make sure to keep up with the studying aspect of the class.",
                "YES. The topics covered are SO INTERESTING!!! Microbiome, bioremediation, disease, metabolism... the lectures are awesome. BUT, the exams are SO HARD. This is definitely not an easy A at all."
