   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Don't grade the problem sets just based on completeness. There is no point in doing that, as then everyone gets a 2\/2 and your final grade is not 20% psets, 40% 2 midterms, and 40% final, but rather 50% 2 midterms and 50% final. I'm sure you understand what I mean by this, statistically.",
    "Strengths: Section is extremely helpful!\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like Professor Kortum could have used the slides more to teach, as lecture was extremely hard to follow.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Covers a lot of material throughout the semester, and we spent a good amount of time on each topic too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish the textbook was incorporated into the class work. Students had no real incentive to read it besides for preparing for exams.",
    "Strengths: Knowledgeable professor\r\nWeaknesses: Class was quite disorganized imo, stuff we learned in class didn't really correlate with parts, which didn't really correlate with exams",
    "Different professor.",
    "I think one strength of this course is definitely the section that accompanies it.  I felt like I learned more from section than maybe the lecture at times. I cannot think of any specific weaknesses at this time.",
    "strengths: material was interesting but often did not understand it in class (his slides and textbook were much more clear and concise), less pressure on psets and quizzes to be perfect which I believe prevented too much stress and focused more on learning \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes disorganized lectures, disconnect between his slides and his classes, not very personal learning",
    "The course is quite disorganized, as the Professor would not use the slides during lecture, choosing topics and what to focus on with his own pace. The slides are one the only materials students get from the class to review.\r\nIf there had not been section, it would have been incredibly difficult to review the material, as the other source, the textbook, was also not followed.\r\nSection helped a lot, especially with Marnix who reviewed the concepts in a concise and easy way to understand.\r\nThe other aspects of the course may need some restructuring though.",
    "Lectures were not useful or informative. Didn't start understanding the information until I just started to try to learn it on my own. TAs were left with little they could do because they only had 50 minutes a week to try to teach us 140 min of lecture material",
    "Prof Kortum was a horrible professor. He would read off of his slides a lot, and talks without explaining stuff. Other students have said the same. He should not be teaching.",
    "Sometimes the lectures were disorganized or didn't make sense with where the course was at in that point in time",
    "strengths: the textbook is online\r\nweaknesses: not a lot of practice material from past classes, exams included current events not specified on the syllabus or the slides",
    "difficult to learn all of the content because it skims over so much on a surface level. \r\nsometimes the professor talks really fast and its hard to keep track of what he is saying. \r\nmaybe have lecture notes uploaded online like the Comp. Sci. department does?",
    "Strengths:\r\n- applied course material to current events (which made the material that we were learning more interesting and helpful day-to-day\r\n- Professor Kortum was extremely helpful and invested in the success of each of his students\r\n- Professor Kortum was incredibly passionate and aimed to not just teach information, but also build a foundation of macroeconomics that we could apply to every day life  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-occasionally the textbook was on a slightly different page than the lecture (to understand in totality, students had to utilize class note, lecture slides and the textbook -- this was helpful for me and helped learn more, but it was time consuming.",
    "I think it is too basic",
    "Strengths: Easy psets, not a lot of work. Fair exams. Very interesting material. Weaknesses: Sometimes lecture dragged a bit. Was also my 4th class of the day so maybe I'm biased.",
    "I think that at times it was unclear what material we were supposed to know for the exam. We often also weren't able to cover all the lecture material in class.",
    "Professor Kortum was a really nice guy, but he used the slides from the previous year at the beginning and was overall unorganized. The TAs were really good, though.",
    "I think that having a Piazza board would be the biggest suggestion. A lot of the times I was confused on a concept that Google or the textbook could answer well, and I think if I had the chance to ask on Piazza that would have been great.",
    "You have to learn the basics at some point. This is as good a way as any.",
    "Strengths- cannot really think of any.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the professor and course director do not care about the students AT ALL. It is evident in the way they interact with and treat students in person and email. The professor even sends out class-wide emails saying not to email him about stuff sometimes... The course director, Marnix, treats students like they are imbeciles and overall like shit. The course director should not be teaching and should just be researching if that is all he cares about. Students come to Yale hoping for an education, ideally with instructors who care about them, which was missing from this course with Samuel Kortum and Marnix Amand.",
    "The lectures are very interesting! Professor Kortum makes the information relevant by discussing their implications for what's going on in the world. The exams could be structured better -- many of us were confused as to what exactly were on the midterms and the final.",
    "This course is obviously taught by a researcher trying to get tenure - refused to help me when I asked for extra help, went off on irrelevant tangents during class, poorly written tests that weren't good judges of what we've learned, etc.",
    "Not many strengths or weaknesses. Weaknesses are that we didn't receive guidance when it came to preparing for the midterms and finals.",
    "I'm not sure I even got to take an introductory macroeconomics course, because the way it was taught and organized felt so disjointed and misunderstood that I actually think I just sat through almost four months of accomplished researchers COMMENTING on introductory curriculum and never passing any sort of knowledge down. Thanks to this, I don't have any sort of comment to make on the course itself  besides the department's choice in instructor and the overbearing weight of exams upon our semester grade. :o",
    "I really liked that Professor Kortum tied in current events such as the Nobel Prize winners, Paul Romer and William Nordhaus, and President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts.",
    "The lectures were interesting, and the textbook and slides were easily comprehensible. However, sometimes easier concepts were given far too much time, making the class seem slow moving.",
    "Good overall intro course; posted section answers would've been helpful",
    "The course felt disorganized and lacked attendance. Could be improved by having more organized and informative sections and from the professor following the powerpoints written for him.",
    "Strengths - Professor Kortum is nice, and TA office hours were very helpful. The weekly quizzes were good practice to solidify concepts. Weaknesses: Lectures were structured in a way that wasn't very cohesive and hard follow along. It was hard to know what the important part of each lecture was. Additionally sometimes the psets weren't related to what was being taught in lecture so we would have to lots of outside research in order to complete them.",
    "There isn't too much help for students outside of class and sections.",
    "professor was a little all over the place. grading was a little unstandardized and not fair",
    "Lectures were not great",
    "It was a really informative class although not the most structured.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kortum and Marnix were very helpful and accommodating \r\nWeaknesses: The TAs were sometimes hard to get ahold of and I found them to be confusing at times",
    "This course lacked a cohesive arc, it just seemed to be random tidbits that werent related to each other",
    "I think the material itself was not too difficult and it can easily be self taught. However, be prepared to teach yourself because the lectures are not particularly informative.",
    "I was uncertain about the goals of the course at times such as what the main takeaways were. There were times when a lot of information was given or a lot of derivations were done, but I wasn't exactly sure what purpose they were done for.\r\n\r\nThere were also many moments when I felt like my studying did not pay off--especially when I study a lot for trade and labor but get a question about the Nobel Prize. I wish there was a better way to give people who go to lecture more credit without penalizing people who go to lecture but don't study the portion of lecture that doesn't seem to be as relevant to a course that seems to be meant to lay down introductory macroeconomic principles."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's very useful. It's badly organized but who cares because it's easy.",
    "The topic is very interesting, so yes.",
    "Yes, because it gives you a good idea about what macroeconomics is without having to delve deeper into the mathematics and underlying theories. It is a good overview course for people considering to major in Economics.",
    "You have to take it for the econ major, but take it in the spring. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH KORTUM.",
    "If you are interested in economics or thinking about becoming an econ major than I would absolutely recommend it.  I also would say it is just a good foundational class to have.  Overall, yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "yes; wasn't the best class, but good to know for common knowledge \r\n\r\nwasn't too hard",
    "Absolutely not",
    "If you have the requirements, take Intermediate Macroeconomics rather than this course. The Introductory courses are always very qualitative and hard to get any rigorous understanding of the topics presented. Taking the higher level macroeconomics might allow you to learn a lot more relevant material in a shorter amount of time.",
    "No, although the material is interesting by itself, it's presented in a very boring and dry way",
    "If you want to be an Econ major",
    "Yes, it's helpful for developing basic knowledge of the macro economy",
    "yes",
    "Definitely! This course is absolutely essential for anyone interested in economics. This class is perfect for getting an overall picture of the money supply, GDP growth and markets (and how these apply to current policy)",
    "Absolutely! Covers material everyone should know. Not just good for Econ majors!! It's not a lot of work and you learn so much that is so relevant in the news every day (ex. tax cuts, GDP, stock market, inflation, interest rates).",
    "It's a really useful class, so I would recommend anyone interested in learning about how the world works to take a class in macroeconomics.",
    "You're probably taking it for the major. That being said, I think Tsyvinski would do you better.",
    "If you have to take the class for the major, I was told that the seminar was much better.",
    "Yes! This course did a strong job blending the basics of systemic understanding with real world insights.",
    "Not with Sam Kortum and Marnix Amand. Marnix made my life a living hell for sometime (Dean Excusable reason and was presented) and has no compassion as an instructor. Major red flag for someone in academia teaching students. Sam Kortum was very disengaged from the students, and Marnix treated us like we were incapable of intellectual thought. I can go on and on. With these duo, do not take this course.",
    "Yes!",
    "The course, yes! The teacher, NO.",
    "Absolutely not, unless the Econ Department decides to hire an actual teacher  an instructor, somebody whose goal is to TEACH students  rather than handing the job of teaching an introductory level course to researchers with absolutely no experience or interest in teaching. ;)",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student. The macroeconomy is relevant to everyone, and it provides a really useful context for understanding current events.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was enjoyable, as Dr. Kortum clearly had a lot of passion and knowledge about the subject. It is a great class for anyone,  not just Econ majors, due to the many real-world applications that are not only talked about but covered on problem sets and exams.",
    "Yes",
    "I think it's useful information to know, but you could teach yourself.",
    "No, unless you need to take it.",
    "If you need it for your major. not for fun",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if majoring in Economics or looking to gain an understanding of large-scale economic interactions",
    "Its usually a requirement, but if not, probably not.",
    "Interesting and useful knowledge! I would take it if only to gain an understanding of how economies work, but watch which professor you take it with, and know what you want to take out of the course."
