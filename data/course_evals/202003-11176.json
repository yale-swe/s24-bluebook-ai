                "Incredibly engaging classes and you learn so much! The only weakness could be time commitment. Daily classes can definitely be exhausting and hard to schedule around.",
                "Weaknesses: I wish the grading system was organized a little better because with the way it is displayed on Canvas, it is hard to have any idea of how you're doing in the course until you receive a final grade at the end of the semester. Although I can see my grades on individual assignments\/exams, it would be helpful to have access to an accurate representation of my overall score. In terms of the course itself, it is a lot of work and it is very fast-paced, but I think that is necessary to keep up with the rigor of the curriculum. I also don't feel like I learned how to write characters very well, but I think that was simply because it is hard to practice with class online. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Learned so much in such a short time. Since the topics are cumulative, it forces you to keep up with the work and make sure you master each lesson. Class time is so well spent; I never feel like I'm wasting my time learning things in class that could be learned in the textbook. I also found the weekly individual sessions very helpful.",
                "It was a great course! Rigorous and engaging even despite being online.",
                "The Chinese department is amazing at Yale. This class is challenging, you get out what you put into the class. If you were able to breeze through foreign language classes in high school, Chinese at Yale won't be like that. You have to put in the work daily. DAILY! I learned this lesson the hard way."

Even though this is a very basic introduction to Chinese, I learned so much about how to read, write, and speak. Students are frequently encouraged to participate, which I would normally find stressful, but the professor was always so nice and fostered a very welcoming environment. The class is very fast paced, but if you are willing to put in the effort and spend some time on the homework each day, I think it is very manageable. You get out what you put in!",
