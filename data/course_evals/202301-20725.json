                "Learned depths about the technicalities of drawing!",
                "Basic Drawing was awesome! I came into the course with a bit of experience, and Professor Maria de Los Angeles helped me refine my skills, especially in regards to figure drawing.",

                "I developed my understanding of lighting, perspective and composition of drawings. I was able to gain a lot of drawing skills over the course and have produced arts work that I am proud of.",
                "I learned a lot  about branching out to new mediums with my art and working with physical materials, as well as different influences that go into different kinds of art.",
                "I became a much better technical artist in this class. While my improvement per class wasn't apparent, the motions of drawing every class made me improve even if I didn't notice it. I also finally realized what it means to \"draw what you see, not what you think you see\".",
                "I gained insight as to how to develop a composition that I was proud of. Coming in with drawing as a hobby, this class helped me develop more technical skills with regard to proportions and graphically developing a piece. This class helped me to become more free-flowing with mediums and use intuitive observations to accurately depict a subject.",

                "A great strength of the course was the creative liberty each student was afforded to develop and push their skill sets. A weakness in the course was not spending enough time on the basics of drawing and being thrust into creating immediately. This played to the strengths of the students with more drawing experience but left the true beginners feeling less confident.",
                "great course, good time management",
                "Strengths: you get to draw a ton! Amazing way to learn. Maria is a fantastic professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: had to spend a bit of my own money ($20) at the beginning of the semester. Would be cool not to.",
                "It was a great course, one of its strengths being the way we were always encouraged to cross artistic boundaries and experiment with mediums outside of our comfort zone.",
                "This course is a great opportunity! It is a fun departure from the standard academic work we do at Yale.",
                "I love how engaged I was in the class, particularly with the use of live models. I will say I had hoped this would have been a class where we learned peoples names, but it wasnt",
                "This class is a great low pressure way to learn how to draw, though I will say you get out of this class what you put into it. If you actually put in effort into your drawings, youll definitely see significant improvement in your work",
                "The course instruction is very good, but sometimes the language used during instruction is hard to understand for art beginners in art.",
                "This course is strong for anyone who would voluntarily sign up for it. Ive done art for a lot of my life and have a lot of fun with it. Its usually rather difficult, but its very engaging.",
                "Strengths: the professor and the openness of the course. I liked that while it was formally a drawing class, my professor allowed us to explore drawing through many mediums and gave us open-ended projects to help us grow our personal styles as artists. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: students should not have use their own funds to pay for materials in the course- while students should buy their own extra supplies if they want to continue pursuing drawing, there should be a budget endowed to each student for basic supplies for the course.",
                "Strengths: MARIA! Access to the school of art building and its resources!! The hands-on nature of the class and how we get to dive into drawing with real-life models in so many class sessions. This course could be improved if color WASN'T allowed. I think it would help us focus on the basics without being distracted by extra factors.",
                "it's a lot of learning as you go but in the best way possible. just practice and go with the flow!"

                "100%. Maria is very nice and honestly changed my view of art. I had taken a few art classes in middle\/high school which were pretty grade focused, and I felt like this class is the opposite of that and is purely meant for you to grow as an artist. Maria helped me realize that I actually have my own natural style of art when looking at all of my pieces, and I feel like my interest in art was reignited through this class.",
                "If students are interested in drawing and spending lots of time outside of class drawing, I do recommend this course. It is a lot of work outside of class, and those who enjoy spending time drawing will like this.",
                "yes absolutely",
                "Absolutely! If you have any interest in art or drawing, this is an awesome course to take! Not too much work and you get so much better.",
                "yes yes yes! wonderful course if youre interested in learning drawing fundamentals or simply improving your technique.",
                "Yes! I think everyone should take an art class, whether you consider yourself an artist or not.",
                "Its for people who have drawn a little in the past\/ shown interest in drawing in the past",
                "If youre at all interested in drawing, you should absolutely take this class. There were all kinds of people, from people who had never drawn in their life to incredibly talented artists, and it was a super supportive environment",
                "yes",
                "Yes, the course was fun and I enjoyed how much freedoms I had with my assignments. If a student is interested in art, I would reccomend it.",
                "Even if you're just a STEM major looking for a Humanities credit, I would recommend this class. It doesn't ask anything outside of the meeting times, and it's still very instructive.",
                "Yes! Absolutely - Basic Drawing is challenging in a way completely unlike other Yale courses; it exercises the creative part of the brain and encourages you to go above and beyond to grow your drawing skills as much as you can, no matter what level you began with. The professors and TFs are amazing, and the peer collaboration and critiques were also very rewarding as students receive valuable feedback that they can apply to current or future works. Especially with Professor de Los Angeles, this course is incredibly rewarding, and at the end of the semester, you will be able to see a line of growth throughout your work and understand yourself much more as an artist and creator.",
                "Yes! Especially if you would like to DRAW and be able to explore this creative outlet in an academic, collaborative and fun setting!",
                "yes! it was a great break in my schedule and I looked forward to letting go into my work, and while learning how to draw too? overall a great experience"
