                "Improved Spanish skills including writing, reading, comprehension, and speaking.",

                "I learned to speak and write and Spanish fairly well.",
                "I noticed an improvement in my speaking skills thanks to the large amount of time spent listening to and speaking in Spanish in class. \r\nI learned a variety of tenses and vocab that allowed me to express myself with detail and accuracy.\r\nI was immersed in the culture of Spanish-speaking countries.\r\nI learned how to effectively study to retain large amounts of info in a compressed timeline.",

The class is set up in a way that encourages participation to interact with the language. I think that I was placed perfectly into L3 after the summer placement test, which allowed me to be successful throughout the two courses."

                "The strength was that we had two different teachers so it was great to get some variety in ways that the material was taught. The weakness was that the homework we would do before class was new stuff and I wish we spent more time learning it before hand or after to really clarify what we learned.",
                "This course was very well organized and covered a lot of material in the limited summer session. I'd say one weakness was that sometimes it was a bit hard to focus when there were longer periods of lectures and explanations of grammar concepts. I think it would've been helpful to break up some of this with more interactive activities to keep students engaged.",
                "Strengths: great professors and TAs who really cared about the students. Material in and outside of class was very helpful and immersive.\r\nWeaknesses: more opportunities to work with classmates outside of class would have been helpful. Cultural project was also a bit hard to organize virtually.",
                "Strengths:\r\nThe engagement was high from beginning to end\r\nProfessors are always responsive and willing to answer questions ASAP\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nDuration of class every day\r\nZoom Connection/\r\n\r\n\r\nSome assignments posted on canvas were not there on the day listed in syllabus",
                "The course made you work hard to understand and speak the language, as far as weaknesses go, I think some of the homework questions on the films and readings are a bit difficult.",
                "Strengths: amazingly supportive teachers, a variety of learning approaches (in-class lecture, Supersite tutorials, textbook, handouts, one-on-one conversations with Martha). I found the Supersite tutorials to be very helpful!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nAnswers to exams were not provided immediately after they were returned--this hinders our ability to learn from mistakes.\r\nI would have appreciated the lesson powerpoints to be adapted to handouts as well since they're easier to print and study from. \r\nAnswer keys to additional practice worksheets were sometimes provided, but not always. \r\nFinally, I think it would have been beneficial to assign more frequent \"real-life\" readings such as current news articles that could passively reinforce reading comprehension and vocab.",
                "Having so much homework every day in the five week summer course is difficult, but I guess that's the price you have to pay to take it over the summer!",
                "Even though I took the course online, participation was a strength. The course work was very organized and fair. I don't have any weaknesses to share, as I loved every aspect of this course and would recommend it to any student."
