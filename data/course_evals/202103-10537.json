There was always a loud fan noise in the classroom and she had a very soft voice, plus the mask, leading to some discussions where we couldn't hear her.",

The only weakness I can think of is especially at the beginning of the semester, it was sometimes hard to actually hear the Professor, but this got better over the course of the class.",
