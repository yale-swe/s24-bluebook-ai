                "Great econ elective to learn more about macro trade policy and current issues surrounding tariffs and carbon reduction.",
                "This is a course mostly centered around trade models and trade theory. It does not really go in depth into modern trade policy or issues. It mostly covers the theoretical models that have been popular historically in international trade (Ricardo, pure exchange model etc) which you might've seen a bit in intro macroeconomics.",
                "This course gave me an understanding of the leading theories of trade, an ability to better understand current events related to international economics, and an introduction to international environmental economics.",

                "I learned more about various models used to evaluate and explain trade.",

                "Strengths: interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: professor's lectures & material delivery, obstruct concepts without any explanations whatsoever.",
                "The lectures were very uninteresting and often hard to follow for extended periods. A restructuring of the class to make it more engaging is much needed.",
                "Very interesting, lectures\/content could have more structure to them to allow for students to prepare for lectures etc.",
                "Lectures were well organized and easy to track the trajectory of learning for the class, which was helpful when learning and growing with a bunch of different models for looking at maco trends.",
                "The strength is that it gives you a solid understanding of historical and modern trade models that you can use to model current trade flows and patterns. The material can sometimes get very dry and it involves a lot of graphs and indifference curves, budget constraint lines etc.. If that speaks to you, definitely give the course a shot. I felt like lectures were also sometimes not that exciting and often found myself and others losing interest as the class neared its end. The two guest lectures during the term helped to change things up a bit very nicely though!",
                "This course might be improved by making it a bit more interactive. Some class polls or discussions might help in this regard. The strengths of this class are that the material is important and interesting. It is also presented in a very clear way by a very knowledgeable instructor.",
                "The class was a little weird and different than my other econ courses but I enjoyed it",
                "Strength: low workload\r\nWeaknesses: incredibly boring, i struggled to pay attention. Very disorganized, they would post psets later than planned and we had to submit them in a rush. Pset questions are hard to understand on a logic level",
                "I love the way he teaches on the board.",
                "I appreciated that the professor thought through all of the information he presented to the students during the lecture instead of just going through slides. The problem sets didn't have significant relation to the lecture materials, which made it slightly hard to prepare for exams. A bit more structure during lectures would also have been appreaciated.",
                "The course had no structure, it felt like we were jumping from one economic model to another without knowing how they were connected to each other. The PSETS were complicated and hard to understand, completing them with in class instruction was impossible and even with one on one time in office hours, I was often more confused than when I came in. The lecture slides were helpful but the exams were not reflective of the PSETS."

                "Yes, good economics elective, interesting lectures.",

                "Only if you're really interested in the theoretical models underpinning trade. Basically take the fundamental trade models you learn in introductory macro\/microecon and scale them up to a whole semester. Again, this class doesn't teach trade policy or analysis of current trading patterns. These come mostly in the form of application of the models you learn in class.",
                "Yes, this course is a great economics elective. The material is very applicable to current events, and it is exciting to be able to explore current trade deals and economic events with a critical lens.",
                "Yes if you want to see how econ can be applicable and are interested in international trade",
                "No, thers much better courses where you are engaged and actually learn",
                "The course content is very interesting but the organization is poor. Workload is really low so if you feel confident in your ability to get by on your own it may be okay. If youre someone who relies on office hours, practice tests, or group work, this isnt a good choice. The prof is a bit boring and doesnt seem to have a clear plan.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who would like to gain some understanding and familiarity with trade.",
                "No I would not, I think there may be better alternatives where you will better understand the content. Everyone including the professor seemed confused about the content."
