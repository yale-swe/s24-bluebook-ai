                "I learned about many different angles of the study of ethnomusicology and how humans perceive the environment (and how we define that environment). Through the many readings, I improved my ability to glean an authors message within dense texts. I improved my writing skills through short free writes and longer process papers.",
                "I learned how music and sound influences our perception of time, our understanding of the environment, and ultimately how we view the world. I learned how to read efficiently and developed my essay writing skills that will no doubt prepare me for future college writing. This course opened my eyes to how music and sound play a role in my daily life. As someone who is not a \"music person,\" I took this class to get out of my comfort zone, and it did not disappoint!",
                "This course taught me to think deeply and abstractly about a topic and urged me to do so actively rather than passively. It has improved my essay structures and the depth at which I discuss a topic. Additionally, it taught me the strengths and weaknesses that may accompany varying approaches. For instance, a broader and more complicated topic may be more restricting than a simple topic. Learning to work with different scales of content has taguht me that the approach I choose should be specific to the skill I would like to foster.",
                "Skills: Balancing a heavy reading load, parsing dense academic texts, writing college papers, citing properly, using Zotero. Knowledge: Many unfamiliar and niche ideas in philosophy, music theory, acoustemology, ways of thinking about the climate and climate change, ways of thinking about our sociopolitical and race relations according to music and sound.",
                "I learned about ethnomusicology. I also learned how to read difficult texts and write an academic paper.",
                "Academic writing and advanced literary analysis were the key skills I derived from the course.",
                "Gained a new appreciation for the interconnectedness between Music and Nature. Redefined some terms in insightful ways, such as difference between noise and sound. Learned how to critically analyze an article and write a college paper.",
                "It was fascinating to hear all of the different opinions and ideas about music and the environment that we heard not only from the authors but from our fellow classmates. I definitely have a different outlook on the environment and on music as a whole after taking this class."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths are Giulia's attentiveness and willingness to work with our ideas. Her insight and ability to break down the complicated concepts in our readings were essential to my engagement in this course. I think the class could be improved if there was some connective thread between all of the texts. Sometimes they seemed random, or not clearly connected to this blurry vision of music, sound, and the environment. Perhaps some sort of map (in the form of slides, or even a visual that the class builds through the semester) between the texts to explain how they add to that vision would be useful. The clarity of the course was aided by the vocabulary presentations, but I noticed that over time, our slides became more and more text heavy in a way that was less effective in presenting an accessible definition of the keywords.",
                "Strength: Giulia is an incredible instructor and she gave really good feedback on our writing assignments. Weakness: sometimes it felt like the course content was a little all over the place--it was our job to piece everything together and make what we could out of it. Sometimes I liked this individual thinking, but other times it just left me lost in the readings.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of the curriculum of this class and felt that all readings were very interested in a unique way. The free writings were helpful in allowing me to understand how well I was comprehending readings. I feel that this course could have benefitted from more embedded lessons that cleared up any confusion on overarching terms and terms that were very specialized to their fields. However, I did like that this class emphasized seminar-style discussion that forced us to derive a texts meaning rather than be told its meaning.",
                "Strengths: Unique subject, interesting course matter, covers a lot of ground, good for developing writing and reading skills, changes the way you think about and perceive how we engage with sound and music. Fun class outings to concerts and music\/sound events that make for great class-bonding experiences.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A heavy reading load (which Giulia justifies by comparing her course to DS), covering so much ground that sometimes the connections between different readings and discussions are lost or confused. Giulia's feedback on papers, at least her on-file comments, can be confusing (though she is always happy to clarify them in-person).",
                "The course was well organized and the readings, while somewhat disjointed, all added new perspectives to the course. I also liked how we had a lot of guest speakers.",
                "Great reading selection, engaging speakers, interesting material I otherwise would likely have never stumbled across.",
                "In class assistance on readings could be increased. Otherwise, course was wonderful.",
                "I loved the discussions we had in class, and the material was very fascinating. I also really enjoyed the various field trips our class went on. One weakness I would say would be that at times the workload could feel a little bit strenuous in terms of the quantity of reading."

                "Yes! Especially if you're not someone with experience in the classics or humanities, this class is a good introduction to learning how to process different humanities-oriented texts. You also have a lot of flexibility in the longer papers, which helps facilitate interest and also allows you to explore the readings that interest you more deeply.",
                "Yes! If you're looking to learn something new that you'll probably never learn anywhere else, go for it!",
                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Speaking about it to other students while I was in it was always complicated because its content has plenty of breadth: from planetary harmonies to listening to extinction. However, this course is formatted in a way that you learn how to dissect pieces you might read with less interest and still develop important skills from them as well as introduce you to pieces you will love and have an opportunity to write a paper on or discuss about with the professor. I will say this class discusses many environmental issues and that it is not necessarily a music theory class, hence its name.",
                "Yes! It isn't a light workload, but Giulia grades very well so it's not very stressful. You'll make great friends in this class from engaging with such interesting and unique ideas together, and from the fun class outings.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in musicology. Even if you're not, I still think this course helps to develop good reading and writing skills, and it will probably challenge the way you think about music and the environment.",
                "Fantastic course, great instruction, unique material. No weaknesses, highly recommend for someone looking for a wr\/hu credit with a reasonable workload yet high intellectual stimulation.",
                "Yes. Great content and lots of fun field trips.",
                "Yes! Some of the most thought-provoking discussions Ive had this year were in this class. It was so interesting to have such a range of perspectives and deep dive into material that was super fascinating to everyone. It was also great to have such a small class size; I really got to know everyone."
