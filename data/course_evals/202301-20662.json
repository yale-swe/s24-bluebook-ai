                "In 255, I learned about how higher-level math is conducted and significant lessons in study habits, the history of mathematics, and the importance of having an uplifting classroom/course environment. I learned topology, set theory, limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and the properties of real numbers.",
                "Functions, sequences, metric spaces, derivatives and the Riemann integral at a lot more fundamental level than Math 112/115. And you also learn proof writing a lot more rigorously than in Math 255/256. I feel a lot more confident with pure math topics thanks to this class, and I feel well-prepared to take the upper-level Math courses that follow this one.",
                "The mathematical skills I developed in this course are exactly outlined in the syllabus -- we did a great job of sticking to that. However, I also gained a lot of insight into how to be a better mathematician in general, like what to do when feeling discouraged or confused. Professor McAdam was very helpful in this regard, and it was much appreciated by all students.",
                "A deeper understanding of calculus and better understanding of proofs!",
                "The course begins with a thorough introduction to sets, fields, functions, and other basic pillars of mathematics. We then reuse these concepts over and over to derive theorems about metric spaces, series, limits, derivatives, and integrals. Most things you learn have a clear purpose later on, which I really enjoyed, but the class can be pretty tough.",

Additionally, I learned about making proofs readable and to write them according to whether it is an exam or a problem set. In terms of material, almost everything was new, but specially topology, metric spaces and sequences. I also learned about how to study mathematics.",

            "comments": [
                "the PSETs are proof based on while the proofs are logical, they often don't make intuitive sense. The professor provided class notes online which was nice.",
                "idk bro i didnt go to class. neitzke notes goated",
                "The course was taught with a lot of support; TA's, ULA's office hours really, really helped with problem sets and I should have taken advantage of them more. The material 'flowed well' - I didn't ever feel completely lost in the sauce (of all the material that needed to be covered). However, simply by nature of analysis, we had to go through multiple theorems/concepts without proofs, but the profs did their best to accomodate students along the way. It felt rushed, and we were often told to 'check the notes,' but even then, there were not many examples of applications until the notes were developed more later. However, I am extremely satisfied with the teaching itself and the professors' emphasis on interactive learning. Regardless of exam scores, you will 'learn' how to approach a theorem/problem with strong intuition if nothing else.",
                "Strengths: a ton of resources and support, challenging but fair problems sets/exams, great and understanding professors. Weaknesses: class can be a bit dull sometimes, and there was not much incentive to come to class since the content that was covered was in posted lecture notes, and either way it felt like I needed to self-study the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof. McAdam was a wonderful professor. She is kind and knows the material exceedingly well. The lectures were well organized and full of examples, which are very important in math. Office hours were accessible and helpful, and the online Ed Discussion board was as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Other than slightly slow grading, none. It was a difficult class, but I wouldn't call that a weakness necessarily.",
                "Almost all strengths: Taylor worked with a pedagogical partner and we say certain helpful things implemented over the course of the class. We had useful in-class quizzes and discussions that helped expand my understanding of analysis. This was perhaps the hardest course I've ever taken, but I really enjoyed it throughout!",
                "Strenghts: Taylor is fantastic; problem sets were hard but well-made; great resources; Neitzke's lecture notes were incredibly organized and detailed\r\nWeaknesses: homework grading could be faster, as classes are over and I haven't gotten my grades back for 4 out of 13 problem sets. The course is very fast-paced, particularly over the last weeks, but there's not much to do about this given the amount of material that must be covered.",
                "strength: very well organized\r\nweakeness: feedback on assignments took quite some time",
                "I feel like we spent too long on countability and ended up losing out on some pretty important concepts in analysis, ie power series",
                "There is a lot of material, and often it is just taught in rapid succession more as a list. In addition it will often be the case that you have to make an intuitive leap to solve a problem, and otherwise you are pretty hosed. A strength is that there is a large amount of outside of class options for help, though they vary in helpfulness.",
                "Strengths: the professors were great and the course was taught at a good pace, weaknesses: grading was very slow at times and many grades were not released even when final grades were due",
                "Strengths: great centralized notes, great problem sets and very fair exams. Great practices tests and exam materials.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: one too many psets maybe. Pset evaluations come too late.",
                "strength was depth of content",
                "The strength was how well organized it was and the availability of notes and help. I cannot really think of any weaknesses, except for maybe the homework was graded a little slowly.",
                "hw could have more down to earth human answers (answers that a student would come up with)\r\n\r\nThe recitation was at an inconvenient time",
                "Strength: lecture notes are very detailed \r\nWeaknesses: topics appear on midterms and finals have never been practiced by students via psets or practice questions",
                "I should have done more exercises when preparing the exams",
                "The major strength of this course is its rigor in developing each concept and it gives us a flavor of fundamental mathematics.",
                "The course notes were very helpful and were taught in a clear, predictable way.  Additionally, there were plenty of office hours between both sections and the TAs were very helpful."
