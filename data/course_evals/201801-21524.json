    "I learned about current issues in biology, the technology associated with it, and the ethical issues brought about my new biological findings and developments.",
    "I do feel like a have a better grasp of biology after this course, especially as a non- science major. I also feel like I can assess a lot of news articles about biology- related matters that are designed for shock factor and evaluate them realistically.",
    "new biology knowledge",
    "After taking AP Bio in high school, this course taught me biology with a focus on issues, such as GMOs, cloning, stem cell research, cancer, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about modern biology such as the opioid crisis, antibiotic resistance, and in vitro fertilization. I have taken biology classes in high school, but this course definitely covered a lot of new material that I hadn't been introduced to before and that was very interesting to me.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No real weaknesses, facilitates learning pretty well",
    "I loved this course and would highly recommend it! The work was super manageable, I liked having several lecturers give their unique perspectives, and sections provided enlightening opportunity for discussion.",
    "I wish we would focus a little less on DNA and RNA; there are a lot of other fun things in Biology to learn about. Otherwise, the head TA (Rachel) was really great.",
    "Some of the lecturers went too quickly and it was hard for me to capture all of the important information. It would have been helpful if they would have slowed down.",
    "Lecture is actually pretty interesting most of the time, but section is absolutely terrible. Class discussion was extremely forced and incredibly awkward. I left section every day feeling frustrated that this is what passes for a Yale course.",
    "given that usually many professors teach the class, it was hard to deal with the different teaching styles of each professor when we moved from topic to topic (i.e. some spoke extremely fast and were not the best at explaining complex material, others were much more patient and paced with us)",
    "The organisation of this class was outstanding, and all the lectures, despite being taught by four separate professors, flowed together and worked well as a complete whole.",
    "Strengths: first professor\r\nWeaknesses: poor focus on course development, just a bunch of random biology based on different professor's research, this is also projected as intro level bio and requires further understandings of the topic",
    "there should be a little bit more dialogue on the issues that occur with the biological information presented in class. This class also skipped around a bunch and had abrupt starts and stops in what we were learning such that it didn't feel like we were getting the full picture.",
    "Section was not as engaging as class and some of the lecturers spoke too quickly",
    "Strengths: very organized, covers a wide range of topics, discussions on ethical issues in section supplement the biological concepts learned in class, written assignments reinforce concepts\r\nWeaknesses: might have tried to tackled too many concepts for one course? But all in all, we did learn a lot of important information that will help us in understanding our world and its sociopolitical issues.",
    "The first series of lectures were great; it went downhill from there. Lectures needed some kind of continuity\/standardization of what kind\/depth of science would be taught and in how it would be tested.",
    "Strengths:  the first 2 professors of the course, particularly professor Sung, the material was always presented in a clear manner, with lots of current events to back it up \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lecture slides pretty much conveyed everything necessary for understanding the class in a VERY brief manner. As a result, engagement during exam times was limited to memorization, and connecting biological concepts from class was limited (since it required the student to go beyond the \"study guides\" of the course)",
    "Some of the instructors are much more engaging than others. I found that it was so much easier to grasp the material with certain instructors over others, which could be frustrating. The TFs in the class were very helpful though.",
    "This course did teach us about what it set out to do, and I love that we had section instead of labs, but section material and lecture material wasn't very well integrated",
    "A lot of the lectures moved too fast for the students to be able to write down and understand the material they were hearing, and I thought the exams could have been a bit shorter so we had time to check them over and finish them",
    "The material was interesting, and I definitely enjoyed learning about a breadth of topics over the course of the class. I think the course could be improved with more integration of the biology and issues portion in lecture, rather than just split between lecture and section. The tests often asked questions I feel weren't covered heavily in lecture or in the readings, but they still seemed fair enough.",
    "Strengths was that the lectures were only fifty minutes, which definitely helped to keep students engaged for the whole lecture period. The material was well taught, however the teaching styles and speeds at which the professors taught varied a lot. It would have been better to keep one lecturer for the entire course.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive, good balance between the scientific portion and the \"issues\" portion\r\nweaknesses: Because there are four lecturers, it can be a bit disorganized",
    "The volume of work was a lot. Weekly readings, three exams, plus a paper...too much.",
    "The material is mostly interesting, but the syllabus could have been planned to be more coherent. Having four instructors makes for frustrating overlaps and dissonances in material that would be eliminated with one lead professor.",
    "Overall good.",
    "There wasn't an equal approach to Issues and science on the exams.",
    "Strengths - really good balance between issues and science, science goes into the perfect level of depth (not too hard to understand and not too little learned), well-picked Issues, good readings",
    "Strengths: interesting types of technology, discussion sections were great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: terrible lecturers except for Sung, repeating lecture ideas and knowledge, tests were way too difficult and had nothing to do with discussion sections, honestly this class should have just been the discussion section, weekly discussion section assignments were unnecessary",
    "this course was great, very engaging and had a good balance of issues and biology",
    "It seemed like we had an exam every other week, and then a paper afterwards was a LOT. A lot of the lectures kind of got bogged down in the science to where it was hard to follow, especially in the beginning. The lectures were where more of the science was discussed, while the issues were kept solely to section, and I kind of wish they had been better integrated. I would have loved to have had lectures which discussed the issues, that was kind of what I was hoping for with the course in the first place",
    "Strengths:\r\n-Weekly writeup assignments\r\n-Section participation \r\n-Rachel, my TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Changing professors every few weeks was really difficult to keep up with.  Teaching styles differed literally once a month.\r\n-The final exam review sheets did not always match what was on the exam, which meant that we could not rely on review sessions to help us study for the test.",
    "The ordering of the different subjects in the course was sometimes a bit random, and even suboptimal. It seems that this could be mitigated by having the different professors communicate more between themselves on what they were gonna teach\r\n\r\nSection and the paper were by far the best parts of this course. Lecture sometimes seemed to focus on almost arbitrarily chosen peculiarities of biology",
    "The course had no strengths. It's major weakness was that it went into too much detail in lecture and was very poorly organized.\r\n\r\nThe structure with multiple professors was very confusing. Each professor talked in-depth about the topic they research, which meant the level of detail in lecture was way beyond that required for a non-major science class.\r\n\r\nThe class also had very strange policies. There was a \"don't ever tell students their section grades\" rule. This was incredibly stupid. Every week we had to write 1-2 page papers, but because TAs couldn't discuss assignments\/grades, this made it impossible to try to improve your writing for the harshly-graded term paper. Also, apparently the class will be curved, but the TAs were forbidden from sharing this information. This is a very strange policy to enact when students are averaging low Bs on every exam. Telling us would probably have boosted class confidence.\r\n\r\nStudy guides and review sessions were terrible. They barely overlapped with the material that we were tested on. This was incredibly frustrating because students would spend hours researching study guide questions and attending the review sessions to eventually learn that all their hard work was for nothing.",
    "The material for section related like 0% to the material in lecture -- its essentially two different courses.",
    "I thought this class was fairly accessible to everyone, regardless of your science background or academic pursuits here at Yale. The professors were cognizant of breaking down any scientific jargon and really rounding out discussion to focus not just on science, but also the ethics at play. Discussion sections were another core asset to the class, and really helped press the ethical\/political\/social issues that we weren't necessarily able to fully cover in lecture. As for a weakness, it was kind of hard to switch between different lecturer (and thus teaching styles), but having a constant TF and discussion section really helped maintain consistency.",
    "Weakness is having a number of different professors teach, getting just one throughout a course is better",
    "The \"issues\" and the \"biology\" side do not connect as much as they should. What we learned in section was not what we learned in lecture, and the tests covered too much material. The course rotated professors too often, and I think it tried to cover too much.",
    "I enjoyed the course material and found all the lecturers to be engaging. Some material was covered in class more quickly than I would have liked, but the TAs were always good at explaining things in section. I also wish we'd received clearer instruction in what was expected of us on the final paper.",
    "I found the course to be a very manageable science credit - I enjoyed the way it was taught.",
    "The strengths are that it is extremely organized. The weakness is that it could talk more about biology in the discussion section since ultimately the biology is way more important than the ethic involved.",
    "Great course- very in depth but instructors varied",
    "Strengths - lectures are interesting\r\nWeaknesses- most of the homework is just busy work",
    "This course is poorly taught. A lot of assumptions are made and sometimes professors will use terminology for a whole lecture that no one understands and then figure it out at the end. Dont take this if you dont want to be learning kind of difficult bio topics on your own.",
    "A strength of the class was how beneficial the section meetings were, also the class structure was organized and manageable.",
    "Strength was that the articles we read about ethical issues were interesting. Overall weakness was that science professors don't understand how to tailor a course to non-science majors. We moved too quickly through scientific course material but also didn't go into enough depth, leaving students confused about what the concepts were, how they worked, and why they were significant. Homework assignments were also incredibly tedious (although I appreciated that they weren't difficult).",
    "The TA is amazing and you receive a lot of feedback. You get a specialist to teach you each section. I thought the transition from one professor to the other was smooth.",
    "I liked this class much more than I thought I would. I missed taking science courses and it was refreshing to revisit bio. Some lecturers were more interesting than others, but my TA (Rachel Plumb) was outstanding. Discussion section was interesting and I liked the topics discussed. Sometimes the order of lectures seemed arbitrary, and there was an excessive amount of weekly work. I don't think there should be an brief essay assigned every week. And 3 exams and a final essay seems excessive.",
    "It was interesting switching up the lecturer every few weeks but also meant that some lecturers were better than others. It was nice to have professors teach on their specialties. Certain lecturers had way too much content on their slides and it was difficult to take notes at the pace they were moving at, and sometimes professors covered the same material by accident. Each professor made different assumptions about what background knowledge the students had- would be better to have this be universal. Overall though very interesting material and presented the biology in a relatively understandable way. Felt like we had an exam every 3 weeks.",
    "I think the course's goal of giving students an understanding of the science behind issues so we can develop a informed opinion is very important, and I felt that the course achieved that. I also appreciated the chance to discuss the \"issues\" in section, and the chance to delve into a topic of my interest in the final paper. However, there was some inconsistency in terms of depth of science across different lecturers, and some lecturers were better than others. I also felt that the course overall was a bit disorganized with all the different people involved.",
    "Lecture and section were both informational and helpful.",
    "Strengths: many of the lecturers, really good TFs, interesting material, well organized for learning (user friendly to review for exams and prepare the final paper). Weaknesses: many students don't talk in section or don't say interesting things (probably an us thing and not a problem with the course), some lecturers were weaker than others."

    "If you're looking for a SC credit, this course can be a good choice. But do go to class: if you skip all the time, you won't so feel good going into the three exams.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot and the workload was very light. Win-win.",
    "I think so. It's not a gut anymore, but not incredibly challenging. It was a little more work than I'd expected, though.",
    "Yes! I took this class because I needed a science credit, but I found that the information was interesting and applicable to everyday life. Definitely recommend, especially if you're looking for a relatively easy science credit, that is actually interesting, this is the one!!",
    "No.",
    "Yes definitely - a fascinating science for the non-science major.",
    "Absolutely not - please take other \"gut\" science classes, as this clearly is not",
    "no. lots of memorizing of information. seemed pointless at times. not much connection between the science and the issues.",
    "I would recommend it for someone interested in biology and the ethical issues new innovations present.",
    "Sure, if they need a science credit.",
    "Yes. If you are a social sciency person like me I think you will like it! I appreciated how it felt so much more relevant than other classes I've taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in biology and health, but is not sure if they want to major in it. The course is not super in depth, but it does give the student a wide variety of material that will catch interest in some way.",
    "If you need a science credit, take it. You won't love it.",
    "This is not a class where you can coast. If you recognize that, the class can be pretty cool because of its integrations of social and ethical questions that it brings to the forefront. That said, this is definitely still a class where you will need to know some science.",
    "Yes! This class is a great and engaging way to fulfill a science requirement while still feeling like you're learning science. It also tackled a lot of really interesting topics",
    "yes if they are interested in science, but not to a student who has not had a strong science background because it is difficult",
    "I would recommend this course to a student if they do not wish to pursue the BIOL 101\/102 track, but still want to become literate in biology. However, to seems like the exams are worded so that it is hard to know exactly what the question is asking. Also, with the changing of lecturers, it is sometimes difficult to adapt to their lecture style and understand which information is just supplemental and which we are supposed to memorize.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who are not planning on majoring in the science field. The material that we learned was intriguing, but also challenging.",
    "A good science class to take for non-science majors",
    "Yes, as it was engaging but not too difficult. Especially useful for non-STEM majors looking for a science credit.",
    "Take this course for an okay science credit. This semester they beefed up the workload a bit which meant you had to write a 2 page essay response every weekbummer. Other than that, easy class and enjoyable.",
    "No. It's not really a gut.",
    "No. Only if they restructure the class to actually be issues-focused\/the tests reflective of that rather than specifically an intro to bio basically.",
    "yes, this is a great course because it gives you insights to biology that can allow you to formulate better opinions on issues in the world.",
    "It is not a gut , do not be fooled into thinking it is a gut especially if you were not a strong science student in high school.",
    "I took this class because I am horrible at science and I almost failed it.  I'm not sure if there are easier courses out there to fulfill the SC requirement, but if there are I would recommend looking into them first.",
    "Nope. It's not a gut and the professors are awful at dumbing down the information for non-majors. The material we learned had nothing to do with \"Issues.\" It was just a (too) in-depth lesson on whatever the the professor was researching. The study guide and review session were very little help in prepping for exams.",
    "idk",
    "As a non-STEM major with an interest in biology, I thought this class really fit what I was looking for in a science credit. The science is fairly vigorous, but we really learn what is necessary to speak about the ethical\/social\/political issues intelligently. The professors do make an effort to break down the language so it is easier to understand. I really looked forward to discussion sections; while the work was a little more than I had expected, the readings were a good read and something I could easily see myself casually reading outside of this class.",
    "Yes; if interested in biology",
    "No, I would not for a science credit.",
    "If you're a non-STEM person looking for a science credit that's accessible but teaches you actual science, this is the one to take! But don't think you'll be able to breeze through without attending lectures, there's real science here.",
    "Definitely- a great science credit for a non-STEM student!",
    "Yes, if they are organized enough to really study the material.",
    "Yes",
    "No. For a gut not worth the weekly work",
    "I reccomend this class because it puts a spin on science in order to evaluate current issues from an ethical standpoint, an important part of science that can easily be overlooked.",
    "I guess I'd recommend it to someone who needed a science credit (because as a non-science person it's difficult to find a science course that isn't too challenging), but the course could really benefit from better organization and perhaps some insight from non-science majors or professors.",
    "I highly recommend it to any student who wants to get a superficial, but yet very interesting, insight into what is happening in the world of biology.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students interested in biology who need a science credit, especially people interested in politics. The lectures are very science-heavy and the discussion sections are ethics and politics based. You should know that the course requires more work than you might expect.",
    "Yeah this is a great class to take as a 5th class or for a science credit. Make sure you get a good TA. Interesting material and good lecturers, not too much weekly homework but a lot of tests.",
    "This course is a good science credit in terms of actual being useful, so I would recommend it for that.",
    "Yes, it was a perfect science class for a non-science major. It covered major issues and tied in political applications.",
    "Yes"
