I took positions on things that I once thought only PhD students had the right to assess- if that makes sense. This is a valuable skill that I will carry with me into future courses.",
                "I developed a much more rigorous understanding of the term \"decadence\", which is the core focus of the class. I also strengthened my writing ability through my professors thorough and critical feedback.",
                "I think that this course really helped give me a strong foundation with my research and writing skills. Learning about the library systems, reading texts and discussing them in class, and writing and peer editing papers has all definitely made me a better writer."

                "Weakness: more harsh in comparison to other ENGL 114 classes. Worried about my grade.",
                "The main strength of the course is that it allows for one topic to be engaged for an entire semester. I found a course on decadence, a subject that I had little prior knowledge of, to be incredibly interested and intersected with my other course material well. Another strength is of course the intention of the course which is to be writing heavy. This was great as a first year, first semester course because it gave me ample opportunity to improve and to have assignments that weren't weighted heavily for grading. However, this means that the workload is intense and the deadlines are always imminent. I think the class could easily be restructured to move around some of the deadlines for material or have maybe one less major assignment.",
                "I think that the course was very strong. The work was all helpful and definitely developed my skills. The class was small, but that made the class discussions very interesting and we were able to all discuss openly and everyone contributed multiple times to discussions in every class period."

                "Yes, however I have not yet seen my overall grade. This class was challenging in comparison to other ENGL 114 classes and it was sometimes frustrating to hear my other peers talk about how they finished their assignments far before me.",
                "I might recommend this course to someone who wants to sharpen up their college writing. However, I seem to find that the writing expectations for this course are higher than for other courses (even English courses I am taking). So if another student isn't interested in that specific fine-tuning and feels confident in their writing then this might not be the right course. Subject wise, yes! Definitely recommend a lovely seminar on a broad and rich topic."
