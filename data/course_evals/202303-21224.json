                "I learned about the ways theater can help war veterans, sexual violence survivors, refugees from war and more process through their trauma and share their stories with loved ones. I learned that dramatherapy uses theater in unconventional ways and that those methods are often more effective than full-scale productions. I learned that dramatherapy works on more than an American scale and that there are global artists and doctors using theater, music, and the environment to facilitate healing in small batches. (I think I also learned that you can't commercialize or mass-standardize healing of this sort and that it's most effective on smaller scales.)",
                "I learned so much about not only theater and therapy techniques, which I am especially interested in, but also gained an insight about veterans and the applications of creative therapies to help them cope after war.",
                "I learned so much about military trauma and the modes of performance that are used to help those struggling. We had fantastic guest speakers from a variety of backgrounds, including performance art and hands-on work with the VA. We were able to talk through and throw ideas around about very complex and painful realities of our world. It was a truly great course.",
                "The main topics I gained knowledge in by taking this course were theater, therapy, war, and the ways in which they intersect. In addition, I gained valuable skills related to writing, group discussion, reflection, oral presentations, interviewing, and making connections across varying contexts and disciplines."

                "The readings were really strong! And it was very clear week by week how things related to each other and built on top of the other, which some classes lose sight of. This was also one of those rare classes where you learn not only from the professor but from your classmates, and discussions were very insightful and thought provoking. The guest speakers were also really knowledgeable and doing really creative things. Something I valued was that there was freedom to disagree with the speakers who came in and discuss what got us there. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I'd say is that since the course is new, sometimes readings were uploaded with only a day or two before class, and some assignment instructions were unclear. But I think that will come with time since the syllabus was being amended as the semester went on. And though the guest speakers were great and I learned a lot from them, I feel there wasn't a lot of time toward the end of the semester for the class to unpack everything we'd learned past the midterm.",
                "Well-organized syllabus and connections between weeks; I particularly enjoyed our trip to see Brian Doerries' Theater of War project in Manhattan!",
                "This course was just fantastic. The topics were so interesting, and I appreciated that it was a smaller group so we could all give lots of input and feel comfortable sharing personal details with the class.",
                "I think a big strength of the course is Professor Morrison. She was able to provide such careful and knowledgeable leadership in the classroom and created a very interesting and not overly dense syllabus. The seminar set-up lent itself to good discussion, and the midterm/final prompts were narrow enough to be approachable but also broad enough to allow for creativity.",
                "I loved that there were so many opportunities for students to explore their own specific and personal areas of interest within the course's overarching themes, such as by selecting a person to interview for the midterm or suggesting readings. A related strength was that we had weekly opportunities for self-reflection via the reading responses. I also appreciated how simultaneously niche and thorough the course was. For example, I did not know much about war prior to the course, but I emerged with a whole new set of perspectives, evidence, and texts. I had a phenomenal experience in taking the course and learned so much from both the professor and my peers. One tiny way it might be improved could be through making the weekly readings' themes flow more smoothly from week to week."

                "Yes! Especially the HSHM/ER&M/PreMed/Social science girlies. It's a great mix of theater, psychology, theories of war, and abolition in a surprising way. Easily in my top 3 classes at Yale.",
                "Yes, absolutely! It was a lovely course and you will learn so much about topics that are interesting on their own, but especially compelling when combined.",
                "Yes! It is a fairly niche (but super interesting and surprisingly relevant) overlap of disciplines, but great conversations always came out of class sessions. Dr. Morrison is great and cares so much about this field, and we are very much given room to explore whatever suptopics appeal to us.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has even a passing interest in the intersection of theater and therapy, you won't regret taking it.",
                "I HIGHLY recommend taking this course. I don't mean to sound cheesy, but it seriously opened my eyes to new perspectives I had not considered before, whether it was through Professor Morrison's brilliance, my peers' unique lived experiences as shared in weekly class discussions, or insights gained through the niche, fascinating texts and video readings."
