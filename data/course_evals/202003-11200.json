                "Strength: you get an in-depth understanding of how to construct formal reports on current events, and are able to read formal reports. Weakness: besides the oral reports we give once every two weeks, you don't have a lot of opportunities to practice speaking Chinese in a discussion setting",
                "Weakness: The course was heavily affected by the online format. It is much more difficult to facilitate discussion between classmates and the professor via zoom. I also feel that we spent more time listening to the professor go over grammar points and less time actually practicing speaking.\r\n\r\nStrengths: The professor is very kind and committed to helping you do your best in the class. The material is well organized and assignments are well spread out. Students are encouraged to improve according to their own baseline as students are have different levels\/experience.",
                "strengths - the course is very well taught and not meant to be stressful\/anxiety-inducing at all, Zhou Laoshi is very flexible with deadlines especially given the extenuating circumstances of this semester!\r\n\r\nweaknesses - more time could be dedicated to more casual conversations (I especially enjoyed the movie analysis part of the class)",
                "Strengths: good selection of news topics\/vocabulary, predictable format, well-structured class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the structure of the class can make things feel a little too repetitive and cookie-cutterwould benefit from more variation in assignments",
                "A clear strength of this course is its exclusive use of authentic news materials  both written and audiovisual  to teach and practice using real, high-level Chinese in context.  This course also benefits from its inclusion of a wide variety of topics, which ensures each unit is fresh and engaging for students.  In addition, Professor Zhou personally added a great deal to this course through his lively and caring style of instruction, as well as his commitment to ensuring each student received tailored feedback and individualized help no matter what their proficiency level."

However, the lectures were effective in teaching us new vocabulary and grammar that is used in formal writing.",

                "If your goal is to write in formal Chinese and read formal written Chinese, then yes! This course is really great for that. However, considering how little the course met and how long we spent going over new words and grammar, there's not much opportunity to practice or improve one's spoken Chinese. So, if your goal is to improve your spoken Chinese, then this wouldn't be the best class for that.",

                "definitely!! Zhou Laoshi emphasizes learning at your individual speed so you get as much as you put into this course, all in all, it was a very fun high-level Chinese course that I don't think we can learn elsewhere after graduation",
                "Yep, very solid course covering relevant contemporary topics",
                "Absolutely.  Professor Zhou has done an excellent job making this an interesting, far-reaching, and  most importantly  extremely practical course.  For anyone interested in learning and practicing how to use Chinese in both daily life and professional settings, this course is perhaps the most useful you can take at Yale or beyond."
