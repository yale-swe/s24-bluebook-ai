I also write in French at a better level than in the first half of the year. I can sit down and write fluently in French without aid\/ a dictionary for  200 words, min 100 words.",

                "Tiffany was really caring and supportive! However, I'm not sure if this course is as helpful as for students whose first language is not English. I think the curriculum should be more attentive to international students who want to learn French at Yale.",
                "The class is basically a continuation of French 110, with similar teaching materials like French in Action and handouts. Only difference--and a plus of this couse--is that there are bi-weekly tests instead of weekly ones from 110. I thought this made the course a bit less stressful than 110, but I will admit that it made every exam have higher stakes in general. French in Action is a great program, but I do think that it is slightly archaic at this point and I look forward to seeing how they will develop the French program here at Yale in the future.",
                "The strengths are that everything was very clear from Day 1. All the resources I needed to succeed were readily available. I also felt that our discussion sections very very engaging.",
                "This is a good course. A strength is the professor. Mine was Professor Tiffany Premand. She is an excellent instructor, and when unable to understand, she seeks other ways to help students understand. She used innovative ways to help us solidify our understanding of the materials. The weakness is definitely the French In Action series, I always felt it was mostly unhelpful and I had to look for other resources online or consult my instructor on things which I should have learned from the book, the story is entertaining but some parts of the workbook are just busy work and tedious. Searching for a better teaching resource would take this program to the next level.",
                "I was very pleased with the focus on conversational language, as while I do understand the need for learning grammar, it shouldn't be the primary focus of a language course in my opinion.",
                "Great class! Everyone participated actively in discussions. I do wish we learned slightly more vocabulary but overall was extremely pleased with the setup, and Tiffany was a superb instructor.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- effective at teaching French\r\n- small class size help with engagement\r\n- encourages oral communication and comprehension\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- the Capretz method (which will soon be replaced)"

                "It depends. French is a very intensive class even among Yale languages, so for many people I would suggest an easier alternative if they were only interested in fulfilling their base DRs. If they are truly interested in wanting a useful language, however, I would absolutely recommend it.",
