    "Critical thinking about studying up, and how to study privilege.  Methodological as well as ethical issues of research.  We learned a lot about who privilege as a system operates and maintains itself.",
    "I learned many perspectives through which to analyze privilege. I enhanced the language that I use to explain privilege in terms of gender, emotions, housing, race, etc.",
    "Developed an understanding of \"studying up\" and learned a lot about ethnographic research",
    "I became more cognizant of my own privilege and also how it permeates through our society and structures our conversations. I also gained insight into many different areas of American and Latin American culture in things such as housing, beauty, elite schooling, finance, and race.",
    "To think about privilege in larger contexts and analyze the systems that reproduce it",
    "Critical thinking, writing skills, seminar discussion, etc.",
    "This class broadened my ability to engage in productive conversation regarding social and financial inequalities. The articles and books that we read weekly were deeply engaging and produced lively classroom conversation. This class strengthened my ability to articulate thoughts regarding difficult conversations on inequalities that become apparent across race, classes and genders.",
    "It was a great course where I learnt various aspects of privilege through the lens of sociology. The professor was extremely dedicated and very knowledgeable and the students in the class made a great group for discussions."

    "The course was great in that there were many diverse readings that touched upon a variety of topics. I also just found the readings incredibly interesting most of the time. I also think that Professor Ramos -Zayas is an incredibly kind and supportive person who had an incredible understanding of course material.",
    "The readings are all fascinating and eye-opening, the discussions are extremely engaging and thought-provoking. I have enjoyed everything about the course.",
    "I liked this course because it was extremely interesting with greatly varied topics covered on the syllabus. I loved that we got to also study south American cultures. sometimes the writing assignments were difficult to complete, maybe more workshops or a rubric would help clarify the expectations. \r\nSome days, we would have entire books assigned and it really hard to complete them, it would have been nice to have sections that were highlighted by the professor so we could pay attention to certain parts when we didn't have enough time",
    "The courses strengths is its content. The topics that we engaged in were unlike any others I've dealt with during my time at Yale. Another strength is Professor Ramos-Zayas's ability to spark engaging discussion. Professor starts each class with a framing lecture that puts all of the students in a particular perspective that will facilitate discussion.  I can't think of an area in which this course needed improvement.",
    "It was great, no major improvements or changes suggested."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "This course is an introduction to privilege in the Americas. I really enjoyed the class because the readings were incredibly interesting am the Professor is very kind. Keep in mind, however, that students are expected to submit weekly reading responses which become a big burden sometimes. The Professor also requires that students lead discussion which was disappointing at times because I felt that the Professor could have added to the conversation if she had led it too.",
    "Yes -- for anyone who wants to look at \"how the other half lives\" from a sociological perspective, Professor Ramos-Zayas is a great resource and teaches a great course here.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn more about issues of inequality\/care at all about how this, then by all means take this class! We are in such a privileged position as Yalies and it really helps to understand the larger forces at play here and have tools to discuss and understand the concept of privilege better.",
    "YES! I love the professor because she is knowledgable, you really learn a lot. The readings were always interesting and although the weekly responses were tedious, they help you understand the readings better and help you think about them in a different way!",
    "Absolutely! Super interesting material taught by an amazing and intelligent professor. This class will change the way you think about the world and everyone around you, it changed my life.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Hands down one of my favorite classes at Yale - ever. \r\nIt will give you critical perspectives on ideas of privilege and systemic inequalities that are so pertinent to today's political climate and conversations. This class is not taught according to politics and is absolutely one based on the social sciences and a lot of ethnographic research but it is relevant and applicable in so many conversations that we engage in daily.",
    "I would highly recommend it. Especially as a graduate student I gained a lot from taking a course outside my own department and interacting my undergraduate students."
