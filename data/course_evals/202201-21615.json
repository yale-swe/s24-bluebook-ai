                "Yes! It is relatively low stress, but you learn a lot, and the professor is great. It's an awesome learning environment",

                "Yes. The Korean department is supportive and Im  is the best",

                "Absolutely. I think the Korean program here is phenomenal. The instructors are great, and I think you could go into the class with little or no interest in Korean and come out very interested in the language. You also get what you put into the class. But if you don't have hours every day to study the language it isn't required to do well in the class. This class is often the highlight of my day."
