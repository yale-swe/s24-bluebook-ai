I understood the value of group study and start to focus on CONCEPTS rather than memorization. I believe this class is a good transition from high school to college.",

                "This is an excellent introductory biology course that combines relevant ideas from biology, chemistry, and physics to create developed knowledge about the science of life. The way this course was taught emphasized understanding over memorization, and that focus helped me improve my studying. I feel I developed vital critical thinking and reasoning skills since everything we learned built upon each other, which encouraged me to think about the concepts in different ways. We also touched upon reading and discussing scientific literature, an aspect I did not expect but very much enjoyed.",

I also learned about different experimental techniques used in biology research, along with how to build the skills necessary to read and analyze scientific papers.",
                "I learned a lot about proteins, DNA, RNA, and intermolecular forces. I learned how to apply biological concepts instead of just memorizing them, and I learned how to learn through a flipped class format.",

                "The flipped classroom structure really affected how well I understood the content, and I often felt that I had to do everything on my own. For example, the professors and TAs had no listed office hours, and all the interactive activities overlapped with lab or other classes. I greatly believe that having more in class interaction would have really enhanced the course",
                "It is a flipped class so there are definitely strength and weaknesses to this format. A strength is that it allows the class to move rather quickly and the student can choose when to view the lectures.",
                "Strengths: The focus was on concepts rather than memorization, so it was helpful to have study guides during the quizzes to apply to the questions. Enrichment sessions were so helpful. I am able to recap a lot of my learning in enrichment. Professor Harrington is the best!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were more questions on the quizzes, so the grading would not be as harsh if I missed one question. I wish there were more reminders (or some kind of platform) for assignment due dates because they are easy to miss due to the obscure deadlines and the number of assignments.",
                "The course is asynchronous, which I thought was one of its strengths. I could learn the lecture material on my own time at my own pace.",
                "The virtual lectures were quite long, and I didn't feel like they were available for enough days to properly manage when they could be done. I liked having benchmarks due every week because it made doing the final project a much less intimidating task.",
                "Thus course reused recorded lectures instead of having in person lectures which was very frustrating and harmed my engagement. Instead of looking forward to an interesting lecture each week I dreaded having to watch the prerecorded lectures.",
                "Strengths: I really liked the structure of the class, it kept it low stress but I still felt I learned a lot; the teaching team was also really supportive and I found them all really helpful \r\nWeaknesses: More a critique of the way the BIOL sequence is run in general but the turnover of staff and course structure every six weeks is a little difficult to navigate",
                "The course definitely provides many ways that support the students. One weakness is the lectures where Guest Lecturer Dr. Kabeche was teaching because I feel that she didn't explain the concepts well enough, and it left wanting Professor Koelle to explain them.",
                "Strengths: grading is fair with opportunities divided amongst the quizzes, final project, and homework. Weaknesses: the final project can seem a little daunting but depending who your TA is the process can be different levels of stressful (I felt supported by mine).",
                "I felt a strength of this course was the pacing of assignments. Though the learning was fast-paced due to the short time period, the professors structured it to really reinforce learning through weekly quizzes, which I felt greatly benefited my understanding. I also liked how the final project was divided between weeks, as I felt that having small sections due at one time improved my work quality. One thing I struggled with was finding ways to test my knowledge. I would have preferred that the homework more often covered the actual content we learned because otherwise, I had trouble studying. More opportunities to practice applying our knowledge would have been helpful.",
                "A strength of this course is that the content is accessible to students who have not taken courses like AP Biology while also going more into depth on mechanisms and examples (like new technology) that might interest students who have more experience in biochemistry and biology. Having a professor, a teaching fellow in discussion sections, and a mentor for the project creates many points of contact for learning in the course. A weakness is the number of assignments in the course throughout the week in addition to having to watch the video lectures, leaving less time to \"plan ahead\" for large assignments since there was always something due immediately.",
                "Strengths: asynch lectures, lectures were to the point and easy to understand for the most part, quizzes were fair and we were given the resources to be successful, papers that were difficult to read were supplemented with staff annotations, section focussed on collaboration, and the final project was really cool. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the weekly quizzes are rough but kept me on my game.",
                "Strengths: clear deadlines, very organized \r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of peer interaction",
                "Strengths: The course material is very engaging, in my opinion, and the enrichment opportunities provided to students are a resource everyone in this course should try and take advantage of.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is asynchronous, so you have to watch lectures outside of class. While these lectures claim to be the same amount of time as a regular lecture, in reality taking notes while watching them takes up much more time. In addition, the discussion sections didn't really add anything to how well I understood what was being taught in the course- they often felt a little pointless.\r\n\r\nImprovements: I believe that this course would be more engaging if it was synchronous instead of asynchronous as it was this semester.",
                "Strengths: Manageable P-sets, moderately difficult quizzes, very generous grading distribution, dedicated teachers, interesting and engaging content\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "This is one of the most organized and well-taught STEM classes I've taken at Yale so far. Every assignment is laid out in advance. Enrichment sections and collaborative homework sessions are very helpful. The lectures can be viewed at your own pace and the workload is manageable. Overall a very good course. Slight weakness: it would be nice if the lectures were available for viewing earlier. They open on Sunday and are due Wednesday by noon, however, on Monday is the quiz for the previous unit so it ends up being about a day to watch all 2 or 3 hours of lectures.",
                "There was not great consistency in grading",
                "Strengths: even distribution of workload throughout the half-semester, content covered was interesting and challenging, yet manageable and well explained, plenty of built-in academic support especially with enrichment and study halls!\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "I don't think there were any office hours, I would appreciate some office hours.",
                "Strengths were that the course provided many opportunities to succeed in the course. There was a reasonable amount of work.",
                "I really liked the collaborative homework sessions and peer tutors are awesome. Prof Koelle and all of the teaching staff is really kind and the grading is generous. My only complaint is the way the quizzes were worded. Sometimes they felt a little too cryptic and I wouldn't necessary get the answer wrong, but I just wouldn't be answering the question correctly, if that makes sense.",
                "Strengths: explaining each topic fully so that we are well prepared for the quizzes\r\nWeaknesses: short turn around time for watching the video lectures",
                "The course is very information-heavy, which can be both a strength and a weakness. For the most part, I did not mind the online format, but at times, it left me less engaged with the material. I think one of the main strengths was how the final project was organized, with weekly papers and subsequent feedback that helped keep me on track.",
                "Strengths of this course include plenty of options to ask for help and providing good basics for building a foundation in biology. One weakness of this course is that the wording of the quizzes are sometimes confusing and vague.",
                "I liked the virtual lectures because it gave a lot of flexibility. I think there were limited places to ask questions, though, which made it difficult to get anything answered before quizzes\/homework assignments.",
                "I actually really enjoyed the asynchronous layout. The weekly quizzes were a bit daunting at first, but were actually quite manageable and I got used to the routine. Now that I've started BIOL 102, which has in-person lectures, I realize I prefer learning at my own pace with the videos. I don't feel that I learned much from discussion sections in 101, so maybe this will change in 102. There was a lot of support given, from Enrichment to Peer Tutor office hours, which I was very grateful for.",
                "If you take enrichment as I did I think it definitely helps you maintain engagement in the course and for that reason, I see enrichment as a reason for the course to be very strong. Also, the way grade distribution works helps the students. The overall teaching team is strong as well.",
                "I liked that the course was asynchronous yet there were still many opportunities for me to get help if needed. I was able to pause, take notes, and rewatch the lectures, which really helped me. The only downside of the course for me was the amount of work. I felt like I was putting in hours and hours of work into this one class, which made me struggle a bit during the semester. Looking back it all helped me learn the material sufficiently, but at the time the course was very stress inducing.",
                "Strength: Knowledge is tested in multiple different forms: quizzes, homeworks, extended projects and interactive sessions\r\nI particularly enjoyed the Final Project which refamiliarized me with reading Scientific Papers"

                "I would recommend this course for general biology knowledge, but a lot of learning is done on your own through textbook or by going to office hours\/enrichment. This course helps frame you to think in a concept-minded way.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course to someone who knows they are interested in the broad field of biology and want to get started on a deeper understanding of it.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course because I got experience reading scientific papers and applying my knowledge to more complex concepts like COVID. Even with some biology background, you can still be challenged.",
                "No because I did not like the format of watching prerecorded lectures.",
                "Yeah, if you have to take it I think it's a relatively enjoyable pre-req",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I feel that it builds the scientific foundation for you to continue taking upper-level science courses.",
                "Yes! Even if not necessarily for a pre-req, if you don't know much about biology and are prepared to invest the time (not a gut) you'll learn a lot!",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in expanding their knowledge of biology, whether for their major or not. This course is very accessible to students at all levels of biology knowledge. The teaching goes beyond rote knowledge, too - I learned critical thinking and reasoning skills that will help me in many other non-biology-related classes.",
                "For people who need to or could take this course for a major requirement, I would recommend it because the material is fairly approachable and the content is varied enough between the weeks so as to never be too boring, dense, or repetitive. However, I would suggest people looking for a science distribution requirement to choose a different class since this class was more of an overview of basic biology concepts that I felt I had already learned to a degree in high school (even without AP Biology).",
                "Honestly, yeah. I think BIOL101 is taught in a way that rewards hard work rather than magically getting a good grade on an exam. I never felt discouraged while trying to learn the content or get better grades. This class is an anomaly among STEM classes at Yale (maybe try to teach the Chem department a thing or two. There's a reason Yale's bio department as far more undergrad students than the Chem department).",
                "Yes if it is a prerequisite",
                "Yes, if you're in any biological major or you're pre-med! If you're looking for a course to fulfill your science credit, this course is also pretty great but since it's introductory it doesn't really touch on current topics in science until the end of the course, which can be a drawback.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about biochemistry. The class itself was very well structured.",
                "Yes I would recommend this class, although most people are just taking it as a pre-rec. It's a well-taught class, and you will definitely learn the material if you put in the work. Overall, and interesting and relatively chill STEM class.",
                "yes; it was very well organized",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was extremely well-organized, interesting, and had a manageable workload.",
                "Yes, a great introduction for what is to come of your biology experience at Yale.",
                "Yes, because I felt that we were given all the tools to do well in the course and the material was interesting",
                "Yes! Even if you aren't premed or STEM, this course is great for learning basic biology concepts.",
                "Yes, it is a great introduction to the topics of biochemistry and biophysics.",
                "I would recommend this course to others that are interested in biology.",
                "Yes, as it gave me a good foundation for Biology and it was manageable.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It solidifies the biology foundation that I received in high school, but I do feel that it went a bit more in depth. There is a lot of support, the professors want to see you succeed, and it is a good way to start a journey into learning about biology.",
                "I would recommend BIOL 101 to any student for a science involvement as it never becomes unbearably difficult but with the right amount of work success is all but guaranteed.",
                "Yes I would because this class is a good introduction to the science classes at Yale. It's low stakes and doesn't burn you out and it teaches good applications of basic biochemical knowledge.",
                "I would simply because I think that the content is interesting. I would make sure to tell them to only take this course if they do not have an overwhelming schedule or if they are really passionate about biology, because the amount of work and effort required to gain an adequate understanding in this class is strenuous.",
