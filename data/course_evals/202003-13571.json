                "Strengths: the lectures are well structured and you will actually learn a lot in 1hour15. The course is fairly small and mostly everyone was very engaged. The grading is fair. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the homework problems don't always follow from what we learned in class. Sometimes, the pace is too fast and your brain will feel like mush.",
                "Strengths\r\n-VANDERLICK!!! BEST PROFESSOR EVER\r\n-Lots of help offered\r\n-Very fair grading scheme\r\n-interesting material\r\n-manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-TA could have been better prepared",
                "I wish there were some sort of class notes or textbook that I could've read that followed the class. I easily got lost in lectures and in most classes I would turn to the textbook to learn the material, but this class didn't really follow a textbook and no class notes were provided. Overall, I felt like learning the material was hard for me because I felt like I didn't have the resources to learn the material. Even though the lectures were recorded, rewatching the lectures didn't help me better understand the material. I went to office hours but was often so confused I didn't know what I didn't know and what questions to ask. The one thing that I found very helpful in learning the material were the  3-4 review sessions that were held after the first exam in preparation for the mulligan. Those review sessions really helped me learn the material, so I wish there were these type of review sessions before every test.",
                "The strength of this class is Professor Vanderlick. This class is just one of the hardest classes at Yale, and she made it much less stressful than I would have walked in expecting. She demands very high engagement with the class, but knows how to gauge the audience well and answer our questions to the best capacity. The weakness of this class is probably just the fact that the course materials take up most of the time of your semester, and that there is little handout material to work on (i.e. you have to watch recorded lectures if you miss the class). I would say that's not really much of a weakness, because honestly if you do not pay enough attention to Fluids you just will not get it. The class's grading scheme might seem complicated at first, but Professor Vanderlick is accommodating in a way that it is mainly up to you to put in the work.",
                "This course emphasizing the Fluid Mechanics material that is relevant to chemical engineers and does not spend much time on the material that is more important mechanical engineers. The course being structured in this way was great.",
                "This course is really well taught by Professor Vanderlick, and this is the second class that I have had with her.",
                "Strengths: Vanderlick is an incredible professor. A great lecturer, cares about her students, cant recommend her enough.\r\nWeaknesses: its very much a class where youre thrown in and you just have to figure out how to swim. Can be overwhelming at times, but definitely builds problem-solving skills.",
                "Strengths: small class size (it's a class geared toward chemical engineering students specifically, so these are the students who will be in many of your other classes for junior and senior year)\r\nWeaknesses: lectures sometimes lacked structure; example problems were almost never solved all the way through; exam grading is a bit subjective since she doesn't grade using points; course grade is determined solely from average of exams",
                "The supplementary material (swiffers, clarification videos) is a big plus for this course because they ensure students are thinking properly about the material. One weakness I would point out is the speed at which material is presented. Some material is taught thoroughly with examples while other material is only mentioned yet still appears on the homework assignments."

She also has a very fair grading system. \r\n\r\nIt's really difficult material, but super interesting.

If you are not those Engineering majors, maybe if you would like to challenge yourself; I wouldn't really expect anyone except maybe Physics students to consider the course.",

The course is challenging, but Professor Vanderlick will make sure that you have all of the resources you need to be successful in this course. Definitely a large time commitment, but you will learn a lot and the some of the material is really interesting.",

However, it is definitely very challenging and if you want to get the most out of it you need to dedicate a lot of your time and effort. To get a sense of how much time and energy you need to put in, I was told that this course \"took the sparkle out of my eyes\". If you don't commit yourself fully, you are wasting your time because you will still have to put in a lot of work to get a decent grade."
