                "The course was great, especially during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Professor Smooke is my favorite professor in the MENG department. He cares deeply about his students and tries to tailor the content to the interests of his students. If I had one suggestion to make, I would offer that we go offer more non-textbook practice problems.",
                "Professor Smooke is an excellent teacher. He plans out his class extremely thoroughly in advance and gives every step needed to understand what he is doing so his lessons are clear. He very much cares about the students and there are lots of office hours because of this so if you are struggling, you can succeed.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness for this class was that the in class lectures were too similar to the recorded ones. This made it hard to focus in class or hard to find the motivation to watch the videos ahead of time.",
                "The course did a great job of explaining the material in the textbook, but it was up to the student to practice with questions and get a stronger understanding of the applications in preparation for the exams.",
                "The bing exposed to all material twice via pre-recorded lecture and live class is helpful, given how difficult the material can be.",
                "Strengths - Prof. Smooke makes the class very fair in terms of grading and difficulty, and is good at helping you understand how the concepts you are learning about in class translate into real-life settings. He also made sure a lot of support was available since fluids is a difficult class.\r\nWeakness - Prof. Smooke is a really fast lecturer, which makes it hard to take notes in class at times.",
                "Strengths of this course include the teaching, readily available resources for help and the very engaging content. Weaknesses include the need for more practice problems and the online format.",
                "This class was taught very well by professor Smooke, especially given the constraints of a 2020 virtual education",
                "I think that this course would obviously have been better if taught in person. I think that the strengths were the material is interesting and Prof. Smooke is good at explaining things. The weaknesses were that grading was a little frustrating at times and the semester was not evenly divided up. I think we could have had fewer exams or not have been so rushed.",
                "Strength: watching the lecture before class and then going over the material again was very helpful. Exams were actually representative of material which was good. Weaknesses: could have done without one of the exams, it felt like we had them so often that especially by the last exam there wasn't much material on them, history\/context presented to us was pretty narrow and not diverse",
                "I think the biggest strength was Professor Smooke and the TAs being understanding that the coursework is already difficult (and offering a course like fluid mechanics during a remote semester would only make it harder) which was reflected through how manageable the homework and the willingness for accommodations to be made; however, that's where the strengths of the course end for me. I thought the virtual module\/in-person lecture format was very confusing. If you paid attention during both, you were relearning information in the lecture that you already saw in the module. This made me, personally, unwilling to do twice the work to learn the same amount of information. Due to this, I opted to attend in-person lectures, but when Professor Smooke taught, he went so quickly through derivations and problems that the class was unable to keep up. This would make sense if he were teaching for the entirety of the 75-minutes; however, he would end class up to 45 minutes early. I could've more easily retained the information if he just taught the same information in a larger time window.",
                "Professor Smooke is great! He truly cares about his students and what they learn.",
                "Professor Smooke is the ultimate strength of this course. The material was interesting and a good combination of math and science like most of the more theoretical engineering courses.",
                "Prof Smooke included little snippets of history or specific applications of the subjects we studied in lecture. This was really nice, because it broke up a rather complex subject with some more simple context. I'd say fluids was a very well put together and organized course, and there aren't any specific weaknesses I can think of. Exams are fair and balanced, and you know what it is you'll need to study.",
                "Strengths were the amazing Professor",
                "Very tough course",
                "Strengths: lectures were really well made and the pre recording explanations were very helpful.  \r\nWeakness: More examples like the homework in class lectures would be helpful.",
                "Covers a good range of topics. Can sometimes be hard to see how the subtopics connect to each other and you can get lost in the math, but overall quite good and delivers a strong understanding of fluid mechanics basics.",
                "Very well structured.",
                "Strengths were the ability to view the course on our own before\/after the synchronous portion of the test. Weakness was how quickly we moved in the live portions.  It would have helped to have a video of a whiteboard and the professor writing out the math and equations as he goes along, instead of having them pre-written and blazing through them.",
                "Strength: Professor Smooke made a point of including videos and real-world examples in each class. I have a lot of trouble focusing on theory so these videos helped me a lot by putting the material into a context that I could understand. They also just made class a lot more interesting. Also there were a lot of office hours which led me to actually understand material rather than just get it done.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes Smooke got carried away with the videos. Right before an exam is just not the best time for half the class to be videos.",
                "This is a great course for those preparing to work in areas where characterizing fluid flow is crucial. The course was well-organized (I took this class in the Fall 2020, and Professor Smooke and his assistants evidently spent a lot of time over the summer preparing it to be taught virtually), and from what I can gather with my limited experiences working in related fields, he covered the most important topics within introductory fluid mech.\r\nThe lectures are clear. The exams seemed well-written, fair, and good tests of what we had covered in class. In exams, topics seemed to be appropriately weighted by their relative importance and the amounts of time we had spent on them. Though straight from the textbook, psets were good tests of the concepts we had seen in the past week.\r\nProfessor Smooke did a great job of incorporating examples of technologies and historical events based on the concepts we were learning. He and his TAs also did a good job of keeping the tone of the class upbeat and fun, even during weeks with more complicated concepts and greater workloads.\r\nOne weakness I would highlight (and which Ive noticed in other classes this COVID-impacted semester as well) is that we didnt cover quite as much material as the instructor had planned because we ran out of time. (We didnt really cover computational\/numerical methods of solving some of the fluid equations of motion.)\r\nThe TAs were also very helpful, and had plenty of office hours. (Those hours were also scheduled at opportune times.)"

                "Having pre-recorded lectures was an extremely good idea. Learning was at our time table which was great because we were not going to class in person.\r\nA split classroom is supposed to cover just practice problems in person, so doing the same lecture twice was a bad idea.",

                "The live zoom lectures were great, especially when the professor included videos and images related to the topics we were learning about. There were also a lot of office hours to accommodate questions and homework help during the week. More resources for exam prep would've been helpful.",
                "The way this class was adapted for working remotely didn't really work for me. Prof. Smooke would upload videos of him explaining the lecture slides in advance, but would go over the same exact content in class almost word for word, with the only addition being that people could ask questions. Since it was the same exact lecture as his pre-recorded lectures, I was not motivated to watch the pre-recorded videos. The problem was that since he expected us to be watching the lectures in advance with the ability to pause and write notes, he had license to speed through pages of derivations as quickly as he could speak them and finish lecture in like 20 mins. I've previously had Prof. Smooke for another class in person and students' saving grace was that he would be slowed down by his own writing (which is still blazing fast). I know most of the issue I had with his teaching style this semester was my own fault because I refused to watch the same lecture twice, but I feel like I would have benefited from him slowing down in the live zoom lectures and writing out his notes on an iPad or writing tablet instead of using slides and only a fraction of the class time.",
                "Professor Smooke pre-recorded all of his lecture videos and wanted us to watch the pre-recorded videos, then come to class and essentially watch the same lecture. Towards the end of class, I feel like the in-class lectures were more example-based and focused on real life applications, which was great, but at the beginning of the class we would just be watching him do the same derivation that he had us watch a pre-recorded lecture of him doing. I think having the prerecorded side focused on proofs\/derivations and the in-person lectures focused on example problems would be much more useful.",
                "The live virtual lectures, office hours and pre-recorded lectures worked. It would have been helpful to also have discussion sections where we could go over problems using the Zoom whiteboard, step by step. While I think the format of the class worked, having the opportunities to see problems worked through on the Zoom whiteboard, similar to a chalkboard in person, could have been really helpful.",
                "We had recorded lectures and then had the same lectures live over zoom to ask questions and get the information solidified, which I found very useful.  Taking exams if front of a camera live over zoom was not the best though.",
                "I appreciated that we had both lectures and recorded videos. I think it was good to be able to watch the recorded videos, which were concise.",
                "Prerecorded lecture before live lecture with questions was a good format. Would have liked to engage with Professor Smooke more in an office hours setting but he didn't offer any",
                "Similar to what I said in my last answer. If he taught the same information in the 75-minute window, it would be easier to keep students engaged. I think the combination of a full 75-minute lecture and recording the classes would be just as time-efficient for Professor Smooke (I think they would render the pre-recorded modules unnecessary and he could just post the slides from the lectures if he wanted to).",
                "The pre-recorded videos were great because it allowed me to go at my own pace and take detailed notes before class. Then in class, I could focus on hearing the information again, digesting it more, and asking any questions.",
                "Prof Smooke had prerecorded lectures with the exact same material as in lecture, so it allowed students to take notes or prepare questions before class. This was an excellent idea and should continue to be done",
                "Having the lectures recorded ahead of time, then also having Smooke redeliver them was a great way to learn the material.",
                "Again, adding videos and history snippets into lecture was huge. It's tough to stay motivated and interested when you're on zoom half the day, and these provided enough spice to lecture to make it really enjoyable. Prof Smooke recorded lectures before class that were the same as the live portion, which I would normally be frustrated with but enjoyed for these reasons: First, fluids is HARD, so seeing the topics twice is more or less necessary, and the second time round you can ask questions during lecture. Second, lecture usually ended before the scheduled time for the course, which, even though we covered a lot of material in that time, gave us a feeling that we were getting out early. Plus, you're not watching the clock for the end of lecture, you're simply present the whole time.",
                "Recorded lectures followed by live ones were very helpful",
                "Yes. The combination of prerecorded and live lectures helped",
                "The well made slides and pre-recorded videos explaining the lecture were very helpful.  The virtual lectures were great as well and having the notes available to us a few days before lecture allowed us to take notes before so we weren't rushing to take notes during class, which can be difficult with online lectures and powerpoints.",
                "Regular synchronous meetings were incredibly helpful. Even if I didn't ask questions, these live meetings held me accountable and added some dynamic to the class.",
                "The format could be improved if this course is offered again virtually. The pre-recorded lectures and the live sessions had exactly the same material. although after the first few weeks Prof. Smooke started introducing more fun videos and example problems in the live lecture. The problem is that the live session goes way too quick to take meaningful notes, which means you need to watch the pre-recorded lecture to have all the equations and stuff written down. But once you do that, most of the live session becomes redundant because you're just staring at slides and listening to explanations you've already covered. \r\n\r\nWould be better if live lectures were not just presentations, but included hand written derivations, which allow you to take notes and engage in real time. Would also be helpful to gear the live sessions more toward solving problems and applications of the lecture material. Most of us really loved the videos and stories Prof. Smooke shared and they really contributed to our enjoyment and understanding of the material.",
                "The large number of office hours were very helpful with allowing me to always have access to help. The asynchronous recorded lectures made reviewing class content very easy which facilitated studying",
                "Taking advantage of the asynchronous portion and having many many TAs and ULAs was extremely helpful",
                "This course was taught as a flipped classroom, meaning that we had pre-recorded lectures to watch before class and class time was given over to a quick recap of the recordings and answers to conceptual questions. I found this course format easier to work within and better for my learning style.\r\nThe plenitude of TA office hours were also quite helpful."

                "Yes, it is a core class for the MENG major, so you mostly likely have to take it, but if you ever get the chance to take a course with Professor Smooke, I highly reccomend.",
                "This was my favorite mechanical engineering course I have taken so far. The material is incredibly interesting and the way to apply everything you've learned thus far (differential equations, multivariable calculus, statics, thermodynamics). The material is very complex so be wary of the teacher you are taking with, but Smooke is an amazing professor. He really wants students to succeed so he teaches you well, but also gives very straightforward problem sets and exams. Nothing is surprisingly hard; nothing is surprisingly easy. This means it is a nice middle ground course. Extremely rewarding and very interesting.\r\n\r\nAVOID TAKING WITH GOMEZ. He is supposed to be extremely challenging.",
                "Required for mechE, take it with Smooke.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone who would like a greater understanding of the mechanics in the air or liquids around you, such as how airplanes fly or why cruise ships float.",
                "This is a difficult class, but can be very rewarding if you are interested in fluid mechanics.",
                "When taught by Professor Smooke, I feel like this is a good class. It's difficult, and I wouldn't recommend taking it for fun, but if you are ABET MechE or ChemE you have to and it's not a bad elective for other STEM majors (non-ABET engineering, applied math, etc.).",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. You gain a fundamental understanding of fluid mechanics, which is essential to parts of mechanical, biomedical and chemical engineering. The course is taught in an engaging manner and is overall a great learning experience.",
                "Yes, If you are a mechanical engineering major, or just a STEM major, I would highly recommend taking this class with Smooke",
                "Yes, I would. I think it is useful and in terms of engineering classes, it was pretty organized and good.",
                "Yes, great class with Smooke, content presented clearly without assuming much knowledge prior, math concepts also clearly explained",
                "MENG361 has a bad reputation. Based on the horror stories I've heard about Prof. Gomez, this is a much better alternative if only because the professor is nicer, more accommodating, and the courseload is more fair.",
                "The topic is fine, so if you have to take the course, definitely take it with Professor Smooke! I enjoyed this class much more than I though I would because of him.",
                "Yes, Prof Smooke is a great teacher and lecturer, and the subject material is interesting to learn about, especially with all the real-world examples he included in lectures",
                "If Smooke is teaching this course, then it is such a good time. He very obviously cares about his students, and he's super funny.  The content is also interesting, and he provides side stories of concepts occurring in real life.",
                "Don't get me wrong, fluids is tough. It can be hard to see how the various topics we cover connect to each other. BUT, fluids is rewarding. I'm a very curious person, so fluids had a similar feel to physics where it feels like I'm uncovering the veil of how the things in the world around me work on a basic level. After this class, I look at water and think \"woah, water is CRAZY\"",
                "Yes, very fulfilling and fun lectures",
                "Only if Smooke is teaching it",
                "Yes, this course covers very interesting material.",
                "Definitely take it with Prof. Smooke. He is a great lecturer and knows how to make a class interesting. Fluids is an essential part of many engineering disciplines and this provides a useful theoretical background. If you're a MechE major and\/or are planning to take Aerodynamics, take this class early to see if you're truly interested in the material. Everyone loves aerodynamics until you have to solve the equations. Don't expect to get anything too practical out of this course, though. It's mostly equations and theory, but the applications are cool.",
                "Yes. Prof smooke is a great lecturer and the content was very helpful to understanding how fluids can be mathematically modeled",
                "Professor Smooke is fantastic - this class is just hard and virtual learning really made it difficult. If you have to take this, take it with this professor.",
                "I rarely recommend MENG courses to students unless they are required to take them, but this class is an exception. If you're required to take it, or are just interested in fluid mechanics and have a good background in math, take it! I feel like a much more competent engineer and constantly catch myself breaking down real-world phenomena using my knowledge from this class.",
                "Those for whom this is a prerequisite know who they are. If youre not one of those people and youre thinking of taking it as an elective, I would still recommend considering it, particularly if its taught by Professor Smooke. This course did a great job of increasing my knowledge of the equations of motion, the different modes of fluid motion, and boundary layer flow."
