                "Our capstone's greatest strength was without a doubt David Robinson. He is a great capstone leader, who trusts the team to work according to their strengths, abilities, and individual capacity. He encourages learning, and honest reflection\/discussion about the content matter and the work of stakeholders, and he gives students a great amount of flexibility and independence.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the project was extremely vague and not super interesting, although we made the most of it and found something useful to make of it. Jackson does not seem to take the capstones very seriously. The choices were disappointing and did not include some of the most important issues in global affairs, including climate change or China. Jackson was also disorganized in response to travel requests, and the  \"panel\" presiding over the final presentations included only three judges, one being asynchronous and another watching remotely...",
                "More guidance from Jackson on the guidelines of the Capstone, travel requirements\/rules, and deadlines would have been appreciated if given up front.\r\n\r\nEverything else is a strength; I had a wonderful time and learned a lot. It was truly an exercise in critical thinking having to start from nothing to produce a final deliverable with minimal oversight\/management from an instructor.",
                "Strengths; ROB!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We undoubtedly had the best Capstone advisor of any of the groups. He was extremely helpful and insightful, and it was such a highlight to get to work with and learn from him over the course of the semester; we would always leave the classroom gushing about how much we adored him. Unfortunately, despite Rob's performance as our advisor (incredible, showstopping, spectacular), the lack of organization on behalf of Jackson administration was extremely disappointing and made it much more challenging for us to enjoy our project or stay sane. More information should be conveyed to students at the onset of the course, more frequent communication with advisors should occur, and the School should heavily consider having capstones be a year-long commitment, or at the very least have them start a bit earlier in the Spring so work can be done over the Summer."
