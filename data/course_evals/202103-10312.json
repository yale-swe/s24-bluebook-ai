I learned how to better space out writing a long-term research essay (eg. what steps I should take along the way to make the process smoother). I learned more about different perspectives on childhood through having a lot of great conversations with classmates.",
                "I learned how to write a basic college research paper. More specifically I learned to write about rhetoric and analyze academic arguments. I also learned how to simplify my writing and how to read academic sources for quality and form.",
                "General writing and formatting, time management, developing proper mindset to write, self and peer evaluation, close reading",
                "I learned a lot about myself such as, what I need to do in order to be productive, what writing strategies work best for me, and the steps to take to complete a paper I'm proud of. I also learned about to thoroughly research a topic and how to choose a specific topic/thesis for a paper.",
                "Academic writing, building strong arguments, research, developed my writing style",
                "In this course I really developed the skill of not looking for the obvious argument but digging deeply into the complexity of a text or research topic. We constantly practiced deep analysis of sources and using this evidence to create unique claims. This not only made my writing better, but it made it more interesting. I also developed the skill of revising and always looking to improve. For the first two essays, once we got our grade back, we were encouraged to revise according to the professor's edits for a higher grade. With this policy, we not only learned how to write the initial essay but how to respond to feedback. Regarding the topic of the class, childhood, I not only learned about childhood topics in the academic sense, but the topics we discussed got me to think deeply about my own childhood experiences.",
                "Writing academic essays. Going beyond just the standard 5 paragraph high school essay. Not just writing, but learning to effectively communicate ideas and arguments with compelling evidence. Learning how to structure larger arguments by organizing and stringing together a variety of related ideas. Techniques to write a good paper, different styles and tones.",
                "I became comfortable reading, engaging with, and producing academic writing; this is a skill applicable across all disciplines and essential for all university students. I became familiar with and used the many resources available to Yale students (libraries, personal librarians, office hours, writing tutors, academic mentors, etc.).",
                "Writing argumentative essays with clarity and structure, and appreciating the process along the way, engaging with Yales library system and support networks for writing and research, the importance of collaboration and a continual revision process when writing"

                "The strengths of this course were for sure the professor, Professor Klemann, and the community. Professor Klemann was always very passionate, which in turn fostered a very passionate community of students. I made good friends in this course. I liked how we also didn't only focus on the essays, and had more casual conversations about childhood in general. Something that could be improved is more engagement with the actual pop-up books in the Beinecke. We observed them, but we never did any critical analysis on them, which I think would've been fun. However, everything else about this course I loved!",
                "I saw very little weaknesses because Heather did a lot to make sure our voices and concerns were heard. She took all of our suggestions with deadlines and was very understanding with turning in our work. Overall, the greatest strength was how she led us step by step with each essay so it didn't feel like a lot of work and wasn't overwhelming.",
                "genuinely amazing--I can't think of a negative thing to say. Very well structured and almost every assignment genuinely helped me learn as a writer. I felt that the sources web assignment wasn't super helpful for me but I can see how it would help someone else.",
                "Strengths of this class are the in class discussions and one-on-one time with the professor. A weakness of the course would be the speed but it reached you to be productive with a smaller timeline.",
                "Strengths- great instructor, interesting class discussions, feedback from Professor Klemann is very helpful\r\nWeaknesses- deadlines seemed pretty close to each other sometimes, but Professor Klemann is always very understanding and modified them according to our workload",
                "One of the main strengths of this course is how personal it is. We not only discussed essays and writing but dug deep into our childhood experiences and how they connected to our readings and research topics. Every week a person in the class would write a blog post that we would respond to about some childhood topic. This brought up so many different perspectives and so many topics that I have never even thought of. Another strength is the amount of freedom we got in choosing essay and research topics. We were really encouraged to go wherever the evidence and our interests took us. This freedom allowed me to write about topics I was really passionate about. One weakness of this course was sometimes it felt like there were a lot of things going on at once, in and out of class, and we didn't have time for all of it. In order to improve this, I would suggest being sure to put the most important things for a class at the beginning of class so we definitely have enough time to focus on it.",
                "Strengths - Prof Klemann is one of the best instructors I've had the privilege of having so far! She will spend a lot of one on one time with you and fine-tune her feedback to play to your strengths. Often, she was able to tell me what I really wanted to do before I understood it myself!",
                "The course was a great introduction to academic writing. The organization was also excellent, and its small size led to the creation of a great community.",
                "Excellent topic, loved visiting the Beinecke, helpful mini-workshops in class led by the instructor, spaced-out essays with lots of check-ins throughout the process the best part was the small community and amazing instructor and CTL teaching fellow, though!\r\nImprovements: More emphasis on collaboration"

We had to do 3 essays in total, and they all progressed in difficulty, so by the time we reached our final research paper, I felt like I had a good basis in essay writing. You also get to make a pop-up book, which is awesome!",
                "Yes! It provides a great basis for the research college essay through a very fun lens that is childhood. It is a mix of intellectual stimulation, challenging writing and a fun, collaborative class atmosphere.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is a great english course to learn about yourself as a writer and also develop a good basis for writing research papers with strong, supported arguments. The discussions throughout the class are also a benefit.",
                "Definitely  a great class to start learning academic writing for college. We received very detailed feedback on our work and it was very helpful. I feel much more confident in my writing after taking this class",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. We have all been through childhood and thus all have interesting perspectives on the experience. I now not only know more about other peoples' perspectives and experiences but also about my own. This course allowed me to both explore the experiences that have made me who I am today and improve my writing.",
                "Absolutely - if it is taught by Heather Klemann, then it is a MUST do course!",
                "Absolutely, this is one of the best introductory courses that you can take at Yale. Try to take this course with Heather -- if you are willing to treat the class with the respect and time it deserves. The enthusiasm that she brings to the classroom is contagious, and I learned a lot of valuable skills and tips.",
                "Yes! And a hearty yes with my instructor (Dr. Klemann) and subject material. ENGL114 gives an excellent introduction to argumentative writing in college and beyond and guides students with a strong support system (as opposed to other courses where there are less check-ins with the instructor, less feedback throughout the course)."
