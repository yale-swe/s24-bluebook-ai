                "Strengths: Professor Klein walks us through the readings very well, and the collection of articles for each week are, for the most part, wonderfully curated for meaningful class discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A more structured feedback system, rubrics and\/or sample student essays to denote what is expected, and a list of resources for writing history papers or using Chicago-style references would have been helpful. Though Professor Klein is super helpful during office hours, these resources would have helped me to better understand how to improve.",
                "Strengths - Professor Klein is a really wonderful discussion facilitator. All of the course readings were really interesting and allowed me to learn a lot about urban spaces across such a huge period of time. They also allowed me to gain a variety of perspectives into specific events, such as Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans. I also appreciated the fact that we had to start working on our final assignment early on in the semester. \r\nWeaknesses - The course readings could get a bit longer than necessary, especially sometimes in class we don't end up covering everything that we read.",
                "Strength was that the class covered very specific case studies that nodded to a broader movement throughout history which is personally more engaging than what you would normally cover in a lecture course. \r\n\r\nWeakness was that again, it's specific case studies of which you will later discuss. For students who might not have learned about these topics, it can be difficult to engage in the discussions as you won't have as much to contribute. Another weakness is that the readings was way too much (upwards of 300 pages per week) on top of the paper assignments we had.",
                "I really like this course",
                "The strengths are that I learned a lot and gained a lot of new skills. The topics were interesting and I was interested by the readings. The weakness is that there were too many readings, meaning we couldn't get to them all in class discussion and weren't able to go as deep.",
                "Strengths: very thorough and insightful seminar discussions and talks; structured writing assignments in preparation for the final research paper; fantastic readings\r\nWeaknesses: many weeks there was too much reading to the point where it was difficult to have meaningful discussion; lotsss of writing in the last third of the class; podcast assignment felt unnecessary"

                "A break during the 2-hour seminar was nice, although giving questions to think about during that break defeated the purpose of a break. Breakout rooms allowed for more open discussion. At the beginning, students would talk about different topics outside of the readings, but when Professor Klein gave us a list of questions, that made the discussions much more meaningful.",
                "The breakout rooms are effective (when given some guiding questions to consider), especially because it allows smaller groups of people to discuss amongst themselves. I also think that the discussions were conducive to learning because we talked about themes that were brought up in the discussion question posts, so a lot of the content was student-driven.",
                "While I felt that our discussions were consistently rich and illuminating, the reading felt far too heavy for a pandemic semester with no breaks. Professor Klein did agree to lighten the load towards the end of the semester, but reducing it from the beginning might have allowed for a deeper engagement with some of the material; it felt surface-level at times because we were speeding through so many readings and topics.",

This course is fantastic in its knowledge you gain, readings you do, and work you produce, but it is a LOT (sometimes, severely overwhelming amounts) of reading and writing so be prepared for this. Otherwise, it's a really fantastic class with a great professor."
