            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Landemore is amazing. She presents insightful and succinct arguments, and I loved how she wove her own research into course material. She set expectations high but was always clear about what she wanted, and I felt like everything we did -- from the readings, to presentations, to response papers -- all had a purpose of enhancing our learning. I also loved the moments in class when we would do mini debates or presentations based on small group discussions. The subject matter is fascinating and mobilizes ideas of climate change and justice in fresh and critical ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there were opportunities earlier on to get to know my peers, as that always helps with stimulating class discussion more naturally (or even just doing introductions for the first few weeks of class to learn names). I did not find the first guest speaker super valuable to listen to but perhaps we could have framed the conversation a bit more or had more chances to ask questions.",
                "strength: very very interesting discussions + approach to have student presentations makes the class very interesting and worth learning from\r\nweakness: a lot of reading to get through; sometimes the presentations were rushed",
                "S: very cool in that it gives you the opportunity to engage with current, developing academics and literature, as well as make small but real contributions to a developing field (editing a wikipedia article, opportunities to volunteer at conferences, etc)\r\n\r\nW: The readings were very long. I think they could have been more effective if they were a bit shorter and to the point. Student presentations helped a bit, but it felt like the course was largely driven by the presentation of a few ideas, and more time was spent just explaining the ideas in the first place than actually getting into meaningful discussion about them (i.e. explaining what a mini-public is in detail but not spending as much time discussing how they'd be implemented in the real world or debating their merits). This is not to say that the latter things did not happen, just that I wish that the proportion was more balanced. As a result, I felt like my takeaway from most classes could be captured in a paragraph's summary of the day's reading, with little active discussion or back-and-forth. I also felt like there wasn't a ton of professor feedback on work, though it's probably available if you request it.",
                "Good course but disorganized",
                "strengths: interesting material, wikipedia assignments, and very knowledgeable professor\r\nweaknesses: material was disjointed so the material didnt always connect from week to week, assignment instructions often werent clear, heavy reading load that was unevenly discussed in class",
                "This course greatly benefitted from Professor Landemore's own knowledge of and involvement with deliberative democratic experiments. We were able to discuss case studies in depth, with additional insights provided by a number of guest speakers. Often times, however, the readings were unengaging and did not speak to the questions we were most concerned with in in-class discussions. A tighter, more engaging syllabus would have done a lot to increase my engagement with the course readings."

                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. I have taken tons of EVST courses but none that positioned the environmental movement amidst labor, justice, and political philosophy in such necessary and fascinating ways. I really feel like my theories of environmental and political change have evolved through this course, and I was challenged to approach climate change through a variety of critical lenses and perspectives. Definitely a must-take for anyone hoping to work in public policy or on climate issues more broadly.",
                "yes absolutely. prof helene is amazing, and brilliant and very open to having many class debates. she encourages all of us to explore our own thoughts and encourages pushback. there is also a lot of good learning to be had in this class.",
                "It depends entirely on your interest in the subject matter and your willingness to make something of it! The course is better thought of as a resource you can use to learn and do really cool things than a standard learning experience.",
                "A really cool class",
                "yes, if really interested in and moderately familiar with the course material.",
