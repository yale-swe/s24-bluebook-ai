                "strength(s): covers A LOT of material. Your math\/probability knowledge will definitely improve. Also, problem sets were graded fairly (we were only graded on those and a final paper)\r\nweakness: sometimes the problem sets go overboard, so you often have to learn things on your own accord.",
                "Strengths: format of the course (heavily-weighed psets and a paper with no exams) was a wonderful change of pace, and lectures were really good. Sekhar's lovely. the paper was really open-ended and made me focus on something entirely new. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the problem sets were the main weakness. I felt very disengaged with the course and the p-sets were the majority of the reason why. they were not very motivating and did not really relate to the stuff we were learning in class, so I could get through them without much trouble despite not fully making the effort to understand the lectures (all I had to do was look up the definitions in the uploaded lecture sheets). I like the no-exam format, but without engaging, difficult p-sets, the result is just that students won't ever internalize the material since they won't ever be evaluated on their understanding. I wish the problems themselves were more interesting. they were a little too generic (e.g., \"prove this generic measure that's clearly a measure is a measure\", \"prove this type of basic function is measureable\", rather than \"work with this specific cool measure,\" \"use this stuff to find the probability of ____\"). Martingales in particular have some really cool examples but only generic results came up on the psets. This is coming from a pure math major.",
                "Sekhar is excellent at breaking down complicated, rigorous proofs into understandable steps. He also did a great job of pointing out common arguments that are used throughout the course. I would have appreciated it if he slowed down when presenting new definitions and theorems, since many of them are heavy in notation and difficult to parse upon learning them for the first time.",
                "This course needs consistent notation, LaTeX'ed notes, slowed down lectures, and office hours at reasonable times. The professor's office hours were effectively meaningless since they were held right after a PSet was due and right before the next one was released. Warning: don't go into this class without having taken 305 or a real analysis course, because I didn't and paid the price. The professor goes mad fast and expects you to understand things immediately, else you have to figure it out yourself.",
                "The problem sets reinforced the problems well. Sekhar's explanations were really clear and complemented the textbook. I felt like we could have done some more applications that really let us see the power of measures.  We didn't learn char functions, which made me a bit sad."

Sekhar is a fantastic lecturer and a great guy, and the format of the course is a really nice change of pace from most of the classes in math and stats, since we had no exams, but had a final paper. However, the material was often really dry, and there were very few fun examples on the problems sets and in lecture, so especially for a student like me who has only taken measure theory (with little to no stats\/probability background), the results felt very unmotivated. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend the class to anyone who doesn't have experience with proof-writing and at least one analysis or measure theory class.",
