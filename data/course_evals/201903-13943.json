   "comments": [
    "I have greatly improved my writing skills. My writing has become more concise and I have enhanced my ability to put my ideas onto paper.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned how to be a little more comfortable with tackling big research papers. In high school, my papers never really spanned past five or six papers; however, in this course, I ended up writing a research paper that was 10 pages. Just experiencing writing a paper this big has been a good learning experience for me.",
    "Definitely improved writing.",
    "By taking this course, I was introduced to higher-level academic writing like I had never seen before. While the material, at first, may seem daunting, Sarah did a great job of guiding us through the readings and helping in our writing. The discussions in this class were the most influential part of the experience, and I enjoyed attending class to hear the thoughts of all the other students. The environment easily allowed for collaboration and debate which helped me grow my critical thinking skills.",
    "Critical analysis of texts.\r\nIncorporating sources into my writing.\r\nWriting longer papers.\r\nMore complex essay flows.",
    "I felt I learned so many different perspectives to take on displaying ones message through all the writing we read. The readings were so diverse yet all so powerful. Reading and getting to write about things I feel passionate about has taught me to look at writing in a deeper sense.",
    "I learned so much! I remembered how much I loved English courses and philosophical discussions in general. This course made me rethink what I want my major to be. I think that my writing improved greatly. But I also feel more confidant really dissecting and engaging with readings. I learned how to face readings that were intimidating, and use my peers to reframe my point of view. And, of course, I learned a lot about the cosmos.",
    "Learned to better structure and write a college level analytical level. In class discussions were useful in improving on the spot critical thinking and speaking skills.",
    "I believe this class developed my writing and close reading skills. By reading varied selections and close reading them to form an argument, strengthened our ability to interpret texts. Furthermore, the draft and review process of essays as well as personalized feedback and class wide workshops helped us to improve our essay writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I love how the course was dependent upon discussion between my peers. The course could be improved by possibly reducing the number of papers to three so as to allow for more time to work with peers and the teacher to perfect the papers.",
    "Strengths: The discussions we had in class were guided very carefully and impactfully. I learned so much just by talking to my peers. I also have to commend the way my teacher Sarah Weston assigned us our readings. She made sure we were pushing our ability to read critically, but she was also cognizant and nice enough to make sure we weren't assigned an incredible amount.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Just a little more lessons on specific tactics in writing.",
    "Sarah is the best.",
    "The direct feedback from Sarah was extremely useful. She would go over essay drafts in-person and would later send lengthy emails with recommendations on how to improve. It was clear that she was very engaged in helping students and genuinely was passionate about our writing. There were no major weaknesses of the course, and the only negative I felt was the large amounts of reading we had due on certain days. Later on, the readings were cut down and this was not a problem at all.",
    "Strengths:\r\nFantastic Intructure\r\nVery interesting subject\r\nGood course-load - Not too high, not too low.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nMore structures approach to helping students improve their writing\r\nProvide more instruction on what constitutes a GOOD and a BAD essay\r\nI wish this course would have more \"realistic\" readings about space. i.e. less philosophy and sci-fi and more Carl Sagan and history.",
    "The readings were diverse and beautifully selected. The pacing of the work was perfect, giving me time to breath after each assignment but also keeping me thinking about the next thing Im working on.",
    "This course is strong because Sarah was a great professor! The syllabus had readings that were fascinating and everyone loved. And the small seminar setup allowed every person to be an active participant. Some of the deadlines set by 114 as a course were intense and could be improved, but Sarah was flexible so it was not really a problem in this class.",
    "The course greatly succeeds as a discussion based seminar course. Assigned texts were as fascinating as they were widely ranged and in class discussions always took place at a very high level of discourse. Extensive feedback on all essays greatly improved my writing ability throughout the semester. One aspect of the course that could be improved upon is continuity between readings, which sometimes feel disjointed.",
    "The class has a lot of excellent readings and pulling different sources from different areas helps to build understanding of the readings we discuss in class by giving context and other interpretations. The only weakness that I noticed was that we wanted more class workshops. But, we asked for this mid semester and our professor was very flexible it was very helpful!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! I think it is a necessary class to help transition into Yale, as it helps students foster ideas with their peers and improve their writing skills.",
    "Yes, this English 114 class was a great experience and it is a great writing class for students interested in science topics who need to take an English class.",
    "I would for sure recommend this course to another student. I went into this course with a very real interest in learning more about space and how to write better papers, and I'm very satisfied and glad I took this course. There were so many interesting papers we were able to read, and I was able to practice writing by researching topics I was interested in. I mean, my research paper was on \"Moon Landing Conspiracy Theorists.\" How cool is that? \r\n\r\nIn summary, I would recommend this course to someone with an interest in space topics.",
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to another student. Anyone with an interest in space-related themes, and even those without a particular passion for it, will love the class. The readings were extremely interesting and led to great in-class discussions. I don't ever remember having a dull discussion over the readings.",
    "Absolutely. My section got close and built a great group with lots of trust and collaboration.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this course! I was a little intimidated coming in because it was a more \"science-y\" English, and I am very much a humanities student. But I did not need any knowledge in advance. This was my favorite course of the semester and I was excited to attend class every day.",
    "Highly, especially for any student interested in space exploration or science fiction. The course was intellectually stimulating, enjoyable, and a great education for anyone aiming to become a better writer and speaker.",
    "Yes, I believe this course is excellent for anyone interested in a seminar about a particular topic. In Earth, Sky, and Stardust, we read really interesting selections which tied world events, philosophy, and science fiction together to increase. The diverse sources helped to create a lot of interesting discussion with many different interpretations of readings."
