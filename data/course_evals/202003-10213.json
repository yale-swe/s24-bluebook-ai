                "This was an excellent course. I appreciated the emphasis on discussion, and I think there was a nice balance between guidance from the Professor, and room to stray off course a bit and discuss what the students were especially interested in. Professor Elias's feedback was very useful, and he did a good job and creating and fun and thoughtful environment for discussion. Students were in general very engaged.",
                "Strengths: There are less texts covered in this course, so the pace each week feels reasonable. The class discussions are also very helpful. I loved hearing the different perspectives from my classmates, and I learned a lot from them and Prof Elias. The essay assignments allowed me to explore topics I was interested in and deepen my understanding of the texts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The poets covered in this course are not very diverse. While Prof Elias tried to introduce modern adaptations by female and non-white poets, I would love to have read more original middle english texts by female and non-white poets. The requirements\/expectations of the blog posts also felt a little vague. I would love to have received feedback periodically on my blog post.",
                "Strengths - Prof Elias. He is wonderful!!! He is very accessible outside of class and always willing to meet with students. The class was very structured too, and we would almost always discuss at length all the main ideas during each meeting. Prof Elias' feedback for each of the assigned papers was extremely helpful and definitely helped me grow as a writer. Weaknesses - none.",

                "yes, even if texts themselves aren't super interesting, you still get a lot out of it",
                "Yes-- this class is great for anyone who really wants to engage with the literature and learn to consider the nuances and complexities of some famous works of poetry. The course really teaches you to embrace contradictions and ambiguities within texts as opposed to espousing the simplest interpretation.",
                "Yes. I learned a lot about the foundations of English literature and my writing improved significantly. Its important to know that this course is writing intensive, so youll be doing a lot of writing and the expectations for writing quality are high. However, your professor will always be there to help you brainstorm essay topics, provide supplementary materials, and give very detailed feedback on your essays. Its also a fascinating experience and rare opportunity to learn about the origins of English literature, and how early\/early modern authors and works continue to influence us today.",
                "If you are a prospective English major, definitely! This course is a great introduction to early English poetry, and Prof Elias will help you improve your writing by a lot. The texts covered are interesting and will challenge your close-reading skills. The class discussions are also great. However, my one reservation is that the grading is sometimes strict and a little discouraging. For non-English majors, I would recommend shopping other classes first.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, English major or not. I think it is important to have read the works examined in this class such as The Canterbury Tales and Paradise Lost, and be familiar with the English poets, too. Definitely take it with Prof Elias.",
