Further, we read medical pieces in several forms and learned how to write opinion pieces, patient profiles, and long form research papers.

                "Strengths: Professor Epstein is a wonderful person and it is a privilege to take classes with her, one that any student interested in medicine or writing should consider. She arranges an abundance of opportunities to chat and learn from experts in the field and patients with the conditions you read about. She encourages taking risks in your writing, which I believe everyone should experiment with. With luck, you will also be able to meet a wonderful group of fellow students as I did. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None relating to the course. I must admit that writing is not one of my strengths, which made the class very challenging. But that is less an issue of the class and more my personal interests.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Epstein is always available to help and loves to connect and work with her students.\r\n- Learned about how to trim down essays and where to cut out unnecessary words.\r\n- Had helpful workshop periods to get feedback and read other peoples work\r\n- Engaging readings\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not too many that I can think of. Potentially would like longer periods of time to workshop.\r\n- Class sometimes went over which is difficult if you have a commitment or class that starts 10 minutes later.",
                "Strengths: Excellent readings, lots of opportunities to talk to well-known, accomplished medical journalists and writers, great feedback on writing, and the chance to take a small seminar with Prof. Epstein, who is passionate about teaching and really knows what she's talking about.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I can think of."

                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in writing, medicine, or public health. At the same time, it is a serious time investment. If you are not highly talented / passionate about writing, I would say it is a comparable time investment to CPSC323 (systems) or CHEM332 (physical chemistry).",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to people. If you are interested in the medical field this is the perfect course to take because you learn about new things in the medical field and improve on your writing. The work load is manageable and Professor Epstein is a brilliant professor.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in a) journalism or writing and b) medicine or science. You will learn so much. Of my classes this semester, this class was hands-down my favorite."
