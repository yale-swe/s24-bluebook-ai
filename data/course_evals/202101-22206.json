                "(This is a DS comment, not specific to my section) While the spring syllabus for H&P is more diverse than in the fall, this is a very low bar to pass and the DS curriculum remains woefully behind. We read one book by a person of color in H&P (unless I'm missing someone-- which I sincerely apologize for). And, the lecture for this book was given by a white professor. I'm not saying that a white professor cannot be knowledgeable about African American history, but there is something distinctly uncomfortable about having one representation of the Black experience in H&P and being taught about it by a white professor. Furthermore, the theories proposed in The Souls of Black Folk were called outdated by African American academics just a few decades after it was published (I know this from prior research on the book and its significance). This doesn't mean that we shouldn't read it because it is such an important part of the Canon and the African American Canon especially. However, balancing its portrayal with a more modern idea of the Black experience/Black identity would be more balanced and more accurate and could lead to some interesting discussion which is supposed to be the point of DS. I hope in the future DS begins to incorporate more diversity both in its syllabus and in its faculty.",
                "This course's strengths mostly stem from its organization - the seminar style keeps students heavily engaged and ensures a lot of one-on-one teacher/student interaction. The only weakness of this course this semester was that it was online.",
                "I loved this course! Super thorough, the class format made it very engaging.",
                "Incredibly welcoming, rigorous discussion; \r\nDiscussion could have been guided more effectively, sometimes haphazard in the way texts were approached",
                "Strengths: Semmel was great! He was always lively and such fun to be around. He always created a welcoming environment and encouraged fruitful discussion. Reading was highly interesting. Love how we tracked themes throughout the course.\r\nWeaknesses: Pace of certain texts, such as Democracy in America. Should have gotten two weeks. Being online, but that wasn't anything anyone could have controlled.",
                "Main weakness was the ability to develop a flowing conversation  I think this is mostly down to the virtual format, however",
                "Having an in person class would be nice, but that'll be solved after covid.\r\n\r\nThe material I find to be sufficient, but more looking back would make the class more interesting. In most paper topics we discuss two authors that we read back to back, but it isn't until the final that we truly compare one political thinker to another centuries before it. More bigger picture learning, focused on what this content means in the world today as opposed to what is this author trying to say would be good.\r\n\r\nBeside this, I find nothing wrong with the course. The span of books is good, the time spent on each seems sufficient.",

                "Definitely. In terms of the content itself, the second semester of DS readings is much more diverse and much more enjoyable than the first one. Honestly, it's worth sticking through the fall semester of DS just to get to the spring. However, to students of color, I would advise that DS is a white dominated space. We already go to a PWI so it's to be expected but please be aware of what you can handle and protect your space. We read two books by Black authors in the spring and no other books by a person of color, please be aware of that coming in.\r\nSpecific to this section, Professor Semmel is great. Essay prompts are an underrated but crucial part of the DS experience, and Professor Semmel always delivers. Each of the prompts I've chosen has encouraged me to think about the text in a different way and challenge myself to write and argue in new ways too. The class discussions are enlightening and Professor Semmel does a good job of setting up topics (i.e. sending an email before class that explains any key historical moments, asking thought-provoking questions, and clearly answering student questions that come up). You'll leave the course as a better writer and thinker and with a new appreciation for these eras of history.",
                "YES! DS is a fantastic program, and I grew so much as a student and as a person.",
                "Yes! The DS curriculum was super formative and extremely insightful. The authors you read are really cool, and you leave the class feeling like you learned a lot.",
                "Strongly recommend; Professor Semmel creates an environment that fosters welcoming contributions from all class members. Great reading list.",
                "Yes, I love Directed Studies and would feel anyone who is even slightly interested in the themes and books discussed to apply. I loved this experience and would not trade it for anything!",
                "Absolutely",
                "Yes. I'd recommend that any student from any walk of life with any goals coming into Yale should take Directed Studies. It's where you can get the more clear picture of the totality of content from throughout history, from the Ancient Greeks to reflections on the Holocaust. It's knowledge that is designed to inspire further reading, but at the same time give enough that one can see and learn a lot with just what they see.",
                "I think that there might be more specialized courses that also take into account a wider range of thoughts, but it was a great introduction to many thinkers.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn to think more deeply about ideas and have fun learning a bit of European history along the way."
