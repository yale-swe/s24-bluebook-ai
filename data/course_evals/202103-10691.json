I feel I learned really interesting things about each of the topics, with particular emphasis put on ggplot2, and theory and history of data visualization. I came into the class knowing vaguely how to make basic histograms in R, and left with the ability to think of and produce all sorts of actually good graphs, as well as data maps, in ggplot2. Moreover, the class showed me how data visualization is not a recourse to be used when you need a powerpoint, but a core tool in truly understanding data and the world. I also learned some interesting things about history, art and political science. I think it would be incredibly useful to anyone interested in statistics, political science or other social sciences.",

I also learned how to more thoroughly analyze graphs, as well as the power that visualizations have on conveying a lot of information in little space. The final project also allowed me to craft an original argument through research, data, and graphs, which I think combines a lot of important skills into one final product.",

However, I did not learn a lot. I came into this class knowing no ggplot2 and no R. And I left knowing a little bit, with some big holes in my knowledge. There are some very basic concepts I still dont understand. Part of the reason why is my fault. You did not need to do the readings to get 100% on the psets. And Im busy. So I never did the readings. And that bit me in the a** because I am leaving this class not as strong as I should. That being said, I think the psets should have pushed us a bit harder and really forced us to practice and explore things like mutate and piping and such (without it being handed to us in the example portion of the pset).",

Other insights included artistic principles of visualization, and interesting historical case studies including WEB DuBois, Florence Nightingale, Agnes Martin and Maya Lin. I was challenged to think about what could be considered as data visualization beyond standard line graphs!

Most S&DS professors I've worked with up until this point use base R rather than the tidyverse.

Without the motivation, I'm probably going to continue coding in base R.",

                "Dr. Coppock and his TAs were wonderful, engaging, thoughtful, and clearly expert on the topics presented. It was a joy to be in his class, and had one of the greatest skills/knowledge received to time commitment ratios of any class I have taken at Yale. You will learn a ton. You will apply the lessons learned to many other courses and projects.\r\n\r\nOne improvement that could be made: many of the early Psets seemed too similar (homages/redesigns/etc.) and were too focused on artistic representation rather than actual coding. I think that some of the early psets could thus be beefed up a bit.",
                "The course was engaging and the assignments were fun.",
                "Weakness: uploading the code for students to follow along. The one and only time the prof actually uploaded code for us to follow was probably the best class of the whole course. Otherwise, it felt very dull. Coding notes were not very good since prof would present a slide full of text and then it would disappear into the void before you could type out the first line \r\n\r\nStrength: very organized, very chill, very understanding. Concepts were unique and I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about R and the art of data viz.",
                "A strength of this course is how well it manages to synthesize art, political science, statistics, and coding, exploring unique intersections that I had never thought about. Lecture is engaging, and time passes quickly - I especially enjoyed the interactive elements of lecture like the polls and oil pastels. The psets in this class are the most enjoyable homework I've ever had. I spent hours designing and redesigning just because I found the degree of freedom we were given so interesting. I will note, though, that you have to be somewhat independently motivated to get the most out of this class - the more time you spend trying to perfect a visualization (going to office hours, reading the textbook, etc), the more you will learn.",
                "Strengths: Professor Coppock is an extremely engaging lecturer, and the material is very interesting. It also teaches you practical skills that would be very useful for anyone interested in working in quantitative fields or social science. The P-Sets are not too difficult, and often teach you a lot. I didn't feel like the class was stressful or frightening at any point, despite the fact that I was learning a ton and doing engaging work. When you're done with the class, you will know a lot more than when you came in, not have stressed too much about the class, and have P-sets full of code about how to make all sorts of useful visualizations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is no Visualization of Political and Social Data II, the sequel to the original.",
                "This is by far the best class I have taken at Yale so far. It is extremely engaging, and you find yourself applying the lessons from class to graphs we see in the real world everyday. The lectures are always so interesting, and 50 minutes fly by in this class.",
                "Its main strength is Prof Coppock  hes incredibly approachable, funny, and engaging in class. In terms of weaknesses, its not organized perfectly content-wise  the material isnt really linear after the first few weeks when you learn the basics of ggplot2. There are some interesting subjects you jump around to, though, so I dont think thats a huge weakness.",
                "Strengths: lectures were engaging and interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: expectations for our weekly psets were sometimes ambiguous.",
                "Professor Coppock is a clear strength! He is a kind, interesting, passionate professor and a greater lecturer. Would strongly recommend him. But I did not learn a ton. I think Professor Coppock could add a lot more content to the class, especially in the R department. We kinda ran out of stuff to talk about. That couldve been solved by more ggplot2 and R instruction at the beginning of the semester. Im leaving this class knowing how to use ggplot2 and R, which I did not know before, but I have some MAJOR holes in my knowledge because the psets were not designed in such a way that forced you to learn and understand the ggplot2 and R concepts. But it was a cool and interesting class. Not hard at all which was nice! And Coppock is a gem!\r\n\r\nOne last thing (and this is more for Prof Coppock cause he is totally the kind of professor who cares about what students think and would read the class feedback). I would change the pset grading system. Its very kind to give us a 0,1,2 scale where you basically always get a 2 for doing the work. However, it means that any small screwup on an assignment (like forgetting to answer a problem or giving some lame answer) DRAMATICALLY impacts your grade since a 1.5 is a 75% and there arent that many psets. I would make the psets harder, require more engagement with ggplot2, and then grade them normally with a couple points for each problem.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- LOTS of support from TAs (Shikhar literally saved my life) and Prof Coppock\r\n- Very interesting and engaging lectures\r\n- Psets that help you develop your skills in R\r\n- Useful and applicable information\r\n- Ability to showcase your work when Prof Coppock incorporates students' assignments into the lesson\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- One small thing: the first PSET was unnecessarily difficult for people just starting out using R. I spent 5 hours completing it (I had no prior coding experience) and didn't feel like I had as much support as for the other psets because I didn't know the TAs yet. All of the other psets were fun and manageable, but the first one I felt like I was scrambling, especially compared to some students who were already fluent in R",
                "Strengths: Fantastic and iconic lecturer who did a great job making each lecture interesting and informative, really helpful TAs who taught us a lot of coding in section, great problem sets that helped us put things into practice and learn by doing. Weaknesses: Could have used a more guided rubric for the final assessment as it was left really vague and I wasn't sure what I was going to be graded on or what was expected.",
                "Strengths: a small lecture and a great professor who cares about his students and loves about the subject area. Weaknesses: some of the topics are a bit disjoint so in the middle of the semester it's easy to lose motivation and stop going to classes.",

                "This course is excellent. Professor Coppock is very engaging and excited about the content. And data visualization is a very good skill to have. I think this course could be improved by having us also learn other data visualization software like tableau at the end. The end of the course as is started to feel repetitive.",
                "The freedom and versatility of the classs subject matter greatly benefited this course. We learn quite a bit of general code which could be applied to almost any research field. The open-ended assignments allow us to really stretch the capabilities of the examples we are given. The only real downside that comes to mind is how professor Coppock doesnt always post the example code weve seen in class. They would give us a great starting point for any new projects.",
                "Some key strengths of the course were that it contained really fascinating and fun lectures, had lots of opportunities for thinking outside-of-the box, and taught me some really valuable skills in data visualization that I will continue to use! There were no real weaknesses of this course I can think of.",
                "Strengths: I liked learning about the theory. I thought lectures were usually pretty engaging. Really liked the incorporation of art and history. I think the workload was really balanced and wouldn't change a thing there. I think we had the chance to try things out and you could spend more time on them if you wanted to really challenge yourself. The problem sets were primarily graded on effort, which encouraged me to take risks in my visualizations that I might not have otherwise.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of our problem sets had the same general format (homage/redesign). Might be nice to switch it up a bit. We focused a lot on the critique of existing data visualizations. But when you are determining what kind of visualization to make for a particular applications, what are some principles/best practices that might be helpful? I think that could have been incorporated a little more. Lecture code wasn't posted for most of the class (thought this was done after student feedback later in the course). Lecture slides weren't posted for the most part. Alex tried to explain why, but I still think it would be valuable. Because there are so many visualizations in the lectures, it's hard to take notes/draw/recreate those and the key points about them. I'm completely relying on my memory, and that's not providing much detail/isn't going to last very long. It would be nice to be able to refer back to them. It would be nice if we got an introduction/motivation for the tidyverse way of organizing data.",
                "This class was very strong in its ability to teach the basics of ggplot2. However, towards the end of the course, lessons began to feel a bit repetitive and dull because we had learned most of what we needed to know for the final project by mid-semester.",

Honestly, his lectures were highlights of my week.\r\nProf. Coppock not publishing his lectures served as incentive to come to class, but I would have appreciated R code (I could reexamine after class) for the new ggplot techniques covered in class. (Since we often sped through the code.)\r\nSection was the best way to learn the R code necessary for the problem sets. Because Shikhar was so great, I always learned a lot at section. However, with a TA less adept than Shikhar (and if I was less experienced with R), the model of \"learn all the technical skills necessary for the problem sets in section\" may not have worked for me.",
                "Strengths: Coppock's accessibility, entertaining lectures",
                "This course is well-designed but is NOT easily comprehensible for someone without prior coding experience. There were not enough opportunities to learn or relearn basic R language which unfortunately compounded throughout the course and made it difficult to catch up if something was missed earlier in the year. The lectures, readings, and conceptual teaching of the class were extremely well-designed, but I believe it should require an intro coding class or provide more additional enrichment or tutoring options.",
                "The strengths of this course are the teaching team and the topics covered. Professor Coppock is an excellent instructor that presented clear and concise lectures throughout the semester, while being receptive to student feedback, The Teaching Fellows also led great discussion sections and actively supported students with the course material through office hours and additional assistance in section. The variety in topics covered in the class also improved the learning experience.",
                "I thought this course had some interesting lectures about Tuftes rules for visualizations and also some fun / engaging partner assignments, but I did not take away much from most lectures and thought the material was incredibly limited. I wished we got more into design principles and how they are often used by the best graphic artists today, but we mainly covered one or two graphs a lecture."

Class is like watching a TED Talk, with fun interactive pieces that involve oil pastels or polls. I really enjoyed the readings and the problem sets - often, I found myself spending time on them not because they required it but just because they were so interesting. Many of the psets are open-ended, allowing you to tackle a visualization problem however you see fit - this feels more authentic to how visualization works in the real world (not with a professor telling you which type of graph to use but you having to figure it out for yourself). One thing I will note is that this is truly a data visualization class, so it may not be for you if you're trying to learn fancy statistical techniques or how to clean messy data.",
                "Absolutely. This class is useful, incredibly fun, not too hard and will fill you with a passion for data visualization you had no idea you had. You will leave with useful skills; an understanding of the importance of data visualization essential to social science and statistics; and a collection of interesting takes and facts about data visualization. You will also have a great time doing it! It is possibly my favorite class I have taken at Yale.",

It also encourages you to think critically about your surroundings.",
                "Yes! You learn a solid dataviz foundation in R and ggplot2 if you are engaged with the material.",
                "Absolutely. Alex is an amazing and passionate instructor, plus the contents of class are super interesting and useful when it comes to building a better knowledge of ggplot2 and R.",
                "Im not sure. I enjoyed the class, and I would definitely recommend Professor Coppock! But I did not learn a ton of coding  perhaps it is my mistake for assuming there would be a lot of coding. I did learn some cool history and had a fun time learning about visualization. I think Professor Coppock could add a lot more content to the class, especially in the R department. We kinda ran out of stuff to talk about. That couldve been solved by more ggplot2 and R instruction at the beginning of the semester. Im leaving this class knowing how to use ggplot2 and R, which I did not know before, but I have some MAJOR holes in my knowledge because the psets were not designed in such a way that forced you to learn and understand the ggplot2 and R concepts. But it was a cool and interesting class. Not hard at all which was nice! And Coppock is a gem!",
                "Yes! I had 0 coding or stats experience prior to this course, and I learned SO much and ended absolutely loving it! If you are on the fence because you feel like you'll fall behind students who have more experience coding, don't be afraid. I was nervous to take this course, but I found that my inexperience actually encouraged me to be more engaged, take advantage of every resource (use office hours, email TAs, meet with Prof Coppock, listen to lecture), and I felt supported throughout the semester! Take the course, you got this!",
                "Yes!! This is a great class that combines polisci, data science/coding, history of data visualization, and graphic design principles. You will develop a lot of practical skills to make all future ggplot graphs incredibly well-designedsomething that can be applied to almost any field of research! The lectures are all very engaging and interesting, and the problem sets are all pretty fun too. Be aware of the final project being 25% of the grade, as the rubric this semester was a little vague. If I had more time I definitely would have gone to office hours to ask more questions about it, so something to keep in mind!",
                "Definitely! I'm an S&DS major but there are people from all sorts of background in this class so it's really nice. The 3000-word final is a natural continuation of learning and it didn't feel too stressful at all.",
                "Yes! A low stakes way to improve r skills while creating good graphs.",
                "Absolutely. I think anyone would benefit from taking this class and learning about data visualization in todays data driven world. Its an exciting fun class.",
                "yes if you'd like to take it as a stats elective",
                "Definitely! The workload is extremely fair, with weekly homework assignments that are neither mindless, nor overburdening. Many of them were geared towards how creative we could be with our knowledge of ggplot. Professor Coppock keeps lecture engaging with a completely new and exciting topic every time.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class! It was a stress-free opportunity to learn about a critical component of statistics and was very applicable to nearly every field of research, from social science to the physical sciences. The assignments were pretty straightforward and, while they did require a fair bit of work at times, were definitely rewarding.",
                "Yes. The material is interesting and I found lectures engaging. I appreciated the mix of theory and practical applications with respect to data visualization. I had coding and R experience, so I can't comment on what this was like as a first coding class. I usually work in base R, and I was kind of hoping to come out of this with a more balanced perspective with respect to the tidyverse, but I'm not sure that quite happened. I wish there would have been more motivation/justification for why organizing data this way is better.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to students who are looking to explore basic r in a political science context.",
                "Yes! Please take it! Its one of the best courses I have taken at Yale! You will learn a lot from this class.",
                "Yes. Great 5th course to learn an increasingly important skill in todays world.",
                "This is simply the perfect class.",
                "Absolutely.\r\nData visualization is a valuable skill for basically every academic field. And PLSC 349 has such a reasonable workload that everyone who can should add it as a 4th/5th class. (That said, the workload is negligible: psets can take as long as you want them to take, and I often spent 5+ hours on each week's pset. If you are not familiar with R, the first two psets will require that you seek out extra help.)\r\n\r\nYou will learn something new every class. Lectures are phenomenal (dense with interesting material and concise).",
                "Yes! Professor is great and the TAs are super helpful. Super chill class and useful skills. Highly recommend!",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is not too familiar with data visualization, R, or statistics, who is interested in getting started! I gained a strong command of the R programming language and familiarity with all kinds of graphs and visualizations, including networks, animation, and maps! The TFs are extremely helpful and complement course material very well.",
                "Yes! One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to any student who would like a great foundation to R and data visualizations more generally. This course helps students understand R, how to analyze data visualizations, and how to create the visualizations, in a very comprehensive manner. These skills are transferable to other political science courses as well.",
                "This course is a good fifth class and straightforward way to fulfill a requirement for the data science certificate. In all honest, it is not the most rewarding, but if you remotely enjoy creating data visualizations, it can be incredibly engaging and an easier A."
