Nothing changed, so it was hard to become engaged. It seemed like as a class we never dived into the material beyond brief overviews and 1.5 hours worth of general dicussion. On our own, I am sure we had more engaging thoughts, but there was not enough space to share them.",

However, that's not really a flaw of the class so not sure how it could be fixed.\r\n\r\nStrengths: seminar discussion, I always enjoyed the class and seeing what other people had to say, and giving my thoughts on their thoughts."
