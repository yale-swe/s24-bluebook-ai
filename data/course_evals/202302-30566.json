                "Incredibly well-taught course. Learned not only comprehensive vocabulary and grammar but also discussed the cultural and religious history of Morocco, which allowed us to communicate with our host families and the locals within the community. Although the center is based in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, there were numerous opportunities for trips and cultural activities built into the course that allowed us to explore various cities.",
                "The program was situated at an institute called Qalam wa Lawh, which was an absolutely fantastic place to study. Qalam was small, but a perfect size to house its students, and it always felt cozy and welcoming. The daily lunches were nutritious and delicious, the teachers were kind, knowledgeable, and patient, and were able to teach all of our lessons in Arabic without impeding our understanding. The host of tutors and open tutoring schedule made me feel like I always felt like I had someone to go to if I needed help with coursework, and the women who worked in administration became some of my closest friends during my stay there and I always felt like there was someone looking out for me who would listen to my requests if I had any. The location of the institute was fantastic because it was situated in a very safe neighborhood with easy tram access and in close proximity to most of the major areas in the city. We had several weekend trips around the country which were wonderful! Transportation was coordinated as was housing and the itinerary, so we students could focus on enjoying and experiencing the various cities. I am so grateful to be able to say that in my two months in Morocco I visited all of the major cities and saw most of the most important sites. I think so fondly of my time there, and miss it every day.\r\n\r\nThe program was very strong, but if I had to improve one thing it would be the scheduling. Our weekly schedule was Modern Standard Arabic from 8:30AM-12:30PM every day, lunch from 12:30-2:00PM, Moroccan Arabic from 2-4PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and 1-2 hour long activities afterward ranging from calligraphy to cooking classes. While all of the learning and activities were rewarding and very interesting, it was sometimes difficult to find a healthy work-life balance when some school days ended at 6PM and we still had homework for the next day. I think that it would have been more beneficial for us to give school days a maximum duration until 4PM, which would give us enough time to get homework done and still have a bit of wiggle room to explore the city.",
                "The instruction quality was good but communication with the language school was a  hassle. The coordinators were often inflexible and interpreted feedback as a personal offense."

                "100% recommend this course. The staff at Qalam Wa Lawh is beyond incredible. They foster a welcoming environment for all students and are committed to students' success in speaking and writing skills. Words cannot express how grateful I am to have learned from such encouraging and helpful professors.",
                "Absolutely! It was a life-changing experience for me. The quality of instruction was fantastic, the cultural engagement that we were provided was very high, and I learned a huge amount of Arabic in a very short time. For those looking for intense and fast-paced, but fun and fulfilling experience to learn Arabic, this is it!",
                "No, solely based on the price. While its certainly a solid program, its hard to justify paying 4-5 times as much as the other students at the language school for the same quality of instruction just because its a Yale program.  It also feels unfair that the Morocco program costs the same as the other study abroad programs in Japan, Germany, France, etc. despite the conditions being worse and cheaper. Coming from a middle-class family, it was a significant financial burden and I would do it independently if I had to do it over again."

                "Although I am still intending to major in Theater and pursue a career in entertainment, this experience showed me how much I had come to love the Arabic language. I first began learning Arabic because I fell in love with Middle Eastern music specifically from the Levant, and throughout the past year much of my interaction with Arabic culture had been from the Levantine region. Coming to Morocco, being immersed in an entirely different side of Arabic culture divorced from what I had previously become very familiar with, gave me the clarity to see that its not just one region I love, but the language as a whole, not one culture I love, but the various nuances throughout Arabic speaking regions that I love. In addition, I interacted with a lot of poetry at the institute I studied at, which cemented the passion for Arabic literature that an Arab-Islamic Literature course Fall semester of Freshman year sparked. I am currently considering a NELC and Theater double major, may be taking Classical Arabic along with Modern Standard Arabic this coming Fall, and am brainstorming ways that I can create or find intersections between my love of Arabic language and theater. I would love to do film work in Arabic speaking countries in the future, and while moving to Morocco would not be conducive to a career in primarily American entertainment, I am itching to go back and am considering it as a place to retire."
