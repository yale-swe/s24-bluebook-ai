                "pushes students more than JAPN130 to speak in Japanese",
                "This class is very well organized! There is always a weekly schedule, so you know what you have to do before each class. Assignments were graded very quickly and there was good communication between the teacher and students.",
                "The strengths are how you get to have a small class size and become good friends with your peers, and the extra events promoted by the class to help improve your knowledge of Japanese culture\/language. Additionally, the Japanese Language Clinics are really helpful for engaging in regular conversation and learning more intricacies of grammar structures learned in class.\r\nOne of the few weaknesses of the class is that I'm not really a fan of the Intermediate Tobira text book, because it was made *before* the two Beginner Tobira textbooks (it was made in 2009 and the beginner books are from 2021 and 2022), leading to some frustrating inconsistencies.",
                "The main strength was how organized the class was, since there were daily, weekly, and monthly syllabi for the whole semester. This was very helpful in terms of knowing when tests and projects were and always knowing which homework was due the next day. The weaknesses were maybe that there wasn't any in-class time to work on group projects at first, but this was improved after spring break when we got more time to work.",

                "Yes! If you want to improve your Japanese skills, this is a great next step.",
                "Definitely! I had such a great time in this class and truly believe that I learned a lot about both Japanese culture\/history\/geography just through the readings and topics that we covered.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because even though the workload was intensive at times, I had a good time learning Japanese and felt a strong sense of connection to my classmates due to the small class size. I think that continuing Japanese at Yale has been worth my time and this class has made me want to move on to the advanced levels.",
