                "I learned about different theories of Orientalism, subaltern studies, ngritude, and others. We read Said, Spivak, Cesaire, Fanon, and weekly novels",
                "The syllabus for this course is amazing. I really enjoyed the literary, rather than the theoretical focus of the course. We read authors that I have never been introduced to in other classes in a way that I felt was more accessible than the typical Yale upper level seminar. Prof Habchi is also a sweetheart.",
                "This course helps to define, as much as possible, what the postcolonial is and how amorphous the study can be considering the modern worlds relationship with post colonialism. Even further, if taken for French credit this course allows the student to write in a foreign language about modern implications of race and colonialism both inside and outside the context of the francophone world, a very challenging but beneficial exercise.",
                "This was a really good introduction course to the studies of post-colonialism and relevant topics within the field. Taking this course gave me a lot of understanding about the most prominent discussion and arguments about what post-colonialism is and how this framework can be used to explain the experiences of those in the Global South and or working in the \"aftermath\" of imperialism and colonialism.",
                "This class provided me with the skills to question and critique many of the historical and present-day systems of knowledge and power. The different texts we considered allowed us to observe the way the colonial project shaped and continues to shape social, economic and political institutions.",
                "I had virtually no knowledge of postcolonialism or postcolonial theory, and now I have a pretty solid foundation. We read a lot of really intense theory, followed by a wonderful selection of books to build upon the theoretical readings. We talked about the subaltern subject, what it means to be 'postcolonial,' if that is a thing at all, the female vs. male subject, colonial history (in France especially). We talked about beurs, beurettes, the author and the author's role in a work. Spivak, Foucault, Gramsci were major players. And then we moved into all but two originally French books, which were mostly incredibly interesting. Some less interesting than others, for sure, but all equally important to the course as a whole. Postcolonial theory and its literature are complicated, but Professor Habchi is the one to study it with, for sure."

                "strengths: interesting discussions, Professor Habchi is wonderful and amazing at leading the class, manageable workload\r\nweaknesses: some of the theoretical pieces were a bit dense but the discussions really helped",
                "Strengths: Having the course split between Theory and Literature was a really clever way to introduce all this material especially to those who were new to it. The books we read were not terribly long but were very well selected and expanded my understanding of post-colonialism greatly.\r\nWeakness: I would have loved to have some outlined discussions questions that would help guide my reading especially because we were reading such dense texts that I sometimes felt overwhelmed about all that the texts were discussing. This would have helped shape our class discussions too and avoid some awkward silent moments.",
                "This was such a great class! Professor Habchi made sure to allow time for questions and discussion. The readings built on each other and were all engaging.",
                "This course is essentially all strengths. I think the people in this class, combined with Professor Habchi's discussion leading prowess, lent itself to an incredible class environment, where I'd leave each class having learned something new or had something new to mull over for the rest of the day. While some of the material definitely went over my head, it was worth wrestling through it, and the class environment lent itself very well to such a task. I will say, however, that sometimes the discussion started to fizzle out, and I thought we could wrap things up, but we continued talking (sometimes repetitively) -- which was both a strength and weakness. We also didn't receive a whole lot of feedback on our writing, save for a small comment with a grade on Canvas; I might have appreciated more thorough feedback. I think also, perhaps providing points to guide our reading might be helpful, as going into some of the readings blind, especially the theory readings, was really difficult. When I say the theory readings are hard, I mean they \"make you question your English skills\" hard level difficulty. And so I'm not sure I got out as much as I could from these particular readings because of that. Aside from that, fantastic course. (Slightly unrelated: Professor Hachi is incredibly kind, granted me not one but two extensions on a paper, very cognizant of the turmoil throughout campus, held space for us to discuss how we were feeling, and was all-in-all wonderfully approachable. Wish all professors were like her)"

                "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in studying policy, language, or ethnicity-related subjects. The course provides a critical look at present-day and historical power relations and the wider implications that these different levels of power have on knowledge and identity.",
                "On the one hand, I'd say \"yes\" emphatically, without a doubt. However, this course is targeted, perhaps implicitly, toward a particular demographic, or subset of Yale student. If you come into this class with a more conservative world view, I can see why this class might not be a good fit for you. If things like \"western temporality\" or \"time is colonial\" are buzzword type things that tick you off, steer clear. However, if you're prepared to read some really difficult theory, delve into great works of more modern French literature, and build a foundation in a field of study that doesn't really have a definition (like seriously, what even is \"postcolonial\"?), then this is wholeheartedly the class for you. I did the readings for the majority of the class in French, so I would definitely recommend that -- Kiffe kiffe demain in the original French is a diamond of a book, and it's such a lovely experience reading it in French. That said, English is perfectly fine, too."
