    "I learned about architecture styles from all over the world across different cultures and time periods. It was so interesting to come to class and learn about different monuments and it definitely made me want to travel and see them in person.",
    "Honestly not that much :\/",
    "Writing about architecture, thinking critically and deconstructively about architecture, history, and the connection between the two. I gained an appreciation for the complexity of documenting history particularly through architecture, on top of exposure to monumental and representative pieces of architecture from antiquity (Babel) to the Baroque.",
    "This course made me think about architecture more broadly. I wish assignments were more closely related to the course.",
    "We studied materials, features for supporting weight, and how historical decorative styles applied them in architecture.",
    "I developed me understanding of architectural history.",
    "A survey of architecture from Antiquity to the Baroque",
    "Viewing architecture in a critical way",
    "Taking this course helped me view this world in a different light. I learned there is no such thing as (capital A) Architecture, more that each person finds different buildings important.",
    "I learned how to participate well in a small group setting.",
    "I gained a deeper appreciation for a wide range of architectural styles, a knowledge for how to analyze architecture from a theoretical and practical perspective, and a newfound direction for discussions about architecture.",
    "I learned a lot about being critical of the approach to fact.",
    "I found a deeper appreciation for the ways in which we accept and question history, and how we decide what qualifies as Architecture.",
    "I learned how to apply large questions surrounding architecture (its form, purpose, historicity, etc.) to individual buildings, and how to effectively write about them.",
    "Some knowledge about architecture, though not enough that I could point out a building and tell you its history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Kyle is an incredible lecturer and makes it very interesting. His analysis of structures always amazed me because he could talk about one subject for such a long time and pick out details you would otherwise never think to notice. He is very enlightening and changes your perspective on how you see the built environment. You learn a lot about major monuments like the Pantheon and Parthenon. Sections were interesting and engaging so it was fun to discuss the material and bounce ideas off of classmates.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings were a bit long and you don't need to do them all if you show up and pay attention in lecture and section.",
    "I understand that it is difficult to have a good survey class on ALL of the history of architecture (from antique to baroque), but I really felt like nothing stuck and that we went through chapters either too shallowly or too quickly. I think we should have more lectures on the nuts and bolts of each type of architecture rather than have the narrative lectures that Kyle presents, which are interesting but would be much enriched with a lecture first on the actual architectural styles and history first. Yes, the nuts and bolts should theoretically be covered in the textbook, but no one actually reads every week. Grading of the course also feels weird. At midterm grade evaluations, students with very similar performances and grades leading up to then had significant grade differences. Overall, I wish I could have left this class with a broader knowledge of the history of architecture and architectural styles over the centuries, but I am not. Section was not productive; it felt like filler time.",
    "The key strength of the course was how it strove to move beyond the structure of a conventional history of architecture class - rather than simply presenting examples of important architecture through time, the lecture and discussion sections tried to break down concepts such as style and tradition, and highlighted the roles these definitions played in the history that everyone constructs for themselves.",
    "This class is more of a philosophy class than an art history class - I wish this would have been stated online. However, Professor Dugdale is very passionate about this class.",
    "Its strengths were the lectures and theories. Its weaknesses were the examination structure and vocabulary quizzes.",
    "Strength: it is quite unconstrained and provides great freedom in exploring and interpreting the material. The lectures are very interesting.",
    "This course organized in a very traditional way in a chronological order \r\nThe quiz is not particularly helpful \r\nThe textbook has so much words and so few pictures and I am not sure whether it is the best reading",
    "Professor Dugdale is brilliant. He links ideas together seamlessly. The course would be lost without him. I only wish I was able to see my grade evolve throughout the term.",
    "I think the class has a good emphasis on how malleable history is, encouraging students to see conventional architectural history in different ways. However, I often struggled to keep engaged in class, because Kyle talks really slowly, with a lot of dramatic pauses and repetitions. Sometimes it felt like he barely said anything in a 50 minute lecture. I'm not sure I learned all that much in this class, except for a skepticism towards architectural history in general (which is important). I think we were expected to learn most of the conventional history (who built what, in what political, social, cultural context) from the textbooks and readings, but without reinforcement in lecture, as an auditory learner, I'm not sure I retained much. On a separate note, section was always interesting and we had a lot of fun discussions.",
    "The textbook-survey approach to architecture is a practical and thorough way to teach a wide range of architectures. I came out of the class with a strong appreciation for how such a broad array of styles across the world are connected. However, at times that textbook-survey approach is boring. What helped was the professor's interesting, thought provoking lectures that poked and prodded at the architectures from a theoretical perspective. This approach was rooted in asking more questions than answering them, which I found to be intellectually stimulating. Along those lines, the supplemental weekly readings and section discussions were interesting counterpoints to the routine textbook spiels.",
    "I think this course suffers from being caught in the middle of two pedagogical approaches, one is a critical analysis of architectural history while the other is a more traditional historical approach. Push this course into the more radical form of studying architecture.",
    "I think the professor is a strength of the course, but he is forced to contend with the flawed foundations of the class.",
    "A large weakness of the course would be the structure. I wasnt sure if the course was theme\/thesis driven, or chronologically driven. I think either option is fine, but clarification and organization is needed in order to retain the interest and level of engagement that students have in the first week. \r\n\r\nAlso, I found it lard to take notes during lecture because Kyles means of lecturing was less conveying information, and more so telling a story with no narrative thread. \r\n\r\nA strength of the course was the supplementary readings  I wish we had spent more time on them, or, at the very least, that they were given equal weight to the textbook.",
    "Too much lamenting about the name of the course! If you don't like that it is called History of Architecture I, change the name instead of talking about it every day in class!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course and have been to all my friends because Kyle is such an incredible professor and the material is so fascinating. I genuinely enjoyed the course very much and am looking forward to taking more like it in the future.",
    "No. I think there are better classes for learning about architecture. This survey class is way too much of a survey.",
    "Definitely - it serves as an excellent survey of architecture across a wide range of time and geographies, and allows one to appreciate architecture we see daily and acknowledge their debts to prior examples.",
    "It should be noted that this class is more conceptual than face based. I would only recommend this class to someone if they were interested in thinking about art history conceptually. I wish I came away with more knowledge from this class than I did.",
    "This was a fantastic course.  The information was stimulating, the architecture we looked at was breathtaking, and it is not hard to get a good grade.  I am not an architecture student (I took this to fill a humanities credit alongside a bunch of pset classes) but it ended up being my favorite course of the semester.  Especially if Professor Dugdale is teaching it again, this is a must-take class.",
    "Yes, this course was in keeping with other writing based architecture courses I've taken. The topics were interesting and it's very obvious that professor Dugdale is passionate about his work, which makes it fun to come to class.",
    "Yes, however, I would only recommend it to students with a background in art history.",
    "yes",
    "I think it is good if they are architecture major student, but for other students that take it out of interest, it may not be the best",
    "Hmm probably not and if you're thinking of majoring in the Design track of Architecture (in which case this class is required), I'd take it as soon as possible before Junior year because it's really annoying to take during Studio and when your life is more intense.",
    "I would definitely recommend. Yale is a beautiful campus and taking this course can help students realize where we are.",
    "If you are required to take this course as an architecture major, then yeah, of course, take it. The workload is pretty low. Some interesting ideas are floated around. However, I'm not sure I'd recommend this course for anyone who isn't required to take it. History of Architecture, of the entire world, for all of history, is a pretty much impossible course to teach. Because the subject is so broad, it  feels like you learn very little. We spent most of the semester talking about why this subject is impossible and necessarily leaves out important voices and narratives. So, if you are interested in architectural history, I think a course with a more narrow focus would probably be more engaging and satisfying.",
    "For students with little knowledge about architectural in general and who seek a broad encounter with a range of architectural styles, I would recommend this course. The class gives a good \"flavor\" of different architectural styles to students, but does not teach too deeply.",
    "I would recommend a more developed version of this same course for sure. I think it definitely is just a step from being an excellent analysis of architectural history.",
    "Yes - I think it provides an interesting lens through which to look at history",
    "I had to take the course because its mandatory to my major, but I think that a student would be better off taking Modern Architecture in a Global Context if theyre looking for an architecture course.",
    "No, unless it is required."
