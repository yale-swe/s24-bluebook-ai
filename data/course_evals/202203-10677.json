P3 not only allowed me to learn a lot, but also fueled my passion for learning Spanish because I got a small taste of all of the amazing things that I could be engaging with if I achieve fluency.",

                "I think that the weaknesses of this course are the daily homework assignments which just felt like busywork. Also, the very rigid structure of Linguameeting is not great.",
                "I loved the professor and how fun the class was. We learned a lot but it was never a stressful or cut-throat environment.",
                "No weaknesses this class was perfect",
                "This course is strong in that you learn lots of information, unfortunately the weakness is that I feel the course does not give you the time to process all of this new information. I know students should do homework outside of class but I wished there was greater emphasis on practicing the language and tenses outside the VHL homework.",
                "Supersite, the homework platform, was helpful. I believe shorter, nightly assignments are necessary for students learning a language so we can practice daily without feeling overwhelmed. There was always sufficient practice given before exams, and the exams were always fairly made and fairly graded. The Wednesday asynchronous day was another strength of the course. The only weakness is the amount of Spanish spoken by the instructor to the students in the course. I believe level 2 Spanish should have the instructor speak just some English, especially when giving instructions and clarifying complex topics."

                "Yes, definitely. If possible, take it with Professor Alexandrov!! She made the course amazing. I genuinely looked forward to class everyday. I never felt judged and I always felt like I was being pushed to try my best. Professor Alexandrov creates a really special and unique classroom environment, and I'm sorry that not everyone has this Spanish experience.",
                "Absolutely. It is relatively stress free and super fun, but you also learn a lot of spanish and make good friends.",
                "ABsolutely, this course was the highlight of my year here at yale",
                "I would. I love spanish and I grow more in love with it everyday. Also I think this helps get you into enough spanish to be able to begin reading and understanding subtitles and speaking to others. This is a great essential course in the language. Again you learn lots of tenses and vocab that are helpful.",
                "Yes. This course teaches you a lot of the language in one semester. If you are interested in learning the language but willing to put in daily work, this course is for you. Although it is a very difficult course, the daily classes were always enjoyable."
