In the second half of the semester, we learned about the history of K-Pop, spanning from the 1980s to now.

She is very understanding and will always make time to talk to her students if they need any help at all (or just want to talk!) \r\nWeaknesses: None! However, if you take this class because of just New Wave or just K-pop, you will find the other half of the class quite boring compared to the section of the class that is about the music you like! So, be open-minded.",
                "strengths: fun class if you're interested in these music topics, easy to understand, super engaging\r\nweaknesses: power points were sometimes boring",
                "Strengths: Professor Kao! She is very knowledgeable about the history of both New Wave and K-Pop, and being an ER&M and Sociology professor allows her to go more in-depth on the racial and social dynamics of the time. The class promotes collaboration, and we (classmates) got really close by the end of the semester! Professor Kao created a fun environment and encouraged us to share our thoughts and opinions. The guest speakers were also all lovely and it was nice to hear from people who lived through what we learned in class. \r\nWeaknesses: None, really! The only \"complaint\" I would have is that because the material is relatively new (the material being New Wave and K-Pop and how they're connected), there aren't many academic writings, which makes it difficult to use multiple sources other than the ones we read in class for our final papers.",

It's not just a music history class, as we really do learn about how \"race, place, and gender\" influenced New Wave and K-Pop music. Professor Kao is an incredibly nice professor that will definitely make your first year much brighter!",

                "YESYESYES!!! A thousand times yes especially if you like british new wave and k-pop! This was definately my favorite class of my fist year and I'm so glad I got to take it. The essays aren't much and the playlists don't even feel like homework if you listen to them with someone else and jam along together!"
