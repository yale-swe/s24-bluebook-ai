Galois theory was an exceptionally interesting subject and I gained much more insight into field extensions and the symmetries between roots of polynomials. This was the the most engaging and fun math course I've taken thus far. Moreover, I felt that through the problem sets I developed much stronger proof writing skills and critical thinking skills as I was forced to delve very deeply into the weeds of the concepts we'd studied in order to understand and then solve a problem.",

Cool things we learned as part of this included: why there's no general formula for roots of degree 5+ polynomials, what n-gons are constructible using ruler and compass (and why we can't trisect an angle), and other cool stuff. Practiced proof writing and problem solving skills.",

                "Overall the course was extremely well taught and the problem sets were extremely engaging. At times, however, I did feel that the course went a bit slowly and felt I could have had a better experience had the pace gone quicker giving us more time to discuss the applications of Galois theory.",
                "The course is fantastic: lectures are clear, meticulously planned, and engaging; psets are of a reasonable difficulty and reinforce class concepts excellently; exams are fairly written and straightforward tests of understanding; Miki and our TA were both excellent, and there's a huge support network for students.  If you want to see what committed teaching looks like, take any course with Miki - it astonishes me every time.  Maybe there are weaknesses, but I can't find them.",
                "Great course! Very organized and Miki is amazing. She made the content seem very interesting.",
                "One of the best things about this course is the psets.  They really give you a wide variety of problems to practice working with the concepts and weren't too easy or hard.  At the end of the day, psets are how you learn in a math class, so good psets translate to lots of learning.",
                "Great course! The material was presented well to build understanding as we went, like how theorems were explained thoroughly before proofs were given. Problem sets were a good level of difficulty, built upon material covered in class, and were helpful to solidify knowledge.",
                "Strengths: High engagement, lectures clear, Miki is a great instructor",
                "miki is a great professor and she does a great job with the class",
                "Miki is fantastic--she's super clear at explaining concepts, very encouraging, and cares an incredible amount about her students learning. The course material also happens to be very pretty.",
                "I think this was a very well organized course. It was very hard, but the instructors put in the work to have corresponding supports",
                "NO WEAKNESSES\r\n\r\nStrengths: Miki is absolutely a gem of an instructor (literally FLAWLESS) and the content itself is incredibly interesting",
                "This class is very difficult and abstract and covers a lot of material. However it was taught my Miki so if one put in enough effort, it was possible to wrap your head around the material.",
                "This was a great course. The material was engaging, the teaching was great, the work was satisfying. I wouldn't change anything.",
                "The instructor - Miki - was definitely a strength, as was our ULA. Take this class if Miki's teaching it - Miki does a good job of scaffolding new material, affirming students while keeping the course rigorous, building community, the list goes on. In general the course was very good as a result - all the material was delivered effectively and the course ran very smoothly. The only weaknesses of this course are more general weaknesses of math courses - e.g., at least in this year, it had timed exams (and timed math exams are kinda silly from a design standpoint), and most of the course was lecture-style, neither of which are necessarily weaknesses per se, but there could be more experimentation with the course format and tailoring it to help all students learn.",
                "Mostly I just need to improve my own sleep schedule (which deteriorated in the second half of the semester).",
                "The course was very cohesive and well structured. The homework assignments were very useful for consolidating one's understanding of the topics introduced in class, and the pre class assignments ensured that we reviewed concepts continuously throughout the semester instead of just before the exam. Some of the homework problems were quite challenging, but there were many office hours to get assistance. I do not have any complaints, other than that sometimes the lectures moved quite quickly, although that might have been necessary to get through all of the material."

Galois theory is such a fascinating subject and a really beautiful way to apply techniques from abstract algebra to understand something as simple as symmetries of roots of polynomials. The applications of Galois theory are also astounding and getting to see how we can use this theory to examine topics like the solvability of polynomials by radicals is absolutely fascinating.",

                "Yes! For students in the math major, take the algebra courses! They're great",

                "If you're interested in more algebra, this course is a very fun course. - I also personally found it more engaging and interesting than abstract algebra, since it's less of a 'toolkit' course and has more direction in proving cool results.",
                "Yes, absolutely.",
                "Definitely, assuming they have the right background.\r\n\r\n(In general, I am a big proponent of learning things out-of-order and trying to learn topics you don't think you're ready for yet... for self-study. For classes with work and deadlines, I think it should be pretty linear.)",
                "Yes, if you enjoyed Math 350!",
                "YES YES you should ABSOLUTELY take this class, especially if Miki is teaching. Miki is the best lecturer I've ever had -- in math or otherwise -- and never failed to make the content engaging. The way she ran the class was wonderfully designed to facilitate student learning, and it always felt like she had our best interests at heart. Her psets are challenging and engaging, her tests are very fair, and she's very receptive to student feedback. And learning Galois theory is SO rewarding. The theory is beautiful, and the payoffs are incredible (proofs of Fundamental Theorem of Algebra!! proofs that not all quintics are solvable by radicals!! learning about what can be constructed with a ruler and compass!!). This class seriously resparked my love for math, and I wish everyone could take it.",
                "I would recommend the course to anyone who enjoyed MATH 350 and would like to see more algebra (especially if the course is taught by Miki). The material is very interesting\/ pretty, and the course was organized very well. But I would recommend to be prepared to put in quite a bit of work, as lectures move quite quickly at times and some homework problems can be quite time consuming. I think it would be a great experience to take any course with Miki - she really cares about her students and puts in a lot of effort into teaching, which may not be very common in the math department."
