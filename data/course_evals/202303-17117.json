Dont let the twelve lectures fool you, come exam time, you will realize that it is a lot of content! Since Prof. Edwards is a botanist, I also learned a great deal about plants and their reproductive life cycle, which was fascinating!",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The course lectures are clearly laid out. \r\nWeaknesses: I have talked with quite a few MCDB faculty and other faculty members in the science departments, and I, along with them, struggle to understand the point of the introductory bio sequence. I found this course to be tedious to sit through, as the professor explained basic information at an alarmingly rudimentary level. This is no criticism of the professor, but the nature of the course itself. I do not understand why students majoring in MCDB are required to take this course and the bio sequence in general, when doing so pushes them a year back in taking more advanced and intellectually enriching courses. I had taken BIOL 102 a few semesters prior, and fondly remember engaging in rich discussions about figures during journal club. I was beyond disappointed to see that most of the papers we were discussing in this course were reviews, and the section leader did not even make an attempt to have students pair up and explain figures. Having taken upper level science courses that expect students to be accountable for understanding and explaining figures, I struggle to understand how the approach to education in BIOL 104 prepares students for upper-level biology courses, as its mission claims to be. This course presented redundant information, and the material chosen to be delivered was either way too basic (information I had learned in a ninth grade biology class), or needlessly obscure.",
                "This lectures were really long sometimes and that made it difficult to stay engaged at times. I did find the topics interesting though.",
                "The course covered a variety of topics and was very engaging. The assignments were not overbearing, and were usually interesting. The excursion to the Peabody was both fun and informative. Sometimes, I felt that the expectations for the work were not as clear as they could have been.",
                "Strength: interesting sometimes\r\n\r\nWeakness: the bio sequence as a whole is a disaster. But this course definitely shows that. I understand that there's a lot of information to cover in half a semester, so this course should be a full semester. Or, considering this is an intro bio course to INTRODUCE people to E&EB, the course material should be significantly reduced. Having 100-slide lectures that are extremely dense in content is not normal; it should not be expected of students to memorize all of this for a final. If anything, a final project or some other way of connecting all this information would be better. But a final exam forces cramming of information without truly learning it, and turns the course into a very negative experience. A lot of this goes for the whole bio sequence, but especially for this course. The professors and TFs were good, but the structure of the course is horrendous.",
                "Very well organized for feedback",
                "Strengths: Ericka Edwards is a fantastic professor - probably the best lecture-style professor I've had thus far. The subject material is succinctly delivered, the writing assignments and PSets are incredibly useful, the tests never feel like they're trying to make you fail or mess up as opposed to 103, the class is engaging and collaborative, and the TAs are phenomenal. Weaknesses: I wish there was more time to go over a few topics that were glossed over. I wish there were more Psets or opportunities to test ourselves on the subject material.",
                "Phenomenal lectures, but slides are not as excellent--some redundancy and disorganization. I liked the workload, but I think have psets for the second half of the course would be great. I LOVED that the \"final\" was not explicitly cumulative, only cumulative in the sense that concepts are buildable.",
                "strengths- professor edwards is super cool and obviously loves her job. weaknesses- the exams (at least the midterm) are super nitpicky and sometimes the answers are not directly on the slides, they're just based off what she said. so that's a tricky line to navigate",
                "Strengths: it's better than BIOL 101-103.\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are long (like 100 slides) and often a bit dry",
                "Very memorization heavy.",
                "Strengths: The Peabody\/Marsh Tours give an in-person experience in ecological biology. \r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were recorded BUT only given in the last week of classes (just to study for finals), no review session for the midterm or final by the instructor, a lot of memorization required, no clear application, PSETs are ungraded.",
                "A strength were the assignments as this is where I connected with the course the most. A weakness was the amount of material covered.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures, relatively low workload compared to BIOL 102 and 103. Chill atmosphere that was such a relief after the stress of BIOL103.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it's hard to tell what is a fun fact that is there only for the sake of example and intrigue and what is a fact that you will need to recall on an exam.",
                "strengths: pretty well organized and slides were neat and understandable \r\nweakness: covered so much content in such a short time span (though I guess this is just the nature of the course), we also were not provided a review session for both the midterm and the final or any practice tests.",
                "Theres so much memorization its difficult to know whats essential and whats just extra information.",
                "This course was a great wrap-up to the bio sequence. Super interesting for those who have never learned any evolutionary biology.",
                "The strengths are that it is engaging and the Professor is amazing, the weaknesses are that it can have more resources and the the teaching scholars could be more receptive to being reached out to.",
                "Overall, I think that lectures were well organized and pretty easy to follow - I think it was still imperative to attend lectures because there were some things explained verbally in class that were not well explained on the slides themselves. I would've appreciated more transparency on the format of exams other than short responses and a practice final. I felt like I didn't know what to expect with the midterm even with the practice short answer. I think the short answer is graded in a very specific way.",
                "In terms of strengths, the material of the course was very manageable to learn and the professor had a very easy to follow lecture style. I liked that the peer tutoring continued as it was very helpful for review during reading period. In terms of weaknesses, the biggest one the class has is that the p-sets aren't worth any points. While I understand the changes that occurred surrounding the grading system, it made it so that the exams had a major impact on the overall course grade. I would have liked if the grading system made the exams have less of a dent in the grade.",
                "strengths: professor edwards is really kind, knowledgeable, and a good professor; weaknesses: i feel like the point distributions on tests are a little skewed in that if you make small errors (even with partial credit) a decent chunk of your grade is taken off. do not slack off just because this is the \"easy\" one out of the bio sequence.",
                "Strengths- minimal homework, good lectures, allowed AI on papers",
                "The lectures could be very boring at times which made it hard to focus, but the instructor spoke clearly.",
                "This course covered an immense amount of material, much of which was memorization-heavy.",
                "The main strength of the course was Prof. Edwards. She was a light in the classroom. She made us laugh and smile from plants to animals to fungi. All of the lectures were engaging and fascinating. I loved the visits to the Peabody Museum of Natural History and to the Marsh Botanical Gardens. I only wish that all discussion sections were tours. I would have loved the chance to visit more (if not all) of the collections and feel that I would have learned more doing so than reading another three papers. With regard to the discussion section papers, I loved the first three about ring species, invasive species, and lizards. I did not care for the one on human ancestry; I recommend choosing a different paper that is easier to comprehend. I loved the Writing Assignment; it was straightforward and fun to complete. Additionally, I appreciated that the problem sets were ungraded. This allowed me to complete them stress-free. The main weakness of this course was that the ecology segment of the course was condensed into only two of the twelve lectures. I wish that there was more on this part of the field, including sampling techniques. Another weakness was the lecture on rerooting trees. A video that was posted on Ed offered a much better explanation than was given in class and I recommend reconsidering how that lecture material is taught. Another weakness was that most of the exams revolved around memorization. In the age of ChatGPT, testing on memorization seems archaic. I would prefer the questions to be application-based. For example, the Tree of Life that students were asked to memorize could have been provided on the exam and then students could have been similarly asked to order organisms by order of relatedness. This would essentially teach the same principle without forcing students to memorize a Tree of Life with 10+ groups, especially since that group can easily be Googled. I also wish there was a Review session before each exam, especially for the final, given OUTSIDE of the discussion section.",
                "This course had incredibly thoughtful lectures and the professor was very good at taking time during the lecture to answer questions. The lectures were additionally well-timed.",
                "The strengths of this course was that the content in the slides were in depth and showed many different examples. One weakness was that the class is mostly dependent on one paper and two exams which puts a little bit of pressure. In addition, I believe the expansiveness and broadness of the content covered in this course truly needs to be restructured because when studying for the final and saw my notes go from the Big Bang and RNA Theories to incredibly specific animal evolutionary behaviors to why human birth is more difficult than ape birth, I realized the material taught in this course goes all over the range of biology."

                "Honestly, no. This course is tailored towards students without a general knowledge in education and evolution, and it shows in the content chosen to be included in the lectures. It's disheartening that students who did not place out of BIOL 101\/102 and thus decided not to take the placement exam for BIOL 104 are forced to take this course in order to graduate. I would encourage all incoming students to seriously consider whether you want to spend 0.5 of your 36 credits at this institution enrolled in BIOL 104 when you could instead spend the time delving into more rigorously, and frankly, intellectual, material in a different class. Meet with your advisor, dean, and DUS early enough in order to find alternative courses that substitute for BIOL 104. I have talked with quite a few MCDB faculty members who share my views on the disservice that the bio sequence does to the Yale undergraduate education, and they encouraged me (unfortunately, a little too late) to do what I share here.",

                "100%. It is a genuinely fun and engaging class. I thoroughly enjoyed this course, especially when compared to 103. It is a great introduction to these topics and revealed an interest I didn't even know I had.",
