   "comments": [
    "Learned about communication in sociological\/psychological terms as well as the relationship between the public, media, and politicians. Was really interesting in terms of understanding how news is made.",
    "I learned a lot more about the business behind news-making than I expected. Additionally, I learned about the function of politicos\/ spinsters.",
    "A pretty comprehensive overview of American journalism and politics and the relationship between the two! Really fascinating and topical content that I hadn't learned about previously.",
    "This course was not as practical as I wanted it to be. I havent taken a lot of sociology, so that might have been the issue, but it was very heavy on sociological theory and less on actual newsmaking. I really enjoyed the first half of the course when we were focused on learning the evolution of news. But I was less convinced by the theories around what is truth? in the middle. I really enjoyed, however, an recurring assignment called News about Newsmaking which was a short essay analyzing recent news articles about journalism itself. I appreciated how open Professor Mahler was to letting us write about a topic of our choosing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sometimes the concepts get a little hard to grasp and it's easy to sit there very confused and silent, but I believe having a small number of students in the class helps work out the understanding issues. There is a very reasonable amount of work; weekly reading supplemented by questions to guide you through it, and a total of 4 writing assignments for the entire semester.",
    "The readings for this course were incredible and helped my understanding of journalism and the role of politics. Further, the sociology element made me understand the field of journalism in a new way that was incredibly productive. I think seminar could have been a bit more discussion-based\/ structured (ex: a presenter each week to talk on the readings and develop reading questions).",
    "Professor Mahler is very knowledgeable and passionate about the topics at hand. The smaller class size was really helpful for facilitating discussion. I did wish I would have known this course could be more sociology-oriented than political science-oriented (not a strength nor weakness, just noting as it might influence others' decisions to take the course).",
    "The content of the course is its greatest strength--interesting readings with a good balance of theory and applications! I found the reading questions that Professor Mahler posted each week to be super helpful for understanding important parts of the readings. I also enjoyed the few group activities that we did--our class was pretty small and I liked getting to know each other. Also, perfect amount of workload. Sometimes, I feel like Professor Mahler lectures a little too much but the information he gives tends to be pretty helpful. I would appreciate a little more student discussion though!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend if you're looking for an interesting seminar, an So credit, or just a pretty low workload class, but do the readings because it's very easy to fall behind without having in your mind a couple of concepts attributed to certain authors from the syllabus.",
    "I definitely would recommend it for anybody who is interested in journalism or politics. However, I would say the student has to be willing to really engage with the readings, as they can be dense but are incredibly important for understanding the topics at hand.",
    "Yes, but I would let them know that this course can feel much more like a sociology course than a polisci one, especially in the second half of the class.",
    "Yes! I absolutely loved the content--if you are interested in American journalism and politics, this is the class for you.",
    "Im on the fence about this one. I cant decide if I just wasnt prepared for the type of sociology involved, or if I was unconvinced by the crux of the course (intersubjectivity theories). Take this course if you are a sociology student, or if you are a poli sci student who wants to try branching out into something totally different. However, if you know you dont like really dense theories, skip it."
