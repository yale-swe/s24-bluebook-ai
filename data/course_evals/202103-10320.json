                "The strengths of this course is definitely the collaborative spirit and opportunity for one-on-one feedback that helps students grow as writers and thinkers. However, a weakness is that the timeline of having essay after essay can grow to overwhelm students and stunt growth and reflection on the mistakes made in previous essays. Thus, I think having assignments that help do-over problem areas in essays previously turned in or help actively develop solutions to problems pointed out would help a lot."
