                "I learned how to be more critical of US involvement in foreign policy and the reach of US imperalism.",
                "I learned SO MUCH both about American History and how to think and write critically for college courses. TZB provided an innovative method/lens to view American History that revealed so many hidden concepts and ideologies that drive movements.",
                "Learned about the role gender/sexuality in US imperialism, particularly in the contexts of Roosevelt/westward expansion, WWI/WWII, the Cold War/Orientalism/the Vietnam War, and 9/11/neoliberalism. Learned theoretical frameworks to explain a lot of intuitive concepts about how gender serves a political function. Became much more aware of and able to discuss the problematic underpinnings of concepts like humanitarianism and institutions like Yale. As a first-year seminar, this was also the first class where I was asked to create a truly unique argument and apply my learning.",
                "The course offers a basic introduction to the field of American Studies (basically, cultural history of the United States). We learned how domestic perceptions of gender and race shaped US foreign policy, and how in turn US foreign policy shaped domestic perceptions of gender and race at home. The readings were really fascinating and the course was eye-opening!",
                "This course felt like a perfect introduction to Yale seminars. The importance of coming to class prepared was clear -- in order to participate in a meaningful way, everyone had to have read the material and begun to reflect on it. While perhaps not totally apparent from the title, it felt in many ways like an American history course, which I was really happy about -- throughout the semester I was connecting different periods in history that I had never connected before, not because we were memorizing facts or attempting to hit every historic landmark but because we were thinking critically about what eras or events informed the next. I think the texts Prof TZB chose were spot-on -- nothing felt extraneous, everything felt purposeful.",
                "surveying aspects of american history and events through different lenses of gender, sexuality, culture, etc. the concepts from the readings were very liberally applied to all aspects of the coursework, which honed the skill of close reading for quotes, analyzing and synthesizing quotes, and comprehending the impacts the concepts have when applied to modern primary sources or secondary sources",
                "I gained insight into the imperialist mechanisms that US cultural media mobilizes to maintain American supremacy.",
                "I think about this course at least once a day. The content is so relevant to every facet of our lives, and it changed my perspective on life. I am a better reader, writer, and analyst thanks to this class. I absolutely loved the content and the assignments.",
                "I gained new knowledge surrounding academic and argumentative writing, I learned how to better analyze secondary and primary sources and I gained new insight into American history through the lens of gender, sexuality and race.",
                "I gained an ability to perceive of both historical and current events through the lens of gender. I gained an ability to link culture and history without considering them separately. I gained an ability to view the continuing impacts of American empire.",
                "I learned how to read and interpret writing about America's imperial history. We focused on cultural and ideological dimensions of race, gender, and sexuality in the US in the past two centuries. We practiced talking and writing about secondary sources in historical context, and linking them to current events and primary sources.",
                "I appreciated how this course addressed various themes of American empire, specifically by developing a conceptual toolbox through secondary source readings. Without a doubt, AMST 032 spoke directly to my academic interests as well as my identity  I now have a better grasp on my own position with respect to U.S. imperial ambition, the patriarchy, and white supremacy.",
                "This course changed my worldview in ways I didn't expect. I learned a lot of American history while also analyzing the relationship between gender, race, and American imperialism. I came away with this class with sharpened critical thinking skills and new perspectives on culture, foreign policy, and history."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This class was literally so freaking cool in every single aspect. I actively looked forward to every class and dreaded the end of every class. Every class discussion was always super interesting and I loved hearing my classmates' contributions and perspectives. TZB really facilitated our own growth as historians and students without spoonfeeding us answers but still providing support.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings could be trimmed a little but they were still all very good and interesting.",
                "Strengths: readings are almost always fantastic, TZB does a great job explaining readings and is very supportive, the essay prompts are interesting and force you to think critically, it's a course with real applicability to your daily life even if you're not planning on studying WGSS/American studies\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: in-class discussions sometimes felt a little slow, we often lost track of time and didn't get to cover everything. The first class is phenomenal + mind-blowing and it slows down a little bit in later sessions",
                "The readings were really interesting, although sometimes lengthy, and our in-class discussions were eye-opening. I learned a ton both from the professor and from my fellow students.",
                "The format of the class makes a lot of sense, in that the texts we read are chronological (and we get closer to present-day the farther we get in the class). The texts are fascinating (although at times overwhelming -- there's quite a bit of dense material, and everyone writes a short response before each class, so this was something that took some getting used to -- but after a few weeks I felt confident in getting everything done in a manageable amount of time). Most of the class is just open discussion, which I really enjoyed. I think this is a class where everyone takes from it what they put in -- so when, on occasion, a portion of the class didn't do all of the readings/everyone was just really exhausted, this made for less interesting discussion.",
                "strengths: a sort of community fostered that ascends the need for just learning all the time, both the professor and students were allowed to sit back and take in the readings and concepts and then push forward to learn how to really apply them, a very comprehensive learning environment that was not necessarily intimidating but supported growth and the best type of learning\r\n\r\nweaknesses:",
                "Class discussions were engaging and thorough. There was a good balance between explanations from professor TZB and free discussion among the class. The readings were interesting, and I felt like they covered a wide range of related topics but were not too difficult to understand. Sometimes, though, I felt that I didn't always have time to get through all the readings as thoroughly as I would have liked.",
                "No weaknesses. The course was well-organized, engaging, and TZB is a wonderfully warm, intelligent, and well-informed professor who goes the extra mile.",
                "I loved how the course was structured. I felt like each week I learned a new part of one general topic which was extremely rewarding. This approach gave me a deeper understanding of a specific aspect of US history (which was US history through the lens of gender, sexuality and race). If the course had any weaknesses it was potentially providing more guidance and instruction for the papers. I thought I had a fairly good idea of what I was supposed to write, but there were times where I could have used stronger criteria.",
                "The readings and papers in this course were phenomenal, the teacher instruction was very clear, and the prompts for the essays were very good and motivated me to write well. I dont have many improvements for this course.",
                "Strengths: Prof. TZB centers the students' experience and checks in often to help us understand new ways of thinking. She spend time to get to know us personally, which made the course feel significant in daily life. The reading was manageable and interesting, and class seminars reinforced our learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of any! It was a truly amazing course.",
                "Strengths: fantastic instruction, compelling topics, excellent feedback on essays\r\nWeaknesses: more time could be allotted for in-class workshopping",
                "This course was incredible. The content is super interesting, and TZB is an amazing professor. The readings are rather long and can be very repetitive, but they are interesting concepts so you learn to skim them and they aren't too painful to complete. The essays are all very interesting and fun to write, but TZB gives very little time to complete each one. Usually, they will be explained in class then due less than a week later. Luckily, TZB is lenient with deadlines, so it is easy to get an extension if you need more time. For a small seminar, many of the classes felt more like a lecture, but I loved the content and we got a lot of time to participate and discuss amongst ourselves."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course -- as a first-year seminar, I'm not sure if I could recommend it more highly! I definitely improved in my reading comprehension and writing (even though the class doesn't count as a writing credit), and became overall much more confident in articulating my thoughts in a small college classroom setting.",
                "yes!!!! this course improved my understanding of many various topics surrounding american imperialism and was an amazing introductory seminar",
                "I would (and already have) recommended this course. The class offered a way of critically examining history which was completely new to me -- but easy enough to learn and incredibly interesting. I think it would be a good idea to take this class before any additional history classes at Yale. This class definitely improved my understanding of analyzing history, rather than just memorizing it. I think that's an important insight gain, which will shape the way I engage with my history classes in the future.",
                "Definitely- you gain a completely different understanding of the world and power structures around you.",
                "Id recommend to anyone. I had serious reservations coming into this course, but the pace is just right and TZB will always make sure everyone has the knowledge / historical context to engage in discussion.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to any student, regardless of what they are studying , to better conceptualize the creation of the world around them. This class didnt just give me knowledge but fundamentally changed the way I view the world and myself.",
                "Absolutely. This first year seminar was a great setting to practice reading academic texts, writing papers, and engaging in class discussions. I took the class together with my suite mate, and the course material produced many wonderful conversations and inside jokes in our downtime. I feel connected to the people in my class, and to the skills that we learned. It definitely changed the way that I approach American cultural history.",
                "Absolutely  youll learn about the role of your own identities in U.S. world power, while also developing critical thinking and discussion skills.",
                "Yes! If you have the opportunity, this is an amazing course to take. You will learn so much about American history and imperialism plus there are fun assignments like film analyses. This course is a great introduction to American studies and Yale seminars. You do have to put in some work to get the most out of this class, but you will be glad you did.",
                "Yes, this course was a great overview of American history with a focus on race, gender, and empire. The professor organized the class well and listened to the students' needs and addressed them well. I found this class to have a good balance between discussion and teaching. This class allowed me to learn about race and gender, which I can take into other fields and outside of academics."
