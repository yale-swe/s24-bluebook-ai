Having workshops once in a while in place of lab was a great way to get qns answered. Experiments were fun structured and you receive enough help from your TA.\r\n\r\nWeakness : Not enough feedback is given for the lab reports and every TA grades differently but at least its anonymous.",

Also, this course fulfills requirements that many students in the life-sciences need. Also pre-med requirement!",
