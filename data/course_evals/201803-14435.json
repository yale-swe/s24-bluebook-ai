   "comments": [
    "I learned quite a bit about Russia, US relations with the country, and how the governments have worked together historically.",
    "I learned about the history of US-Russian relations since the end of the Cold War and the factors that influence foreign policy decision-making. I definitely leave with a better sense of the relationship between the countries.",
    "I learned much more about Russian views on foreign policy and American decision making in bilateral relations between the two countries.",
    "A great introduction to US-Russian relations that gives you a solid foundation for thinking about this critical relationship. Also provides a worthwhile framework that you can apply to other geopolitical matters. Overall, a very valuable learning experience.",
    "Learned more about how U.S.-Russian relations work and about the underlying motives of both countries",
    "I learned so much about how the U.S.-Russian relationship is playing out in a variety of different geographic regions and on a variety of different functional issues (like terrorism, energy, arms control, etc.).  Similarly, I felt this class really helped to present the history of Russo-American misunderstanding, explaining how the two nations and peoples managed to interpret the events following the end of the Cold War in entirely different ways.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course taught me how policymakers in the State Department actually approach real-world crises and issues today.",
    "This course gave me an incredible overview of the strategic and geopolitical issues that have prevented the U.S. and Russia from improving relations since the end of the Cold War.",
    "I learned how to examine a country from their own perspective and from the perspective of another country. A  better understanding of U.S.-Russian relations, particularly on regional and functional issues.",
    "I developed knowledge of the history of US-Russian relations since the late 1980s, skills to prioritize US foreign policy objectives and understand how Russia prioritizes its own objectives, and insights into how foreign policy is developed and practiced."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the class are that you will learn so much about the subject matter and taking a class with Professor Graham is a pleasure. One weakness is that it's hard to jump into the class without substantial knowledge of Russia, but the resources are there if you put the effort in.",
    "Prof. Graham is friendly and knowledgeable, and the material is interesting, so it's a good class. Much of the seminar was devoted to asking our opinions of certain issues (ex: what should the United States' top five priorities be for dealing with Russia), which was engaging and useful but didn't give a lot of insight into the actual thoughts of policymakers. Overall, though, a strong course.",
    "It keeps the students deeply involved in thinking thoroughly about foreign policy decisions in the two governments. The presentations given by students seemed like a waste of valuable time to further discuss the readings assigned to the class.",
    "Professor Graham is incredibly knowledgeable and was able to field student questions with great care and authority. The course material is interesting, though sometimes it felt a bit cursory. Class assignments were fairly open-ended, which allows students to explore topics that interest them. And student participation is key, so hope for a good and active group of classmates.",
    "It is an amazing course, with fascinating readings and engaging, student-led discussions.  I don't think it could be improved.",
    "This course is incredibly well-organized and taught by one of the most knowledgeable professors I've had at Yale. My only suggestion involves making the class environment more relaxed so that students and Professor Graham can all get to know each other better and feel more comfortable throughout the semester.",
    "Incredible course. Dense readings, but worth it.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive coverage of issues and regional topics in US-Russian relations, analysis of continuities and changes in US-Russian relations between administrations, interesting and relevant readings, passionate and incredibly knowledgeable professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had been able to hear more of what Professor Graham thought about each topic. He typically left most of the discussion to the students, which was helpful for our learning, but I sometimes wanted to hear more about what he thought as an expert on these issues."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Professor Graham is amazing  he has so much knowledge and background in the area. The workload is manageable and the flexibility with the papers allows you to focus on the subject areas you find most interesting.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is a great foreign policy course that delves into bilateral relations between the US and Russia, which is relevant in today's global affairs.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. Overall, it provided a new framework to consider geopolitical relations, and it gave me a very solid foundation for thinking about US-Russia ties in a post-Cold War world. Professor Graham is incredibly smart, and is quite an authority on the topics covered, and so long as you have a class willing to engage and participate-- it's a very worthwhile Yale course.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in US\/Russian foreign policy and how the two affect each other. Professor Graham is absolutely amazing although a harsh grader, he provides great feedback on your work and helps you improve, should you take his notes into consideration when doing next presentations\/papers.",
    "Yes!  Professor Graham is excellent and the readings\/discussions are very engaging.  Further, the assessments are not overly burdensome and are graded very fairly.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in learning more about U.S.-Russia relations. If you have any interest in this topic, it is definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Professor Graham is incredible. His insight and understanding of U.S.-Russian relations is incredible.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in current and past US-Russian relations. Professor Graham is extremely knowledgeable and the course analyzes in depth all the major topics in US-Russian relations. Finally, the course provides a unique opportunity to really understand the Russian perspective on the US-Russian relationship, which is rare for many US-based courses."
