    "I learned to use R.",
    "I very much developed my analytical skills. I also got to learn new methods to deal with problems I often encounter. I also learnt to think critical about research papers, because now I know how some methods work and can use that knowledge to evaluate them. This course encouraged me to be more curious and try to empirically show something.",

    "Economic knowledge like how to describe a question in economy to conduct research easily and also some computer skills like R."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course are that it gives real life examples of the application of the methods learnt and very interesting studies. Personally, I did very few mathematical proofs at home and now consider them very helpful to fully understand where things come from. The weakness of the course is that it is very fast, but with a little more effort it can be done. \r\n\r\nI would say that the course needs more exercises other than those presented in the lecture slides.",
    "It is an intense class and there is maybe a lack of explanation about R.",
    "Strengths: the problem set and quiz are very precise and abundantthey do can improve our abilities.\r\nweaknessthe number of course is too smallit would be better to add more courses.",
    "Interesting and up-to-date real life examples.\r\nMany office hours to help with the materials.",
    "One of the strenghs of the course is that it combined methematical knowledge with empirical questions, theories with R code. I really like the examples provided in the course. The course could be better if the instructor could spend more time explaining the examples in class.",
    "More engagement of students is needed. Maybe more R code practice in class works."

    "No, the TA and the professor do not seem to care much for the students.",

    "Definitely, the course allow the student to apply statistics in order to explain the effects of independent variables on dependent variables in the economy.",
    "Yes I would if he wants to learn more about R and how to understand properly a data set.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who have no prior learning in related areas, otherwise, this course might be somewhat easy.",
    "Yes, I would. I think this is a useful course to have a basic understand about statistics as well as learn some R method.",
    "I will recommend it to other students in economic major.",
    "Yes. The instructor is diligent.",
