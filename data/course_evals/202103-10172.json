                "Sekhar is the strength, he is very friendly, approachable, and a great lecturer. I appreciate that he was always willing to ask us whether we wanted to see a particular proof.",
                "Strenghts: Sekhar is a very good lecturer. He proves everything rigorously. He is very kind as well and clearly cares about his students. Also, for a math class, psets were relatively short. Weaknesses: the material was generally boring until martingales, which I feel like we could have done a lot more of. For example, the proof of the Kolmogorov SLLN took like 2 whole classes and was a big yawn. It would be much more effective if we could get into more stochastic things. Another thing to cut might be some of the CLT proofs at the end of class. We spent some time doing a bunch of proofs, but again, it would have been more fun to learn about more martingale stuff. There were other things we proved that took like most of a class but were just kind of pointless. Finally, I wish the professor would relate this measure-theoretic stuff to basic probability more. For example, conditioning was really hard to understand at first (especially Kolmogorov conditional expectation: very scary), but after I reread my probability notes from last year, I started to put the pieces together for myself to see how everything connected.",
                "Strengths - a lot of material is covered, and it's the kind of stuff you need to see if you're going to do advanced work. Sekhar is incredibly knowledgeable and explains the material very well. Weaknesses - there's just so much material, and it's almost impossible to follow everything.",
                "Strengths: First, the problem sets were very well-thought-out and the final project was a great opportunity to dig deeper and acutely understand the course material. Also, Sekhar was clearly very passionate about the subject and was always willing to meet with and help students. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish this course could have been split into two. I understand that there is a lot of cover in the very short span of a semester, but it really compromises students' understanding. This is not Sekhar's fault but rather the fault of the MATH and S&DS departments. Key concepts such as the Radon-Nikodym theorem are covered in a single lecture and barely mentioned ever again. This is the only thing I disliked about the course: it felt like you were running a marathon but could never slow down for water.",
                "Course is extremely well taught and interesting. Final project guidelines could be clearer.",
                "While this course covers very important material, the lectures tend to be a bit dry, since a lot of the proofs are very long and hard to follow all the way through.",
                "Strengths: The format of problem sets and a final paper with no exams is a nice change of pace from many other math courses. Breaking down proofs from an actual published paper in a field of your own interest is a very important skill and I am a bit surprised that it is not emphasized as much in other courses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course moves way too fast. Students are a mix of people who have taken 300 (which doesn't exist anymore) and 305. Those who have taken 305 feel like the first half of the course is too much review, while the second half goes too quickly and could be expanded to fill the whole semester. I had only taken 300 and felt pretty lost for the first few weeks, but then I got used to the pace. I still feel that I learned more about measure theory (which is very useful but not really the focus of the course) than probability theory.",
                "This course is hard and fast, and Sekhar did a great job of squeezing so much content into so little time. I don't really have any advice to offer on how this course could be improved.",
                "Professor was good at explaining concepts, problem sets could have corresponded better to the pace of what we were covering in class.",
                "Strengths. \r\nProblem sets. These were really informative and a great way to let the material sink in.\r\nSekhar. Hes awesome.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses.\r\nClass pace. This was way too fast. I would have learned so much more if the pace of the class had been about 20% slower, with more examples of how the results we studied apply to the real world of MATH 241. \r\n\r\nLack of exams. It pains me to say this, because math exams are often really stressful, but this course would be better with a midterm or two. Otherwise there is no incentive to review past material, making it very easy to forget results weve already proved. This makes lectures even harder to follow.\r\n\r\nDisconnect between pset and class material.\r\nPsets were way easier than lectures. If the lectures were toned down in intensity or the psets were scaled up in intensity, my time doing psets would have better prepared me to understand lectures (and vice versa).",
                "The homework can be more structured so that we can follow the argument in the class more easily. There are a lot of materials in the lecture indeed, sometimes it is not that clear, what the professor is referring to, good homework design that fills the gap could help a lot.",
                "The class goes way too quickly.  More time should be spent on examples.",
                "I think it would be better if we spend a little bit more time on weak convergence and CLT",
                "Sekhar has great lecture notes that really covers this material well. Great strength there. Lot of notation that got a little tricky to keep track of over time but really that is my problem and just a feature of the material.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were interesting, the content is super cool, the psets, while tough, can be fun, and the final project is great - for me, it was much more interesting and instructive than studying for a final exam. Weaknesses: not sure if this can properly be called a weakness, but lectures go really fast. Sekhar squeezes a good deal of content into a semester. This is a good thing in some ways!",
                "I would have preferred spending a bit less time on the measure-theoretic details at the beginning (e.g., Carathodorys extension theorem) so we could have spent more time on the special topics at the end (e.g., martingales, CLT, maybe Fourier transforms)."

                "Yes, this was probably the best \"learning\/stress\" ratio math class I've taken in four years at Yale. The final paper was a great change of pace from exams and I think I learned a lot more while being way less stressed about exams and grades.",
                "It's a solid class and well-organized, it's just that the content is really dry. There are probably more fun math classes or statistics classes to take. However, if you really need to learn the material in this class, or the professor decides to do a lot more martingales, this class is good.",
                "Yes",
                "Take it as long as you have some time to fill in gaps on your own",
                "Do not be fooled by the \"No course exams, I will take this class,\" mentality. The course material and problem sets are, by nature, very challenging. You can spend hours and hours on a problem only to make very little (or no) progress. Also, the final project is extremely difficult: reading a measure-theoretic probability paper is a feat in and of itself.\r\nThis class is certainly very rewarding but not for the faint of heart.",
                "Absolutely. It is a useful and well-taught course. One caveat is that I would probably not recommend taking it without some preliminary measure theory (e.g. Math 305). Personally, I had already taken 305 and that made the material easier to follow, but a lot of it was still novel and challenging, so I think it would be tough going straight through (although I'm sure it's manageable if you have a lot of raw math talent),",
                "I would recommend probably only if you are interested in studying very high level theoretical statistics (ie grad school). I took the class after taking Real Analysis, hoping for an interesting application of measure theory, and I have to say that it did not live up to my hope, although that's just how the material is I guess.",
                "Yes. I think the way to get the most out of the class would be to have previously taken 305 and then choose a paper for your final project that is related to martingales. Martingales were probably one of the most important things we covered but were a bit rushed through at the end of the semester. If you have already taken 305, you don't really have to worry as much on making sure you have a grasp on measure theory when figuring out what to do for the final project, and choosing a paper on martingales will lead to a much deeper understanding than one would get from the lectures and the one or two problem set questions about them.",
                "As long as they're up for a challenge, yes. It's a very fun course if you can get past the hard stuff, and the subject matter is very interesting if you're a naturally skeptical person when it comes to the copious handwaving present in most stats courses.",
                "Yes, this course teaches you the material in a mostly painless way",
                "I would not, unless the student meets all the following criteria:\r\n\r\n1. Has taken MATH 241 (otherwise the material in MATH 330 seems extremely irrelevant)\r\n\r\n2. Has not taken MATH 305 or MATH 320 (if you already know about Lebesgue stuff, the first month of the class is review).\r\n\r\n3. In taking MATH 241, became curious about formalism (how to prove LLN\/CLT, how to resolve conditioning paradoxes, etc.)\r\n\r\n4. Can follow extremely fast-paced math lectures.\r\n\r\nIf this is you, take the course. Otherwise dont bother.",
                "That depends on where is your interest. If you want to do more research in the related field, people talk in this language, than you have to learn it.",
                "Yes",
                "Yeah. I was hesitant to take the class at first because some folks have said it is difficult. While it is in fact not easy, I think this is probably good for you. You should do things that are probably good for you. So take it.",
                "Yes. I enjoyed the content, which is relevant to many different fields of study. The format that Sekhar uses for assessment is great - pset and project based. Sekhar is a great teacher and very approachable and helpful.",
