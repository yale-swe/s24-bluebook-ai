                "Black Disability Studies was one of the best classes I had ever taken at Yale. There are very few disability studies classes offered at Yale, yet alone one that delves into the important intersections between Black studies and critical disability studies. This class has taught me to re-think a lot of previous concepts I've learned in past HSHM courses through many avenues that I had never considered before. Professor Henry is also such an amazing professor and mentor who is always delighted to share her knowledge with class while holding space for everyone's thoughts and learning processes. I would 100% recommend this class to any student at Yale!",
