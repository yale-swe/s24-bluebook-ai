We read books and graphic novels, and were exposed to videos, movies, and series on Netflix. I was exposed to so much material that was picked specifically due to students' interests.",
                "I learned more about Israeli culture through movies and in-class readings, as well as greatly expanded my Hebrew vocabulary.",
                "I greatly improved my Hebrew and learned a lot about various aspects of Israeli culture. We talked about Mizrachi Jewry, the LGBTQ community in Israel, watching a bunch of engaging movies and TV shows, read poetry, and got to meet with multiple guest speakers. The class was absolutely amazing and Shiri is easily the best professor I've had at Yale!",
                "I developed my Hebrew writing skills through engaging with various media, and I learned to write using more academic Hebrew.",
                "I was able to work on my writing, reading and speaking of Hebrew while learning about key (and very diverse) elements of Israeli culture, the Israeli narrative, Judaism, intersectionality, etc."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Goren's use of a wide variety of materials (movies, TV shows, books, graphic novels, academic articles, artworks, etc) as well as variety of ways in responding to those materials (discussion, written responses, recorded responses, essays, translations, etc.) allowed me to approach different topics in new, interesting, and memorable ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only complaint I had (which Prof Goren listened to and addressed at the soonest possible opportunity) was the difficulty in finding good Hebrew sources for our first essay/project. This was a minor difficulty and Prof Goren did a great job of addressing it.",
                "No weaknesses. It is obvious the Hebrew department thinks very strongly about pedagogy. Strengths were having time to meet with teaching fellows, all the cool film screenings, and the fact that Shiri constantly was tweaking the syllabus based on what students were interested in. Everyone enjoyed translation from Hebrew to English a lot in class so Shiri asked us if we would enjoy doing that as a final project, and we did it. It was an awesome final project and everyone enjoyed doing it. Shiri saw what we were passionate in and used that to impel us to be better at Hebrew.",
                "The class discussions were very engaging and writing responses were good preparation for these discussions. There were often many assignments going on at once, so it was sometimes hard to keep track of due dates.",
                "The biggest strength is Shiri and how much she cares about you not just as a student but as an individual. The variety of different types of material we engaged in was also a big highlight.",
                "This course is great in that it teaches Hebrew through a variety of angles. The materials are consistently engaging, and the class is reasonably paced. Some weeks had much more work than others, but it's possible to work around that  overall, the course is relaxed.",
                "The course is at its strongest because of the instructor. Shiri is excellent! She has crafted a very diverse course with lots of different readings, assignments, topics and ways to improve in the Hebrew language. She incorporates different sources of media very well and within every week is a robust discussion of one or two interesting topics."

                "I would recommend Dynamics of Israeli Culture. It's a fun L5 Hebrew course that is structured like a humanities class in Hebrew. At times, there can be a lot of writing, but it's rewarding to see improvement."
