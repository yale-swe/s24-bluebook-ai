It may help to have more consistent assignments throughout the year because I feel like before the final project, we really only had one other assignment (besides readings of course). Maybe more role-play games would be fun. I feel like the one that we did in the middle of the year really helped me improve my understanding of the subjects we were talking about at the time. I also loved the career panel we had. I found it super helpful to hear firsthand about going into different STEM fields as an undergrad.",

Head Charles was very helpful in giving insight into topics we were confused about, however, I would have liked to have more conversations where it was purely between classmates. I also think it would be interesting to dive more into the private sector."

Professor Bailyn is very knowledgable and Yasmeen was great. The workload is not bad and the content is interesting. Sometimes class discussions can go off on a tangent.",

It covers the scientific aspects of modern astronomy while also looking at the politics and ethical dilemmas at the forefront of space exploration. This class covers almost every corner of modern astronomy.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I learned so much about the field of astrophysics. I also walked away with a much greater appreciation for our universe, and the technologies we use to gather information about our universe."
