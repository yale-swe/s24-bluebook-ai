I came into the class hoping to learn music theory (as one does when they sign up for a music theory class) and I can confidently say that I did not learn a single thing. Professor Quinn developed his own music notation and therefore we only touched upon Western music notation in the last week of class, which was useless because we had essentially not learned a single thing for the entire semester prior to this.

            "comments": [
                "I really enjoyed the beginning of the course, and how it was structured as a \"singing school.\" I thought that was fun, and I felt like I was gradually learning more about rhythm and sight-reading. I liked how we weren't focusing on Western standard notation, because I'd never seen that before. The system Professor Quinn created was also interesting. We weren't learning traditional music theory, but based on what the instructors were telling me, I believed it would all come together at the end of the course, and we would learn standard music notation. However, it never really came together. I felt like we spent the majority of the time sight-singing, and only really touched standard music notation during the last 4-ish classes. It felt like a total 180 from what we had been doing, and I found it really hard to keep up with the music jargon. I felt I came into this course wanting to learn standard music notation, and just be able to understand more about music, and I don't think this class helped me fully achieve that. I also felt that even though this class is meant for those with little to no experience with music, many people in the class actually had a lot of experience, which made discussion sections hard to follow, since people were using advanced terms I had not heard before. Overall, I think this course could be improved by having more emphasis on music notation and integrating standard music notation more with the system Professor Quinn created.",
                "The only strength I can think of is that there was almost no homework. As for weaknesses, the entire class was a disappointment. I really wanted to learn music theory and I wish I took literally any class besides this one. I don't understand what Professor Quinn was trying to do this semester but it really just wasted all of our time.",
                "It could have been a little better organized from the start. The syllabus was constructed on the fly and semester was a bit experimental, so there were a few hiccups organizationally.",
                "Not well organised",
                "A weakness of this class is that it didn't know what it wanted to be this semester and was taking a new approachsometimes it paid off and somtimes it didn't.",
                "Strengths: super fun, not boring, easy homework, intuitive, GREAT TA's, fun final project! \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes poorly run, the professor would neglect to show up occasionally and left us with a less-than-satisfying curriculum to follow. I also think we spent too much time on South Asian/Indian roots and chords, because the point of the course was to work us up to the Western Staff and we barely spent time on that by the end of the semester\r\n\r\n(It should be noted, though, that my class was the first 110 class to exist like this, so we were guinea pigs.)",
                "Strengths: low workload, fun, engaging final project. Weaknesses: disorganized, assignments are posted 1-2 days before they are due, skills aren't that transferrable to instruments but very applicable to voice/singing., didn't learn everything that was in the course description.",
                "Too simple. I could have taken this class in fifth grade.",
                "Strength  very engaging. \r\nWeakness  says that it is for non-music major but I found that many of the topics discussed in group sections were themes that we did not discuss in class. I was confused frequently.",
                "A more set structure would be appreciated, but the style is unique and works.",
                "In class, the course is very engaging and requires your full attention, which I enjoyed. However, because it was the first time the class was being taught in this way, some parts of it felt a bit disorganized.",
                "I loved that this class addresses the basics of music theory from a non-\"western\" centric perspective. We spent several weeks several weeks singing in the Southern Carnatic Indian scale system, and had two guest presenters discussing Canadian Indigenous music and dancing. I loved how engaged each lecture was with singing exercises for at least half of the block. My only suggestion would be to add in more instruction on transcription techniques and technology such as Musescore earlier in the course. From seeing next semester's syllabus, it sounds like this suggestion has already been implemented.",
                "I love the singing school aspect of this course. This was the very first year this course was taught, so it was understandably very disorganized and experimental. The syllabus for next semester looks much more organized and in-depth.",
                "Strengths: I like that the instructor included a lot of non-Western music notation. I learned a few more terms than I had known in the past, and I feel excited to learn more about music theory in the future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps more of a syllabus would have been helpful just in choosing which courses to enroll in, but I honestly did not mind the quizzes being somewhat-randomly added throughout the semester. They were manageable, but perhaps could have been difficult if the workload was a LOT.",
                "I really enjoyed the singing school format, and think singing as a group is a great way to learn. I also really liked my section and found that to be quite helpful. \r\n\r\nAs for how the class could be improved, I feel that too much time was spent on the singing exercises and not enough on introducing notation. If the dept wanted to get away from just western notation, why not teach other traditions of music by themselves? \r\n\r\nWhile its evident Dr. Quinns made up notation was very thoughtful and took a lot of work, I dont know that it helped us understand western notation any better. I wouldve enjoyed a course that introduced a few different notations and then spent more time on western notation. I dont feel prepared for upcoming music classes."

                "Based on how the course was this semester, no. However, I understand that this was the first time this class had been taught, so the instructors were also figuring it out as they went along. We received a syllabus for the next semester on the last day of class, and based on that, it seems like the class will be much more effective at teaching music theory next semester. So I think it depends, because MUSI 110 next semester will be different from the MUSI 110 I experienced.",

                "Yes, but keep in mind that the syllabus is changing drastically for future semesters. The syllabus is probably more valuable than the reviews for this semester given how much will be changing",
                "Not really",
                "If you like to sing during class and generally like music, I would recommend this class. If you are looking for deep technical knowledge I would not recommend this class.",
                "Absolutely. If you're anything like me and play instruments/love music but don't know how to read notes, this is the class for you. I'm not 100% there yet, but I wouldn't even have the guts to try reading staff if I hadn't taken this course. It's so cool to be in a big lecture with people from all different musical backgrounds, interested in gaining a fundamental understanding of something that means so much to all of us.",
                "Yes! As someone who grew up viewing music through the western classical perspective, I found this course super enlightening and very interesting.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student wanting to not only build a stronger base in music theory, but also look at the relationship of intervals through sight singing. As an instrumentalist, this was new for me and I found it to be very rewarding not only in building a new skill, but also deepening my understanding of intervals.",
                "I would recommend this course. The act of gathering and singing together is truly magical, and with the new structure next semester, this course will be excellent.",
                "Absolutely. If you're not interested in Music as a major or anything, this course is still designed to bring an understanding to music that goes beyond simply hearing it. You start to notice different elements of music composition even when simply listening to pop music, and the insights are genuinely exciting. Highly recommend. The workload is not overbearing at all, and will certainly fit in with other courses.",
                "With no change to the current curriculum, I wouldnt recommend the course as I feel I didnt learn much. Ive had some musical experience, which is completely what I relied on to complete the homework and the final project. The notation Dr. Quinn made up was very confusing and I dont think it would make sense to people who havent seen much notation before."
