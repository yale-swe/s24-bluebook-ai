                "This is a hard question. I would have loved more studio time to work, but I also understand that that cuts from discussion time, which was itself pretty scarce. This is one of those classes where there's never enough time.",
                "Strengths: I think Alex was a great instructor and the structure of the course was really helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: There were a few readings that felt overly long and burdensome. In addition, we didn't really end up following the course outline in the syllabus, because we got behind pretty quickly. I think that might be unique to this weird semester, but there were some days I was a little unclear on the homework.",
                "I really appreciated that the course allowed the students to be exposed to a extensive variety of different art fields. I also liked how open ended each assignment was and how open the resources were to engage with new studio spaces\/materials such as the soa print shop"
