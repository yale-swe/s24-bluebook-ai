                "Strength: really boosted my writing confidence and I can see myself improving over time. Weakness: readings in the later half of the course weren't as engaging as the first half, and you could see students less engaged after spring break",
                "The class was amazing. The discussions we had with Professor Riley were engaging, and none of the essays were held on pedestals where we couldn't attack them for faults we perceived. I appreciated the openness of the discussions to disagreement, but also the insights of my peers. The class environment was lovely. No faults that I can think of.",
                "The strength is certainly the way essay writing is taught. Instead of lecturing or directing about the goals of writing, the emphasis is on reading great examples of essays and discussing them, allowing for both a subconscious and active learning experience. I also enjoyed the broad prompts that encourage different yet fulfilling essay types. I cant think of any substantial weaknesses of this course.",
                "Strength: I really enjoy all the readings and all the seminar discussions. Professor Riley is an amazing instructor who leads wonderful discussions, gives great feedback, and cares a lot about the students. I love writing all the ENGL 120 essays. They are much more than assignments but an opportunity to recollect and reflect on pieces of you life. It's a beautiful and rewarding process.",
                "The course facilitates meaningful conversation and the feedback you receive on your work is extremely beneficial. This, with Professor Riley being an incredible professor overall, make for a class with no real weaknesses.",
                "Great seminar good conversations about readings.",
                "Professor Riley is a lovely professor to be around. She has a charm that invigorates one out of their 9am drowsiness. The discussions were well-facilitated. The readings were interesting and fun to read.",
                "Strengths: class discussions were always engaging and I felt like they actually helped me when I considered my own writing. Professor Riley was really accessible and gave very detailed feedback on drafts and final essays. It is amazing to get so much personal attention from such a talented professor! Another strength is the way the class is organized. We covered such a wide range of essays through the five units. // Weakness: I really can't think of anything major, because I loved this class so much. One small thing is that I wish we had more time to write each essay, simply because I am someone who likes to have plenty of time and space to think before and during the writing process (not necessarily because of the workload or anything like that)."

                "I would recommend this course to another student if they're interested in improving their reading and writing. This course, the instructor, and your peers will challenge the way you think and the way you formulate those thoughts into an essay.",
                "100%. I think it's a must-take for every Yale student who aspires to be a competent writer. I am motivated to take more writing classes because of this.",
                "YES!!! I cannot recommend this course enough, especially with Professor Riley! She is so incredibly fantastic. She is so talented and knowledgable. She is also very accessible and will meet with students basically any time to talk about our writing. Her feedback (both her written feedback on drafts and her feedback through conversations) is genuinely very helpful, and I definitely feel like she helped me understand how to become a better writer. Also, class discussions are at once engaging, challenging and delightful. Basically every essay we read this semester was genuinely enjoyable, and so was actually writing the essays. Seriously, seriously, seriously LOVED this class!"
