                "This course helped me develop several important knowledge, skills, and insights. In terms of knowledge, I gained a solid conceptual framework and understanding of the overarching theories that underpin architectural design. I also broadened my imagination and ability to appreciate my peers' work through analyzing different styles and precedents. \r\n\r\nIn terms of skills, I learned various techniques for hand drawing architecture plans, elevations, and sections to visually communicate design ideas. I also improved my modeling skills through hands-on experience creating physical scale models in studio projects.\r\n\r\nFinally, working on out-of-class exercises and semester-long assignments gave me valuable hands-on experience applying the concepts I learned. It helped connect theoretical knowledge to practical skills. Discussing my work with TAs and peers also helped me gain insights into how to improve.\r\n\r\nOverall, this intro course laid an excellent foundation for continuing my architectural studies. I feel better equipped with both conceptual framework and practical techniques to approach design problems. The feedback and support from instructors and TAs also helped me develop self-insights.",

            "comments": [
                "I loved the final lamp project, and also the midterm model project.",
                "The strengths: I think everyone I know had really positive experiences with the TFs. It's incredibly cool as a non-architecture major to be able to work with architecture students, develop their vocabulary, and talk through ideas. Alec and Trattie are similarly extremely kind and interesting people, both of whom are willing to discuss ideas or anything else with students. \r\nWeaknesses: It was tricky at times to understand where to start with assignmentsfor someone coming in with no background in architecture or art whatsoever, I would have liked some sections to be workshop based, or to see more precedent projects for our design assignments.",
                "This introductory architecture course was excellent for students just starting to learn about the field. The conceptual syllabus was structured to help build an understanding of the overarching frameworks and theoretical underpinnings of architectural design. It effectively introduced key concepts and precedents, covering both classical and modern styles through detailed illustrations. The out-of-class exercises and studio assignments helped connect theory to practice. The TAs provided extremely helpful support, taking the time to ensure all students comprehended topics and giving responsive feedback on our hand-ins, which was valuable for improving. Adding more wording descriptions to the lecture slides, rather than just pictures, could help with following the progression of concepts throughout the term. Overall, the material was paced well for newcomers to grasp principles. This was a very solid foundation for green hands looking to pick up architectural design, and I learned a great deal. The TAs were instrumental in that learning through their dedicated support.",
                "I think that a strength is the conceptual nature of the lectures and the lack of a formal test as I think that allows the students to focus on engaging with the material as opposed to just cramming it for a test.\r\n\r\nA weakness perhaps is that the readings did not really play a large role in the course, especially because section focused so much on the students assignments. Perhaps the readings could be incorporated more into the lecture, or fewer readings could be assigned so there would actually be time to discuss them in section.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the section however not everyone got equal time to show their work so I think that it would be better to have smaller sections. For example there were about 10 students in my section and 2 TAs but I think it would have made sense to have two different sections of 5 students with 1 TA each. In fact, we could have even swapped things around each time so that students would get to view different students work instead of just the same five being together.\r\n\r\nI also think that more feedback could be given, particularly regarding grades. I think this would give students a clearer picture of where they stand during the semester and allow them to adjust accordingly. I dont think one round of mid-semester feedback and then one final grade at the end is nearly enough.\r\n\r\nI also think perhaps there could be more engagement during lectures. A lot of the course has to do with seeing so even something as simple as presenting a picture and giving the students opportunity to say what they see could help make the class feel a bit more conversational.",
                "strengths: lectures are short and easily digestible. weekly meeting with TAs where everyone is really encouraging of everyone else's work.",
                "One strength of the course is that it is an introduction; you can take it with little to no experience and still enjoy it. Everyone is pushed to draw, create, and trust themselves. The TFs were very supportive of beginners.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the disconnect between lecture, assigned readings, and section. While I enjoyed the readings that I completed, there was no need to do the readings to understand lecture or to succeed in the assignments. Additionally, the lecture felt disconnected from section because it often covered abstract concepts, whereas we worked on skills in section; while the lecture was usually fascinating, it felt disjointed from our weekly assignments. The decision to take attendance at lecture encouraged more people to show up, but I question if more active listening happened or if people showed up for their 9:25-10:15am nap.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness of the course was that little time and progress checks were provided for the larger assignments (the model and the lampshade). I would have loved to receive feedback from Trattie and Alec before the lampshade assignment, maybe with the model assignment. I would have loved to have seen more work from outside of my section throughout the class. I also would have loved a more iterative process for the lampshade; I would have appreciated a review in section with their TFs one week before the final review, so that we could have time to change it after one round of feedback.",
                "the lecture times could be improved to a later lecture time.",
                "The lectures are a fantastic strength, Professor Purves' lecturing is comforting and warm and full of wisdom that spills over into everyday life. The sections might have been a bit more directed and purposeful.",
                "The sketch book assignments are very effective in letting students apply and learn by themselves what had been taught in class that week. I do wish that these assignments would reference previous ones, that way I could see how my skills had grown instead of constantly trying new things that you are unfamiliar with.",
                "This class was awesome. Lectures were great and section was awesome. I think that your section leaders do play a role in how the course goes, both in terms of grading and general enjoyment, so that is something to keep in mind.",
                "Good course",
                "I liked the nature of the assignments but felt as though I did not receive much quantitative feedback.",
                "I think the strength of this course are the sections. I like how they were structured where we took the time to discuss each individuals representation of the assignment. A weakness would be the lectures. I think there isnt really room for discussion or questions during the lectures.",
                "Strengths: Alex and Trattie are incredibly knowledgeable and give very interesting and engaging lectures. The TAs are also very involved and never hesitated to help when I asked. Weaknesses: The readings, lectures, and assignments are very loosely tied together and it was sometimes difficult to see how one element would relate to the others. There is also no concrete evaluation system and your grade is based mostly on how much effort the TAs think you put into the course, which can be frustrating.",
                "POST GRADES. Currently grades are not posted during the semester so you have no clue how you're doing. You get one paragraph of written feedback on the midterm but no letter so you're completely in the dark. (If you don't have drawing experience, this will come back to haunt you).",
                "A major weakness of the course was the variability in TFs. Since the class is a lecture ones primary engagement with the material occurs in section. My TFs were far less organized than other sections leading to a less engaging experience of the course. I found Trattie's lecture fascinating since they were a bit less concrete and unpredictable that Purves. I wish that the professor made more a concerted effort to connect with the students by taking questions in the last few minutes of lecture."

                "Yes, if you are interested in art or architecture it is a very fun and rewarding class. You will mostly learn about very basic skills and aspects of architecture so if you have these skills or know the basics, this class will be very boring to you. Also, if you do not intend to go to class or put in the effort on already relatively low workload then you will get nothing out of the class and be left frustrated.",

                "I loved getting to create physical models with my hands. Although there was limited instruction on this skill, the model and lampshade-making exercises offer an eye-opening introduction to architectural logic.",
                "Yes, I took it for fun my senior year and found the lectures to be enjoyable and different from other types of lecture courses I've taken. In section you discuss everyone's drawing assignment for that week. My TAs Silas and Tony were both WONDERFUL.",
                "Yes especially if they are architecture majors so that they can learn some basic skills needed for the major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in architecture, drawing, or both. I came into this course with very little experience with architecture, but a passion for drawing that I have mostly ignored the past few years. This class gave me a great opportunity to not only learn about architecture, but an opportunity to reignite my passion for drawing.",

If you already have an understanding of how to approach architectural space and interact with your environment you might not gain much from the course."
