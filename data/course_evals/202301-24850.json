Not only did I grow as a theatermaker and learn applicable skills, but I was pushed out of my comfort zone and encouraged to take risks. This class was a space where I didn't feel like I had to be a Yale Student or a Theater Person, and I could just exist as a person and be motivated simply by wanting to get better at the moves that we were learning. Also sword fighting is really fun.",

                "Absolutely. This course is fun and not too challenging to fit into a schedule while also being extremely practical. I've developed as much practical skill from this course (and the intro version) as from any other course in this theatre major.",
