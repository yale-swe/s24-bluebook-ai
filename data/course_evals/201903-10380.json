    "I learned a lot about many current technologies and how they work. Some of the things I feel I learned most about are transportation (electric cars, self driving cars, fuel usage, pollution, trains, planes) and electricity (how it works, how it is generated and transmitted, electricity needs, pollution, fossil fuels, renewables). The class has an overall theme of energy: how we use it and make it, and the side effects of how we use it and make it.",
    "This course was a great introduction to the area of technology and technological developments.",
    "I learned about modern technology in science.",
    "I learned about how Yale's energy was derived and how it affects society, politics and the environment. I learned more about technologies of the future and how they would address current scarcity issues. It was very eyeopening to learn about the current state of technology and what kind of implications it results in."

   "comments": [
    "The in class visits and the field trips were great. We had other speakers come in pretty often and those were quite enjoyable, and they tied in to the content we were learning from Professor Prober. However, the class certainly could get boring. It was mostly a semester of powerpoints and little interaction, so it felt more like a lecture than a seminar. I thought the midterm, homeworks, and final project were quite fair.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that while the class is named \"Science of Modern Technology and Public Policy,\" the class was at least 90% technology with very little mention or discussion of policy.",
    "The main reason I took this course was for the outside lecturers, and they definitely delivered. Professor Prober's lectures,  however, are often lacking in the \"policy\" aspect of this science and policy course.",
    "The class was mainly focused on science and modern technology, rather than public policy although it is in the name.",
    "I do not see any strengths, but there are many weaknesses. The class lacks structure and material. It feel very unsubstantive and feels a bunch of busywork with no purpose.",
    "I learned about a wide variety of topics but for some it was very surface level knowledge and we didn't dig in to the challenges that came with some of these technologies. This course maybe covered public policy once, yet it is half the name of the course.",
    "The course was more so lecture based, even though it was a seminar. Thus, the course wasn't very engaging. However, the field trips, guest speakers and demonstration of gadgets was very refreshing."

   "comments": [
    "If you want a crash course on a good chunk of modern technology, then I do recommend this course as long as you don't come in with the expectation of learning about how policy affects science.",
    "This class would be good if you are interested in learning about science and technology, but if you are interested in the public policy aspect, this course does not really cover that aspect.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Its interesting, but not super engaging or stimulating. Also, not too much work.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in energy studies. The title of the course is misleading, since policy was barely touched upon."
