                "Excellent close reading in the context of post medieval literature!",
                "I learned SO MUCH from this course. I gained a solid understanding of literary history, perspective shifts in prose, and how to analyze books. I also learned how to craft a cohesive literary essay with close reading.",
                "I learnt valuable skills to allow me to sit with and work towards understanding texts that I otherwise would not have felt equipped to approach.",
                "This course definitely did its job, and gave me the opportunity to noticeably improve my literary analysis skills. I really appreciated the way that the books on the syllabus were not only a really good extension from the first semester of DS, but also that there were interesting thematic continuities through the different styles of literature, particularly that of empire."

                "This course introduces students to a large body of work, but this also contributes to its main weakness in that it does not allow for deep dives into any of the reading. Discussions often centered around the texts compared to contemporary academic and social issues, which I felt detracted from an appreciation for the works in and of themselves.",

                "This course offered a wide selection of literature, with engaging material that was invigorating to discuss.",
                "It helped us learn about aspects of popular texts like To The Lighthouse and Wordsworth that we wouldnt have paid attention to otherwise !",
                "There are far more strengths than weaknesses. Great literary picks, interesting discussion, and a well thought out syllabus. My only critique is that some weeks the reading load was way too long.",
                "This course was incredibly strong in fostering a sense of community, creating excitement for the subject matter, and providing feedback for growth in assessments.",
                "The lectures this semester were absolutely phenomenal  they were not only very informational, and had a good balance of analytical arguments and context across the board, but the professors were just good at speaking and structuring them in an understandable and engaging manner. I also thought the material was really rich, and created a lot of opportunities for fruitful discussion."

                "While I love the premise of DS, I feel that the program often falls short of its intentions. A successful DS seminar requires a good combination of professor and students. If students are deeply interested in literature, I would recommend a more focused course.",
                "yes",
                "Absolutely -- this course is a well-established introduction to Western literary tradition.",
                "If you like lit\/the humanities yes of course! Its very different from semester 1 literature though. I think I found last terms more fun\/interesting which I didnt think I would but to each their own - its possible I just prefer thinking deeply about individual similes and grand stories than realist\/romantic prose, though I love reading both.",
                "Definitely! I learned so much about how to understand and write about books on a deeper level.",
                "Absolutely- if you are looking to engage with these texts, this class provides an excellent environment in which to do so.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who liked the first semester of DS. Professor Lindskog is wonderful, the books we read always felt worth the time I put into understanding them, and though the workload is a little harder than first semester, it's still manageable. DS really means so much to me -- I have met some of my closest friends through this program, and though I didn't realize it during all of the late Thursday essay nights, I will really miss the sense of community and intense commitment to the humanities that DS encourages. Basically, yes, stay in these classes for as long as you can. I really don't think you will regret it.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student  in fact, it was my favorite of the DS classes, first and second semester. Aside from the readings just being super interesting (Walcotts Omeros is probably my favorite thing Ive ever read), the collaborative nature of the discussions we had demonstrated so many new ways to approach these kinds of literature that I wouldnt have thought of without them."
