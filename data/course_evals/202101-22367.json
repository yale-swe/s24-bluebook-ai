I developed my critical thinking skills, listening skills, argument-making skills, and expanded my knowledge about how to think about business decisions in an ethical framework.",

                "The strengths of this course was certainly the discussion based format. Conversations were lively and the class was actively engaged in arguing different viewpoints with their reasonings grounded in the texts. The weaknesses of the course was the quantity and lack of diversity of opinions with the readings that were assigned. Oftentimes there would be many (6-8) readings assigned, most of which said very similar things about a topic at hand. That then led to the conversation in class being very one-sided and us agreeing with each other a lot of the time. I would have found it more useful if we were assigned 2 readings of different viewpoints and then we were to debate it out in class.",
                "Strengths - the topics are very interesting.  Prof Landis is good.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - too much reading.  It would be better to pick a few of the best readings so everyone would do all of them than assign ~200 pgs and have people do random readings.",
                "I think the strength of this course are the readings and discussion, which are usually really interesting and thought-provoking. The weakness is probably the lack of structure. Discussion can feel a little repeated sometimes, because the same issues come up (stakeholder v. stockholder, etc.).",
                "In terms of strengths, I really enjoyed the organization of class (Start with theory, then move into specific contexts). I also thought our class built a meaningful community and I liked how discussions were allowed to move in whatever direction the class took them. This made the class more engaging. In terms of weaknesses, the only one I would note is that some weeks readings were substantially longer than others.",
                "I personally would have appreciated it if Professor Landis sent us some questions for discussion each week.",
                "Professor Landis is totally unclear about his grading and really needs to be more upfront with rubrics and expectations. He also doesn't facilitate proper class discussion and it feels like everyone just talks at each other."

This class is great for understanding different theories that factor into making business decisions and for analyzing cases about past decisions. Someone who is prepared to do readings, have discussions, and ground their thoughts in the readings should certainly take this course.",
