   "comments": [
    "A broad overview of Stanisklavskian acting techniques. If you've had acting training or theater theory classes before, this class doesn't really offer anythingnew.",
    "Learned a ton about acting technique and artistry as a whole from our selected authors that we read this semester, but ultimately the greatest takeaway was the amount I learned from and about myself.",
    "I learned acting theory from several important writersStanislavski, Hagen, Tharp and got to put them into practice. I got much more comfortable in making decisions on my feet and incorporating original ideas into performances or improvisation exercises.",
    "I learned more about the theoretical approach to performance and worked to develop my own creative process.",
    "I learned so much both as an actor (from the readings and exercises and what Hal taught us) and as a director (by watching how Hal taught us)."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I wish that we had focused on a broader range of material. We really just read Stanislavski and there are a whole host of other theater practitioners with views on how to approach acting. Instead of reading two of his books and a bunch of work from his followers, I wish we had looked at a more diverse group of theorists.",
    "Strengths: Syllabus and Hal's canvas announcements made it very easy to anticipate what readings\/assignments were coming, and plan accordingly, which is greatly appreciated since the class is full of busy theatremakers. Work on a variety of exercises and pieces in class in additional to discussion, and I think the theory\/practice balance was hit on just right for this class. Course is accessible even for non-actors who need to take it for the major.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very few honestly, I would've loved to been able to choose any musician I wanted for the rockstar autobiography paper, just because it was more difficult\/less engaging to try to compare my own creative process to one of three people I wasn't very familiar with\/excited about. There are other artists out there who also have published works about their creative process, I think the assignment would've been more effective for me if I could've done it with a musician whose performance style I was already familiar with!",
    "In this course, you learn so much but also have a lot of fun. It's a great balance of work and play that has moments of serious vulnerability but also long fits of laughter. The only weakness on a structural level is that 210 is a completely different course dependent on the professor; they are all great, but students walk away with absolutely different experiences and takeaways, which is counterintuitive for a requisite course that's supposed to set the foundation for the rest of the major.",
    "The class is structured around the readings and assignments as opposed to the performances. The type and frequency of performance is left to the discretion of each individual professor. I really enjoyed Hal's performance assignments, especially those that were outside of the routine monologues and scenes (ie. the Rockstar project). However, I was disappointed to find out that peers in other classes weren't doing the Rockstar project, or could only select scenes from certain works. Hal gave us a lot of freedom which I think is essential in defining our creative process. I think this type of freedom should be considered when creating a concrete curriculum. If anything, I believe it would make the most sense for the performance assignments to be more consistent across the board, and for the professors to have more discretion in choosing readings for the class (ie. incorporating more schools of acting, or applying materials from their specialty).",
    "I loved this course because it was so different from the other courses I was taking at the time  it always felt like a relief to have this class. I also always had fun in this class, in part because it was so small and we had such intimate interactions with each other and the professor. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, we had two short papers due at the beginning and end of the semester (apart from our final reflection paper) that did not seem to be connected with the course at all, and seemed only to be assignments for the sake of assignments, which I didn't really like."

   "comments": [
    "Take it to fulfill the requirement, but I don't really think it would be particularly engaging to someone not interested in the theater major.",
    "Yeah! Especially for the non-actors in the major or people outside the major interested in learning a little more about acting. The course overall was a great introduction to major schools of acting and some good perspectives on art making as a whole.",
    "Yes! It's a great chance to appreciate the theory and work that goes behind acting and performance, as well as to grow as a public speaker, improviser, and actor.",
    "Yes. Although it is geared towards Theatre Studies majors, I think people outside of the major would also be able to draw a lot from the course.",
    "Yes  I learned so much about performance and performing from this course, and I had fun while doing it."
