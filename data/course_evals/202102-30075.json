                "I learned how to conduct extensive research, as well as interviewing methods for different people.",
                "I learned how to report and read reports on serious investigations.",

I knew people who were taking this course because they needed a writing credit and this was outside of their comfort zones, and they thrived just as much as the aspiring journalists in the class! Even online, there was a human connection among my classmates. We always shared insightful discussions and it was great knowing that the work we did was actual, valuable work that journalists would do. We ACTUALLY interviewed people, we ACTUALLY did research, we did it all."

The weakness was organization. I think it would have been helpful for all assignments to posted in Canvas ahead of time.",
                "The biggest strength were the uniqueness of the lectures, such as on trauma and journalism and media law. The syllabus readings were excellent, wish we would've had a chance to discuss more of them. Though I understand the importance of working in a group, the team nature of a project we worked on all term was frustrating. Course materials sometimes unorganized at times--think class would've functioned better as more shorter sessions than 2 3hr sessions/week.",
                "This course does a good job keeping students engaged and having us apply the taught content in journalism.",
                "The course was very engaging and it taught me a lot about consuming news.",
                "The strength of the class is Professor Shapiro. He's passionate about journalism and especially about the history and ethics surrounding the field. The only weakness is that he's typically late in grading and in announcements, which led to some confusion about readings that we had to do and what we needed to complete."

It's so valuable to investigate and to learn more about the community around you in a way that transcends textbooks and readings. YOU'RE almost teaching yourself about the things you're writing about, and that's what's truly special about this class. You are working in the field!"
