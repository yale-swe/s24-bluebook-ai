                "A strength of this course is that it is laid back and can draw people from a variety of academic backgrounds. There is a risk, however, of it becoming so laid back that learning becomes limited. At times I felt like the instructors were looking for ideas\/guidance from the students, but we were looking for that from the instructors, creating a bit of a content vacuum.\r\n\r\nI think the instructors should think carefully on whether this is primarily a performance-based course. I was expecting to focus much more on learning and performing pieces, which I think would be a lot of fun. We had all of the technology necessary to do this but not the requisite ensemble rigor. People need to be quiet and not play when the conductor or someone else is introducing the piece, adding further directions, or tweaking the piece in some way. Also, it might be worth trying to standardize the output from each laptop (choose a \"base\" laptop volume, speaker dB level, and Max amplitude level) so that everyone can be heard without risking blowing out people's ears. What tended to happen is some people would start louder, so then those who were initially quieter would crank up their volume, and so on. \r\n\r\nThis structure would create a clearer student expectation of what we would work on, which might make it easier for students to offer their own ideas (\"we should try ___ piece or try ____ when we rehearse this piece again next week\"). The performance-based approach might improve lab as well. I do not mind having a lab section as long as I feel that there is a reason to be there. Sometimes I felt like the lab time just needed to be filled because there was too little content. \r\n\r\nThe assignments for this course were generally good. I enjoyed reading and thinking about the theory\/history of the laptop ensemble as an introduction to the course. Creating my own synthesizer was also very fun. I think the final project may need to be re-designed. I felt that in my group three people ran away with their own ideas and, due to the nature of Max programming, were not in a position to be helped by others in the group. Perhaps if each person in the lab designed their own shorter piece, that would ensure equal engagement within the group while keeping the length of group presentations limited.",
                "Strengths: You get to see\/hear and participate in a bunch of really nifty demos with computer-based music. You also get to try stuff with fun, expensive equipment and cool sounds. The class is also a great generator for killer band names. \r\nWeaknesses: The work in this class isn't particularly demanding most of the time, so once you get to group performances, it can be hit-or-miss on whether your group is great or a bit detached. Also, the final project was essentially to come up with ideas for short pieces, even if we couldn't execute them by ourselves; that meant \"Konrad and the TAs\" did most of the work, which is nice as a student but also means you feel a little powerless to help sometimes because some of Konrad's wizardry is just next level.",
                "I think more of the homework could be group focused to better prepare for the group final.",
                "The course is amazing in the uniqueness and quality of the music made, instruments explored and the tools used. The sense of community of the orchestra is also wonderful. \r\nCant think of a weakness.",
                "Very enjoyable and chill class which taught me a great deal about synthesizing sound",
                "Great lectures that showed why laptop ensemble is exciting",
                "This course provides so much fodder for different ideas and approaches to this way of creating music! I really enjoyed the time we spent playing pieces in class. I actually wish we could have played even more pieces as a group in class -- I'm especially curious about older ones (although of course I'd bet the tech is sometimes too outdated). Labs were very fun and productive for sandboxing ideas and working towards the final performance.\r\n\r\nRe: the final performance, I did find it frustrating to find myself the de-facto group leader and try my best to hold others accountable to getting their piece of the puzzle done, which didn't always happen, so I think that accountability (for each individual in the group) earlier on in the process would have been helpful.",
                "Strengths are that it shows students a lot of different possibilities for laptop ensemble musicking. I felt, however, that it would have been beneficial for students to have more in-class, large-ensemble performances to showcase how laptop ensembles rehearse and perform a wide variety of pieces."

If you're not a musician, take this class only if you're excited to delve into some weird sounds and get cooking (in a metaphorical sense).",

This isn't your traditional music course which I am used to taking, but it was cool to see the different ways that you could make music from computer software, and Konrad is a great prof who's really interested in the things that he is doing and the sounds that computers can create.",
