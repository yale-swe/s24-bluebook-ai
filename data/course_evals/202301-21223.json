                "Strengths: I think the ASL department approaches language learning in a very approachable and low stress way which makes it easier to actually learn the language rather than stress about assignments, the professors are really really knowledgeable and helpful and I found the assignments to aid my learning a lot\r\nWeaknesses: I think there still needs to be some work done on adding more structure to the service projects, there have definitely been improvements but I think if it's going to be a required part of the grade it needs to be a little more structured",
                "The 4 day a week and learning-centered classroom over grading work very well. Sometimes repetitive.",
                "strengths - class community, lower workload, service projects\r\nweaknesses - seemed like we were running out of time every day, sometimes instructions for assignments were unclear",
                "The course is unorganized at times, and the nature of the assignments can be unclear.",
                "Great course!",
                "I really liked the combination of lecture and small group discussion\/practice in ASL IV! I also enjoyed the emphasis on poetry and translation later in the semester. I would have enjoyed more consistent work with service projects (i.e. weekly check-ins to talk about tasks) as opposed to having work building up at the end of the semester, which I think can tend to happen in ASL courses.",
                "Strengths: voice off policy, lots of ways to interact with other ASL students and the Deaf community, fun in-class activities\r\nWeaknesses: I had a larger class which was a little bit rough sometimes. It took a lot of time for everyone to say how they were and things like that. Also there would be quite a lot of people missing from class some days which was hard if we were doing group work.",
                "Meeting 4 times a week is definitely helpful and relevant to developing ASL communication skills. Classes were always engaging and I always enjoyed attending. There was enough guidance for the semester service project and I felt there was enough support for outside the classroom learning. I would have appreciated better communication outlets with my professor and student peers, such as creating a class groupchat in the beginning of the semester."

When you learn ASL you become apart of such an inviting and positive community of students and staff at Yale. You learn more than just the language, you learn about the Deaf community, the culture, accessibility and so much more."
