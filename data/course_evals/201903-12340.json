    "This fast-paced class will give you an overview of German history. Between ID Quizzes, Essays, and a 3-hour essay-based take-home final, this course uses different forms of assessment to make you critically think about German history. Professor Allen nods to different trends and themes but leaves a lot of room for independent interpretation. The essays are an exercise in concision and using limited sources to make a solid claim.",
    "In this course, I gained a broader knowledge of German history. Though I had already learned about certain aspects of German history in my German language classes, this course covered several themes that I was unfamiliar with, and I found them to be very interesting. \r\nIn this course I continued to develop my skill of reading through primary and secondary sources and extracting significant bits of information. This course exposed me to authors I was unfamiliar with, but whose work I am now interested in, including Hannah Arendt and Timothy Garton Ash.",
    "Professor Allen taught me to think critically about German history through a cultural studies lens, interweaving institutional politics with the daily lives of ordinary people. I became a more thoughtful reader of primary and secondary source documents and more adept at making historical arguments.",
    "Pushed me to improve my writing greatly. I was complacent with this and it really challenged me to develop more critical and deeper arguments",
    "I learned a great deal about German history and its importance. I also improved my writing skills through the three papers.",
    "Critical thinking, source analysis, and sifting through large volumes of information to find what is relevant.",
    "I learned more in this class than most other classes I've taken at Yale. In addition to a comprehensive and well-curated summation of all of German history since its initial unification, I learned the kinds of questions historians are asking about German history, and history in general. I was able to develop my writing skills, analysis skills, and ability to conduct primary research to develop my own theses about material I had learned from the class."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Allen is an incredible lecturer! I felt super engaged the entire semester and found each lecture fascinating, both in content and in the way which Professor Allen presented it.\r\nA quirk of a poor time slot, not many students were in this class, but it was still taught as a pure lecture. If more students don't join in the future, it would be great to hear more of Professor Allen in a seminar format, especially since section discussion was usually pretty weak.",
    "One strength of this course is the lecture style. The way content is covered in class is rigorous, but very engaging. \r\nIn addition, I liked the way that papers were structured in this course, going from a small reading response to a larger original research paper at the end of the semester. \r\nOne weakness has to do with how readings are assigned. Sometimes for discussion section we would have multiple readings, but only discuss one of them. It might have been nice to have certain readings be prioritized, or to have \"framing questions\" going into each reading that we could then use to foster discussion.",
    "Professor Allen's lectures were outstanding  rigorous, well-organized, and lively. The readings were diverse and very well-selected, encompassing a wide range of historical viewpoints. The short essay was a helpful leadup to the later assignments. I loved the music at the start of class. There's not much I would have changed about the course. If anything, the Weimar period is kind of a confusing morass and I wish we'd spent a little more time talking in detail about Peter Gay's book since I found it to be a helpful analysis.",
    "I think the course was very well taught, but I would have liked for the ID quizzes to be more low stakes. I felt that there were too many terms to memorize for each one, and Professor Allen was looking for very specific things.",
    "This course was superficially thought, leaving me with little more depth of understanding of German history than I had come in with. The readings were entirely insufficient compared to every other history class I have taken here.",
    "Strengths: a very comprehensive review of German history that makes sure to include a number of different perspectives on any issue. \r\nWeaknesses: very quickly paced.",
    "Strengths: Each hour and fifteen minute lecture was an engrossing journey through a specific period in German history that was both complex and able to cover a lot of material. Every assignment served a clear purpose without seeming superfluous or like more work for the sake of work. The quizzes ensured that that people payed attention during lecture and took notes, and so actually felt a need to understand and internalize the information. The essays were short, which made it all the more important that the writing was of a high quality and made sure that the students actually had enough time to complete the work to a satisfactory and thoughtful degree. Professor Allen is wonderful to meet with during office hours, very generous with her time. She makes you feel like she cares about you as a person and not just a student, demonstrates that she is immensely dedicated to teaching and not just her own research, cares what students write about, and makes you want to do the best work you can. Weaknesses: there is no time for questions during lectures, and there is a TF even though it is a very small class. It was good to be able to have section each week to discuss the readings and ask questions since there wasn't time in class, but this also meant that we never got direct feedback from Professor Allen on essays and had to go to office hours to ask her questions."

    "I think this is the best history course I've taken at Yale. Professor Allen is extremely organized and knowledgeable; she packs a lot into a lecture, while coming across very clearly. The quizzes and short papers are well conceived and implemented. I felt challenged, but not overwhelmed. Also the topic is great. I highly recommend.",
    "Absolutely! Feels very applicable to anyone regardless of German\/History background. It felt like a nice introduction to history at Yale since it was small but a lecture and had many different forms of assessment. The work is interesting and can be tough at times because you get attached to your topic and position.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would warn them that they would have to remain very attentive during class. The lecture moves at a very fast pace, so you have to strategize with note taking regarding which bits of information are most important. It's not enough to feel overwhelming, just a quicker pace than what I was used to.",
    "Absolutely! This is a memorably excellent class. I was a total novice in European history going into this semester, but Germany from Unification to Refugee Crisis was accessible, super informative, and surprisingly provocative of philosophical thought. The readings and essay prompts were generative and Professor Allen is a brilliant narrator of modern German history.",
    "This is the best history course I've taken here. Professor Allen is an absolute expert on all things Germany and a very engaging lecturer who will help you think clearly about the interplay between politics and culture. Her approach to history makes the subject matter feel urgent and shows its relevance to daily life. I came away with a much clearer understanding not just of German history and culture but of twentieth-century Europe as a whole. And the lectures on Nazism and its aftermath helped me think more clearly about the troubling trends in our current political landscape. I loved this class and I can't recommend it highly enough.",
    "Yes would definitely recommend. Its certainly a challenge but definitely worth the investment",
    "I honestly wouldnt. There is a reason why every other history class taught here is not taught like this. Better off taking Snyders Eastern Europe class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student no matter your major or interests. It is a wonderful class for history majors, but it is also wonderful for anyone interested in anything because the themes of German history have such a broad application to most aspects of history and current events. The opportunity to be taught by Professor Allen will better prepare you for anything you do at Yale afterwards."
