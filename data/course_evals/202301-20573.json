                "sometimes the student run sessions were disorganized / we didn't know the paper well enough to have a substantive discussion",
                "I liked the format, I do wish we got more regular feedback ahead of the final paper",
                "Strengths: Excellent environment for improving your literature reading skills and experimental design. Professors (there were 3 of them) were helpful during class.\r\nWeaknesses: There was relatively little feedback in this class, despite there being 3 professors for 10 students. Most of our assignments were ungraded by the final paper, meaning errors were probably made that I had made before (and didn't know about). Most of the class was quite stressed about grading by the end of the course because we had so few assignments and feedback to fall back on. Additionally, the final project was not explained very well. There was a two sentence explanation in the syllabus for an 8-page paper; a more detailed explanation and example paper would have been incredibly helpful.",
                "Strengths  the wide range of papers and just the practise of discussing interesting biochemistry papers every week. Professors tried very hard to make an inclusive class environmnt. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  unfortunately the grading practises were totally opaque and we rarely received timely feedback on how to improve. I know a lot of people have been dissastisfied with grades this year so BEWARE.",
                "Strengths: Interesting papers, knowledgeable instructors, engaged classmates\r\nWeaknesses: Professors were, ironically, unprofessional. Our first week, the professors did not come to class. After that, posting of the homework was late for several weeks, which was tough because sometimes there were new assignments not on the syllabus, which is unfair. The profs also did not give any example proposals or final papers, or even provide more guidance for these assignments besides page count and font size. Profs also did not grade several assignments. At the end of the course, no one knew where they stood in terms of grading which was very unfair, given that we were expected to submit weekly homeworks in a timely manner. As a smaller note, the homeworks sometimes felt more like busy work, especially the parts of identifying pos/neg controls and how good they each were."

                "Yes, though it depends heavily on who you're taking the class with since it varies year to year. It is a very positive experience to be able to really engage with MB&B in a seminar format after the lecture-heavy two years of the major.",
