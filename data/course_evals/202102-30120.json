The course also dives me into some sort of reflection of the modern world. For example, what will we leave for a future historian to study?",
                "I learnt lots of new different materials that I wasnt know before, the ancient empire course is great!",

When it's been compressed into a 10 session course, the wide variety of contents sometimes intertwined together which makes me hard to follow occasionally.",

Perhaps posting more of the PowerPoints would have assisted class prep?",

As a result, I probably wouldn't recommend it to someone having no interest in Middle East history because they may find it boring and incomprehensible. But if it's someone who has interests or even some study in any of the topics we covered in this course, I would definitely recommend this course because I am surprised by the abundant knowledge of professor Bladel. And his course no doubt can benefit that student a lot.",
                "Yes because it is something that would broad your understanding on ancient empires and extent your intellectual thought on them. Very interesting!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Though it was challenging and time consuming, this course was really interesting and enlightening. This course also helped me understand the current political tensions within the Middle East.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, regardless of their background. It has changed the way I approach my own studies and the way I think about the world. Prof. van Bladel energetically dispels stereotypes and lazy analyses in every lesson; we began with a broad discussion about historical methodology and continued to question modes of analysis and interpretation throughout the course; I gained a better understanding of world history at large, a necessary understanding, I think, for every student. Also, unlike many intro courses, the presentation of the material doesn't feel diluted. There's a fair bit of homework, but by the time the final came I just had to glance at my notes because the homework had prepared me so thoroughly.",
