    "I feel that I learned a lot about ways in which people professionally engage with history. I also learned how to construct a historical argument using many sources. Additionally, I learned how to consider the intentions and possible biases of certain sources.",
    "This course focuses on how people portray historical topics, whether through the written word, conversation, movies, etc. We learned about the different types of historical sources and how we can use and analyze them.",
    "I learned how to write about history in ways beyond the traditional academic approach. I also gained immense writing skills that I will find applicable in every aspect of my academic career and beyond!",
    "This course made me a better writer and critical thinker in analyzing the past. I learned to reflect on history in its context, and the meaningfulness of discussing controversies and uncomfortable topics. The social and political atmosphere today has little meaning without the backdrop of history, and learning to write effectively about history - and explore and challenge the ways much of it is told - has been quite an eye-opening experience. I learned to be a more thoughtful writer with my use of punctuation, adjectives & adverbs, and sentence structures, and a more clear-sighted reader."

   "comments": [
    "For people interested in history, this course has a lot of strengths. There's a lot of freedom in what you read and write about, and you can take risks. You also approach history from new angles and consider new formats for talking about history.\r\n\r\nOne weakness that really impacted the class for me was discussion. Most of the class was discussion, and there were only 5 students, but I didn't feel like I got much out of them. They tended to be a bit echo-chambery, with everyone agreeing. No one wanted to challenge anything. I felt like I couldn't really bring up points that were interesting to me because in general, I feel that my commentary wasn't really appreciated. I felt like if we didn't pick up on what we were supposed to, our points were sort of just nodded at. And the discussion would be sort of herded to one topic even if that wasn't what the majority were really picking up on. Everyone was respectful, but sometimes it just felt sort of futile to discuss if we would just all agree.",
    "This is a wonderful class! Professor Gordon is very engaging, gives thoughtful feedback, and finds ways to encourage shy students to participate. She gives us exercises that help facilitate in-class discussions and directs the discussion based on our interests. The only weakness was that some of the papers could have been assigned earlier so that we would have a little more time on them, but the spacing out of deadlines depends on which semester this course is being offered and the timing of breaks.",
    "Strengths: engaging, genuinely passionate professor, stimulating reading, great discussions, relevant\r\nNo weaknesses!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they liked history and writing.",
    "Yes! This is a fantastic course, even if you are not a history major (I am not). Even someone with the slightest interest in history will benefit from this course. I would highly recommend this course, especially if professor Gordon is teaching it.",
    "Yes, you learn to appreciate history in many aspects and learn how to write better as well",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough. If you are at all interested in improving your writing - and becoming a more historically-conscious thinker along the way, then I would highly consider taking this course. Professor Johnston Gordon is an incredible professor - on top of being one of the kindest people I have ever met - and learned so much by taking one of her courses."
