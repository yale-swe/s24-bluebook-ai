                "This course helped me better understand the ideas behind the Constitution and American politics as well as the many Supreme Court cases dealing with specific aspects of the Constitution. My writing definitely improved as well as my ability to take some of the longer readings and bring their main ideas to class discussions.",
                "Over time, this course gave me the skills to read Supreme Court cases, foundational documents, and political theory papers. Additionally, the class discussions enhanced my critical thinking abilities, requiring me to thoroughly analyze the topics at hand and quickly build evidence-based arguments to back up whatever claim I sought to make. On the writing side, I learned to be more clear and concise thanks to Professor Silverstein, who was super helpful with feedback on papers and always willing to provide extra guidance during office hours.",
                "A fairly comprehensive coverage of American constitutional history and its big themes like government and power, democracy, liberty, and equality. I learnt a lot about how the Supreme Court works through our discussions of significant cases past and present.",
                "I learned how to approach the Constitution, its application in historical and contemporary contexts, and, most importantly, that I no longer want to go to law school.",
                "Amazing class",
                "I gained an understanding of American political history as it relates to the Constitution, from English scholars to modern Supreme Court cases",
                "I feel like I got a deeper understanding of the American political system, while also developing my reading, writing, and discussion skills."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: seminar style discussions led to many thought-provoking conversations coming out of almost all readings. Prof. Silverstein is an amazing professor as he is able to both prompt students to reach conclusions about the readings on their own while also adding in important details when necessary. Weaknesses: some of the assigned readings were never discussed in class and some readings are also very dense compared to others",
                "The course finds its strengths in its passionate and charismatic instructorProfessor Silversteinas well as the engaging class discussions and thought-provoking readings. The only weakness I could possibly think of is that sometimes the conversations became too theoretical.",
                "The reading load isn't too heavy, although some of the older texts might be harder to understand. I think the course is paced well, although we sometimes don't finish covering all of the readings in a session. The blog posts are fun to read and write and I wish I did more of them. I still learn a lot from what others write. The three papers you write are very much focused on what we discuss in class, so the key is just to make clear, well-substantiated arguments.",
                "Strengths: The material and subject is interesting for the most part. A good portion of the readings are enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor is pretty good, but too often it felt like he was getting us to teach ourselves instead of him teaching us. I get that this is the Socratic way or whatever, but sometimes he'd ask the class something and everyone would look at each other with blank faces since none of us knew how to respond.",
                "Amazing class",
                "The seminar structure allows for thorough discussion of the readings, but sometimes those readings were very dense and long so I feel like we weren't able to fully discuss some of the readings."

                "Absolutely. Even if you aren't interested in a career in politics or law, I think this class is incredible, and a lot of that is due to Prof. Silverstein. Each class discussion was engaging and fresh, while also still being connected to the others/ideas from earlier in the semester. The structure of the readings allows you to see where the ideas behind the Constitution come from, and then see them in reality with the Supreme Court cases. Overall, Prof. Silverstein is an amazing professor and this class is great for developing a deeper understanding of American law and politics.",
                "YESS!! Take this course if you have at least the slightest interest in constitutional law or the legal history of the United States. I guarantee that you will come out at the end of the semester being passionate about landmark cases, foundational documents, and current legal matters as a whole.",
                "Yes. For someone with almost no knowledge of American history, much less constitutional law, I found this to be both engaging and accessible. Some people might already be very knowledgeable, but that doesn't mean you can't contribute something to the discussion.",
                "The type of people who should not take this class: Those who have no interest at all in the Constitution, those who hate Socratic Seminar style teaching, those who are absolutely neurotic about maintaining a 4.0, and those who hate philosophy/theory (there was a lot of this and I did not expect it.) If you're interested in the Constitution, go for it. In my eyes, it's a mid class. But that's also because the class wasn't exactly what I expected it to be. If you're into this stuff, you'll eat the class up.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes, definitelythe readings were engaging and the class discussions always had something I hadn't thought of before. The workload was also extremely manageable",
                "Yes, I think the class is challenging, but very rewarding."
