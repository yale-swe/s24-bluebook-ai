In addition to writing 7 essays in this class (including response memos, midterms, a debate statement, and a final), we had many interesting discussions on the history and theory of nuclear proliferation. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the course which focused on Nuclear Crises between 1945 and the early 2000s.",

                "Nuclear politics was an excellent course; highly recommend for those interested in national security, game theory, and international relations. The course is a great blend between understanding why states proliferate, how they proliferate, and the history of nuclear (counter)proliferation. Professor Debs is a great professor, and he is genuinely enthused by the content at hand. The essays and response memos were also very interesting assignments, and I learned a lot just from doing them. Readings were manageable as well.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: \r\n- The professor is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject. I liked that we read directly from his book. \r\n- I really like the discussions at the end of every class, although the same students seemed to mainly participate every class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- The grading seemed a bit arbitrary, especially since it's all done by the TA. Since we weren't given averages or letter grades, I had no way of interpreting my grades. More guidelines or distribution info would've been appreciated. \r\n- I think that pretty much no one did all the reading. Realistically with 3+ other classes, we probably can't read 40-60 pages in depth between each class, especially if we're discussing them in the next class. \r\n- I didn't love the format of the lecture itself. It just wasn't super engaging some of the time. I think it would be better if the discussions were a bit more interspersed and there was more of a norm of calling on students and asking questions throughout the lecture.",
                "Many, many strengths. The students in the class were my favorite part; so many peers with great interests and experiences in national security and high stakes international relations. The essays were challenging, and graded fairly reasonably (a tad harsher than the average political science course.) I do wish that broad questions were asked to the class from time to time, where we could brainstorm together, and then be told why we were wrong/right.",
                "The format of the course, lectures with a discussion component, was great.",
                "The combination of the theory and practical cases",
                "Strengths: well organized, cohesive content\r\nWeaknesses: unclear expectations, inconsistent engagement",
                "It was very engaging. Lectures were very well done",
                "Strengths: extremely interesting content, professor is very chill and great at explaining the concepts, readings are actually interesting, workload is not bad. small class size means theres both lecture and discussion \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes class can be a repeat of the concepts covered in the readings",
                "Strengths of this course are the professor and the material. Class discussions often felt a bit disjointed because the class was larger than a typical discussion section.",
                "Professor Debs is without question one of the best part about this course: he is really passionate and really cares about his students! I thought the format of the class was interesting (lecture with the last 15-25 minutes saved for discussion and debate). It did feel like the workload was much higher than probably necessary and at times it felt a bit overwhelming, especially for the weeks you were assignment a memo. The final debate statement also did feel like a lot. Perhaps having only one memo assignment and reducing the final debate statement by a few pages would help alleviate this!",

Professor Debs is really awesome and he is a great professor who really cares about his students. The material is really interesting but, at times in the middle of the semester, some of the topics can feel a bit dry as they get really technical and analytical.
