   "comments": [
    "Weekly presentations we have to do are useless, much of the course seems geared towards rote memorization. More speaking practice would be better",
    "Strength: Almost everything (good teachers, good course, etc)\r\n\r\nWeakness: Everyday class can get a bit tiring",
    "Goes much too fast",
    "Strengths: amazing teachers, great system with daily quizzes to keep you on track, fair exams\/tests, interesting material\r\nWeakness: at one point in the semester, we only had one teacher for a couple of weeks and we wanted the teachers to rotate more evenly",
    "Alternating professors was amazing for the development of Chinese language skills!",
    "This course could use some more innovative questions. My favorite aspect about the class was when we got to answer questions in a circle and learn about our classmates in the process. I would encourage the teachers to keep having an open mind about the question, and come up with varied questions for each class unit. When answering questions, I wish students could be encouraged to make more mistakes with the language, so that teachers could correct our grammar and give us tips about vocabulary."

   "comments": [
    "It is way too hard, make sure you have an actual reason to learn the language.",
    "Yes-- it's so rewarding to learn Chinese and it's really not that hard. I almost got scared away by the other reviews about how this course is overwhelmingly work intensive. I feel like at first it is, but you get good at memorizing characters and preparing for the quizzes which are very predictable. By some point, it only took me like 15 min to study for a quiz and 15 min to do homework. It just takes practice and smart study skills (i.e. thinking of characters as pictures\/images)",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes definitely take Chinese! You will be amazed by how much of the language you learn in even a semester, which will allow you to articulate yourself quite well even as a beginner. The teachers are so amazing and kind. They really get to know us students! The teachers have helped me so much on my learning journey."
