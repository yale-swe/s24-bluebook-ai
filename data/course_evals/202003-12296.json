            "comments": [
                "It's very well-organized and designed to facilitate learning. There were plenty of office hours and study halls throughout the week, offering students many opportunities to ask for help on homework, get clarification on the lecture material, or just to get to know the professor.",
                "Strengths were very thorough lectures and homeworks paired with very helpful office hours and peer tutoring hours. Weaknesses were that some of the concepts were explained in a bit more of a convoluted way than seemed necessary making some lectures difficult to follow.",
                "The biggest weakness of this course is the structure: completely asynchronous lectures with NO discussion sections, only participation questions randomly thrown into lecture videos. I would find out where the participation questions were in the day's lecture and only watch up until the question. I would not watch lectures after answering the question, because what was the point? I absolutely loved physics in high school but it was very difficult to be invested in this course, when there is little to no motivation to watch lectures and very little interaction with the instructor (which is what made my high school physics experience so valuable). \r\nMaybe the only strength of this course was the flexibility in grading. We would only have to submit 5-6 questions on the PSET, of which half would be graded. This was a much better workload compared to classes like MATH 120, which required you to submit all questions on the PSET and all would be graded. Another grading policy I liked was test corrections; corrections made it very easy to improve your grade in the class.",
                "This class is fairly difficult for people who have not taken physics\/have limited knowledge of physics and the workload is very heavy. But, the Professor Steinacker is very willing to meet with students and the peer tutors are very helpful.",
                "Because all of the lectures were pre-recorded, I found them to be very dense. There was no time to catch up on writing like in a normal lecture so it took me double the amount of time to watch the lectures. I wish they had an synchronous portion to opt into so that I could go to that and I think it would make the lectures easier to watch.",
                "This course is very strong and made great by the passion seen in the professors lectures. It is only slightly weak in the sense of it goes by very quickly  and can be overwhelming at times.",
                "The course was taught very well and I don't have any weaknesses to point out.",
                "I find physics very interesting and applicable, as it is around us at all times but many people do not think about it much. Professor Steinacker has a true love for the subject and tries her best to make lectures engaging, however, it is difficult on zoom. The recorded lectures were helpful so I could pause and follow the information when it became challenging. A weakness, though, is that during these lectures, Professor Steinacker does countless proofs and integrations, which I understand there is a need for, but at times it felt like a lot and repetitive.",
                "To be honest, basically every aspect of this course was a strength. The office hours structure was great, the recorded lectures were clear, and the grading was totally fair. The only thing that I thought could be better was the late work policy, but that is ultimately up to the professor's discretion.",
                "this course is very difficult to take online. It is easy to fall behind or feel like it is being done alone, which makes a difficult class even more challenging.",
                "Strengths: concepts are explained well\r\nWeaknesses: the title of the class is \"Intro to Physics\", but it seems like it's much too challenging of a course to be considered in introductory course",
                "The main boon of this course in past years has been Professor Steinecker and her personality; she made up for the difficulty and grind of the class. However, this semester, we did not get to experience any of that unless we went out of our way to interact with her in office hours. This would not be a problem for a class with less of a workload, but due to the extremely high workload of the class, most of the time that could have been spent in office hours with her was instead working on the next PSET. This is not an individual trend; many, many people experienced this problem. We simply could not afford to go to her office hours when we had to work on the class's PSET, which to many was just as difficult as it is in a normal year.\r\n\r\nWhich raises another difficulty; despite the change in learning method, we were still expected to perform just as highly as they have in past years. In fact, despite the overwhelming amount of fatigue and burnout experienced by the students in the middle-to-late area of the semester that most faculty were aware of due to the lack of fall break, Professor Steinecker never even began to show signs of slowing down. Coursework continued at its normal difficult pace, and we were forced to adjust or risk our grades.\r\n\r\nOne strength of the class this semester I can give is that Professor Steinecker did begin to lengthen the window in which we could take our exams, and for many, this was a saving grace.",
                "This course was taught very well-- although the lectures were super fast (for someone who didn't take AP physics), going to office hours (which were held daily!) really helped me understand concepts. The addition of \"study groups\" during online learning also really helped me study with my peers.",
                "The course allowed for a lot of flexibility. Having the lectures to watch on our time allowed us more freedom in designing our schedules. Our teacher also ensured that we all had study groups at the beginning of the semester. This proved to be very helpful throughout the semester, particularly on Psets. \r\n\r\nThe teacher did well in removing stress from the course. I appreciate the opportunity to make up points on exams if we dont get everything right the first time.",
                "Prof Steinacker was very good at explaining exactly where each formula came from and how to use them. However, at times the PSETs would be graded without very clear explanations as to what exactly was incorrect.",
                "The only suggestion that I have could be to have certain lengthy proofs in an added part to the lecture in order to focus more on applications for the things that we are learning. Other than that, no suggestions.",
                "The lectures were available early and very helpful, and the lecture notes posted afterwards helped me solidify any concepts I might not have understood from the lecture alone. The problem sets were well designed for us to apply the material, and office hours were widely accessible.",
                "Professor Steinacker is a great professor and she truly cares about her students and tries to make sure everyone does well in the class. Office hours are extremely helpful.",
                "The easy access to office hours is very useful in understanding the material. The lack of class engagement is conducive to a lack of engagement with the course.",
                "This course was a great introduction to mechanics. I enjoyed how the course was organized and structured.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were of high quality but I cant really say how much they helped me because I didnt really watch them. The lecture notes were also REALLY helpful and they were amazing. There were a ton of office hours pretty much every day to get high quality help, and I maybe shouldve gone to them, but I just cant stand being on zoom. I really cant wait for in person class because that is where I live. I was somewhat annoyed by the tests (and I guess homework) being open note but you had to follow exactly what the professor did, and sometimes what the professor wrote on the notes was wrong and itd make me go insane and be confused. I also was always really worried about the whole cant use formulas that arent on the formula sheet thing because I always just sort of wrote out the stuff to solve a problem and it made it harder because Id have to look at the  formula sheet and make sure I copied it exactly.",
                "The lectures were taught very clearly and comprehensively. The posted lecture notes were a huge help as well since they allow us to revisit the essentials of the lecture without having to skip through a video in order to review specific topics. The accessibility to additional practice with extra homework problems and test reviews were very helpful when reviewing material before the exams.",
                "Lectures are well-paced and didn't require any prior physics knowledge. Tons of office hours were available so there were plenty of resources for successful learning.",
                "Strengths: Course is structured well. Logical flow of content is very good and delivered clearly. Instructor is very passionate about material and makes material relevant to students.",
                "The greatest strength of this class was Professor Steinacker and her passion for teaching! The organization and expectations for the class were made very clear from the start, and while problem sets are challenging, Professor Steinacker will never leave you hanging or confused as long as you seek her help during office hours. She really tries to reach out and get to know as many students as possible, despite the class being so large, and she also posts special review lectures before each exam as well as extensive notes for each class. Professor Steinacker also uses a lot of demonstrations, which I enjoyed since they helped me understand the concepts through a more visual perspective. One of the weaknesses for this class is that grading by the TAs is sometimes unclear or subjective, and they would take off points if you didn't have things that weren't explicitly asked for. This isn't a big deal for the homework or participation since Prof. Steinacker had a policy where a 90% would be 100% for problem sets and the same for 80% on participation, but it was a problem for exams.",
                "I liked that the lectures were recorded; this made it easy to look back on them which really really helped me study. Otherwise, I found this course very hard to follow. I was brand new to physics; I hadn't taken it since my freshman year of high school. Although this course says no prior physics knowledge is required and it does cover the basics, I found myself at a large disadvantage compared to my classmates who had more physics knowledge. Additionally, we were told we didn't have to know Calc 3, but Calc 3 topics were used in multiple lectures. I also had no idea who my TF was, it was never discussed in the beginning of the course.",
                "A strength was the organization, and the asynchronous nature made class flexible, but a weakness was that the lectures were all recorded, so engagement was not as much as it could be.",
                "I think this course was excellently run.",
                "There were not enough opportunities for live learning or help.",
                "I think this was a phenomenal course and cannot think of improvements. The lectures were very interesting, and Professor Steinacker explained everything so precisely. It is easy to get lost in physics, but her language use was so precise that I did not get lost in this class. I also felt tremendously supported with the huge number of office hours available. None of my other classes come close to this support.",
                "Strengths: TAs, peer tutors, Prof Steinacker! There are so many resources in this class, we had many hours of study hall each day during the afternoon and evening, and Prof Steinacker had office hours for us to ask questions about the recorded lectures. Also Prof Steinackers reviews were amazing!! Weaknesses: Really cant think of any, except the final I felt was really hard compared to the psets and review.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures and thought the class was very well-taught.",
                "The lectures were really clear and thorough. Professor Steinacker explained everything in depth and with enthusiasm, and there were many review opportunities for students who needed them. I know some of my classmates thought the homework was excessive; I didn't find them to be, and I thought they were great as review, but I also probably have more physics experience than the average student.\r\n\r\nI personally found the exam questions a little finicky, with a lot of factors to consider, but this wasn't an issue this year because we were given extra time for most of the exams (I think 24 hours for the final). In person with normal time, I might have felt stressed over the time pressure, but I also like to take my time.",
                "Strength: organized, straight-forward, clear expectations\r\nWeakness: not very engaging in class and hard to get to know peers",
                "This course is well designed in that the psets are not impossible and allow the student to slowly absorb the material in a constructive way. The exams are fair, and there are many office hours and peer tutoring sessions available for when students need help.",
                "Office hours were well organized and helpful.",
                "The strength was the enthusiasm of Professor Steinacker, who made the class quite enjoyable.",
                "I really liked how the course was structured and felt that I learned the material well. The only weakness is that sometimes the problems on the problem set were a bit vague and I was unsure of what parameters I could use in the answer\/ the available information.",
                "The professors notes are very helpful and she goes in depth on things and explains concepts pretty well in class. She also is good at explaining the math. The main weakness is that problems can be written in a confusing way. There are a lot of peer tutoring hours if students are directed enough to utilize them. I wish there was at least one synchronous portion of the class, like a discussion section, to promote engagement.",
                "I can't think of anything that could be changed! I thought all of the assignments in this course were very appropriate.",
                "Strengths: Pre-recorded lectures, a LOT of office hours (amazing ULAs\/TAs), and Professor Steinacker. Professor Steinacker has been teaching the 180\/181 intro sequence for quite some time, and she really has it down pat. Her passion for teaching and physics is readily apparent, and she adapted the course very well for the online format. Lots of support at office hours was also super great during these covid times.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much I can think of. Some psets were kinda long, but they were definitely comprehensive and reinforced physics principles from lectures.",
                "The number one strength was the huge number of TAs and such frequent office hours because it was usually easy for me to get help (with the exception of weekends, when there were no office hours). I think the psets were also extremely helpful in checking my understanding\/mastery of the concepts we learned, and I liked that Professor Steinacker was very organized and sent out messages regarding topics covered in the week's lectures and providing very helpful review guides for exams.\r\n\r\nI often wished an equation sheet like the ones given for exams were available to the class earlier so I could use it on psets. I made my own but I was constantly worried I was missing an equation or something. Given the online format, I think it was also a weakness that I rarely actually got to talk to my professor, especially since I've heard from upperclassmen that Professor Steinacker's personality is one of the best parts of the course. Though I still got to know her a bit through the lectures, it certainly doesn't compare to what one gets from regular live and spontaneous interactions. However, I will also say that I heard Professor Steinacker reached out to some students via email when she thought they could use some extra support after the first midterm and though I was not one of these students, I think its great that she reached out because if I were in that situation I would really appreciate and email like that which shows my professor cares about my success in her course.",
                "Strengths: course material; professorship (!); course organization; homework and exam structure; exam corrections.\r\nWeaknesses: glossed over some material (but may be necessary in a survey course like this); not the most clear feedback on homework and exam mistakes.",
                "Physics is hard, but Professor Steinecker is a great teacher. Also, there were so many resources available to us.",
                "The strengths of the course were the psets that prepared me for the exams.",
                "Prof. Steinacker is amazing! It's so clear that she loves physics and teacher which is energizing. I loved her videos and her demonstrations. The class notes were also super helpful. The psets were also well written and made sure I got the concepts if I didn't get them from lectures. Giving a short outline of all the units and the concepts \/ formulas in them at the beginning of the term or even just the beginning of each unit would be helpful for keeping track of what the formulas we learn are building up to.",
                "Material organization in Canvas is fantastic and consistent. For every class we had the lecture videos and the assigned lecture notes.",
                "Recorded lectures were great, especially combined with participation questions.",
                "This course is definitely a time commitment and can initially feel quite difficult. However, once I realized how vital attending office hours was to my understanding of the material, my work became both more efficient and more satisfying.",
                "In general it was difficult with the course being all online of course, but I honestly thought the demos were still well done. Also the idea of having study groups was really good given the remote nature.",
                "This course did a very good job in introducing students to the fundamentals of physics. Professor Steinacker is clearly passionate about the topics she teaches and about  helping students maximize what they get out of the course. Overall, the course is pretty demanding and requires significant time investment. Among some of the things that I thought would require some change was definitely the deadline for homework submission. Having the deadline be on Saturday evenings every week was something that I dreaded. I think it would be much more preferred for the deadline to be on a weekday rather than on Saturday, as in that case I personally found myself working on the problem set many times all through Friday evening and Saturday morning\/afternoon, many times missing out on extremely valuable rest time from the weekend. I really liked how mathematical concepts that were required for the course were explained by Professor Steinacker rather than being taken for granted. Having a dropped problem set would definitely be appreciated. Some notes on the last two problem sets: it would be much better for the second to last problem set not to have a due date the Sunday after we had to move out of Yale College housing, as that week was hectic (the due date was eventually changed); the last problem set was excessively long compared to previous ones, and it was due the weekend of reading period. It would have been appreciated if that was not the case for the last problem set of the semester.",
                "The participation problems were good because they forced you to stay on schedule with watching the lectures. One thing I didn't like was how the psets were always much more challenging than the examples in the lectures and they made you feel like you learned nothing. You also wouldn't receive any feedback on them other than how many points you lost.",
                "The teaching team is amazing! There are so many office hours, so help is very easily accessible."

                "The asynchronous lecture structure with no discussion sections was unsuccessful. I think having a regulated discussion section with a knowledgable TF would improve my understanding tenfold, as compared to meeting with a loosely regulated study group. Very early into the semester, my study group stopped meeting and I would find others in the course with whom to work.",
                "The recorded lecture format was nice since you can go back and re-watch parts of the lectures that are confusing. However, the participation questions were sometimes a little stressful to keep up on when they were due day of the lecture especially when I had 4 classes in one day. I think that in the future allowing for a little more leniency in when things are due (maybe make everything due one or two days a week) would help students in these stressful times.",
                "I definitely did not like the completely asynchronous aspect of the class. I wish there was an synchronous option to opt into so that I had the choice of going to lecture. I also feel like a recorded live class would be easier to watch because it would be less dense.",
                "It was beneficial to have videos that can go over lecture time, but it was hard to watch record lectures because I couldnt ask questions right when they arose.",
                "Pre-recorded lectures succeeded as well as the various office hours the teaching team had. There aren't any improvements I can think of :).",
                "Professor Steinacker's demonstrations were helpful and made the class more engaging, however, some of the lectures were long and hard to stay engaged, especially when it is mathematical proof after proof.",
                "Everything was good COVID-wise too, I feel like the remote structure actually made office hours more productive\/accessible.",
                "The video demonstrations were excellent, but there could be times when the class met to discuss ideas, or to review face to face instead of by watching lectures on videos with virtually no professor instruction.",
                "Daily OH and recorded lectures (that could be played x1.5) really helped. The study groups also helped when checking PSETs.",
                "Having videos available for viewing before and after lecture were extremely useful for studying.",
                "I did not enjoy doing the participation questions for the lectures. I felt that they would have been fine if asked in a live lecture, but they added too much work when we were expected to do them at home (and the recorded lectures take longer to get through than a live lecture anyways). I felt that I didn't have the time to pay attention to them during an already stressful semester. I would suggest using a program like Sapling learning to ask multiple choice participation questions that still make sure that we actually watched the lectures. It would be less stressful to get done for us, and easier to grade for you.",
                "The asynchronous lectures actually made it very easy and flexible to take this class whenever I wanted to each day.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures greatly improved my flexibility for dealing with at home learning, and greatly reduced stress because it promoted rewinding if something was not understood. The availability for the office hours also helped.",
                "The pre-recorded lectures definitely helped, as well as the posted notes. The many office hours were amazing, even over zoom. The adaptions to assignments, especially exams, I felt were fair and mitigated the difficulties of the pandemic and differing time zones.",
                "I mostly engaged with Professor Steinacker at her office hours. It allowed for a time to get direct help and clarify lecture content if necessary. We also had study groups to increase participation amongst ourselves.",
                "The recorded lectures were effective because they allowed me to pause and watch at the pace which was best for me. Some discussion sections might aid engagement.",
                "One aspect of the course that I didn't like were the take home exams. I understand that these exams were meant to remove the time pressure from a midterm or final. In the end, however, I spent around 12 hours on each exam, obsessing over my work.",
                "The layout of the course was well suited for pandemic learning. The encouragement to make study groups was very helpful as this allowed us to have some peers to collaborate with on homeworks throughout the semester. Also, participation questions ensured that students were engaged with the lectures and office hours\/study halls served to be valuable discussion spaces for strategies and topics we did not understand.",
                "Having study groups really helped",
                "Prof. Steinacker required us to form a small group at the beginning, which proved super useful for me in doing the PSETs and studying for midterms\/finals",
                "The course was composed entirely of pre-recorded lectures. The professor put a lot of effort and passion into making these, and these lectures were effective at delivering the course material. However, the asynchronous structure of the class also made it somewhat difficult to engage with the class and professor at times.",
                "The recorded lectures were useful since it gave students more flexibility with their schedule. Also, Prof. Steinacker made us turn in participation questions for each class to give us chances to stay engaged and to discuss with our classmates. Although these questions sometimes felt tedious, they really helped me a lot in staying focused and actively listening while watching the lectures, and they prevented me from falling behind. At the beginning of the semester, Prof. Steinacker also made us form groups of about 5 people that we could work together with on homework or participation questions despite not being together in-person, which helped me in staying connected with my classmates and really learning to collaborate. Finally, our 2nd midterm and our final exam both ended up being 24-hour exams to accommodate for the election and for time zone differences, which I thought helped take a lot of unnecessary stress off of students.",
                "The recorded lectures were a success, but the constant study halls and office hours all day everyday caused more stress than help in my opinion.",
                "Getting a smaller group with a tutor helped greatly for the second half of the semester. Demos during the recorded lectures helped so they weren't only teaching from a board.",
                "Although Professor Steinacker was very humble regarding her organizational and video skills, I actually think this class adjusted better to the COVID-19 pandemic than any other class I took.",
                "The recorded lectures were very lengthy, which would not have been an issue had their been a longer time frame to watch them in. However, given how short of a time gap there was between the start of each new week (when lectures were typically posted) and when the participation for the lectures were due this was very difficult.",
                "I think all of the virtual practices went very well. The lectures that Professor Steinacker made for us were fantastic. They were interesting and always clear. I will say, in case it is helpful, that my group decided to meet twice a week, but not to watch the lectures together. By watching them on our own, we were able to set them at the pace we needed, watch when it worked best for us, and to rewatch parts of them, which is one of the few perks of virtual learning. The lectures were so precise that I don't think we had a lot of questions during them, but if we needed help we could always contact each other. During our meetings, we worked on the PSETS together. I think that this worked very well for us.",
                "I think this course was very successful transitioning to virtual learning. Some of the changes, such as doing office hours over zoom, are probably improvements over the in-person setup.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures because they allowed me to pause the video when I was stuck on a concept and go back and watch the lectures when studying for the exams.",
                "Recorded lectures easy to follow, with clear expectations for when participation questions would need to be answered",
                "Having the lectures recorded was great. It allowed me to consume the information at my own pace and look back on when I needed it. Additionally, a lot of office hours for different time zones was good in allowing all students a chance to get help was great.",
                "Recorded lectures were helpful in helping manage work.",
                "The recorded lectures are nice since they allow freedom in when they are viewed, and can be rewatched.",
                "I liked having recorded lectures and the notes were very helpful. The participation work was graded too harshly as students in a live class would not be expected to correctly solve everything, so it didnt make sense that this work required that. I also wish there was a synchronous portion to the class to increase engagement. Finally I wish problem sets were not due on weekends because it would waste a day.",
                "Same as above!",
                "Professor Steinacker translated this course to the virtual format very well. The pre-recorded lectures, study group formation, and many, many office hours were incredibly useful. Having the participation credit was helpful to make sure I didnt procrastinate too much in watching the lectures. The extended window granted for the second midterm and final were also great.",
                "The online office hours were great, and the number one reason I was able to do well in the class. Although some days when it was really busy I often had to wait a long time to get help, compared to my other classes the high frequency of office hours and TA availability was very successful. \r\n\r\nWorking and learning from my classmates was one challenge I faced since I didn't get to make friends in the class. I appreciate the attempt to help us form study groups in the beginning of the semester, but I think the course could be improved if there were check ins with groups to make sure the study groups were actually being used. In my study group, we met a few times on Zoom but none of us felt comfortable asking questions and after a few weeks we found it more productive to go to office hours individually or find people in our residential colleges that we could study with in person. I heard other study groups had similar situations so I worry that it must have been especially hard for remote students to benefit from studying with their peers.\r\n\r\nI also wish we could have an experience with Professor Steinacker where she can lecture as if we were in person, and students would have the opportunity to react in real time to her wonderful demonstrations. I think a situation where the professor demonstrates something, then students react, make jokes, and ask questions makes learning a lot easier as I find it easier to remember the concepts and feel more connected with my peers and professor. I'm not sure there is any way to fix this with remote learning, especially since there are so many students taking PHYS 180 so it would be hard to arrange live lectures on Zoom and even harder for students to feel comfortable having their cameras on and participating.",
                "The recorded lectures were essential for the success of this class. I had to watch and re-watch some lectures.",

                "Study groups were really great. I really relied on my classmates to keep me engaged and understanding the information. The numerous and readily available office hours were also super helpful. The full day midterm and final were also super helpful.",
                "Participation questions really helped with accountability while watching the lectures. I did find that they were more helpful if they appeared i  later lectures, because this would force\r\nme to watch the entire group of lectures.",
                "The recorded lecture is excellent quality, although unfortunately my internet bandwidth is such that I was unable to support streaming it most weeks. The only improvement I would suggest would be to somehow offer the lectures on a private YouTube channel or make them downloadable from Panopto - in some way making them more accessible despite a slower internet connection.\r\n\r\nThe virtual office hours were excellent, and offered at a variety of times to make them accessible to all students which I appreciated very much. I met weekly with my designated small group, and we started a group chat as well, and I found having a cohort within the class very helpful!",
                "see above",
                "The abundant office hours offered were definitely extremely helpful in my experience with the class. The fact that lecture notes were uploaded on canvas was also extremely helpful. I found the practices implemented for the second midterm and the final to be very helpful in a smoother carrying out of the exams. The fact that PCLs were graded normally and were many times additional exercises that needed to be completed outside of the homework was definitely something that made the course feel much more heavy.",
                "The ample resources available for homework and conceptual help, namely Peer tutor\/ ULA office hours , were incredibly helpful.",
                "I liked the asynchronous, pre-recorded lectures.",

It feels like you're just watching Khan Academy videos with homework assignments and exams. The actual coursework isn't arduously difficult, especially if you have decent high school physics preparation (I took AP Physics 1 in high school and found that to be sufficient preparation). Just be prepared to be extremely apathetic about the topic.\r\n\r\nI'm sure the course would be better in non-COVID times, especially since who doesn't love seeing physics demonstrations in real life?

                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who needs a physics credit or anyone who truly loves physics and is ready to dedicate a lot of time toward it. This class is definitely challenging, but Professor Steinacker provides you all the resources you need to succeed, and her office hours are especially helpful. The problem sets are tough, but they prepare you well for the exams, which I found to be pretty fair. Personally, I did not have a super strong physics background from high school, yet I found this course manageable, and I never felt like Prof. Steinacker ever skipped over topics or assumed we should know something. Finally, take this course for Professor Steinacker! She's so passionate about this course and her students, which makes all the work feel totally worth it.",
                "I would not recommend this as an intro physics course for people who did not take AP Physics or high level physics in high school.",
                "I would recommend this course because understanding physics is important for many other problems in engineering and in life.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to any student with even a passing interest in physics.",
                "Yes I would because I feel I learned a lot, however it was very intensive.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course. Professor Steinacker is a brilliant lecturer as well as a caring teacher. You have lots of support through office hours. The grading scheme and assignment expectations are made very clear, which I appreciate. The PSET problems are all interesting. This was my favorite course I have taken so far at Yale.",
                "Yes! I dont know what the other physics for life sciences class is like but this one was wonderful. I hadnt taken AP physics and found the workload very manageable and the psets tough\/long but very doable by going to office hours. I felt the exams were very fair and easy to do well on if you do the psets and Profs review.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student wishing to learn more about physics who has the requisite math background.",
                "Yes, it was a very well-taught course and I would recommend,mend others to take it for the intellectual challenge.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to a student who has no or minimal experience in physics. I think it would be a fantastic introduction, especially with Professor Steinacker. \r\nPersonally, I took AP Physics C, and I took this class instead of 200 due to a scheduling conflict. I learned a few new topics, but for the most part it was review. I'm not sure how the other physics classes compare quality-wise, but I think anyone who's retains a good amount of AP physics probably shouldn't take this level.",
                "Good introductory physics course, single variable calculus required only, exactly as the physics department website describes",
                "Yes. This course is fun and the grading is not harsh at all. You will need to be comfortable with math and be ready to put some serious hours into the PSETS, but overall, this course will not kill you and is worth taking, especially if you have friends that you can study with.",
                "Yes, the course was a good introduction to physics.",
                "I would recommend this course as it introduces the fundamentals of physics.",
                "Yes, especially if you need this for a pre-requisite.",
                "This class is a decent broad overview to physics. It is not very challenging, especially if you have any experience, and it does not go as in depth into challenging components of physics and instead has more complicated math. Its not the worst class, but its also nowhere near the best.",
                "Yes, I was debating between this class and PHYS 170, and I am so glad I took this course! It's not as applicable to bio as 170, but it has given me a solid foundational understanding of physics.",
                "If youre looking to take intro physics, definitely take 180. Professor Steinacker is amazing and really knows how best to teach complicated physics concepts.",
                "Yes I would recommend the course because it's a useful introductory physics course that many might need to take higher level classes\/ to fulfill major requirements. Also the professor is generally pretty nice, but the number one strength is that so many people take the course and there are so many TAs so it's not hard to find support in the class. However I would warn students that it is a difficult and time consuming course.",
                "ABSOLUTELY Professor Steinacker is awesome and the course is so interesting!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this class because I learned the concepts covered very thoroughly. Professor Steinecker is also so nice, considerate, intelligent, and a great teacher.",
                "Yes, the professor is fantastic.",
                "Yes, this is a great intro to physics and Prof. Steinacker is really amazing!",
                "For most, physics is a prerequisite to major classes. And though I have limited knowledge of the pother physics sequences, 180 is fantastic because of Prof. Steinacker. If time is put in, you can learn a lot  but its worth remarking that this course has a very heavy workload.",
                "Yes! If you are torn between this and 170\/171, TAKE 180\/181!! The course is organized better and is better designed to actually teach you physics. I am a bio major, and physics was my worst subject in high school, but Steinacker made me feel like I could actually do physics.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student wanting to really get a thorough grounding in classical physics. You must be able to put in several hours of work on psets every week, and reviewing the material from lecture as you go is vital. Also, be aware that attending office hours, while not mandatory, is pretty much essential if you want to succeed on the homework (and the exams!).",
                "Yes I would. I think the TA's could have done a bit of a better job when providing feedback on graded work but in general I thought the course was well-done.",
                "Chances are that if you are taking this course you have to. This is a very comprehensive introduction to topics in mechanics in physics. Professor Steinacker tries really hard to make this course as conducive of learning as it can be, offering abundant office hours and opportunities for students to have their questions answered. If you are a premed you may be wondering whether to take 180 or 170, and honestly I don't think there is one right answer. This is definitely a class that is much more math-focused and purely physics-oriented. If you want to learn physics purely for physics then this is probably the class you should take. Beware that overall the class requires time and energy and the problem sets are long, so a lot of work is required in advance to the deadlines.",
                "If you want to learn physics this is a good course. Workload is fine  weekly pset. Definitely a harder class though  the psets are challenging and really make you think.",
                "If you need a physics course, this is a hard class but a great one. The teaching team is great! I did not have a strong physics background, so I struggled a bit at first, but I was able to make it through."
