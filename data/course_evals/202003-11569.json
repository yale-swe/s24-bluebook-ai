                "A better eye for reading essays, with the authors intent in mind, and some experience in incorporating emotional response devices in my own writing.",

The class covered a range of creative, nonfiction styles from the personal essay to the humorous essay. This class taught me to be a better reader and writer. I learned how to develop an intriguing hook, to use short sentences for clarity, and how to structure an argument essay, among many other useful skills.",
                "We learned how to make our sentences short and precise so that we dont write frivolously but with intent. With the readings we did, we learned how to analyze and emulate the tools and formulas successful writers used.",

It's the sort of course that would help everyone from an English major to Econ to STEM. I came out of the course with a better sense of exactly why certain strategies work and others don't. I found high school english a little opaque, but this course was straight forward and really effective in making me more confident and effective in my writing. I enjoyed the clear units centered around different forms of creative nonfiction. They forced us to try different styles but gave enough freedom to write about what you care about. I came away both a better writer and reader and realized how intertwined those two can be."

                "Strengths of this course include the broad nature of the essays -- you could really write about whatever you wanted -- and the seminar\/workshop format. Most classes will require reading essays and discussing the style of these essays with the class. The essays picked for reading were always exceptional and written in unique ways. The workshops were also a strength of this class, as students gained specific feedback that would help with final drafts. The essays are also spaced out so that you have a lot of time to work on each piece.",

                "The course was great at breaking down the tools we could use in our writing and giving us prompts with vast interpretation. The pacing of the class was definitely a highlight.",
                "The course readings were really engaging and always felt manageable (readings were usually a couple essays under 10 pages for each class) and always interesting stuff (the sort of thing that's in the New Yorker). The reading was stuff I would have enjoyed reading anyways and made me realize the exciting and interesting styles of writing. The analyzing of the pieces in class was much more big picture and style critique rather than your class english symbolism, extended metaphors, etc. which I found really interesting. The writing itself (4-5 1200 word essays) felt manageable and helped me progress as a writer. Professor Green is kind and insightful and made the course interesting and engaging. No real weaknesses, a really well thought out course and Professor Green was great."

I felt that discussing the readings was very effective through the intimate class size and writing was a great reflection during a strange and difficult semester. Professor Green was always available via email and would do one-on-one meetings for papers. This helped allow for targeted feedback focused on specific areas we need to work on."

It will really help you to improve your writing in a short amount of time and develop story-telling abilities that are transferable across a range of genres. The workshops and feedback from the professor were in-depth and specific, which is an extremely valuable level of attention. Overall, I really loved this class and found the discussions, workshops, and meetings with the professor to be helpful not only for the class but for my writing in general.",

                "Absolutely! I've heard great things about English 120 overall and I think the basic format of the course helps you develop as a writer and learn to read and write more effectively. I thought Professor Green was fantastic at giving clear and concise ways to improve your writing. He helped demystify writing in a way I've rarely found. I think the course is a great choice for students of all backgrounds, interests, and majors\/prospective majors. The course is interesting, challenging enough while still being very manageable and consistent with workload, and will help you in years to come."
