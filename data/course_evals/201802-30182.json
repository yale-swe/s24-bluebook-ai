    "I gained knowledge about a lot of important historical figures and insight into what makes a genius.",
    "This was my first college-level course I've taken, so I definitely learnt a lot as a high school student:\r\n- how to write academic papers to a college-level: improving my argument structure, clarity and logic\r\n- that almost all geniuses share common enablers, albeit 'used' differently\r\n- how to see genius differently (through the romantic lens, nineteenth century, etc)\r\n- most importantly, never to use the term 'genius' carelessly",
    "I learned a lot about various \"geniuses\" that have appeared throughout history. It was also great to learn about the research that is being done on creativity in the neuroscience field because that's the field I intend to pursue."

    "- very engaging discussions \r\n- knowledgable professor \r\n- diverse range of readings \r\n\r\n\r\n- sometimes we would be asked questions that were exactly the same as the ones we answered just previously in the quiz.\r\n- quiz could be less subjective and open-ended",
    "Strengths - Professor Wright's enthusiasm. Good structure and interesting topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - technological difficulties",
    "The quiz questions could be a bit debatable, but otherwise I thought the seminar aspect was good and the homework was adequate\/helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Definitely! Its interdisciplinary nature allows the student to grab ideas and knowledge from the culmination of their educational careers. It also forces us to be open-minded to other's bizarre connections - especially since we learn about associative thinking.",
    "Yes I would. The class exposed me to the habits of geniuses throughout the ages - helped me set potentially new standards for myself!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because I think the subject matter is fascinating and it's a pretty well designed and transparently graded course."
