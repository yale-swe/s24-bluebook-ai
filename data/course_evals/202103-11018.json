It was a challenging class, but by the end of it, I feel like I can confidently say I have a good foundation in French that I am looking forward to building upon. I learned how to conjugate verbs in the present, past and past participle tenses. Additionally, I learned how to speak about very basic topics in french, introducing oneself and talking about one's family, education and general interests. I learned how to talk about the weather, food, the time etc...",
                "I have started learning the French language!",
                "This course was a good introduction to French vocabulary and grammar. It focused a lot on being able to organically state ideas rather than just reading."

                "It is the best course I have ever attended.",
                "I think that the Capretz method of teaching that this course employs made it very easy to get to a decent level of comprehension rather fast. Midway through the class, I felt like I could understand our professor when she spoke French without having to translate back to English first. However, I don't think I can say the same for the effectiveness in regards to helping us speak confidently when we weren't discussing the FiA videos. Whenever I spoke it felt like I was just regurgitating what I had heard and had more of a hard time formulating sentences when asked a question that did not relate to the FiA videos. I think that more personal practice outside of class would have helped with this but in general, I think it would also be helpful to have a mix of both FiA and non FiA related questions that students discuss whenever they are having in-class discussions with their peers.",
                "The weekly tests and workbook exercises are very helpful to my learning, and meeting five days a week is also helpful. The French in Action program feels a little dated. It's strange that we learned how to say a woman has long, thin fingers in Lesson 6, but we didn't learn the days of the week until Lesson 15.",
                "I personally was not a fan of the French in Action method as a complete novice to French. I did not find the videos and workbook were not especially clear at times in regards to basic grammar rules, but I do see how this would be really useful for someone with a prior basis in the language in expanding knowledge of French culture and vocabulary. However, I recognize that depending on learning styles, this could be very helpful to some students. Something I was particularly impressed by is how much material you cover in one semester. I know enough to have basic conversations on a large variety of subjects and I can work my way through understanding a significant portion of written French. The professor is also a definite strength; I found all of the class time to be very helpful and she is very good at explaining new topics while keeping us engaged. Her office hours were also a huge help in preparing for projects and exams."

                "I would recommend this class to anyone that is looking to learn the French language. However, I will say that you will only get the most out of this class if you can commit to the daily work that is required to learn a language. French is one of the more complicated romance languages, so it takes a lot of diligent, daily effort to be able to do well and get the most out of this class. If you are not planning to take more french classes in following semesters, I would not recommend taking this class because you will be stopping at a very rudimentary level of comprehension, writing and speaking that won't carry you very far if you are trying to gain any sort of mastery of the language.",
                "Yes! It gave me a good start to learning French.",
                "I would definitely recommend, with a caveat that you should probably not take this as one of five classes unless at least one of them is a gut simply because the workload eats up a lot of time. If you have time to put in the effort, this is an incredibly rewarding class."
