    "I feel like I have a better grasp of the development and progression of Western political philosophy, and am better at demarcating between authors that are often confused as if they said the same things.",
    "I learned how to think in a much more insightful way by taking this course. I never had been exposed to philosophy in a political context, and I think many of my previous beliefs about politics have changed as a result. This class additionally helped me budget my time, and be able to read texts in a more in-depth way than before.",
    "I learned the basics of the western canon and had a good introduction into the thinkings of the basics of political philosophy",
    "This class was most valuable because of its extremely heavy reading load. As my first reading-based college class, Intro to Political Philosophy took a bit of time to adjust to but was ultimately a highly rewarding experience. I'm grateful that I was able to read the works of some of the most important political philosophers in Western history, as I probably would not have read them otherwise.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. My TF was incredibly helpful in guiding me through the process of writing a philosophy paper, and the material we covered in lecture and in the readings was fascinating.",
    "learned a lot about the books we read, her ppts are helping in clarifying\/explaining the most important concepts",
    "I really developed my critical thinking, reading, and writing skills.",
    "Interesting readings of a lot of classic texts",
    "You read major works on political philosophy throughout history. You learn to read a lot of dense material and be able to not only understand but gain your own interpretations to classical texts.",
    "Ideas regarding who should rule from the western canon.",
    "I learned how to read and interpret\/analyze some of the greatest philosophical works in the Western canon, including work by Hobbes, Rousseau, WEB DuBois, Tocqueville, Machiavelli, Aristotle, and Plato (among others). Comprehensive introductory knowledge of political philosophy; what it means and implications for today; the idea of the \"best regime\"\/ the best form of government; the idea of the \"best ruler\"; how to evaluate and understand different forms of regimes and different types of rule\/rulers; the role of the people in governance; different forms of liberty; and how to write a political philosophy paper, which I think really helped improve my analytical writing and thinking skills!",
    "I gained a basic knowledge of the different thinkers and perspectives of the Western Cannon of Philosophy.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge about the basic timeline of ideas and thought of the most important thinkers of the western canon.",
    "Taught me how to write argumentatively and insightfully instead of being descriptive and narrative. Also taught me how to read difficult texts and serive the key points",
    "Got a great overview of political philosophy from ancient to more modern thinkers. Learned how to compare the philosophers ideas and write a political philosophy paper. Learned how to make a claim about the ideas of a political philosopher and argue for it.",
    "I learned how to think critically of political philosophy texts, and to synthesize different theories to formulate answers to questions of how government should be structured.",
    "I learned a lot of information about Western Canon and about how to write a political science paper.",
    "An in-depth understanding of influential western political thinkers\r\n\r\nLearned to apply the western thoughts on politics today",
    "I learned about different philosophers' ideas on who should rule and a little bit about the different ideologies that come with the different types of rule.",
    "I learned how to create a thesis statement that gives me room for my own argument, instead of merely answering the prompt. I also learned the basic platforms of thought for many philosophers.",
    "I developed an understanding of what political philosophy is, and I gained insight into who the most prominent political philosophers were and what they believed. I improved as a philosopher writer and thinker",
    "I have an overview of western canon",
    "A wonderful course! I learned so much about the political philosophy canon. Always received clear feedback, and lecture was engaging and thoughtful.",
    "I got a great overview of some of the most important parts of the Western Canon of political philosophy.  I also learned how to read for college and write philosophy papers.\r\nPeople we read;\r\n*Aristotle       *Rousseau\r\n*Plato             *The Federalists and Anti-Federalists\r\n*Machiavelli  *Marx\r\n*DuBois         *Arendt",
    "I developed my writing skills specifically in my capacity to analyze philosophical arguments. I also developed a better ability to read lengthy texts with great depth of language, concepts, and format. In general, I feel that I have a much more complex and deepened understanding of philosophy in general as well as a more fundamental understanding of the Western Canon and its development to the modern day.",
    "You learn to understand how political philosophy has advanced over the course of time and how to formulate philosophical arguments in essays.",
    "This course gave me an overview of political philosophy through time. I came in knowing very little about philosophy in general so it was very enlightening.",
    "Good introduction course to political philosophy and philosophy in general. Learned to see the relationship between these two disciplines.",
    "I expanded my knowledge about political philosophy, specifically with regards to ten or so philosophers stretching across the ancient to the modern era. My greatest take away was just that, however. My only real take away was a superficial understanding of the core ideas of these philosophers. This is the case for several reasons. First, the class spends maximum two days on an entire philosopher. Additionally, while this is a philosophy class, students are never really taught what this really means; what it means to think like a philosopher, or how to write like one. When it came time for the two papers, students are given little to no guidance on how to actually write philosophy papers. In fact, as I am writing this review, I only know 15% of my grade, the first paper. More on this later...",
    "The ideas of the leading thinkers in western political philosophy",
    "I learned  a lot about philosophy and about many different philosophers' viewpoints.",
    "general knowledge of political philosophy, the connections between and inspirations for the some influential political texts, and how to write a philosophy paper",
    "I gained a solid understanding of the main ideas and beliefs of important philosophers of the Western canon. I learned how to develop an argumentable thesis and how to base my argument on the internal critiques within a work. I learned about the evolution of the answer to the question \"who should rule,\" as well as how philosophers' answers to the question are reflected in the practice of modern politics.",
    "I learned what democracy at its core means, and the different adaptations of it in different societies\/eras. I gained an insight to different methods of ruling and the detailed explanations that each philosopher had for believing in certain methods. I had a very surface level understanding of many of the concepts covered in the class when I first started and I am very happy to have changed that throughout this course. I had never really understood why anyone would support anything other than democracy as a method of ruling but I was exposed to many interesting counterarguments that were very eye opening. I've always loved learning about politics and learning about it from the philosophical perspective was so interesting.",
    "I was introduced to political philosophy as a broad topic and gained the critical thinking skills necessary to reflect on (in simple terms) the political institutions and conventions that surround me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor is very intelligent and teaches the content well. She is able to provide a short summary for each of the philosophers we have read. \r\n\r\nTF sessions are not very helpful. It seems as if everyone just says whatever they want, but no one really engages with what the previous said, so it is not teaching and not insightful.",
    "The strengths of the course was how it was taught in general, and the material we covered. The weaknesses were that the reading material was a lot to keep up with.",
    "Strengths: class lectures were very informative and helpful in guiding reading\r\nWeaknesses: readings were not well-distributed, so sometimes there would be significantly more reading to do between the Monday and Wednesday lecture than between the Wednesday and Monday lecture",
    "The lectures for Intro to Political Philosophy are very engaging- Helne is a wonderful lecturer, and clearly very intelligent in her understanding of political philosophy as a discipline. The class itself is interesting mainly because of the texts that it engages with, but the reading load can get a bit heavy as well. The final examination was also quite difficult.",
    "The strength of this course was the reading syllabus and the lecture. I thought the authors we chose to cover were outstanding and highly representative of the major movements of political thought, and Professor Landemore's lectures provided additional insights that helped us digest the the readings.",
    "Compared to the entire semester, the final did not reflect what we were encouraged to internalize. The essay prompts were fair, however, reading the quote identifications felt more like a punishment, even for students who actively kept up with readings the entire semester. Especially with only 1-2 sentences for defense, most philosophy offer more space because you can be conceptually accurate without memorizing language of an author. The class itself never indicated that level of examination given it was the first and last test.",
    "Weaknesses: definitely a tight\/heavy reading schedule and didn't cover as much of the books as I would like (but that is an eternal paradox especially in intro classes that will never be resolved).",
    "Strengths: great, engaging teaching by the professor and the teaching fellows. Weaknesses: the reading was very poorly spaced. Sometimes, we would only read 20 pages of a book while we would read 220 of another the next week.",
    "The ta staff and bureaucratic side of the course (returning papers, communication about the course etc.) were extremely disappointing. My TA never responded to emails and papers were regularly given back weeks beyond the date originally given. This was even more damaging considering how few grades there are in the course an the fact that the later assignments are worth so much.",
    "Something that was both a strength and weakness was that Professor Landemore tries to simplify the readings which can be difficult into understandable little bits. It was great if you are looking to get a simple understanding of the texts and gain the bigger picture. However, sometimes it can feel a bit superficial and lackluster. \r\nThe lectures themselves were very engaging and Professor Landemore tries to give multiple perspectives and ways to understand and read the books which was very helpful and pedagogically sound.",
    "The content is interesting, undeniably. However, it captures only a small fraction of political philosophy and skims over many hugely important writers. The scope is too large.",
    "Strengths - all of the readings that were chosen for the course were highly relevant to the history and evolution of political thought, and I found each work to be relevant to the course in its own unique way. For the most part, I really enjoyed every single reading and got a lot out of each one. I also especially liked that the readings covered a spectrum of ideas in political theory, so we were not just fed a single dominant school of thought. Furthermore, I really liked that we (basically) went in chronological order with the readings, because it really showed the evolution of political theory throughout history. Also, lecture was extremely interesting and Professor Landemore did a very good job of highlighting the key points of each work and what was most important for us to understand from each reading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the slides that were used in lecture were a bit too wordy; I often found myself rushing to copy down the content of the slides and missing a lot of what Professor Landemore had to say herself in lecture. (Although the slides are posted on Canvas after each class, so you don't really have to copy the slides in class.) Also, I found that often times Professor Landemore gave a bit too much background information on some of the authors in lecture, which used up time that I thought could have been better spent talking more about the work itself (lecture is only 50 minutes two times a week). Also, Professor Landemore very often referenced thinkers in lecture that (I assume) most of us were not familiar with, and she often did not really explain who those people were or really go over their ideas. I thought this was unnecessary and did not really contribute to lecture since we had no context for who these thinkers were and thus could not connect them to the readings under discussion. Also, I did not think that section was very helpful; it didn't enrich my understanding of course material that much, and our discussions in section were not really discussions with one another; they mainly consisted of people randomly (and often tentatively) raising their hand and contributing their own independent thoughts and ideas one after another. There was not a lot of back and forth between students. Perhaps the biggest weakness of this course, however, is the fact that we were never really taught how to write a political philosophy paper or how to craft a thesis until a few days before the final in optional review sessions. Before the first paper assignment, we were given little to no instruction on how to write like a philosopher, and as a result I really struggled with the first paper and had no idea what I was doing or how to write the paper correctly. I think more time should have been devoted to philosophical writing in section or in lecture, because the writing was a huge part of learning about philosophy in this course.",
    "I think the course provides a good foundation of political philosophy, but I think that it tries to cover to much by assigning to much reading, and that as a result we do not get to dive deep into the content.",
    "Strengths: Great intro course for people who want to learn how to approach philosophical texts.\r\nWeaknesses: Some books are not as interesting as others.",
    "Too much reading, could have had more guiding points and questions to keep in mind while reading to make it more structured",
    "Strengths: the section was fun and the papers allowed you to be highly engaged with the content. The readings were super interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were long and sometimes that deterred me from doing them.",
    "Strengths: The lectures were very helpful in understanding the texts which were sometimes very difficult to read, and the feedback given on essays was really good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The material was overstretched and some of the readings were very superficially discussed.",
    "I think that a strength and a weakness of the course is in the lectures. The lectures are helpful in contextualizing the text but I oftentimes left lectures feeling as though I did not know what the main ideas of the text for that week were, especially since the texts assigned were often very long and not entirely useful until the very end of the course. Still, the lectures were engaging and I thought the course material was thought provoking.",
    "Strengths: the knowledge and perspectives you gain from the course\r\nweakness: the lecture can be unentertaining and the reading workload is quite heavy",
    "The strength of this class was the amount of material covered. The weaknesses include the lack of engaging material and lectures, and lack of guidance when writing papers during class time.",
    "The strengths are it makes it easy for you to think about the texts on your own and think critically yourself. Weaknesses are that it was sometimes disorganized and unclear regarding grades and due dates.",
    "Way too many readings. Not enough feedback was given. Not a lot of Professor student interaction.",
    "This course was very thoughtfully taught, lecture was informative, and section always served to build upon lecture materials. I think we could've read less of Tocqueville and more of Du Bois since I found Tocqueville the least helpful author yet Du Bois the reading amount was a bit lacking. Overall, a great course!",
    "Strengths;\r\n*The wise scope of the course\r\n*The lectures were great and informative\r\n*The TFs were great in discussion\r\n*Lots of review sessions for the final\r\n\r\nWeakness;\r\n*The class was kinda fast, but it covers a lot of content so its understandable\r\n*The lecture format didnt really help",
    "This course is extremely strong in its ability to make students engage with very complicated texts in an inviting and powerful manner. Lectures helped students develop a more varied and critical lens for viewing some of the most celebrated and sometimes venerated texts of the past. Section gave students the chance to relate their own personal views in a comfortable setting, making the texts come to life. The attention to detail and specifically the context each text came from really deepened class discussion.",
    "Strengths are just the amount of work you are exposed to and the appreciation you gain for all the works. Weakness is the amount of works you have to read sometimes can be overwhelming and you may get lost.",
    "Strengths: lectures were highly\r\nengaging and very interesting material \r\nWeaknesses: little instruction given on how to write a philosophy paper",
    "Strengths were lectures. Weaknesses were the amount of reading on weeks were papers were due (you just don't do them and get left behind).",
    "Oh boy. I am going to start by saying the course content is fine. At its core, it's a weekly grind of reading of racing to finish and synthesize hundreds of pages of Hobbes, going to lecture and discussing the broad ideas, and then rinse and repeating the cycle with Rousseau the next week. I'd argue there are some problems inherent with this structure, such as not actually being taught how to philosophize or properly write philosophy papers, or trading deep understanding of a few philosophers to a very general understanding of 10-15 authors and thousands of pages of text. As an Intro class, I suppose it can get away with this, but it definitely is not very intellectually stimulating. \r\n\r\nNow onto the biggest weaknesses of the course: section and structure. If you enjoy the weekly grind of having two days to read hundreds of pages of dense philosophy reading, staring at a powerpoint about the content in lecture, and sitting in a section that is essentially a glorified Q&A session, than sure, maybe this class is for you. But there are a plethora of issues with the way this class was run that deeply disillusioned me with the course. First, is grading and timeliness. As I am writing this, I only know 15% of my grade. That's the one paper that I actually received back. This was after a two week delay of the original promised return deadline. Myself nor other students in my section ever received our second paper back, 20% of our grade. This is after originally being promised to have the papers returned before the final exam. Keep in mind this paper was due in November after Thanksgiving. Here are some choice quotes from the email sent out by my TA: \"Hello, all Im traveling and having some internet problems. The papers are all graded, compared to other sections etc, and will get out tonight, but it may be a little late.\" (December 13). I am writing this course evaluation on January 3. I have yet to receive the grade\/feedback for this paper and sincerely doubt I ever will. Additionally, I will expand on this in my TA feedback section, but even after sending multiple emails to my TA, not only have I never received this paper, but was never responded to. In fact, it appears as though the magnitude of this is great. Multiple students report never receiving responses to their emails to our TA. This unresponsiveness combined with the complete lack of professionalism demonstrated by the TA team has clearly resulted in an administrative disaster for this course. This is especially problematic seeing as this is an intro course, the majority of students are first-years. Having this unprofessional and logistically abhorrent course as their \"Welcome to Yale!\" set of first semester first year courses really left a bad taste in myself and many people's mouths. \r\n\r\nBut I am not all criticism, I do have suggestions. First, would obviously be to improve time management and make efforts to actually meet deadlines. When students are held to strict paper turn in deadlines, TAs should as well in regards to returning them to students on promised dates. The excuses put out by my TA were equivalent to \"my dog ate my homework\". If you know you're traveling, then you should know theres a chance you'll be without internet coverage. But even if you did not know that, the promised paper return date \"policy\" of two weeks after submission, should have prevented this from ever being a problem in the first place. This is woefully unfair to students. It's unacceptable to be walking into a final exam when you only know 15% of your grade. This never should have happened.",
    "The lectures were helpful, but the class moved quickly with readings and it was difficult to fully familiarize yourself with a text",
    "This course moved very fast which made it hard to fully understand each reading. It did cover a lot, however.",
    "It was a good introduction to political philosophy and gave a broad overview for a variety of thinkers, but the class moved very fast, it was a bit difficult to get in depth on any one author, and it was difficult to learn how to write for the class.",
    "Strengths: professor landemore makes old texts new and relevant with interesting mg lectures, minimal writing (even WR credit is only two 10 of papers) \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes long reading, hard final",
    "The assigned excerpts were well-integrated and well-explained in lecture. Professor Landemore is a great lecturer; I felt that I gained a better understanding of philosophers' main ideas from lecture, as well as insight into some of the drawbacks of philosophers' claims. \r\n\r\nOne way the course could improve is if TFs dedicated some time during section to explain the essay prompts. Perhaps Professor Landemore can explain briefly during a lecture how to develop a thesis (sometime early on in the semester, before the first essay is due). I also believe that too much weight was placed on the final; many students, including myself, were still unsure of our ability to formulate theses by the time of finals; having to prepare 16 theses in one week was overwhelming.",
    "The texts we read for this class were perfectly chosen for us to see the progression of political thought over centuries, as well as to familiarize us with a range of different methods of ruling. The professor's lectures were well structured. They cleared up many questions I had throughout reading as well as introducing new ways of thinking that I had not considered. Since the texts were loaded with information, the lectures were too, and as a result fast paced. I would suggest uploading the slides the day that they are presented, so I could go back and fill in the missing information in my notes. I know the professor does upload the slides but sometimes they come a few days after, when I've already attended my discussion section. Overall, though, I think the course was well structured with the lectures complemented by discussion.",
    "The course is heavy on reading, but it was fairly interesting. Perhaps less Plato and Aristotle could allow for more time on later philosophers (though I thought the balance was actually pretty good)."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only for a student who is interested in majoring in either philosophy or political science. The course moves very fast, and otherwise does not seem very teaching.",
    "Yes I would because I enjoyed it immensely. I especially enjoyed how it was split up between a lecture and a section.",
    "If you are interested in the basics political philosophy and like to read it is a very good course for that.",
    "Not necessarily. it provided a very basic overview of western political philosophy. Lecture helped to clairy readings, however, I don't feel as though I truly learned that much.",
    "I would recognize this course to a student seeking an overview of the discipline of political philosophy as a whole. Although it is challenging at times, it is ultimately a rewarding experience that forces discussion and re-analysis of the political theories that we view as inherent to Democracy.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in an overview of western political philosophy. If you keep up with the demanding workload, it will be incredibly rewarding.",
    "As someone who has never done political philosophy before, definitely struggled in this class with understanding the concepts, formulating arguments, and writing the papers (which was a rough journey, let me tell you - you will definitely get lower grades than you expect). But overall I learned a lot, and became a better writer. Just wish my grade didn't have to suffer :((",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. However, I would caution them against taking the course as a writing credit.",
    "I would not. The interpretations of the texts are interesting and its worth having read the syllabus, but the staff was extremely hard to work with.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it over intro ethics, that's for sure. I felt like it could be a lot better.",
    "If you are interested in political science or philosophy, then yes! This course is a great introduction to political philosophy, and as someone who had no background knowledge in either of these topics going into this class, I really feel like I learned so much! This course gives you the opportunity to read some of the most important works in the Western canon, which I think are beneficial for anyone to read regardless of major, because it helps you understand why our governments and rulers function the way they do, and it really gets you thinking about democracy in America and whether or not it truly is the best form of government after all, which pushes you to think about ways that we can continually fix and improve our system of governance here in America.",
    "I would recommend this course because you will be able to engage in political thought dialogues with a much better understanding of different viewpoints.",
    "Yes. If you are looking for a good foundational class for political science and\/or philosophy, this class is great.",
    "Yes if they were already very interested in politics\/philosophy.",
    "Yes! If you enjoy thinking about political theory abstractly you should take this course. Also if you are interested in understanding the history of political thought and its development from the ancients this course is very helpful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone interested in political science. It gives a solid basis on how to think about the ways governments are structured.",
    "Yes if the student is pursuing Politics related majors",
    "I would not recommend this course. Unless you want to read the books that are on the syllabus and you are sure you have enough time to dedicate to the heavy reading workload, then this course is not for you. However, if you can manage that, then this class has a lot to offer to you.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, not because it was particularly engaging, but because the material is integral for political thought.",
    "Yes because it is intellectually challenging and allows you to really think about what youre learning.",
    "No",
    "Yes! A great foundation to political philosophy.",
    "Yes!  This course is great for anyone who wants to major in philosophy or poli sci because it gives a really solid foundation for modern-day politics and political thought.  Its also good for those who want to read the great texts of Western Political Thought but never had the time\/an excuse to do so before.  Its also great for those who want to learn how to handle a heavy reading load.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students but I would temper my strong recommendation by informing my fellow student that this class involves a lot of reading and a lot of commitment to attempting to answer trillion-dollar questions. I think this course really develops one's sense of how philosophy and politics go hand-in-hand and how we can see their effects in everything and everyone we interact with everyday. Definitely take this course if you have any interesting in changing government at the most foundational constitutional level.",
    "Yes, its a really nice course to get introduced to political theory and while it is a lot of reading, you do gain an appreciation for the text and can apply the apply it to other aspects of thinking. It is a lot of reading though and that takes time.",
    "Yes, great introduction to much larger concepts",
    "I would if they're interested in learning the foundations of political philosophy. Otherwise, no.",
    "At the end of the day, I would only recommend this course to another student if the logistical and administrative side was overhauled. As it was run this semester, the course is a logistical failure. I am not going to repeat what I wrote in the weakness section, but my reasoning for this is there. \r\n\r\nBut even if the logistical side of the course was fixed, by TAs returning papers on time and being responsive over email, I would still think twice about taking this course. I did not find the structure very conducive to learning. It tries to pack way too much content into a single semester and sacrifices the opportunity to explore philosophers in depth. Plus, it is way too much reading per night, in my opinion, especially when 90% of what students read is never touched on in section, the papers, or the final exam.",
    "Yes but only if you are interested in western political philosophy",
    "Yes, if you are interested in philosophy.",
    "as a requirement, its a good course or if youre just interested in the history of political thought, but it otherwise might be somewhat boring",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it fosters deep reflection about the history behind modern politics, human behavior, and our conception of political knowledge.",
    "I would! I genuinely enjoyed every lecture and assigned reading. The professor also makes the class enjoyable through her added humor here and there.",
    "While I would ultimately recommend this course, students should be aware that there is a great deal of reading and variety in the styles and attentiveness of the TAs when it comes to grading and feedback."
