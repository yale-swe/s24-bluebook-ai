Weekly quizzes ensure you're on top of all the material and not falling behind.  Weaknesses: lectures were very hard to follow sometimes and sometimes it felt like you were teaching yourself the material.",

Sometimes the concepts felt weirdly out of place and the lectures were a little confusing.",

Though we don't cover Lagrange multipliers until the very end it is a good enough course for the math requirement in the major without going too deep into multivariable calc.  I will also say if you took multi or linear algebra in hs, this class might also be a gut for you because you will be ahead of the material.  The professor really wants you to learn and cares deeply about his students although you do teach yourself a lot.  There is a peer tutor who I've heard is extremely helpful.  Truly, only take this class if you're an econ major.",

I think this class gives you the important concepts to understand for the future without having to take math 120 or math 222. However, if you are taking this class out of interest or to continue with math I would recommend the 120 and 222 route more.",
                "Yes, take it if you're unsure in your math skills before intermediate Econ courses.",
