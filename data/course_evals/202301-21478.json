                "There is no formal organization of the course beyond a textbook, but we only take practice problems from the textbook. This makes it difficult to catch up and truly understand the material if you cannot make it to a class.",
                "Strengths: You learn basic linear algebra and multivariable calc skills which can be useful if you're considering a pure econ major. Professor really wants you to succeed.  Weekly quizzes ensure you're on top of all the material and not falling behind.  Weaknesses: lectures were very hard to follow sometimes and sometimes it felt like you were teaching yourself the material.",

I liked Professor Rosenthal because he was available to meet a lot outside of class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The class could have been better organized. Sometimes the concepts felt weirdly out of place and the lectures were a little confusing.",

Though we don't cover Lagrange multipliers until the very end it is a good enough course for the math requirement in the major without going too deep into multivariable calc.  I will also say if you took multi or linear algebra in hs, this class might also be a gut for you because you will be ahead of the material.  The professor really wants you to learn and cares deeply about his students although you do teach yourself a lot.  There is a peer tutor who I've heard is extremely helpful.  Truly, only take this class if you're an econ major.",
                "Yes. Good way to do the math requirement for econ major. Not a particularly hard class at all.",
                "Sure if you are on econ track",
                "I would recommend this class if you need it to fulfill a math requirement as an econ person. I think this class gives you the important concepts to understand for the future without having to take math 120 or math 222. However, if you are taking this class out of interest or to continue with math I would recommend the 120 and 222 route more.",
                "Yes, take it if you're unsure in your math skills before intermediate Econ courses.",
                "No, unless they need a math credit and are a Econ major",
                "If you need the math prereq",
                "No, the professor is so bad at lecturing\/teaching. Otherwise the content is good; the course is condensed well for its purpose. Maybe just take it with another professor."
