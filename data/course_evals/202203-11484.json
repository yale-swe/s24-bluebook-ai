                "I learned about the soft skills required in social entrepreneurship and developed an understanding of how to think about ventures.",
                "Learned a lot about what social entrepreneurship looks like with real-world examples and what it takes to create one. It was a great introduction to the key ideas to pursue any type of entrepreneurship. Each week was clearly revolving around a theme and the importance of why we were going over it was depicted clearly and compellingly.",
                "I think my favorite part of this course was the perspective that I heard from other students in the course. I learned to be much more thoughtful about all the topics we covered and even topics way outside of the syllabus."

                "I thought the strength of the course was the discussion based nature and Professor Lee is amazing! I do wish I had come away with a slightly better understanding of hard skills required in social entrepreneurship. I loved the class though! I looked forward to coming every time even though it was a 3:30 PM seminar on a thursday.",
                "Strengths: A lot of participation and involvement but always on your terms. You end up with a class that likes to talk and ask questions about the prompt ideas given to us. Naturally then, everyone ends up talking casually. The environment is also very un-judgy and much of the participation is your own opinion, so there is no right or wrong. The workload was very reasonable and appreciated. \r\nWeaknesses: There are some things I had wished we covered more of but the prof always asks for feedback so I am sure that each time he teaches this class it will improve.",
                "Strengths: community. content. \r\nWeaknesses: slow, not very organized. \r\nImproved: this course could be improved with more focused teachings and applications."

I learned skills that I'll use in the future, not only at Yale, but in my professional life, and it allowed me to think about certain topics in new ways.",
                "I would 100% recommend this course! Professor Lee is great and overall it is just a fun course to be in! I got to know people in the class really well and the speakers were super engaging!",
                "Yes! This was an amazing college seminar and I always looked forward to it even though it was so long. Brian is a great person and teacher. He has a lot of interesting stories and experiences that are nice to learn from. The class is very intentional, helps you think more deeply, and teaches skills you can use outside of class. Outside work is quite minimal, especially in the beginning. Final and midterm were all take-home which made it much less stressful.",
                "Yes, this class was super interesting!",
                "Yes! It's a great break from other classes because it is not a typical Yale course. Plus, the professor is amazing and really crafts a community feeling within the classroom."
