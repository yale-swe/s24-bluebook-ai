                "I found it a bit frustrating how often there were overlaps of having multiple assignments due in the same week, and even one case where two assignments were due on the same day right before fall recess (although I recognize in a rigorous class this may be unavoidable). I was also split on how I felt about all assignments being due at midnight with a 3-hour grace period. On one hand I was glad for the leniency, but on the other I feel it strongly encouraged me and other students to stay up until 3am to squeeze in work. I know it's the student's own fault for pushing things to the last minute, but I couldn't help thinking there could be a healthier way to incentivize turning in assignments on time. One better solution may be to give a few late days that could be expended during the semester, rather than a universal grace period that leads to people frequently staying up until 3am. This way, students would feel a strong incentive to finish their work at a reasonable hour (as only a limited number of late allowances would be available), and if they needed to spend some of their overtime allowance then they could make that choice and then have normal daylight hours to do their work instead of invariably destabilizing their sleep schedule. Just a thought! Overall, I do appreciate the clear intention goal of giving students flexibility.",
                "Strength: nice professor. Weakness: professor got mad at students for leaving lecture halfway. That is a reflection of the class not the students in it.",
                "More challenging\/advanced homeworks could be helpful! However given workload constraints if the homework difficulty surpasses a threshold then perhaps shifting to biweekly would suffice. I found the homeworks to be more rote\/able to be done by just following the example problems, which was helpful but didn't require much thought beyond understanding how the example problem answers were achieved. (I think there is more to be gained when you need to figure it out yourself first). In general I learned more from the homeworks before example problems were issued (e.g. HW1).",
                "Although it was nice having no exam, I feel like the exam was replaced by the daily quizzes which meant required attendance. However, the grading was fair. The weekly homeworks made sure the concepts taught were really solidified.",
                "Strengths - the Teszca cares and wants to make the course engaging.\r\n\r\nOpportunities - were not allowed to collaborate on psets and discouraged from discussing the topic with other students during office hours. This discouraged OH participation.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fitzgerald's lectures were very engaging. The homeworks and projects were generally well-curated.  \r\nWeaknesses: The TAs generally were not particularly helpful. The daily quizzes also were a real chore as the semester dragged on.",
                "Strengths: the instructor showed up on time\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were several glaring weaknesses of the course, which I will enumerate below.\r\n\r\nFirst, the homework felt a lot like busywork, and often involved tedious computation that did not help with any actual learning. Examples: Q-learning, value iteration, backprop, hidden Markov chains, etc. Instead of having the students run through the calculations by hand, it would've been better and more informative to have them code it up. \r\n\r\nSecond, the grading for \"show your work\" was very arbitrary. In class, when students asked about how much work they were supposed to show, the only answer given was an unhelpful \"show as much work as you needed to arrive at the answer\", which didn't answer the question informatively. \r\n\r\nThird, the material taught in the course is not useful\/relevant to modern approaches to AI. Instead, many of the approaches, like perceptrons, A* search, and feature selection, were already quite old and outdated.\r\n\r\nWays to improve: it might be better to bring in a different professor to rework the course.",
                "Strengths: though tedious sometimes, the weekly homework helps to enhance my knowledge! \r\nWeaknesses: the weekly quizzes. The quiz questions are phrased in a very ambiguous way, and the percentage of each quiz is a bit high. Nonetheless, I still prefer quizzes to 2 midterms. Maybe the instructor could put in more efforts in designing her own programming assignments than just taking those from UCB.",
                "Weakness: Most material is identical to Berkeley's course, not much new information of recent AI knowledge",
                "Grading scheme is very straightforward and lots of cool opportunities to apply AI. Class can get boring at times, and it feels like there is no cohesiveness of ideas between lectures sometimes.",
                "Professor Fitzgerald is a literal genius (seriously, look her up) and has a pretty idiosyncratic way of teaching that forces you to pay attention and come to lecture. I appreciated this. You basically have to keep up with what she's saying to understand what's going on. The Ed Discussion AI readings were pretty cool too, and I read some cool articles.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness for me with the lecture is that Professor Fitzgerald would painstakingly work through the math in real time on the board, and sometimes trip over herself because the theory was so dry and monotonous. This was incredibly confusing at times, and kind of boring. To her credit, Professor Fitzgerald did a lot to increase engagement in the lecture, but I believe there must be a better alternative to literally scribbling out a bunch of math in real time. Maybe having it written beforehand such that she only has to click buttons to \"reveal\" the next step of the equation (instead of literally writing it out) would make things a lot clearer.",
                "The lectures are too example-based. The course is very broad and doesnt provide much insight into each topic. You wont learn anything about the recent advances in LLMs, for example. The problem sets (borrowed from Berkeley) were interesting but short.",

                "Absolutely not. Not only is the course material not relevant to modern AI approaches, but the work is also tedious busywork that does not teach the students much. Furthermore, the instructor makes mistakes at such a high frequency that it becomes detrimental to learning. For instance, during the quizzes, she often realizes that she has made a mistake in the wording of a question AFTER she has collected the quizzes from everyone. Furthermore, there are often mistakes in the example homework questions as well. A quick search on Ed for \"mistake\" reveals many, such as homework 11 question 1a, homework 3 question 3, and homework 5 question 4, among others.",
