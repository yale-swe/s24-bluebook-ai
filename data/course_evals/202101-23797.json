I really like our projects, and the reading we did (although some days there was a lot assigned) was very interesting. This course could be improved by not having so many days with insane reading due just two days later (maybe some of it can be required, while some is extended?). Professor Bazell is awesome and I really loved his style of teaching! He's really smart and has a lot of cool experience. I also loved that we could take the course in many different directions and really pick what interests us in epidemiology to study. For our final project paper, we could write about whatever we wanted, so long as it related to the class in some way.",
