                "It's not a time-consuming course, but the homeworks don't really prepare you for the projects. They're really easy and do teach how to implement a network if you do them in extreme detail, but they're so easy that you don't really struggle or retain anything afterwards. The research presentation could be better, some of it (the written report) felt like busy-work. The final project is really cool since you finish it with a paper that could potentially be ready for publishing. Professor Panda is also organized and cares about her students.",
                "I felt like too much of the course emphasizes on the final project. I actually really appreciated the problem sets and the reading assignments, and felt like they helped me learn and showcase my understanding a lot more than the final project."

                "Hmm probably not, unless you just want an excuse to do a project. If you're really interested in machine learning, there are other classes which will teach you more in-depth. If you have no machine learning experience and want to do a project, the final is good for that. However, you probably won't get too much out of the homeworks or some lectures. I think this class has potential to fill the more practical, non-math oriented machine learning niche at Yale, but it needs to commit to doing that and doing it well. It is nice to come out of the class fluent in the language of neural nets. Tbh I was (and kind of still am) skeptical of neural networks / machine learning, but this class convinced me there is value to the technique, both in application and in giving us insight.",
