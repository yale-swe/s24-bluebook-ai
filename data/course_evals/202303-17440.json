The guest visits from other professors and alumni were also really helpful in providing examples for us to get a broader sense of what a research project could look like. I do think, though, that there could be a bit more structure/specificity to equip students with more of the logistical knowledge we need for embarking on these projects, or maybe even more preparation for the thesis before this course (such as in ER&M 300) so that we can be more prepared earlier on in the senior fall semester.",
