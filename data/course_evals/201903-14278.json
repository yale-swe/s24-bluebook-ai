    "This course gives you an opportunity to examine various issues regarding conservation through a lens of Africa. Topics covered included trophy hunting, CBNRMs, human wildlife conflict (emphasis on lions and elephants), as well as a variety of other interesting topics.",
    "This class was super super informative about the dynamics of conservation in Africa. I think that the course really emphasized how conservation efforts are being made in the communities that matter. I learned so much about the modern techniques of conservation, the historical contexts of conservation in Africa, and the outlook moving forward. I heard about practices that I had never known before. I think one of the important things that I learned is a lot more needs to be understood in order to preserve African wildlife.",
    "I learned a lot about Human-Wildlife issues in Africa and the depth of these conflicts regarding colonialism, conservation, and other major issues!",
    "I learned a lot about conservation issues in different contexts across Africa (the history of Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) in Tanzania, Namibia, etc; political ecology; debates surrounding trophy hunting; etc).",
    "This course provides a very interesting perspective on the Human Wildlife Conflict in Africa. It definitely makes you evaluate issues from multiple angles.",
    "Learned a lot about conservation through a lens I have never looked through before. Mostly southern african CBNRM but in the context of global conservation a very important narrative to understand wholly. A great class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course did a great job of talking about the whole subject of conservation. I really thought that how the course started, talking about conservation and colonialism, was a great setup for the rest of the semester. I went in expecting to be \"taught\" more, but I ended up enjoying the way the course was open-ended and discussion based. I think the class was full of strengths, particularly showing the pros and cons of conservation efforts. One weakness I thought was that once I finished the two paper assignments from the readings, I got a little less involved in the class. Having assignments that incentivize reading and staying engaged may help, but I also liked that the papers were done at the student's own pace, because it gave flexibility and reduced the stress of the class.",
    "Strengths: Lots of general knowledge about HW conflict\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: HEAVY (basically impossible) reading load (literally most of the people in the class skimmed it), and it can be really hard to add value to discussions, papers and research paper are killer",
    "Strengths: Organized and straightforward, Professor Nattrass is kind.",
    "The course material was very interesting, but sometimes class wasnt super engaging. If you do the readings, class is much more enjoyable. If not, it can be hard to follow along.",
    "Bringing a guest speaker that talks about the biodiversity in southern Africa could bring an element of seriousness to the subject."

    "Absolutely! This was probably my favorite class that I've taken so far at Yale. The readings were very interesting and Professor Nattrass is wonderful.",
    "Yes! you must be prepared to do the readings to be able to engage productively in class though - its hard to understand some of these topics without the reading because they are very niche",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It covers a wide variety of subjects that make it interesting to people across a variety of majors. While it seems like an ecology course, it also really focuses on social justice and equality. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. It's just very informative about the current situation, and I think it explains broader trends in conservation and human-wildlife conflict. Would highly recommend!",
    "Although I learned a lot, probably not! It's an intimidating environment and the readings are impossible (convoluted and 100+ pages of reading a week)",
    "Sure, if you're interested in human-wildlife conflict in Africa.",
    "I would recommend this class because the material is incredibly interesting and the workload is very manageable. Professor Nattrass is also very knowledgeable and easy going."
