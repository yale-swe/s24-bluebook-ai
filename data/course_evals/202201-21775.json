            "comments": [
                "I did not feel that I learned very much at all from this course. Most of the lectures heavily overlapped, which meant that routine attendance began to feel monotonous, as we would spend weeks covering what felt like effectively the same core ideas over and over again.",
                "Strengths: Only 4 psets, midterm, final\r\nWeaknesses: Reading Response (short summaries) due before every class",
                "Strengths: Super chill class that is enjoyable and relaxing to watch\r\nImprovements: Professor had some last minute absences and was unable to attend some lectures.",
                "Choose either to attend lectures or do the readings.",
                "Strengths: Slides cover all the material you need to know. No need to worry about a textbook or panicking to get others' notes if you miss a class. Course content is pretty straightforward, as are problem sets.\r\nWeaknesses: While the material is interesting to learn, most of the models are far too simple to be applied to real-life situations (ie Downs-Hotelling Model) and the level of intellectual challenge is low. So if you are looking for a gut class, welcome. If not, this isn't for you.",
                "The content of this course is incredibly interesting and Prof. Svolik is very smart but the problem is he doesn't really care about teaching. The course was a disorganized mess with no syllabus, lectures cancelled on a regular basis, redundant lectures (literally copy/pasted slides), sections were a shitshow. Could be a great course if only the professor cared (although he recently won a Guggenheim fellowship so seems like prioritizing his research is working out lol).",
                "Strength: Work-load was very fair, material was workable, exams were straight forward. \r\nWeaknesses: hard to study material from power points, as limited notes.",
                "The class was well taught but I wish there was a little more communication with responding to emails.",
                "I loved this course! I learned so much and really enjoyed it because the workload was never unnecessarily heavy.",
                "Strengths: Manageable workload, great TAs, great professor, manageable exams\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the pace could be rather slow but that is also sometimes the nature of the material and I actually appreciated that Svolik took his time and made sure we understood everything thouroughly.",
                "Psets files should be posted as files on canvas",
                "Great instruction, good material.",
                "Definitely a more tougher course than anticipated. However, very organized and structured course. The main thing that was a bit off putting was the fact that lectures were very technical and math heavy, but the exams to a large extent and the psets to a lesser extent were more general and conceptual.",
                "class should be recorded",
                "i think this course was taught very efficiently where the professor ensured every concept was explaining throughly and completely before moving to the next concept",
                "The main strength of this course is that it is not difficult. Because the material is not particularly hard and neither are the assessments, I felt like I was able to absorb more of the material without the added pressure of grades.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course was easily the variability in discussion sections. Other sections are not mandatory, while mine was and others were even more intense. I felt like this was not completely fair or consistent.",
                "A strength relates to the application of the strategies covered in the course unto real-world examples. Treating historical events as competitive games allowed me to better understand the nature and relevancy of these various games. Another course strength pertains to the way in which discussion sections acted as a respectful environment in which students could share their opinions on course topics. The only weakness which comes to mind refers to the inconsistency between online/in-person lectures throughout the semester; however, I realize that this was an unconventional semester and believe that Prof. Svolik and the TFs did an excellent job of compensating for such unconventionality.",
                "Good content, pset, and lectures/sections. No weaknesses.",
                "Strengths are simple material, weaknesses are incredibly disorganized.",
                "The course was really interesting but I can say I did not gain much from lecture and ended up in confusion most of the time.",
                "This course was great! The lecture slides were not too comprehensive alone, but Milan was a great professor.",
                "Nothing",
                "Somewhat disorganized; teacher is brilliant but could post last-minute updates on class cancellation/rescheduling. Strengths are accessibility to the average student, low workload that focuses on readings and proffering interesting examples of game theory models in action.",
                "The course could be better organized with denser/more frequent engagement (more psets, more projects/papers).",
                "Lectures taught material well. Reading were not always relevant",
                "After taking this class, it's my opinion this course was of the lowest quality of any class I have taken at Yale. As a student that contracted and was symptomatic with covid, the organization and structure of the course made me and many other quarantined students confused and feeling left-behind. Lectures were posted late, contained little information, and were not very helpful in understanding key topics on exams.",
                "Strengths - The material is incredibly interesting game theory is an interesting class in of itself, and the class is structured in way that makes the game theory applicable to politics. The multiple choice midterm and final also cement that it is a fairly gutty class.\r\nWeaknesses - lectures can sometimes be a bit of a snooze, even though Professor Svolik is incredibly passionate about the material. At the end of the day, it just doesn't feel like you're learning anything substantive.",
                "I thought it was a great course as is. The lectures and psets were very well done and professor Svolik",
                "I thought the course was very approachable for those who had never done game theory before.  However I felt that the lectures and readings could have been more directly relevant to the skills and logic the exams were testing.",
                "I thought that sections were extremely boring and not helpful in covering what was on problem sets and exams.",
                "It is perfect!",
                "Strength: The material was presented in a very digestible way; assessments seemed fair\r\nWeaknesses: The customs of TAs varied a lot--some cared way more than others."

The titular \"strategic models\" are very simple, and any other economics class which mentions game theory in passing will effectively teach the most difficult concepts to you. The lectures were slow, and for the most part unnecessary for completing the 4 psets.",

                "Yes yes yes!! One of my best decisions at Yale. You really do get a good grounding in an interesting subject without it taking over your life. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed game theory. The class is very manageable to the point that you can learn and enjoy.",

                "YES! If you are an EPE major, this class is the perfect way to fulfill the game theory requirement. IT IS VERY EASY. There isn't much content, although the content that we did cover was interesting and seemed relevant.",
                "I would recommend this course to any Yale student whom wishes to better understand the outcomes associated with political and economic dilemmas in the modern geopolitical context. It is my belief that the course emphasis on the importance of incentive structures could be helpful to students seeking to engage in policy-driven work, as the course clearly reflects the notion that a change in incentives may lead to direct changes in the outcome associated with a given situation.",

                "Yes if you want a chill low workload class",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes. It's a solid introductory course and deals with a lot of interesting examples of bargaining, electoral systems, and other political models that other game theory courses at Yale don't talk about. On the flip-side, do know that you will walk away with less of an understanding of how to do game theoretic math than in other courses.",
                "Yes, good way to fulfill game theory requirement for EPE",
                "No.",
                "I think this is a very appropriate class for a student who is looking for an intellectually interesting fifth class to take, especially if their academic interests align somewhat with the class. The psets are reasonable, the midterm/final are fair, and lectures are interesting. The class is fairly slow moving though; I appreciate Professor Svolik's kind intentions of making sure all students are following the material and are caught up with the lectures, but they can sometimes feel repetitive. The result is sometimes not feeling entirely intellectually challenged, but still intellectually satisfied.",

A lot of people say it's an easy 5th class, which is true, but because the material was easy to understand, I feel like I learned a lot of valuable information that is easily applicable to my political career. I enjoyed the real-world examples used in class, and I enjoyed my section with Paul a lot."
