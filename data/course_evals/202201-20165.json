                "Learned about how people learn, both in the readings and by experiencing different learning exercises. Learned how to build terms worth of lessons plans using backwards design. Learned about IEPS and ways to support a neurodiverse classroom. Learned about the importance of culturally reverent course material.",
                "I learned a lot about effective teaching principles through watching and doing in this class. Not only did we engage with artifacts about these principles but we also watched Prof. Scheves, our teaching partners, and our peers teaching throughout the semester and were able to teach two lessons ourselves.",
                "A lot of practical techniques and strategies for classroom teaching, and also got to talk to a real high school teacher in Missouri to ask him about questions I have going into the field of teaching.",
                "This course and Professor Scheve have introduced me to so many skills that will be applicable to me as an aspiring classroom teacher. Of course you will read and discuss how to teach differently across academic disciplines, how to grade and assess students, etc. etc. but you will also get to practice teaching to your peers, receive feedback on your lesson plans and build a relationship with a teacher in the field who will share their life experience with you. Students who are interested in anti-racist education will especially benefit from applying theory to practice.",
                "This course mostly focuses on teaching us to think critically and be purposeful about our own teaching practices, as well as others'. Embedded into this framework are several popular principles of effective teaching, ranging from grading practices to classroom management.",
                "I learned the basic principles of effective classroom teaching in relation to planning, managing a classroom, supporting all students, and assessing in equitable and encouraging ways. I also learned again how amazing the Ed studies communities is here at yale. I learned that teaching is something you do with partners and teams.",
                "I learned about best practice techniques for classroom planning, instruction, and grading. The curriculum included brief overviews of anti-racist pedagogy and inclusive teaching practices for LGBTQ students, disabled students, and multilingual students. Teaching segments helped me develop my teaching style and practice lesson planning.",
                "This course introduced us to the complexities of and current discourse surrounding k-12 teaching.",
                "I learned so many foundational teaching concepts from mastery grading to asset-based learning to scaffolding. I now know how to teach a class in a more engaging and equitable way. I also got to put what Ive learned into practice by creating my own teaching segments in class.",
                "I learned a lot from this class. The structure of each class session is designed to show you different kinds of activities or structured discussions you can have in a classroom, for example, different kinds of group work or 'stations' to move around to. So even while you're learning about teaching at an abstract level, you're also learning about things you can do in the classroom! I also learned a lot through the teaching segments, where you get the opportunity to design and teach a mini 25 minute lesson twice in the semester. Plus, having discussions about the readings helps you work through things that can seem difficult or unrealistic to implement. And the opportunity to work with an actual teacher is helpful for seeing how the readings might or might not apply in the \"real world\"!",
                "Through our readings and class discussions, I learned about many different teaching pedagogies. Through our teaching segments, I learned how to put these ideas into practice and slowly worked out my own teaching style.",
                "Read a ton of literature about teaching and pedagogy, but not any teaching, effective *and* inclusive teaching, we had discussions on these, Melissa modelled them in class daily (she literally taught the class as if it was a secondary ed classroom, which was honestly one of the most helpful aspects of the course, I learned a lot from consistent modelling!!), we interviewed an assigned teacher partner on their experience and pedagogy, and we did teaching segments in which we planned a lesson plan, got feedback from Melissa, then taught it to our small teaching group made up of our peers",
                "In this course, I learned different strategies necessary to becoming an effective teacher. I learned to think meaningfully about the lessons that I hope to share with students and was able to workshop these lessons alongside other students."

                "Readings were really well paced, so I was able to complete all of them before the next class (good mixture of podcasts, videos, news articles, research papers, etc.). Great community building within the course. Great amount of assessments scattered throughout the term. Great teaching partner relationship to learn about the day-to-day experience of educators. Great professor, Melissa, who was engaged, compassionate, and a real joy to see every week. Weaknesses: sometimes the readings felt problematic, but it was nice to have something we could contest \/ read critically. Teaching segment groups were a little too small to feel helpful.",
                "Everything about this course is a strength. The readings are manageable in quantity and interesting in topic; every assignment is carefully explained (and rubrics well-detailed); Melissa is an epic professor; and the day-to-day organization of class is flawless. Not only do you learn what goes into be an effective teacher, but you get to put it into practice twice throughout the semester, too.",
                "Prof. Scheve built a true community in our classroom. We all supported each others learning. We all were responsible for the learning environment being inclusive, caring, and inclusive. I was excited to come to class every week even when the semester was stressful because I was genuinely looking forward to learning from my peers.",
                "This was an incredible course. As someone who wants to be a teacher, this is easily the most important and most helpful class I've taken at Yale. Melissa clearly has so much classroom experience and all the readings and discussions helped make me feel more prepared to go into teaching!",
                "This course is a truly comprehensive education and there are so many ways to stay engaged as a student. Not only will you learn from readings and in class discussion, but also from: (1) asynchronous learning posts on platforms like MURAL and Jamboard (that you'll one day use in your own class!), (2) the meta ways in which Professor Scheve models teaching in a classroom, (3) giving your own teaching segments and (4) the lived experiences of your teacher partner.",
                "This course's biggest strength is its community. Melissa knocked it out of the park by cultivating a classroom culture in which everybody is tight-knit, friendly, and respectful. This made learning easy, fun, and engaging. Another great strength of the course is the variety of classroom activities. Melissa constantly has us trying different types of classroom activities to expand our repertoire as teachers, but also to keep us more engaged than we would be in a plain lecture or discussion. Finally, the third big strength of this course is the practicality - unlike many courses which are largely theoretical, we had the opportunity to actually teach mock lessons and to interview real teachers. I can't think of any big weaknesses for this course!",
                "Strengths: the instructor, the assignments, the spread of the assignments over the semester, the workload, the topics, the teaching segments, the teacher partnership, the classroom community. The accessibility and accommodations.",
                "This course is perhaps the only one at Yale focused on how to teach in a classroom, which it gives a solid introduction to. In terms of improvement, I often felt like the readings were really detached from the lessons. Since each lesson models a different activity or way of teaching, we didn't always have discussions of the readings. And when we did, it felt like we didn't actually tease out the intricacies of the content, we more stayed on the surface level (which may have been more due to the people in the class). Diving deeper into those texts would make the class stronger.",
                "Overall the course was excellent. Our teaching segment groups were fun and I found the exercise of planning a lesson helpful. I did find that the case study project got a bit repetitive by the third iteration. I wish there was more of a difference between the three parts. Maybe one part could've been observing a class session of our teacher partner, or having an additional lesson planning activity.",
                "Strengths: Melissa is a lovely instructor who cares about her students and offers detailed, thoughtful feedback on all the work we turn in. She is very flexible and forgiving and does a great job nurturing our capacity to teach! Other helpful parts of the course: the structure of assignments, the teaching practice segments, the different digital platforms we used for reading responses, the different class time structures (e.g. fishbowl, expert groups\/jigsaw groups, designing authentic assessments), students of the week, teaching interviews. Weaknesses: None, I wish all my classes could have been as varied and engaging as this one!!!! This was one class where even if I felt tired or sad, I felt like I wanted to go and be in community with everyone.",
                "Strengths: Professor Scheve, professor Scheve, and professor Scheve - professor Scheve has been a teacher for a long time, and it really shows. Everything that we did in class mirrored practices prof Scheve would implement in the classroom; moreover, everything we did in the classroom was relevant to what we were learning, and there was never any busywork or wasted time. This is one of the few classes where I truly cared about everything I learned, and in which I felt that everything I learned was important\/relevant; professor Scheve does a good job of communicating the importance of everything being done, whether it's an activity, assignment, etc. This was also a class with a strong community focus - the class was truly student-centered; professor Scheve would regularly take and respond to feedback in productive ways, and class discussions were often student driven. We also got the opportunity to apply our learning, e.g. through teaching segments, and through case study interviews with actual teachers, which helped put our learning in context. The feedback given in the class is also very good - grading is meaningful and tied to process, and feedback is given that is actually helpful to learning, and whenever I got feedback I always felt it was both reasonable and productive to my learning. The only weakness of the class is that it only met once a week this semester, and we didn't get more time \/ regular sessions :( - Overall, this has probably been the most well designed class I have ever taken (which makes sense haha), and has been both a fun and meaningful course to take. It taught me a lot about how people learn, and was very effective at delivering the content material.",
                "STRENGTHS: the professor for sure, Melissa is AMAZING and 100% a teacher who wants to teach others how to teach and does it wonderfully. THE CLASSROOM COMMUNITY: Melissa also does a great job of fostering community in class, we have a lot of community building, and a lot of small group work so that we can get to know our peers better. ENGAGEMENT: the class is so engaging, there's various ways to participate and there's many different activities that kept me engaged the entirety of the seminar, from partner work to small group work to larger group work and that was super engaging\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: The readings could feel a bit basic sometimes."

                "Absolutely, particularly students who believe they will teach one day. I learned practical skills and built a network of future teachers. I also found myself learning without having to stay up super late working on readings or assignments. Melissa is also just an amazing person to know on a personal level, so any way to connect with her is amazing.",
                "YES! A million times yes. This has truly been my favorite class at Yale. Melissa is an excellent professor--kind, wildly intelligent, experienced, and passionate--and she makes me want to be the best teacher I possibly can be. You will not be disappointed if you take this class. The assignments are fun, the case study is awesome, and the readings are super interesting (on top of being manageable--so, win-win). Melissa's seminar was consistently my favorite part of every school week.",
                "Yes, especially if you are an aspiring teacher!",
                "Yes absolutely!!! Especially if you want to be a teacher.",
                "Absolutely. I would strongly encourage future teachers to take this course. It will strengthen your understanding and hopefully your commitment to the profession and see it as a viable lifestyle and intellectually and spiritually rewarding career.",
                "DEFINITELY. This was my favorite course I've ever taken in school. For any who are interested in teaching, this course is a must. It equips you to be a more thoughtful and purposeful teacher in the future, and that's not to mention how fun it is.",
                "YES a million times over. The best class Ive ever taken at Yale.",
                "If you are interested in teaching, this is a great introduction. You will be partnered with a veteran teacher who will share their philosophies and best practices to help you gain an insider's knowledge of the field.",
                "Yes, absolutely! This is one of the only teaching courses at Yale, so if you are interested in becoming a teacher, it is definitely worth your time. Melissa works hard to make the class the best it can be, so you're in for a great experience if you're able to get a spot!",
                "Absolutely! I think it is a must take for any student considering going into teaching.",
                "Yes of course! This course gives us the chance to learn how to teach by letting us practice ourselves. We also learn various class management approaches within each seminar by seeing which activities Dr Scheve designed and which tools she implemented. Lastly we also get to discuss with a highly knowledgeable teacher-partner throughout the semester.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to be a teacher or is considering being a teacher. Not only does this class give you a TON of strategies, theories, skills, and methods for teaching in a classroom, it also gives you the opportunity to talk with a teacher out in the world, which might help you decide if you want to be a teacher or not! Additionally, because this class models effective and engaging pedagogy, regardless of your teaching aspirations it is guaranteed to be a good time every week!!",
                "I strongly recommend this course to students interested in teaching in the future. The course provides three different ways to engage with content -- readings & class discussions, teaching segments, and teacher interviews. This structure allows students to view teaching from different angles, and was very beneficial to my understanding of what teaching is.",
                "Yes!!! - If you are interested in teaching, this is an absolutely fantastic course. I learned a lot about teaching - there was a lot of theory (readings and discussion), but it was always balanced by practical experience through activities\/teaching segments\/etc. - This class is one which is designed to be a class you want to be in and come back to each time, which has been rare in my time at Yale; it is truly a welcoming, safe space to learn - and this is no accident; we spent a lot of time discussing classroom community and community agreements. This class is one that not only taught me the content as advertised, but helped me really embody my learning, all while being responsive to the ways in which each student learned. - If you have any remote interest in teaching, or if you want to learn more about how people learn - this is an absolutely amazing course.",
                "YES! If you want to be a teacher, this is pretty much the only practical course Yale offers, and it is GREAT. I learned a lot with a great community. It is also not a super high workload, it is definitely incredibly manageable, it definitely fits in your schedule but just don't underestimate the time that the case studies can take when the come, nothing to worry about but just watch out for those weeks when those are due.",
                "Yes! This course is dedicated to effective teaching and Melissa mirrors many of these same principles in her actual course. Melissa is an AMAZING teacher and every moment in class was a learning moment. I have never learned so much academically, personally, and emotionally in a class during my time at Yale!"
