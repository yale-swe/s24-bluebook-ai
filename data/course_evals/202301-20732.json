More basic techniques such as paint mixing and how to use the supplies given could be explained. I also did not enjoy the first monochrome collage assignment and wish we learned about painting human faces.",
                "strengths: variety of assignments, level of support throughout the process, matt and soren",

                "Due to time and ability contrainsts I don't think we got to talk enough about colors, perspective, and other basics that are not technically painting specific but would have been useful.",
                "There's a weird paradox in the course where you get better grades for better paintings, but it's supposed to be a completely beginner's class, so I noticed some students who were absolutely completely beginners were sort of penalized as a result of this framework, which I didn't think was super fair. Just to be clear, I think the grading was largely in part based on effort, but I think expectations were a bit higher than what you might expect from a completely beginner's class, and part of this was probably because people who have painted before were in the class.",
