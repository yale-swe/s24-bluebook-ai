I learned what issues are currently the most pressing globally, and understood the methodologies that public health experts use to approach them. The most useful skill was probably thinking about solving problems on the magnitude of those tackled in this class and learning how certain obstacles have historically been overcome and what obstacles currently lie ahead of experts. The opportunity to meet and interact with multiple guests representing leading institutions in public health was also fantastic and left me curious to research more about topics I'm interested in.",
                "I definitely learned about public health as a whole as well as the various individual subject matters as well as hear from some really prominent experts in the field.",
                "I enjoyed this seminar; I learned a lot about health communications and how to critically assess/read a research paper. Additionally, I was able to engage in meaningful dialogues and assignments that taught me a lot about conveying public health crises/topics to the public.",
                "I learned about a wide range of public health issues and how to make cohesive arguments in favor or against certain public health policies.",
                "Much about the reasoning and knowledge required behind public health measures and concepts",
                "I learned how to analyze and make sense of public health issues in a critical context",

                "This course gave me proficiency in the most pressing and relevant public health issues of the last 50 years. I've been able to connect these various issues to my other coursework as a political science major. I have a decent grasp on the history, public health policy, social and political responses to issues from Big Tobacco to physician assisted suicide.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course lie mainly in the diversity of topics covered and the wonderful selections of readings the class is exposed to. The weaknesses lie in the structure that is overly focused on presentations and much less on discussions. The professor also cold-calls which can be nerve-wracking for students that do not feel confident participating all the time. I think these are both easy fixes to the structure of the class. Another weakness is that the class assigns a lot of scientific reading without necessarily meeting its goal of actually teaching students how to tackle these articles and journals especially when using them to write papers and conduct our individual research.",
                "I think some more feedback would be ideal and the quiz questions could at times feel a bit subjective, but I think the topics are all really interesting, I really enjoyed the discussions, and it was great to hear from some experts in the field of public health.",
                "I wish that we were able to engage in more seminar style conversations, and perhaps fewer projects. However, this is a small criticism. Professor Bazell was great at collecting feedback on his own teaching, and led each class with an abundance of energy and enthusiasm. The guest speakers were also incredible -- Professor Bazell has some great connections within the public health field.",
                "Its an excellent course. The topics move by handily, and theres enough discussion of each topic to the point where you gain a solid grasp of it without becoming tired. Weakness is that discussion in class really depends on whether other students do the readings",
                "he was a bit hazy with grade freedback, but other than that an amazing course\r\ngreat speakers, discussions, and experience from Professor Bazell",
                "The organization of this course, tackling one or two issues per week, was fantastic. My only suggestion would be to narrow the readings to a few longer readings instead of several short readingsso many different readings a week made it difficult to keep track of and discuss in class.",
                "there was very little structure to the class and conversation in the class was limited because it was all surrounding questions and presentations. i wish there was more free discussion",
                "Strengths: all of the clips of Professor Bazell from his time at NBC!, guest speakers, range of topics\r\n\r\nCons: course assignments could be more structured with clearer instructions"

                "Yes. If you're interested in discussing the topics in the syllabus or have even a minor interest in the field of public health you should definitely take it. The discussions are interesting, the guest speakers are some huge figures in the world of public health, and Professor Bazell's own experience as a correspondent at NBC for decades also provides some really interesting perspectives.",
                "I would recommend it! It was fascinating material, with a good variety of topics covered. I was constantly engaged, and challenged by the science and communications at hand -- all in a good way. A good first year seminar, and perhaps one of the best science-credits available.",
                "Yes! It is a very doable SC credit and you learn a lot about a wide range of public health issues.",
                "Certainly!",
                "I would recommend this class! It's a great class for non-STEM majors to learn outside of their bubble.",

It is literally the perfect science credit for people in the social sciencesyou get to critically examine the most salient public health issues through reading and discussion, and the midterm and final papers allow for total control of what issues you want to delve deeper into.",
