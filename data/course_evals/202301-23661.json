The novels and cultural events were inspiring and made me think and learn in new and different ways.",

This course seemed to be slightly less focused on grammar and more focused on the importance of conversation and written analysis, which is a critical skill that I was able to develop. I believe I am more confident in Spanish conversation and writing following this course.",

Many of which expanded my knowledge not only of the Spanish language, but also global issues and different cultures. There werent too many weaknesses, but class often felt monotonous. Each class seemed to follow the same routine which can lower engagement in a class that meets so often. To improve the course, I would have liked to explore some new grammar topics. This course explored nearly identical grammar topics as SPAN 120.",

It was truly wonderful being engaged with this class and collaborating with my peers. I thought this course was structured very well to inspire learning. I look forward to continuing Spanish next semester as well!",

                "Yes! One note, however: similar to many of the classes here at Yale (but especially relevant to this one) is that you only get out of the course what you put into it. It is critical to be ready to engage during class and with the homework assignments in order to improve.",
