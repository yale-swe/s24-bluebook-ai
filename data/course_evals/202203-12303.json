I have learned how even within collaborative spaces of contrasting ideas, there is always place for connection and individual interest. This class is a very safe, respectful learning environment where students are not only encouraged, but privileged to engage in artistic collaboration alongside insightful peers.",
                "I really learned how to work with others, how to analyze scripts and theatrical text, and how to do dramaturgical research.",
                "Collaboration with group members, strategies and insight for performance",
                "I developed my directorial and collaborative process.",
                "- I learned to collaborate with peers! \r\n- I gained exposure by reading lots of new plays, and viewing performances I would not have known to seek out on my own\r\n- I engaged with movement work and physicality more than I am used to, and learned how to integrate it into a work\r\n- I learned how to request texts from the Beinecke",
                "I learned so much about what it really means to work with others. The class was built to foster creativity and spur the imagination, and it did just that.",
                "How to work better with people in a creative context, improvement of movement skills, knowledge about theater practicioners from the past and their work.",
                "I learned some useful methods of interacting with pieces of art and historical archives in order to create new pieces. I also got to know my classmates very well, and work closely with many of them. As we studied collaboration, I built a good foundation of understanding what it means to develop multiple performances with other striving arts students. I've also developed an understanding of what I consider a good collaborative process, and the roles that I'm comfortable in.",
                "Seeing as the subject of this course is collaboration, this class helped me further develop my teamwork skills as I consistently worked with my classmates to create new projects from scratch. Not only did I learn a lot about how to work with a small group to generate ideas for a project, but I also learned how to successfully turn a collection of ideas into a concrete product that reflects the collaborative efforts of each group member.",
                "Many insights on community, responsibility and out of the box thinking were gained. Class made me reconsider the nature of academics in a classroom setting and highlighted the importance of creative thinking and problem solving.",
                "This course taught me a lot about artistic practice, research, collaborative methods, and concepts within performance and theater that I will take with me throughout my coursework in theater and performance studies.",
                "I came into this course with a desire to learn more about storytelling, and I believe I did just that. This course taught me skills that turned me into a great collaborator and, ultimately, a better storyteller. I learned how to evaluate different media such as plays, short stories, artifacts, film, music, etc. and reimagine how they contribute to performance. This course redefined how I look at performance and the work that goes on behind the scenes beyond the performers dramatizing the story. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about the performance world and all that inspires performance creation.",
                "Insights into my own creative process and how I work with others. Learned skills regarding how to collaborate and create the space, use the space, generate new ideas, and more. A lot of working in groups throughout this course."

            "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
            "comments": [
                "This course created a community of artists. Both the class as a whole and our individual sections established creative spaces where individuals were heard, encouraged, and excitedly included. I always felt thrilled both to see the processes of my peers as well as to develop it on my own.",
                "I loved this class. I would have liked to work with people outside my discussion section though sometimes.",
                "I appreciated how the focus of this course was thinking, discussing, and creating rather than attempting to achieve a grade - it was liberating and made me feel comfortable letting my creativity flow. In addition, everyone says you can only get good at a thing by doing it, and this class was a continuous stream of doing, which I really appreciated. The only things I would say as improvements would be the corpus of readings and viewings; I felt like they were often more in the experimental realm, but I would have liked to read and viewed a more even survey of works from different genres.",
                "I think the strengths lie in what, for me, was initially frustrating: the lack of specificity in the assignments. In the beginning of the course, I was often confused and unsure how to proceed. As the course continued, I grew to be immensely grateful over this lack of form, because it allowed me and my peers to pursue whatever ideas we wanted. No idea was too big or too small; we could explore whatever we wanted. The ability to just do, and to grow and collaborate freely alongside my classmates, was a huge strength.",
                "Reading and discussing the pieces of work that were assigned was helpful, as we started thinking like interpreters and adapters. I also benefitted from learning a method of providing feedback for performances. \r\n\r\nI didn't feel like the length of the class was necessary to access the core material. There was time used in class for warm-ups that felt slightly unrelated, and during our section, which wasn't listed on the syllabus, there were some materials assigned that felt unrelated and unnecessary for the projects at hand.",
                "This course did a great job of bringing students together to create new and exciting pieces of theater that emphasize and uplift the collaborative process. However, I think the amount of time that students were expected to dedicate to this course was one of its biggest weaknesses. An hour-and-a-half section meeting on top of a course that already met for three hours often felt like too much and at some points it made me feel tired of and less engaged in the class. I think this course could be improved by dedicating more class time to the creation of group projects instead of requiring students to meet for an additional 90 minutes (and oftentimes more) outside of class.",
                "There were too many strengths to count. In terms of improvements, I would love if the groups were mixed up after eacb project so we werent working with the same people all semester.",
                "A strength of the course is that it familiarizes you with the creation of performance very quickly. It also introduces you to several theater concepts through making pieces to embody those concepts, making the engagement with the course necessarily high. Additionally, you meet many other students that are also interested in theater and the arts and begin to collaborate with them in this course. Weaknesses of the course are that it is only once a week and for 3 hours, which can be a bit fatiguing at times. Also, you often have to find time outside of class and section to work on theater pieces, which can be difficult to coordinate sometimes.",
                "One disadvantage is that I couldn't work with anyone outside of my discussion section for group projects. Although this fostered a greater sense of section community within my group, I was a little drawn back when I found out we wouldn't be able to collaborate with other groups or other group members for most/all of our collaboration pieces.",
                "Strengths: meeting once a week together and then for section allowed for ample, spaced out time. Really enjoyed the time to warm up and settle into the space. Weekly discussion posts helped accountability.\r\nWeaknesses: there were times where an outside of section / class rehearsal was added, which sometimes could be difficult to schedule. It was beneficial to the class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time outside of class too. Perhaps having the weekly discussion posts due Monday at midnight would be better, but I also understand the idea that then we can read them before class on Tuesday as well."

                "I would highly recommend this course. Not only is it truly grounding for prospective Theater and Dance Performance Studies majors, but it establishes what a productive collaborative academic environment should look like. By determining boundaries early on in the semester, students are comfortable and allowed to freely express their thoughts and ideas.",
                "Yes, it was both fun and challenging and much different to any other class I took this semester.",
                "Yes, I would.",

                "This class is required for the major, so naturally I would recommend another student to take it, but I also found some fantastic people that I really enjoy collaborating with, so I would recommend this course in the hopes that the student would find the same.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only was it fun, but educational and exciting. I think it would make most sense to recommend this to another student interested in theater, because I dont know that a student without that interest would quite understand some of the pieces we discuss, but I think it would be beneficial for anyone regardless.",
                "Yes, a really good opportunity to work with people on interesting projects.",
                "I would recommend this course to other first-year students who are strongly interested in the TAPS major and looking to build relationships with other prospective theatre majors. I think that the first semester is the best time to fulfill this prerequisite. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is interested in a one-off arts credit or performance/training-based course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the theater studies major. Not only is it already required as one of the prerequisites for the major, but it's also a great way to learn more about the major and a fun way to meet other students interested in theater. Furthermore, the lessons in theater-making that this class teaches are important for any burgeoning theater-maker to know. That being said, I would not recommend this course to anyone who isn't planning on majoring in theater studies because this course feels like it was designed for theater people. A lot of the projects are really abstract and feel more like experiments in theater than actual theater pieces, and while this is an important foundation for anyone who is interested in further pursuing theater more seriously, there are better (and perhaps more fun) courses for non-theater majors who have an interest in exploring theater.",
                "Yes definitely. I have. It is a class that teaches you so much with our taking itself to seriously. It is often a cathardic 3 hours of your week.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think I definitely learned a lot in this class, and if you are someone who is interested in the theater and making theater, this is a great course to start from. It is a low-pressure environment that is all about learning and exploration, and you learn a lot not only from the work you create but from the work that your peers create as well.",
                "I would recommend this class to prospective TDAPS majors. THST 110 is an engaging class that enables you to work with peers of diverse arts backgrounds to create unique performance pieces that can combine dance, acting, voice, and more.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because I believe it is a great foundation for anyone considering the TDAPs major or interested in learning more about the inner workings of performance. I had a great experience working with my peers in full meeting as well as my discussion section: I was able to get to know everyone in my section on a more personal level, and I believe this led to more successful collaborative experiences.",
