                "I found Professor Newburgh's lectures to be incredibly interesting and well-organized. The lectures followed the textbook making it a helpful resource to turn to as a supplemental resource, while the homework sets and the midterm/final were all very fair and manageable. The small class size was also great for facilitating engagement. The one thing that would probably strengthen the course is if lecture notes were posted after class  I understand the Professor probably didn't do this to encourage us to come to class, but even still there were a few times in the course where I missed something in lecture or wasn't confident that I had copied something down correctly, so turning to class lecture notes would have definitely been helpful. Other than that, the course was exactly what a physics course of this kind should be, the professor and TA were easily accessible, helpful, and seemed to genuinely care about our understanding of the course material.",
                "Strengths: clear lectures, fair problem sets, accessible office hours, fair tests\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often, problem sets included some python, which was not taught in class. These problems could often be difficult to complete for those without a python background, but lots of support was provided in office hours.",
                "The lectures were really good and the professor-- excluding couple errors in math and teaching here and there-- was really good at explaining. However, the psets were sometimes a bit challenging and a big intellectual jump from lectures.",
                "Strengths: The class size was small so it was easy to engage with the material and ask questions. The structure of the course is pretty straightforward in that you have weekly PSETs, a midterm, and a final. Professor Newburgh always tried to engage with the class. Weaknesses: Lectures could be boring when we focused on derivations"
