Elements of Japanese culture were also introduced, particularly at the beginning of the course (greetings and set phrases) and at the end through the final project.",
                "Besides increasing my Japanese proficiency, I was able to improve on my skill of communication with my classmates as well as with my instructor. I also attained a better time management skill due to the daily assignments of homework.",
                "Japanese 110",
                "It is really astonishing how much Japanese I was able to learn in such a short amount of time. I am glad that this course was a conversation based way of learning because that is the aspect of language learning that I have struggled most with in the past. Not only did I establish and hone my Japanese language skills but I also learned about the culture and climate of Japan -- which I think is indispensable to a strong language course."

                "I enjoyed the course. I wish that sometimes the homework could be a little less but I know it is good to have so much practice.",
                "This course shines in its dedication to conversation practice, which is typically the most difficult skill for non-native language learners: not only was the majority of class time set aside for partner practice, but the mandatory tutorial sessions also were focused on speaking as well. This means that the burden of vocabulary, grammar, and writing practice fell on the student to complete before class time, but the preparation was easily worth it, especially given that the material was reinforced through careful planning of conversation prompts by the teachers. The only comment about balance I'd make is that I wish more time was spent explaining some of the linguistic aspects of Japanese (rendaku, morphological characteristics and inflection, etc.) to give a more unified roadmap of our journey - I feel that this would help us internalize more of the grammar, especially if comparisons to similar processes in English and/or other languages were given.",
                "The weekly Japanese clinic is very helpful for practicing conversation skills (a weak point of mine). I would like to see rotation among the seating in class so we can practice speaking with different partners over the semester. The course is pretty fast-based so I found it hard to keep up as much as I'd like to, but I'm not sure if anything could be changed to the setup of the course to really help that since there's just a lot to get through. On the other hand I liked the different ways we engaged with Japanese through e.g., the songs, games, or conversation meet-ups with actual Japanese students.",
                "Strengths include daily class which fortified the knowledge taught each day while weaknesses include a very demanding and sometimes overwhelming workload.",
                "The course is super well organized and extremely clear. It is very fast paced and a lot of homework is given daily.",
                "At times the workload can be a bit daunting. Not to say that it was completely unnecessary but there were many nights that I had really wished the work was either a bit shorter or was maybe not quite as often. I feel like I was very tied to that Japanese textbook all semester and found myself having to scramble during busy weeks because of my Japanese homework."

                "Yes. This course helped me learn Japanese faster than I thought possible given my history with other attempts at learning foreign languages. However, students who enroll in this course should be very aware that their success hinges on a large daily commitment and advance planning - time management is key, especially in semesters with other difficult classes. I would recommend taking advantage of mealtimes, etc. to drill vocabulary as much as possible in advance.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in learning Japanese then this class will definitely help you start that journey. The daily assignments and class time ensure that you'll pick it up.",
                "Yes! I loved my experience learning a new language and I believe this class is a very well organized introductory class.",
                "Yes but be prepared for a high high workload.",
                "There are a lot of people I know who did not take Japanese here at Yale because of your rigorous and intense they heard it was, which I think is sad. Though I did highlight how the workload can be slightly overwhelming at times, this is still a great class that succeeded fully in getting me introduced to the Japanese language. So, I would recommend this course to another student if they really wanted to learn the language, and even have some fun while doing it, because I think if anyone really cares about this learning process then they will be able to get over the workload like I did."
