                "There need to be project suggested at the start, in 487, which are known to be possible and feasible and tick all of the boxes. Letting students come up with their own leads to a wide disparity in the kinds of projects that are being done, the workload, the complexity and marketability. Instructors need to be more understanding and to step in as soon as they see things turning south. This is an important, and necessary course, but it absolutely needs to be handled by people who know what they're doing and who are geared towards students learning, not getting everything right and polished.",

                "strengths: clearly you learn a bit about what its like in industry and the engineering processes\r\nweakness: it could be a bit more organized and it deserves much more than a half credit, also administrators who have problems with projects should show their faces instead of hiding like cowards, and the stress, anger and mental and physical harm that was caused NOT by my professors but by random higher ups who think what they do doesnt affect the students was ridiculous. if administrators have problems they need to state them at the beginning of the year other wise they need to shut the fuck up",
                "Strengths: you are given a lot of support and resources to build something that provides a lot of educational impact.\r\nWeaknesses: There are still assignments in the course that are filler. I understand that the 3-9 and Gantt chart might be needed as an assignment to keep people updated and on task but they were not useful to my team. The documentation explaining what exactly we have to submit and when is sometimes confusing and contradictory.",
                "This course needs to be a full class credit, it is honestly absurd it is only half a credit based on the amount of class time and hours put in by the students."

According to the jerks at Yale EHS it has to for sAfEtY.  I cannot name a single engineer that has THANKED these clowns because every single experience Ive heard about has involved these dumb dumbs watering down the coolness of a reasonable project in the name of sAfEtY.  This slow, inefficient organization is more concerned with shutting stuff down than making stuff work which probably contributes to why Yale engineering is lame and not respected.",
