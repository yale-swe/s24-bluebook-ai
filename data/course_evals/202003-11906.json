                "One of the strengths was definitely the professor. She's probably the best lecturer in the entire department. She made it a point to really hammer in the fundamentals, which I didn't learn the first time around and caused me to lose most of the information I was taught in undergrad-level physical chemistry. I did feel at times quite disconnected from the problem sets and found them difficult to complete sometimes, which I think might be a flaw of the book rather than the lectures because the book and lectures are very similar. I also think the course would benefit from some distinction between where the math\/derivations end and the core things that we need to take away begin, because I sometimes struggled with this, especially before exams."
