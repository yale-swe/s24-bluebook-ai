                "I thought this course was a really solid, excellent introduction to organic chemistry. The psets reinforced lecture material and solidified my understanding of the reactions without being overly difficult and time-consuming. The practice exams were also really helpful and were similar in content and difficulty to the exams. One thing that could be improved is posting practice test answers earlier, which would give students more time to prepare and ensure that they know the material correctly before the exam. Also, pthe op quizzes kept me on edge and weren't fun in the moment, but they were for the most part doable and made sure that I was constantly reviewing the material, which came in handy the week before the exams.",
                "The course was strong in emphasizing only necessary materials, however the organization of homework and assessments was lacking.",
                "Strengths: there wasnt a lot of assignments so you could focus on what you need to, instructor and TAs were nice and available\r\nWeaknesses: homework and quizzes werent representative of exam content, there wasnt a high level of excitement about organic chem from the class or instructors",
                "I think the pace was a bit slow, and because of that it's somewhat problematic for students going on to Orgo II. I also don't think the pop quiz structure added to our learning.",
                "Although I find this material to be very interesting and sometimes it was taught well, I truly struggled significantly with getting the help I needed to ensure I was really learning the material well. I also found it quite hard to work with the staff when I got covid, as the lectures were refused to be recorded and I felt that it left me falling incredibly behind. I also do not think that exams properly evaluated my knowledge or skillset whatsoever. I think better organization and accommodation for students would be extremely beneficial. I feel that I taught myself most of the material this semester.",
                "I think the lectures were great and it was taught well but the teaching tram was a little unorganized so psets were often not great in facilitating learning and section wasnt very helpful.",
                "The strengths of this course were the pace, which was very tolerable for students. Furthermore, the professor really seemed to care how her students were doing, which created a more cohesive learning environment. The main weakness of the course was organization. Many of the assignments were posted later than originally specified and review sessions were sometimes last minute.",
                "The course begins in a moderately paced, review style. But then it ramps up a lot and covers a large amount of material in a unit or two that will be covered in an exam. The material did not cover much depth.",
                "It was nice that the course was the Professor writing on chalkboard and it was not automatically recorded and uploaded to Canvas -- this was a huge incentive to come to an early class. However, the course should be recorded for students who are sick and unable to come to class in person. It is really hard to catch up just from the notes from classmates. \r\n\r\nOverall the course was good. The assessments and homework felt reasonable because though the material and the exams were difficult, we got to drop our lowest exam, quiz, and homework. Prof. Slavoff was very nice and accommodating and a good lecturer. My TA was helpful in section and office hours as well. However, despite that she was a great lecturer in class, sometimes Prof. Slavoff felt a bit disengaged from the course; the homework sometimes took a long time to be released, her office hours sometimes did not happen, etc. Overall though, a good course.",
                "Class time was well structured to allow students to follow along with the professor, take notes, and ask questions as they needed to. Professor Slavoff made the class very conducive to comprehensive learning. \r\nI think it would have been helpful if there were more regular homework assignments that had more problems in them; a weekly pset would be really helpful to allow students to consistently reinforce the material, and it would also provide them with additional problems to go review when studying for exams. \r\nIt also would have been helpful to have more structured discussion sections that are synced to the material that we're covering in class, so that students can maximize their understanding of the course content.",
                "We never formally learned nomenclature, which saved us a lot of time but also made it confusing at times. Also, I wish there was more office hours in this class since my schedule didn't align with the few consistent ones that we had every week.",
                "A lot of the beginning of this course was spent reviewing some gen chem topics, which felt a little slow. Otherwise, this course was very strong and the material was interesting.",
                "Professor Slavoff was definitely a strength of the course. She is so kind and truly makes you feel comfortable studying such a difficult subject. She is always willing to make sure you understand by going slower than speed through them. As a result, we did not get through some of the topics that we should have, but she recorded lectures for us to watch on the things we didn't get to, which I very much appreciate. One way it could be improved would be to give a bit more problems or give some good problems from the book that we can practice with.",
                "Strengths: As an off-sequence course, lectures are much more engaging than bigger lectures. I didn't feel intimidated to ask questions in class. Sarah was approachable via email and during office hours. I received prompt feedback on homework and exams. Sections were helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Sarah was very busy from time to time, and occasionally, answer keys to problem sets and practice exams weren't posted promptly.",
                "Weaknesses: not enough resources, fast-paced, lots of mistakes made during lessons which were confusing and sometimes not explained, hand-wavy explanations for difficult concepts, exams were not passed back when promised, pop quizzes??? seriously? in college?, hw wouldn't be posted when promised, review sessions were held at terrible times (day before exam) without student input, exams questions were not always fair (aka exam 3 and the final)\r\n\r\nStrengths: Abby's sections, other students",
                "Very digestible pace for most of semester, bur kinda rushed at end.",
                "Strengths: small lecture format was a blessing as it allows more meaningful interactions with the instructor. \r\nGrading distribution allowed more flexibility and facilitated learning significantly.\r\nTAs were amazing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Time restrictions did not allow us to cover the entire material. However, I really appreciate Professor Slavoff going the extra mile and uploading the uncovered material asynchronously.",
                "Strengths: doesn't try to cram in material, manageable PSETS, helpful curve\r\nWeaknesses: last units were not well taught or supported, had to rely a lot on external teaching resources (Youtube videos, practice problems, etc.)",
                "Great content, explained fairly well as well as very well paced. There was no virtual portion past the first couple of classes which made it difficult when someone was sick and missed class notes. Also there were very few practice opportunities for students in the class and the work that needed to be done there.",
                "Strengths: it was well paced and Professor Slavoff made sure we were comfortable.",
                "This course is very well organized, especially in comparison to other orgo sections, for student success and taking it off sequence increased interaction with the professor greatly. However, greater feedback on work would have been appreciated and more practice problem suggestions.",
                "Great teacher and speed.",
                "Strengths: Prof Slavoff made this almost as painless as possible, considering this is an organic chemistry course. Definitely not even the worst pre-med requirement I have taken at Yale, and apparently orgo is supposed to be the worst of the pre-med requirements (in general, maybe that's not usually the case at yale). Having non-cumulative exams (even the final) was a huge bonus, and being able to drop the lowest exam grade (including the final) was also a huge bonus. also having practice exams was really helpful (and they would have been more helpful if we had gotten the answer keys earlier)\r\n\r\nthe problem sets weren't too long but provided practice. there was a drastic difference between the difficulty of the problem sets and the exam questions. I think it would have been nice if the problem sets were more challenging but graded on completion. and also if we worked on the problem sets during section. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class should have been recorded. I had to miss 2 lectures because of COVID and got behind because reading someone else's notes is simply not the same as actually being in lecture. I honestly don't know why lectures weren't recorded.\r\n\r\nthe pop quizzes. I understand that they were supposed to encourage us to come to class and actually study the material rather than waiting until the exam to study. not sure of a better alternative, but it was a pain studying for a potential pop quiz the last week of class and there not being one. and also because they were so short and worth 10 points, each mistake counted off a whole lot which made it hard to do well (I generally did better on the exams than the pop quizzes) so maybe they should be worth less of our grade. \r\n\r\nthe answer keys were sometimes not posted or posted very close to the exams and also sometimes had mistakes. I think either prof slavoff should just write all of the answer keys or she should check the ones that the TAs write because sometimes they'd go against what prof slavoff had said.",
                "The weaknesses of this course far outweigh the strengths. There were very few practice materials provided and you rarely received clear feedback on PSETs. The practice exams often did not come with an answer key. When they did, some of the answers were incorrect, so you would spend hours studying the wrong thing. The only way to get the correct answers was to attend all of the office hours and review sessions (even then, the TFs and the professor would give different, conflicting answers to the same question). When an inconsistency in the answer keys was brought to attention, they did not issue a change or notify the class, so only those attending the office hour or review session would get the answer.",
                "The course is taught well (it's pretty engaging) and there are lots of materials and resources that are readily available if you need them. The format of the course also helps to reduce the stress (as you can drop the lowest quiz, hw, and exam)."

                "Yes!! If you can take orgo off sequence with Professor Slavoff, do it. It's one of the best decisions I've made since coming to Yale. The lectures are engaging, and lecture notes are laid out clearly, providing a great foundation for more difficult yet still doable problems. Orgo was one of my favorite classes this semester, and it's really due to Professor Slavoff, the smaller, more intimate lecture size, and to Abby (who's an amazing TA!)",

                "This course provides an encouraging learning space to get acquainted with the basics of organic chemistry, so if it's a required class, know that it's very possible to succeed. Just be prepared to go to the professor and/or the TAs when you have questions, because there may not always be homework or discussion sections that cover exactly the material you're confused about.",

                "This course is very fun, and organic chemistry is incredibly interesting. It is a lot to learn, but it is very rewarding.",
                "I definitely recommend this course to anyone when Professor Slavoff is teaching. It was not very stressful and I truly learned a lot just because of the nice learning environment.",
                "Yes!! If you have to take one semester of organic chemistry, I would say the off-sequence one is a great option. If you're excited about chem but not thinking about majoring in a related subject, it's still a pretty fun course.",

I would recommend doing a lot of practice problems to prep and understand things better in the class. That is one of the more vital pieces of information to know.",

                "To further develop chemistry knowledge, yes I recommend this.",
                "Yes; well taught and assignments were at the same level of the exams",
                "I would totally recommend orgo off sequence. there were of course some things that could be improved, but if you want your orgo experience to be the least painless possible, take it off sequence with prof slavoff.",
