                "The greatest strength of the course is the intensive skill-learning. I came into the program knowing that writing is what I'm most interested in, and there wasn't a huge focus on really high-quality writing (and the predetermined group set-up would have been more effective, I think, if it were determined that there was a singular writer, a singular director, etc.). This made it all the more clear to me that writing is what I really love. I think this specific (and maybe pre-set) breakdown of roles could be useful in terms of embracing each individual voice instead of trying to do everything with eight hands.",
