This course helps develop more confidence in your Chinese abilities while bolstering up your reading and writing through various short stories and presentations/essays.",

                "I believe this course was an intensive class in improving my Chinese reading and writing comprehension, although I believe it could start off a bit easier, for students whose Chinese needed some easing in.",
                "Strengths: everyday work meant that students could practice the skill constantly. Also , the teacher was very funny and engaging, which kept me paying attention \r\n\r\nWeaknesses/improvements: I see none",
                "Strengths: Everything is very structured, so there are not too many weeks that are overly stressful compared to other weeks. Because you have three quizzes a week, it forces you to stay on track with the material so that when the tests come around, you dont have too much more to study. You always know what to expect because the class is very well organized. The asynchronous day is also nice to have, and I like the tutorial sections.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Especially at the beginning of the semester, its a chunk of work. Writing characters isnt difficult but takes a lot of time. We only had to write characters for the first ten lessons though. I also feel like theres a bit of discrepancy between different teachers teaching and grading styles.",
                "Strengths:\r\n\r\nVery friendly teacher, good pace, useful vocabulary learned.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:",
                "Strengths- structure, having a lot of engagement and interactivity\r\nWeaknesses- wish there was more emphasis on learning basic grammar rules",
                "This course is excellent! I think the strengths lie in its teacher (Su lao shi) and the consistent/predictable structure of the curriculum. I think it would've been nice to have more speaking opportunities.",
                "I liked how our professor interacted with the students in a funny and modern way. However, I wish he was more organized and in the loop about the course materials and homework.",
                "CHNS 132 just piloted a 4+1 teaching method, where Thursdays were Asynchronous. This was a great strength as typically, your essays, presentation, or tests were due/on Fridays, which meant that having the day before to really start and polish your work was perfect. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of character writing at the beginning, but this is to emphasize stroke order and familiarity with Chinese characters. I recommend writing them during class so that you essentially have no homework.",
                "strengths\r\n- chinese practice was slow, deliberate, and repetitivewhich is exactly the type of practice necessary to really embed the language into understanding\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- you end up knowing curriculum very well, but not really so much anything outside of thati.e sight reading"

                "Yes. The teacher was very interesting and always made class fun. It is also good for heritage speakers because it teaches them the skills they need to know to read and write Chinese well.",
                "Possibly. I hear that Chinese is a bit more difficult than some of the other languages at Yale. Theres a big workload each week just to learn all the characters, but thats just how you have to learn Chinese. I didnt grow up speaking Chinese but had learned some through schooling over the years, and although it was a bit more difficult for me at the beginning of the semester to understand everything he was saying, my aural comprehension improved (and I learned how to use google translate in class). Su laoshi goes a bit beyond what the textbook covers since he sometimes goes on tangents or tells interesting stories, and it made me a bit stressed out at the beginning of the semester since I did not always fully understand the concepts he was talking about, but rest assured it is not on the test.\r\n\r\nI dont know if I improved that much in my speaking ability, but if you want to improve your reading/writing/aural comprehension, then it is a good class.",
                "Yes since itll highly improve your Chinese level",
                "Yes! I think it is an excellent way to improve one's chinese literacy abilities and is tailored to heritage speakers very well",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to heritage speakers who are looking to learn how to read and write Chinese characters. This class was enjoyable and fun",
                "I would recommend this course because the gains I made in my Chinese were unquantifiable. It was clear that my skills had jumped tenfold from the beginning to the end of the semester.",
                "yes, it definitely takes your speaking and reading Chinese to a higher level, as someone coming from a heritage background"
