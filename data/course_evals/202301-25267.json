Said second reader is not involved with the development of a student's project, though likely has familiarity with their subject area. It would be useful to seek their feedback before evaluations are determined (or at the very least for the department to connect students with additional internal resources if they expect a student to commune with experts beyond their advisor).",

I am grateful to have developed a closer relationship with my advisor and appreciated the opportunity to commune with my upperclassman peers but think the experience is poorly structured for success. Several of my friends and their advisors were surprised to receive feedback unbecoming of or at odds with the effort they had invested in their essays. As it stands, you'll have to take this course to graduate in the major, though if these remain the conditions of graduating with an art history degree, I'd think twice about committing."
