            "comments": [
                "Very weak course: little to no content covered in each lecture, more or less all the material can be learned by scanning the notes for a few minutes. Problem sets were deeply tedious and did little to help learning.",
                "This is a well-taught and well-structured course. The psets and lectures worked well together. I definitely became more confident in my proof-writing skills. However, the exams can be quite difficult and a step-up from the usual material.",
                "Strengths: James Barnes is definitely one of the better math teachers I've had at Yale. He's a pretty nice guy and has many intuitive explanations for set theoretical concepts for people that don't really have an intuition for the abstract concepts in set theory (like me). Additionally, office hours (both with James and the TA's) were really helpful, so there was always a place for help if you were struggling with the problem sets. Weaknesses: the course moved a bit too fast at the end. We were basically just speeding through theorems in order to reach the final topic of the course: the Von Neumann Universe (as well as completing the axioms of ZFC). However, James didn't test us much on the final concepts of the course on the final exam, so it wasn't too big of a deal, and it was pretty satisfying to realize we'd just covered the fundamental axioms that make most of the math we know today possible (although I'm still pretty confused as to how ordinals work, specifically ordinal arithmetic).",
                "Strengths: James is very responsive on Ed and an engaging professor. Lecture notes were always posted so I could go through after class and understand what was going on. I like how James always walked through proofs on the board instead of just sharing his screen--that was actually super helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: Every time I asked a question in class/on a discussion forum, I often felt like I was being ridiculed or made small for asking such a trivial/obvious question. Think it would've been helpful for there to be another TF/person/etc managing the Ed so Prof. Barnes wasn't getting so many repeat questions all the time (I can imagine it would be a lot) but I really did feel deterred from asking questions sometimes because I was afraid of an antagonistic response.",
                "Good lecture presentations and helpful handouts.",
                "This course was recorded, so that was a really nice touch.",
                "Strengths: Fill-in-the-blank notes and filled in notes are very helpful and appreciated\r\nWeaknesses:  James is impatient and crabby which is apparent in many eddiscussion posts. Feels like he lashes out on students which is abusive and inappropriate. Because of this I will NEVER take a class from him again.\r\n\r\nA smaller but still significant weakness is that he doesn't seem to know how lost his students are. The second midterm average being literally a failing grade should have made that clear, but nothing was done and it felt like the class just started moving even faster. He claims to be a compassionate grader in the syllabus, but I'm very unsure whether he actually is.",
                "This was a very interesting class but I found that there were enormous gaps between the class lectures, the p-sets, and the tests. This class feels like it assumes you are relatively comfortable with proof writing, which I was not. The notes packets were very helpful though. Additionally, I found there were a lack of resources for this class. I think additional (optional?) assignments that help students apply the notation theyve learned would be beneficial. Much of the lectures necessarily focused  on notation and important concepts, but very little was done to connect those concepts to the challenging proofs we were expected to complete for homework.",
                "Strengths: 1. The topics covered in this course are foundational for anyone interested in the philosophy and/or building blocks of math. 2. Prof Barnes is a great lecturer, and very understanding and helpful as a human. Weaknesses: 1. The class began super slowly, and picked up pace very quickly near the end. Perhaps the material should have been better spread over the semester.",
                "MIND-OPENING! MATH 270 is an extremely well-structured and meaningful course. The lectures are clearly very organized and thought out; James is definitely a selling factor of this course as he is super passionate about Set Theory! The problem sets and exams are very well-written, including some nice proofs. Overall, the course is extremely fascinating, especially when tied all together at the end. The only weakness of this course was the 9 am lectures, but that probably won't be the case in the future.",
                "Course note packets were great and were really helpful. I enjoyed having a good framework to guide my learning. Wish there were more examples and worked out solutions as models who h would be very helpful.",
                "psets and lectures were engaging and well structured\r\ninstructions for final projects could be improved, so could the content and style of the exams",
                "I thought this course had a good structure and consistently-paced content.",
                "Recorded lectures allow me to go at my own pace\r\n\r\nNot much help at the beginning of the year if new to proofs",
                "Strengths: James is a very caring professor and is quite willing to help students on a personal basis. I thought the skeleton notes were also very thorough and helpful, making each lecture structured and well-planned. The problem sets are also reasonable, and most of the assessments are fair. Weaknesses: The second midterm was unfairly tricky (although James was well-aware of that and probably adjusted for it), and the final exam was also non-rivial. Grading on the problem sets was also harsher than most math classes.",
                "The content is very interesting, and I feel like the content covered is very manageable. Lecture videos and lecture notes are posted on canvas which is extremely helpful when studying for exams.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes were very helpful, class was pretty well organized, office hours were helpful\r\nWeaknesses: the second midterm was very hard and came out of nowhere, the instructions for the optional were not very clear so it was hard to make a decision on whether or not I wanted/needed to do it, questions on ed were not answered very fast"

                "Incredibly easy, but really just boring and tedious.",
                "It really depends on the type of math you're interested in. This class is not like other math classes you'll find at Yale. Set Theory is the basis for most, if not all, of the math you've encountered in your life, so you're defining many intuitive things that become much less intuitive from a set-theoretical standpoint. For example, addition on the naturals needs to be defined using the Recursion Theorem, and addition on the other number systems is defined from the naturals, but proving properties of addition varies across the number systems because of how they're defined. Additionally, the grading scheme is not very forgiving. 75% of your grade is made up of exams with both midterms having around 4 questions and the final having 8 questions, so very minor mistakes are costly and major mistakes can ruin everything. However, I don't know if the class is curved, and James gives the option of replacing one of your midterms with a final project, so there is some room for leniency. Regardless, James is a great teacher, and if you really like pure math, you're looking at the right class. I enjoyed the experience (although my grade probably didn't), and I think it's pretty interesting to realize that math is simply held together by a set of axioms that we defined, which can lead to both flaws and perfections in our mathematical system. I can't say I'm an expert at working with ordinals and cardinals now, but it was interesting to take a look at the limits of math and more. I would just recommend shopping the class and seeing if Set Theory is interesting to you, but be aware that the course is much easier in the first half of the semester in comparison to the second half.",
                "I'd recommend it if you're actually interested in getting better at proofs and understanding the foundations of math, not if you're looking for an \"easy\" math course. I found it hard to know what / how to study for the exams, and what the expectations for the optional final project were, so if I were in it simply expecting low effort, I would have been disappointed.",
                "Yes. Its a class on an interesting topic thats worth learning about. The workload is manageable.",
                "For someone who is looking to either sharpen or acquire proof-based reasoning in pure mathematics, I definitely recommend this course.",
                "No, this is the single worst course I've ever taken at Yale. Honestly I get the sense that he probably wants me to say this so he can teach less students.\r\nJames lashes out at students which is inappropriate and abusive. Wouldn't wish any student deal with a professor like this. Hopefully he reflects and fixes it. \r\nI also thought this would be a gut credit for math major, but the psets took forever. But that's on me. And if that's not enough, the psets often felt like busy work.",
                "If you are interested in logic and foundations of math then this is a great class, though very challenging.",
                "If you're interested in how our system of math comes about, philosophically or foundationally, this is the course for you. It's also one of the easier proof-based math courses, if you're trying to test the waters on that front - or if you're looking for an easier 200+ level math course.",
                "To all math majors and enthusiasts, YES! This course is sooo interesting and mind-opening. My outlook on all of math has changed after this course. If you do take the course, make sure to go to lecture! James really appreciates it and you will find yourself feeling very rewarded by the end.",
                "Yes. Fascinating course and great instructor",
                "yes - given yale's abysmall selection of math courses, this is a good one. take it if you like logic, analytical philosophy or rigorous proof based math.",
                "No, not useful unless needed for major",
                "Yes, if you have to take it for your major. Otherwise, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it given the pretty harsh grading and long-ish problem sets.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in mathematics.",
                "Yes. If you have taken a proof-based math class before, you will find this class to be a very manageable addition to your math curriculum. I would recommend taking this alongside Analysis I as a lot of the material is complementary.",
                "Yes! It was really interesting to build \"all of math\" with set theory. I had never seen math built up from the ground before that, and overall the class was interesting. James is a pretty cool professor and made the 9am lectures engaging!"
