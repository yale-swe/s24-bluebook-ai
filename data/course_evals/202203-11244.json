                "The course covers a great amount of information. I would consider this a pro and a con. I feel like I would have been happy to spend an entire semester on some of the modules of the course. However, I appreciate having an introduction and baseline appreciation for so many topics in statistics.\r\n\r\nI feel conflicted in regards to the homeworks. On one hand, they cover an array of questions, but I really wish there were more softball questions. Maybe these questions don't need to be graded like we just get an answer key. I know there are extra problems in the book, but without some sort of answers they really don't feel very helpful. I also know that we cover examples in class, but I like to have as many examples as possible. Additionally, many times example problems from class or the book will be some sort of unique case, which really makes it much less helpful for learning some new concept. I also don't agree with the strategy of struggling through a few problems. I say this in the sense of getting up to speed on a topic as fast and efficient as possible. I would agree that struggling on problems does have a benefit of preparing for what future research problems might hold, and it is probably an indicator of true mastery of a problem. To that end, I might suggest staggering homeworks where each week we have basically 2 sets of problems. One set of problems are the \"easy\" problems that are from the new material covered that week, and the \"harder\" problems are from the previous weeks material. Maybe the \"easy\" problems could be self-graded or maybe even peer-graded. \r\n\r\nI definitely endorse having weekly homework. That is great. While difficult to implement, I think some element of quizzing would be very helpful. It would maybe not need to be for a grade just some type of check on basic understanding of the material each week. \r\n\r\nIf I were to suggest something really out there, I would suggest having a flipped class. Basically, we just watch recordings and go to class to work on homework problems/get extra explanation from the professor. Respectfully, there is not much interaction during class. It doesn't seem the most efficient use of student and professor time. I don't think poorly of Dr. Fan's teaching skills; I just think lecture in general is kind of inefficient.\r\n\r\nLeqi's notes were extremely helpful. The lecture goes very fast, and I found it difficult to write everything down without using these notes as a template.",
                "It's very challenging and covers a lot",
                "There are many advantages. For example, the teacher started with the most basic concepts and then went on to explore more in-depth topics. I understood the nature of statistical inference focusing on what the parameters are and how to make estimates, inferring. Secondly, Prof.Zhou was very patient and shared with us the students' and her class notes, which were very important to me. I could make sure I didn't misunderstand or miss any important information. The assignments at the end of each lesson were always the right level of difficulty to ensure that I understood what the teacher had taught me in class.\r\n\r\nThe current analyses all have very ideal assumptions, but when I need to apply this knowledge in practice (e.g. machine learning filed), these assumptions are often not met. Perhaps the teacher could discuss more current topics. For example, how to apply these techniques in the analysis of machine learning.",
                "A lot of important topics covered. Workload is a little large but this is a hard course so Im happy to spend a lot of time on it",

                "Zhou is a great instructor; I just wish the lectures had been recorded since class can move fairly quickly.",
                "I think the midterm could be redesigned so that it is a better test of the student's knowledge.",

                "The speed this course moves at in the asymptotic unit was difficult to keep up with, especially in the section on local asymptotic normality.",
                "I think Zhou Fan is a great teacher and he is very knowledgeable of the course. I do think he try to put to much material into the semester and we went over class time alot.",
                "Its wonderful",
                "strengths: The lectures are very clear and easy to understand; they helped me quickly understand a lot of things that were very difficult for me to understand when I taught myself; almost perfect notes\r\n\r\nweakness: Personally, I think the lectures about finite sample theory and the first couple lectures of asymptotic theory can be compressed, and the second half of the asymptotic theory is more difficult to understand, and it might be better if this part is slower.",
                "Prof. Zhou Fan is excellent! He gave the lectures in a clear and attractive way. Enjoyed all the lectures. May consider providing recordings of lectures so that students can review them when needed.",

                "I would highly recommend this course: it reinforces many of the concepts learned in 242 by going over their mathematical origins. You develop a solid understanding and appreciation of statistical advances over the years. It is excellently taught, and the TA's/ULA's were solid as well. Just be prepared to work: the workload is not for the faint of heart. Without intuition I'd gained from taking MATH 305 (real analysis) and S&DS 364 (information theory) in the past, truly comprehending some of the sufficiency, domination, and measure theoretic content would have been more difficult. I'll also say that these courses should not be seen as prerequisites: not knowing the detailed, Yale math department-level intuition behind a Lebesgue measure or an open set won't kill you in 410.",
