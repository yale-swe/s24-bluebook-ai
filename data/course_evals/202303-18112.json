The stats that we learned is sort of basic level but it goes pretty far in making you understand lots of research statistics and newspaper data that youre gonna see around so definitely a useful class just for being a more knowledgeable citizen.

                "I liked how it was flexible (you could watch lecture online or go in person). I also thought JRS explained concepts super well, and tried to make things engaging and fun. In terms of weaknesses, I struggled a bit with homework assignments. Most times, I got points taken off for not including details that the question didn't even ask for. Moreover, the instructions were vague, but the TFs were exceedingly picky with grading. It made it a bit hard to complete them, as I was not getting anything technically wrong, but was still losing points.",
                "Strengths: Comprehensive introduction to stats; multiple formats offered (in-person vs. live broadcast vs. prerecorded lectures); plenty of office hours offered; grounded in real-life examples, which helped illustrate the theoretical parts of the material\r\nWeaknesses: Slow grading turnaround, which makes it difficult to assess how well you are grasping the material",
                "The psets were manageable, tons of office hours available was super helpful, and lectures were super engaging. Having more in person office hours would be great. Loved the asynchronous option for class.",
                "Strengths: It is incredibly well organized and everything is easy to find regardless of the format by which you are taking the course. JDRS is also a great instructor who explains the content and holds frequent office hours where he clarifies any and all questions. I especially liked that the exams were open-note since I am one to stress over exams and sometimes forget stuff, this made it slightly lower stakes because I knew I could reference course material.",
                "Strengths: flexible format (asynchronous and synchronous options, and recorded and pre-recorded lectures). The lectures were engaging as well given the topic being taught.\r\nWeaknesses: Better engagement from Ed discussion, as there were times where many students' responses were left unanswered",
                "The asynchronous nature of the class is both its greatest strength as it allows flexibility in students' schedules and also its greatest weakness as it allows students (like me, honestly) to completely check out of the class. JDRS is a good teacher, though.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness is the lack of communication with TAs. You would log on for Zoom office hours and sometimes they just wouldn't be there. I tried to get one of my exams regraded multiple times over a month long period and eventually just gave up.",
                "I love that the class is asynchronous -- I used to go to class at the beginning of the year but found that I learned better by watching the videos. One of the great things about this class is the number of office hours that are held every week --it made p-sets and studying a lot more manageable.  \r\nI feel like often in class there would be a lot of tangents and I would have preferred to fill that time with more complex and nuanced examples.",
                "No weaknesses. The structure is great and makes it easy to learn. Lots of office hours.",
                "Strengths: lots of support available, lectures are clear, flexibility with how much\/little you want to engage \r\nWeaknesses: flexibility of the course could sometimes lead to lack of motivation",
                "Strengths: can be taken remotely which helps if you have 3 lectures back to back like I did, exams did not require memorization of all the formulas, order in which topics were presented was logical\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I hate to be so negative, but this was truly one of the most poorly run courses I have taken at Yale. The professor was very rarely responsive to communication, the rate of TAs answering questions on Ed Discussion (which is supposed to be the primary mode of communication for the course) was extremely slow, the lectures didn't provide many example type problems to use to prepare for exams, it took EXTREMELY LONG to receive grades for the midterms (often 3-4 weeks despite the exams literally being on Canvas and being majorly multiple choice- I've had similarly large lecture courses where exams are handwritten and we get them back within days), the OH schedule for TAs was not correct for a few weeks so it was difficult to get help, there were grading inconsistencies on homework and exams... overall a disappointing experience for a Yale course",
                "can take this class in person or not, very flexible",
                "The strengths are that you can learn at your own pace. A major weakness is that the TFs are not helpful at all, only the student ULAs are helpful. The TFs did not know what we had learned and never knew what I was talking about.",
                "Strengths: This course gives you sooooo much flexibility. You can do things at your own pace, which is awesome. And JDRS is so so incredibly funny. I watched the lectures for enjoyment!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because there is so much flexibility, it is also sometimes easy to fall behind...",
                "A strength is the ability to take it remotely and engage with the concept. A weakness was the lack of responsiveness from the TAs.",
                "content was fun to learn",
                "n\/a",
                "Strengths: Customisable, good instruction, easy to get help\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of in person help available, confusion after the half way mark with transferring TAs",
                "I think that its set up is great and its biggest strength. It's nice to have the option to either go to class in person or watch recorded lectures. No weaknesses, it's a good course.",
                "Strengths: asynchronous format, office hours, p-sets, JDRS\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the number of examples in class felt excessive and I found it difficult to stay focused",
                "Strengths: Asynchronous and a lot of office hours that really helped me learn the content better\r\nWeakness: how fast-paced the course was, which was quite difficult for someone like me who had never taken stats before.",
                "great lecturer just a fast class",
                "Strengths: the online format is super organized and the office hours are super helpful (also, there's a lot of them!)",
                "The teacher is energetic and passionate which is nice. The asynchronous\/in-class options make it easy to fall off course if you're not disciplined.",
                "The strengths of this course was how accessible it was. All of the lectures were easily accessible from the Canvas page which allows it to be a course that can be taken remotely. There were also SEVERAL office hours held by peer tutors and the professor himself. It was very helpful because all of the office hours were staggered and you could easily attend any because they were offered throughout every single day! The resources provided in this course was incredible and unlike any other course at Yale. The weakness of this course was that I wasn't able to really engage in the course because everything was remote. But overall, excellent course with great resources! Unfortunately, grading was pretty harsh and often depended on who was grading.",
                "There are some discrepancies in the grading of the Psets due to the different TA's and ULA's, which may make the grading uneven across all students. There have also been multiple times when Office Hours have been canceled last minute, or when the instructor did not show up to a scheduled Office Hours.",
                "Pretty solid course with lots of office hours and resources for students, no recommendations.",
                "S: Appreciated the ability to take the class asynchronously W: Harsh gradings on the P-Sets and the P-Sets didn't really match the exam content.",
                "It is a great class for humanities people. I did not go to a single lecture, watched everything online, and had a very flexible schedule. I hated probability, but otherwise, it was interesting.",
                "Strengths: very accessible (recordings for all lectures) and very in-depth notes are available. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were numerous times that people who were running office hours (TAs, peer tutors, professor) did not show up to zoom sessions or would cancel\/reschedule them way after they were supposed to have already started. I found this very frustrating. So, just being more on top of office hour times\/the communication of those would be a way this course could be improved.",
                "Strengths: SO many office hours and JDRS's hours are very conveniently timed. Problem sets and exams are not too difficult -- very manageable workload. The course worked well for me as a 5th credit.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Difficult to seek out timely help via Ed Discussions or email most of the time."

                "Yes, take this class if you're looking for a good QR. Good lectures, manageable work. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I am not a STEM person and this was a great QR. It was no calculus so I loved it. You should be prepared to work to keep up with the class and also to potentially do some learning on your own, but you won't have a problem with the class if you just keep up. It was a practical class and I learned a lot. Great flexible class, not a bad 5th credit.",

I think JDRS is an amazing instructor and he's quite fun,  so it makes the class that much better. I liked the accessibility of the course and the fact that you could decide what format to take it in (in-person, recorded lectures, or pre-recorded lectures).",

                "yes - great intro to stats no matter what your incoming knowledge is",
                "Absolutely! As a humanities\/arts student looking for a QR credit, I'm very glad I took this class it gave me practical knowledge that I'll be able to apply in my own field when looking at data. The teaching staff is very helpful, and I appreciated the amount of office hours offered as a student who needed additional help with the material.",
                "I would recommend for a fair QR credit. I did not really enjoy the class but I did not want to take a hard math course and I needed to tae for psych major. If you put in work you will do well.",
                "YES! Take this course if you want an easy but thorough introduction to statistics. Professor JDRS is so funny and explains things so well.",

                "This class is great, especially if you take it with JDRS. The set up of the class as a hybrid is nice and it gives you a lot of freedom. Also, JDRS is a great lecturer and teaches well.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone interested in statistics or looking for a quantitative reasoning class. This was not a difficult class; if you use your resources properly, you can get a high grade in this class. However, do not take this class if you are unwilling to go to office hours or talk to the professor.",
                "Yes, especially if you truly want to learn stats and are willing to put in the work to keep up with class and do the p-sets yourself.

If you are taking this class TAKE IT WITH JDRS (Jonathan Reuning-Sherer) because he is AWESOME. Depending on how comfortable you are with math it may be more or less of a struggle, but having the chance to work on psets with friends and in office hours as well as the open-note take-home exams, I feel like you should be fine no matter what. Its a course that really places an emphasis on LEARNING rather than just memorizing content or performing under pressure. This course made me realize I probably want to pursue a data science certificate here at Yale. If youre curious at all about how statisticians use data to make sense of the world then this is a class for you!",
