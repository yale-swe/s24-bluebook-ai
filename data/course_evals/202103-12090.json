                "We learned some technical aspects, such as camera operation and basic editing skills on DaVInci Resolve. We also covered some fundamentals of filmmaking, such as shot-reverse-shot and continuity.",
                "So much! How to use a Blackmagic camera. How to produce under time pressures. How to use a sound mixer. How to color correct with DaVinci Resolve. A lot of practical skills.",

            "comments": [
                "The hands-on nature of the class and in-person screenings are the greatest strengths of this class. You get to collaborate with your classmates on projects every week and watch and critique them together. You receive a lot of feedback from classmates and Professor Andrews is very passionate and cares a lot about his students' improvement.",
                "The biggest weakness can be the burden of constantly making a new short film every week. It got to be a lot, especially during the first run of the semester where there weren't any breaks. It is something you adapt to, but it was fairly stressful.",
                "You have to produce a short film each week, which by its very intensity forces you to improve your filmmaking skills. Towards the end of the semester, this proved to be somewhat hard to manage, as your time in which to work on them inevitably decreases. \r\n\r\nI would've liked to have spent more class time on using the editing software. I am still not too confident with color grading, and the time we spent looking at this was rushed and confused.\r\n\r\nThe most productive part is the screening each class, where your peers can comment on your films and offer suggestions. If you have good classmates, then some of their feedback can be invaluable. I found Professor Andrews's comments to be somewhat uncritical during class, but his grading can be somewhat harsh and arbitrary, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThe readings set at the beginning of the course were dense but interesting in places.",
                "Strength: Jon Andrews is a saint. A wonderful teacher and a kind man who makes some mean chocolate chip cherry cookies. The course gives you an opportunity to make a short film pretty much every week until the final project. It's nice to make mistakes but not get hung up on them and keep going. It's a real learn by doing approach to education.\r\nWeakness: The notes were insightful/succinct, but I would have liked more notes on projects.",
                "The strength of this course is the full immersion into the filmmaking world that it provides. I would have liked a little more workshopping in class; perhaps working on projects over a span of weeks allowing us to focus on certain technical aspects.",
                "I enjoyed the feedback from the professor and classmates. I wish that we did analysis of movie scenes a couple more times because I found it useful to see the things discussed in the text used in real life.",
                "Professor Andrews is the absolute best. Hes amazing at giving really thorough feedback and helping you along the way with your projects. Both a strength and a weakness is that you have to constantly be making things, which is great for getting more practice and improving but the work can be overwhelming at times."

                "If you've wanted to make films but lack confidence in the technical aspects, then sure. Be prepared for how long a good film takes to prepare for, shoot, and edit.",
                "You get as much out of this class as you put into it. I engaged a lot with this course and helped with other people's films as well as writing and directing my own each week. It can take up a lot of your time, but it never felt arduous because it was so much fun! However, you could do very little and just film everything on your iPhone and do well with little effort. But I would suggest seizing the opportunity to make friends and make films for credit!",
                "Yes! The class is really fun if you want to be making short films each week. I also think a great and open community is formed with the people.",

                "Yes.",
