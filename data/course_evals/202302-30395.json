Since I was taking this course, it was easier for me to complete the modules that were provided by the graduate school.",

There were really no weaknesses, just that the course is very fast paced in the summer so be prepared for that.",

Moreover, since this course was done in online, I was able to participate the live class from Japan, where I currently live right now. I assume summer courses in other schools are rarely done in online these days, thus this class was an ideal course for students living outside of US in summer.",
                "Yes I recommend taking this course even if you are not an economics major. The economic principles you learn have very good and practical applications to everyday life, especially if you want to enter the workforce.",
                "Yes, the pace of the class is relatively fast since it is only 5 weeks but Tolga does a great job of keeping the material engaging and, as long as you do the pre-lecture work, it is actually fairly easy to understand even with the rapid pace.",
                "Yes. The professor is very funny and patient to all the students."
