    "I learned how to revise my writing for precision of language, cohesion of voice, and much more. It was overall a great course for those looking to read the writings of the greats and adopt some of their techniques\/styles.",
    "I learned how to critically evaluate different types of nonfiction writing and how to implement their techniques into my own writing. I gained confidence in my writing abilities and really enjoyed the readings that we read.",
    "I learned how to analyze my own writing and the writing of others to grow as a writer and an editor. I also developed a greater appreciation for the writing skills of others, and find myself more able to appreciate the talents of excellent writers.",
    "I learned how to write in a way that is clear, concise, genuine, and pointed. I also learned about great non fiction writers that I am excited to continue reading.",
    "I grew tremendously as a writer through this course and explored a genre of writing I hadnt seen before, which was short-form creative nonfiction. You learn the basic skill set of a good writer that is applicable across genres and disciplines.",
    "Developed a basis in reading and writing nonfiction - dramatically improved my writing skills and gained valuable insight into different approaches to writing that I've had no prior exposure to in other courses or in my personal reading",
    "I enjoyed learning various techniques and strategies employed by professional writers in forms of nonfiction writing like personal, profile, and humorous essays. I developed a unique voice in my own writing, and it was interesting to see how it took on different roles in these forms of nonfiction writing.",
    "Became a better writer",
    "I think I improved my reading of essays while improving my writing as a whole. Through reading other people's work, my control of language got better and I became more clear in my writing.",
    "Throughout this course, I learned how to be a better writer. This course gave me a multitude of skills that helped develop my style and voice."

   "comments": [
    "Feedback was extensive but could be confusing or overwhelming at times, in terms of contradicting suggestions or large influx from class workshopping of essays. Otherwise, the course was very strong in terms of structure, instruction, and material.",
    "Strengths: we covered a vast array of nonfiction works and learned how to write 5 different types of essays, which was cool. I also enjoyed the element of peer review and feedback. The weaknesses of this course could be that it is challenging to improve throughout the semester since each essay requires a different style of writing.",
    "The strengths of this course are the excellent comments that Pam leaves on your essays, as well as the reading load for each week. It is never too much work, but there is always enough reading that class discussions don't run out of steam. The essays are selected perfectly, with a wide variety, and only one or two out of dozens being anything but a joy to read.",
    "The round table discussions are very productive and engaging, and are especially helpful when going back and writing drafts to be submitted. I think if a few changes to the syllabus where made that we discussed in class the course would be even more engaging.",
    "I think the strengths of this course are the readings. You really learn how to write by emulating the techniques used by great essay writers in the readings for this class.",
    "Very strong - excellently designed and works well with each student",
    "I liked the very structured nature of the curriculum - it was very clear what was due when and what was expected of students, which really helped in planning ahead on completing readings and essays. Classes were also facilitated very well by my professor, who asked us very thought stimulating questions to push discussions forward. One very minor weakness was the class's reliance on conventional roundtable discussions for nearly all classes, which could have been varied a little more, but everything still worked overall.",
    "It was all great",
    "I think the setup of the course as a whole is a strength. The structure of essays as well as the reading and discussion make the course as good as it could be. There are only a few minor changes that could help this course. Although its hard to schedule, I think avoiding a first draft due a Tuesday after an essay could help. I think it would also be better if the order of the essays was changed. I feel like the personal essay is the quintessential essay and I would appreciate if it was the last essay. I understand wanting the humor essay last as it is the most difficult, but could it be second to last? I loved the workshop element of this class where we read each others essays.",
    "I think one strength about this course was the workshops for each assignment. Even though my work was only workshopped by the entire class for one of the essays, I learned a lot from reading other students work and hearing what people thought they should fix. It was especially helpful if I was having a similar problem in my own work. I also thought that many of the texts we read in class were both engaging and useful for our work in the class. One weakness I feel it has is the last essay we wrote. I know its different for each 120 class but I think the timeline is somewhat similar. It feels very tacked on to the end. I didn't have much time to work on it and for me, it ended up being the most challenging of all the essays we wrote. In the end, I wasn't very happy with it and wish I could've done something different, but I felt like I just didn't have the time."

   "comments": [
    "If you want to strengthen your writing or learn how to, as well as try new styles such as humor writing, yes.",
    "Yes! I think it is a great skill to be able to write about yourself and nonfiction in general. Also exposes you to lots of interesting articles and stories.",
    "Yes! ENGL120, as with the other intro English classes, is so enlightening because you learn in an intimate, seminar setting of where and how you can improve. This class has definitely helped my writing skills.",
    "Absolutely! As someone who wasn't all that interested in writing at the start of the course, I feel like I've grown a lot as a writer, and am actually considering taking another writing class just because of the experience I had in this one. If you think that creative writing is something there's even a small chance you might like to try, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I highly recommend this class to other students. I feel that my writing has significantly improved in just one semester and it was a really fun way to gain such crucial writing skills.",
    "It's a course that requires a lot of writing. If you don't have time to write five essays throughout the semester, don't take this class. Otherwise if you have time and want to improve your writing, this is a great course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is serious about writing as a craft and not just a means of academic expression. You go deeper than just setting up and proving an argument and learn what skill set is required of a professional writer.",
    "Yes - every student should have to take 120 before they graduate - even if you aren't a writer, 120 will make you examine and learn from your own personal experiences in a way that you couldn't otherwise",
    "Definitely - the class provides good exposure to modern day essays and writing, and the skills we discussed are transferrable to nearly all other forms of writing. It's a solid, well-structured course, and students won't fall behind unless they choose to skip readings (and even then, it's still possible to contribute and get something out of discussions). The assigned readings are generally short and sweet, and feel more manageable than reading several chapters of an entire book.",
    "For su43",
    "I would tell any student to take this course if they wanted to work on their writing. It is challenging, useful and rewarding. I feel this is probably the best introductory course in how to write.",
    "Yes, this has been one of the most fun courses I've taken at Yale so far. It's also very helpful in developing your personal writing skills"
