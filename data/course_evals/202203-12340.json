                "I really expanded and strengthened my devising skills and learned a lot about clowning. I learned a lot about where tudes come from and how to set them up, and I was also pushed out of my comfort zone with improv games and clowning exercises. I also learned how to balance a stick on my hand.",

                "Greater continuity between the two halves (how to implement what we learnt before October break in our devising) would have been nice. And more chance to work each etude we presented (even if that meant we presented less often) wouldve been great. A greater awareness of consent and consent-based practices wouldve made this course better.",
                "No weaknesses! Take this class if you have the chance, one of the most fulfilling I've taken at Yale.  Release your inner child!",
                "I particularly loved the first couple of weeks in the course and how much the games built the ensemble feel of the class and let us just let go and have fun for once! I found that the splitting into groups and having to bring in planned-out tudes every week felt challenging in a good way, and I also think having one long research paper due at the start of the semester was really helpful, as it made finals period and preparing for final performances much less stressful. In terms of weaknesses, I do think that the lengths of time we spent hearing feedback on each tude was sometimes too long and led to a lot of us disengagingI wondered if maybe focusing on one group per class or opening up the floor to hear feedback from the students as well would've helped this. I also would've loved to do more games specifically featuring improvisation at the start of the semester!",
                "The course was really interesting and I enjoyed getting to work with Dima Krymov. I felt like I grew as a person, not just as a theatremaker. Sometimes we spent too much time on discussing scenes rather than working on them, but overall I learned a lot as a director.",
                "Strengths: pretty much everything, it was a very special class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Yale",
                "The feedback process following the etudes was sometimes long and very repetitive. I wish we could've had more time in class to workshop our etudes independently instead of Krymov kind of just telling us exactly how to fix everything during his feedback immediately following our etude. I feel like our creative expression was limited because some groups elected to just do exactly what he said instead of experimenting and landing on something they liked."

It definitely pushed me and caused me to build more confidence in my ability to create and perform a scene, but it was also definitely a more intensive environment than many other studio classes at Yale. It's also one of very few courses with a focus on improvisation and devising, which I feel are invaluable skills for any theater maker!",
