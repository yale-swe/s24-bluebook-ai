   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was a very strong introduction to the major literary and artistic themes of Brazilian history, which I think was very well complemented by the fact that we actually read and saw books\/excerpts\/works of art representing the ideas we were studying.",
    "I think the biggest weakness of this course is the fact that it could be a course based in active discussion with a bit of lecturing if more concise but engaging readings were given. The biggest strength was that Professor Jackson knew the material very well.",
    "A lot of really important information, just wish we had more time to talk\/discuss in class so that lectures are more engaging.",
    "I think it would be simpler if the course was chronological. Also too many readings for the amount of time we had to do them. This course would be more engaging if the workload wasnt so daunting and if it was organized in a way that made more sense, since its so fast paced.",
    "The course provided some great information concerning the history of Brazil. I wish that race relations were spoken about more and that more current issues facing Brazil were spoken about.",
    "Strength: it covered a lot of parts of Brazilian history and culture. Weakness: there sometimes were too many readings that made the workload less manageable.",
    "I think that the course could potentially be improved if it took on more of a seminar-style approach than a lecture one. I enjoyed the readings that were assigned, the different perspectives that they exposed us to, but I would have appreciated the opportunity to voice my own pinions in class."

    "I would recommend it to a student who wants to get a broad overview of Brazilian cultural history through the lens of its majors writers and artists.",
    "Yes, because it was give them a chance to learn and be encouraged to explore more for themselves about a culture they are unfamiliar with.",
    "Because it is part of the summer program yes. But on its own I would have rather not taken it.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to learn more about a Latin American country that is not typically spoken about.",
    "Yes, the professor is great."
