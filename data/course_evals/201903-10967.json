   "comments": [
    "My writing was transformed, as was my editing. It is tough to put into words how transformative this course is. The readings made me excited to be a reader; the writing assignments and conferences made me excited to be a writer; the critiques and conferences made me excited to be an editor.",
    "My writing improved in this course more than it has in any other. I learned about different nonfiction writers who made important contributions to the field, and about editing others work and reflecting on my own.",
    "I learned to write, to love and appreciate my own writing and the writing of my peers, to edit constructively, to workshop efficiently, to collaborate and set the tone for supportive and engaged classroom setting, and to learn simply from experience and exposure.",
    "How to chip away at a big project and stay motivated, how to write A LOT, learned more about how my personal writing process works, how to revise, learned a LOT about grammar (now I know the difference between \"which\" and \"that\" and when to use commas and when not to), a ton of writing tips (both from Anne and the authors we read), how to stay organized, how to navigate life as a writer after college, how to get to the heart of an idea and base my whole essay around it, how to incorporate critique while still staying true to myself as a writer, how to interview someone, how to write creative nonfiction\/long-form journalism, how to edit\/critique someone else's work thoughtfully",
    "How to craft and edit long-form journalism pieces",
    "How to write, creative non fiction, ethics, strategies, lessons from fantastic authors, reporting strategies, more!!",
    "Concrete tools for becoming a better editor for myself and others",
    "This class made me a better writer and editor. I used to be absolutely terrified of fairly critiquing my own work, but thankfully this class forces you to look at your work and examine it honestly. Anne's conferences are super helpful and you will learn that the \"conference mindset\" will serve usefully on future writing endeavors. Care is the word that comes to mind. I learned to care for my work more."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is, without question, the best course I've ever taken. I emerged from it a far more confident and capable writer, but that doesn't even begin to capture the wonders of this course. I felt reinvigorated in my enjoyment of writing and reading, not to mention of life in general. \r\nMy only recommendation for how the course could be improved would be if it included a slightly greater emphasis on giving each other constructive feedback, rather than just praise, in the canvas comments.",
    "Strengths: very tight-knit class, very high class engagement, very engaged professor, amazing assignments, very thorough feedback\r\nWeaknesses: you need to have a very high investment in the course to get out what you want",
    "Strengths: Anne goes WAY above and beyond to help her students (hour-long conferences each week, helps you compile a list of personal pitfalls for you as a writer, helpful handouts about grammar and the writing process, email response times of under an hour usually, guidance for your life after the class), we had a super supportive and strong class community (e.g. I made genuine friends from this class, and met a wonderful community of writers), the Yellow Pages piece was an amazing project (you spend about six weeks profiling someone with an interesting occupation that you find in the New Haven Yellow Pages), the course is well-structured to help you navigate the YP reporting process and grow as a writer, you get to send a question to the authors you read in class or have them come visit in person (like we sent questions to Gay Talese and Ted Conover. Gay Talese let us read an early copy of his book and give him feedback!), classtime is really fun and useful (I never felt like any part of class time was a waste). I worried that this class would feel competitive and Anne would make her favorites known, but it never felt that way. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this class is A LOT OF WORK (imagine what you think a lot of work is and then double it). It felt like the work of a one-semester thesis and then some. I took four classes (and Anne asks you to take her course Credit\/D) and it STILL felt like a lot, mostly because I loved this class so much that I WANTED to spend hours doing work for it. So the workload can be a weakness if you a.) have an incompatible class schedule, b.) are writing your thesis that term, or c.) end up not really caring about writing creative nonfiction but still have to spend a ton of time doing it. Depending on who is in your class, it could also potentially be a toxic environment. We had an amazing group my year, but there is a certain rigor and competition inherent to a selective writing class that could maybe turn this course into a pressure cooker if your other classmates aren't totally down to earth and awesome. There is sometimes competition for the sake of competition (e.g. sending Anne an application to have dinner with a visiting author), so if the people in your class are annoying then that competition could maybe get toxic. Also, if you're a private person, this class can sometimes get a little uncomfortable. Your first three essays are personal essays about some aspect of your life, and during conferences, Anne might probe to get at more details about your life. This is usually just to make the essay stronger\/help you get to the emotional heart of it, but it can feel uncomfortable and a little voyeuristic at times. This isn't a reason not to take the class, but just something to know. \r\n\r\nIt's both a strength and weakness that this class can easily take over your life. I probably spent about 100 hours working on my Yellow Pages piece, which is ridiculous but was also really helpful for me as a writer. Sometimes I was super overwhelmed by this class and felt like the amount of work it required of me was just too much, but in the end, I was so grateful I did it. You will learn more from this class than probably any writing course you've taken at Yale, but you will also give it more than you have ever given a class. Like, my friends and suitemates knew all about my Yellow Pages piece by the end of the semester, that's how much it took over my life. But, it was so worth it. I grew so much as a writer, and now I feel like I have a wonderful teacher and ally in Anne. She really is in her students' corners in a meaningful way.",
    "This course should count for two Yale College credits. It is a ton of work and expectations are very high. Anne encourages everyone to take it Credit\/D\/Fail and you probably should if you can--otherwise you'll be very, very stressed about the workload. A major strength of this course is that you get to have one-on-one meetings with Anne all the time (almost once a week for about an hour each time, except when you are in the reporting stage of the final). She gives incredibly detailed and thoughtful feedback. The only person who spends more time on this class than the students is Anne. Also, you get to communicate with very cool\/famous writers. The readings are really carefully selected and are almost uniformly great. The one downside to this class' long-term success is that the actual seminars can feel a little bit rehearsed. There isn't as much room for new thoughts from students as I would have liked.",
    "This course is perfect. It is a masterpiece in seminar instruction. Anne is the most dedicated and passionate professor and youd be lucky if you get this opportunity to learn from her.",
    "The strength of the course is you will most definitely become a better writer. Anne makes sure to grant a lot of individual care to everyone and you really get in what you put out. The only weakness is only a semi-weakness: the conferences are very often so just make sure you have to squeeze it and have the right energy."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you want to write, take this course.",
    "Yes yes yes, 100x yes. This is the best course Ive taken at Yale. It will improve your writing and improve your thinking and just be an amazing experience along the way.",
    "Any student who has any interest in writing non-fiction, reporting, journalism, or just writing at all simply must take this course if they get the chance.",
    "See my long note about strengths\/weaknesses for more info, but overall yes, I would. That person though would need to know the incredible amount of work this class will require of them and be serious about improving as a writer. They don't necessarily need to be sold on writing nonfiction, but they do need to really care about writing in general. I came to this course with a fiction background and wasn't passionate about nonfiction writing at first per say, but I was super passionate about writing, and that carried me through the class. If you aren't super into writing, this class and its workload might not be for you. Also, I would only recommend this class to someone who can build their schedule around it. This class needs to be the main class of your semester, in order to give it the time and energy it requires. It's one of the best structured and most instructive courses I've ever taken. I think I've learned more about writing in this class than all the other writing courses I've taken combined, honestly. Anne is also an incredible professor and a great person to have in your life. So, yes, I'd recommend it, but they should be prepared to work work work and love it.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to put in a lot of work and bare yourself emotionally lol",
    "Definitely. Every ounce of the extra workload is absolutely rewarding. if you want to become a writer, take this class.",
    "Absolutely take this course! Its helped me sharpen my voice immensely.",
    "Yes, if you want to become a better writer. It's a hard way, but it's the right way!"
