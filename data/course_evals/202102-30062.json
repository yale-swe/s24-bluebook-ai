                "The first section of this coursewhich focused on C programmingwas fantastic. Super well-organized and engaging. The Arduino part, while still super fascinating, felt like it could have benefitted from a longer course. Maybe some adjustments could have been made to fit the subject matter to a smaller time frame.",

                "The course had a clear syllabus and adequate materials. However, it was hard to cover all the basic things of C programming and Arduino. In fact, it took too long time to inform the basic things which could be learned on the own, and lectures assigned to Arduino was cut down. I suggest that this course be more direct to a clear aim, such as focusing on either C or Arduino.",
