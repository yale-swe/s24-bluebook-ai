                "I learned to speak about legal manners and about legal terms in Spanish.",
                "I developed a significant understanding of the history of the law and its application.",
                "This class was a great way to continue hearing and reading Spanish alongside my other coursework. I most appreciated the constant exposure to new concepts in Spanish -- I think my vocabulary grew because we were learning about elements of the law. I also think it was great exposure to different kinds of accents\/\/speaking styles through the selected media clips.",
                "My vocabulary regarding specific topics was expanded.",

                "The only thing is that Prof Carreras is a tad soft when she speaks, which with a mask and in Spanish made lectures hard to follow at times.",
                "Strengths: Professor Carreras is so sweet and accommodating.  The syllabus is filled with lots of interesting topics, especially for pre-laws.  Very flexible in assignments and grading.  Weaknesses: As a non-native speaker, I did not feel like there was a ton of opportunity for me to \"catch up\" to my native-speaking classmates.  This is an L5 class, but the disparity in Spanish skills is still pretty apparent.  Would have appreciated a bit more structure: classroom debates, simulations, etc.  Class periods are also long -- 75 minutes is a lot for a class like this",
                "Fun class, you learn about the continental legal system and how it compares to the Common Law system of law. It is not too much work, but keeps you engaged on a weekly basis.",
                "Excellent relaxed course. Many individuals were not engaged though.",
                "Professor Carreras is a gem thats the classs biggest strength!",
                "Strengths -- The weekly written assignments were about really interesting topics\/\/cases\/\/legal concepts. I think I got the most out of this course by doing the weekly assignments because they helped me think critically and put my ideas on paper in Spanish.\r\nWeaknesses -- The lecture format was not always super engaging. I think classes would have been beneficial to the entire group if they had been more discussion-based. We had a few classes like this at the beginning of the semester.",
                "Open convo, pretty chill. Not very structured and not a lot of info retained.",
                "Everything was great",
                "The weekly assignments were helpful in practicing my Spanish and the debates were interesting. A weakness was that there were not enough opportunities for discussion as the class was a little too big."

                "Yes! It's a super easy class that I felt was still rewarding. The work is minimal, but the material is still interesting if you pay attention. Great to take as a 5th class during an otherwise busy semester! I cannot emphasize this enough: this class never stressed me out. Not once.",
