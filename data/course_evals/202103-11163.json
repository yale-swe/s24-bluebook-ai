I most appreciated the constant exposure to new concepts in Spanish -- I think my vocabulary grew because we were learning about elements of the law. I also think it was great exposure to different kinds of accents//speaking styles through the selected media clips.",

Very flexible in assignments and grading.  Weaknesses: As a non-native speaker, I did not feel like there was a ton of opportunity for me to \"catch up\" to my native-speaking classmates.  This is an L5 class, but the disparity in Spanish skills is still pretty apparent.  Would have appreciated a bit more structure: classroom debates, simulations, etc.  Class periods are also long -- 75 minutes is a lot for a class like this",
                "Fun class, you learn about the continental legal system and how it compares to the Common Law system of law. It is not too much work, but keeps you engaged on a weekly basis.",
                "Excellent relaxed course. Many individuals were not engaged though.",
                "Professor Carreras is a gem thats the classs biggest strength!",
                "Strengths -- The weekly written assignments were about really interesting topics//cases//legal concepts. I think I got the most out of this course by doing the weekly assignments because they helped me think critically and put my ideas on paper in Spanish.\r\nWeaknesses -- The lecture format was not always super engaging. I think classes would have been beneficial to the entire group if they had been more discussion-based. We had a few classes like this at the beginning of the semester.",

Great to take as a 5th class during an otherwise busy semester! I cannot emphasize this enough: this class never stressed me out. Not once.",
