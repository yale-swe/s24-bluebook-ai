                "I think that the format of the course, where you go through a slideshow during class, is not particularly conducive to my learning. The days when there were technical difficulties and we ended up taking a more discussion-based approach were more engaging and I felt that the material stuck with me better. Additionally, I think that having people act out interactions rather than simply reading dialogue would go a long way in terms of helping students solidify the language in a more authentic way. As far as coursework goes, I think the course textbook and homework therein (Ubungen) are absolutely useless and did not help me gain an understanding of the language in any way. Throughout the course, I felt that the material we were covering was completely within reach of my understanding, but I never got a solid grasp on a lot of it because I felt that there was no way to really nail it down and practice on homeworks.",
                "This course helped me learn so much, and I had a lot of fun in the process. In terms of improvement, I think grading based more on effort than correctness would be nice! But overall a great course!",
                "The professor who taught this course was absolutely phenomenal and I would recommend her to anyone looking to take a German course at Yale. However, I absolutely hated the text book we used.",
                "The course is taught at a manageable pace, so developing an understanding of the language is not too difficult. Class lecture slides are helpful, but specific topics are not organized in a way that makes them easy to look back on. One of the main drawbacks is that some of the work outside of class does not feel in line with what is taught. So it can often seem like you are just doing busy work that is not really developing your understanding of the language. I think it could be more beneficial if more of the homework was specifically directed towards discussed topics so they become more ingrained."
