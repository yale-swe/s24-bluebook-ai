                "Understanding of key Buddhist concepts (the four noble truths, samsara\/reincarnation, anatman\/non-self, dana\/giving, nirvana\/enlightenment), their evolution, and their relationship to one another. Familiarity with important Buddhist stories, parables, and metaphors. Study of Mahayana Buddhist concepts and comparison to early Buddhism: Are these ideas a continuation of the original ideas or a contradiction?",
                "Learned about foundations of Buddhist thought: this entailed mainly reading a lot of primary Buddhist texts, from the early Buddhist texts to later Mahayana texts, and engaging with them on a theoretical\/philosophical level. Some ideas: cycle of rebirth, non-self, and the Buddhist path to enlightenment, what that means, etc.",
                "The basic principles of ancient Buddhism, the life story of the Buddha, and Pali to English translations of key Buddhist terms.

I learned basic understanding of the Pali language, how to decipher ancient Buddhist texts, and how to attribute religious principles to mainstream lifestyles.",

                "Strengths: comprehensive yet succinct overview of the religion\r\nWeaknesses: overly classical; material was a bit dry. Not sure why the emphasis on Mahayana and not Tibetan \/ other lineages",
                "I think it begins in a very engaging way and becomes less so as the semester progresses.",
                "Strengths: super engaging and interesting \r\nWeaknesses: if you missed a class it was a little difficult to catch up on notes from just the lecture slides, so you need to have friends in the class",
                "Strengths: Lectures summarize and explain the readings well; the workload is very fair and material is engaging; section is also helpful and important to help students' understanding of the concepts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly, none. There is nothing I'd change about this course; I really enjoyed it.",
                "Strengths: I thought the content was interesting and the lectures were fair. The class was very focused, in that professor Greene knew what he wanted to talk about each lecture, so each class felt very purposeful. Professor Greene was really effective at drawing out the content of the texts we discussed and their significance, and discussing ways in which we might reflect on the ideas in our own lives, which was really thoughtful and which really inspired me to think about my life in different ways. The workload also wasn't too much, a couple very light exams and a paper, which were all fine, and the readings were generally not too heavy either. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there were some missed opportunities for more engagement with Buddhism, for example when we discussed meditation I was surprised professor Greene didn't have us take a minute to try and still our breathing and meditate, and similar such small activities which would have helped me understand deeper on a practical level. I know the course wasn't particularly about Buddhist practice and such, but I think some of these small activities could have greatly enhanced learning. I wasn't particularly a fan of the midterms\/exams either (since some amount of them was just regurgitating definitions and I don't like the idea of timed essays either), but then again I probably wouldn't have particularly liked a second take-home paper either, so maybe this is just me.",
                "I felt strong in memorizing Pali vocabulary and learning about the basic ancient belief system of the Buddha. I struggled with comprehending the dense texts, as the course ended I felt much stronger in this field.",
                "I really enjoyed the course!",
                "Professor Greene's lectures were very interesting. The class was super chill, and I never really felt too stressed or anything.",
                "Really great organization of the assigned readings and lectures on Canvas. Seriously appreciated that I could find materials for each week in one place. Prof is a good lecturer and explains readings well.",
                "Strengths: interesting material, not too difficult to follow, taught in a good, organized and linear manner, good professor, not too much work",
                "not super engaging material",
                "I really enjoyed this course. The lectures were extremely interesting and engaging, the readings were manageable, and the course was a good mix of terminology, history, philosophy, and other helpful framings that assisted my understanding of Buddhism.",
                "Pros: Engaging lectures, easy-to-follow course structure, straightforward assignments (1 vocab quiz, 1 midterm, 1 essay, final, and weekly reading assignments), and great TAs\r\nCons: None!"

It was refreshing to wrestle with concepts I had never studied before and a nice break from my usual course load. Professor Greene is a great lecturer and explains the readings well. He is funny and engaging and makes the course very approachable. The workload is very manageable. I was almost never stressed but very engaged in this class the whole semester!",
                "This is a nice, chill course. As professor Greene said on the first day, it's nothing that's particularly practical to your own life in a material sense, but I thought it was a fun class which made me reflect and think about my life from different angles, so if you're interested in Buddhism or want some spiritual\/intellectual engagement without too much work, this course is for you.",
                "Definitely! It is not a class that would be taken usually by many  as a Western institution, Yale culture somewhat always pushes us to dive into the depths of the Western canon. Id really encourage another student to take this class and be exposed to Buddhism.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Buddhism. If you are a Buddhist or happen to already know a lot about the Buddhist tradition, this class will probably seem pretty rudimentary; however, as someone who came in knowing very little about Buddhism, I found the class to be interesting and informative.",
                "Yes, definitely take this class! You will learn so much about Buddhism and yourself. This class was the highlight of my semester :)",

                "Not really, unless you are super interested in Buddhism. But there are probably better courses",
                "Yes - this class is interesting, organized, and straightforward to succeed in. No religious studies \/ philosophy background needed."
