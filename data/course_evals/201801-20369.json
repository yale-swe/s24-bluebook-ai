   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I gained a greater understanding of the formal elements of art and how to use these elements to critique both the visual and conceptual aspects of an artwork. I learned how to use these formal elements to support and to enhance my works, as well as to convey messages, feelings, and ideas.",
    "Through this course, I have learned color theory in its applications with art. Having come from Basic Drawing, a class i which color was prohibited, this class as allowed me to cultivate my understanding of color and the power it holds on the perception of a work of art.",
    "In this class, basic visual arts concepts were covered, such as line, shape, value, color, composition, and space. I learned how to arrange images in a particular space (whether 2D or 3D) in a way that is visually appealing and interesting to the eye. Additionally, I gained insight into image production, and technologies such as virtual reality and software (like Photoshop).",
    "You learn about the different principles\/elements of art including color theory, tones, shapes, and etc. You get see the elements in action with each project. Each project, whether in class or for homework, varies in the medium used, so it's a very good way to see which media you are most comfortable using and experiment with materials you haven't used before.",
    "Rather than learning clear cut art techniques, this class was far more helpful in helping me develop an eye for composition. It's good to stand out, and it's important to know what most catches a person's attention when art is so subjective.",
    "I learned vocabulary for talking about visual elements of art pieces. We worked with varying mediums which was helpful for understanding concepts underlying both 2D and 3D art.",
    "This course gives you an in-depth overview of various mediums within the art major, from photography, to photoshop, to sculpture and mixed media live presentations. You learn how to navigate these mediums but also how to incorporate basic artistic techniques and building blocks into different mediums. This course teaches you what your strengths are within the art major and about basic color theory and making collage art.",
    "I learned about other art mediums that I would have never considered using myself in my own work. The class did a great job exposing students to new forms and new technologies to implement in art."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is an exciting survey that oscillates between formality and play. It's very hands-on and a comfortable environment for those just beginning in the arts, or who do not have a formal understanding of art. It is demanding but Anahita is a supportive and thoughtful instructor.",
    "Strengths of this course include a good overview of basic artmaking concepts, and a solid introduction to various traditional and non-traditional media. \r\n\r\nI would say that the major weakness of this course was dull feedback. I felt that the critiques, as much as they relied on both students and professor\/TA alike, were unhelpful because they centered mostly on describing and interpreting the pieces rather than examining their grasp of the concepts they were meant to represent. Though I can say that my artmaking skills improved throughout the course, this improvement would be better attributed to practice rather than constructive feedback from the in-class critiques. I found it difficult to follow class projects when the criteria were unclear.",
    "The strengths of this course is that it exposes you to working with various mediums. This, especially for potential art majors, is really helpful when thinking about which concentrations to pick. We have done work on paper (like collaging, printmaking (to some extent) and working with lines\/color\/tone), digitally (photoshop), and sculpture. The weaknesses of this course is that it's very time consuming (but I suppose that's a given being an art class), and sometimes the projects can be more tedious and annoying than fun.",
    "I loved how experimental this class was. The projects were all structured, but free enough to allow me to develop my own work. The professor's one-on-one meetings were helpful in helping me figure out what worked best for me. The only weakness could be the long length of this class, and the dispersed amount of effort that students put into it.",
    "The course gives you a lot of direction and support and opportunities for your work to be reviewed, but the prompts are fairly prescriptive. This course could be improved by allowing students to develop their own assignments from the very beginning, using the different mediums.",
    "The class was great at showing students new mediums and thoroughly explaining how to use those mediums to them! No student was ever lost!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. For those who aren't comfortable in drawing, this is a great opportunity to engage with the rudimentary aspects of art on a higher level. The vocabulary and assignments are demanding but hard work is rewarded regardless of how \"technically correct\" the final product is. Expect to spend anywhere between 4-7 hours a week on projects, but the more you put in, the more you will get out of it.",
    "Yes, I  would  recommend this course to another student. This course covers the practices of collage, graphic design, color theory, sculpture, and video, which gives a broad view of all that the School of Art has to offer. If students are looking to investigate their interest in art, this course would be an excellent start.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but only if they are ready to challenge themselves with an excess of freedom and little guidance. This is a decent (and required) introductory class for prospective art majors, but students who are looking for an art class in which to explore principles of art and design in very concrete terms should look elsewhere.",
    "For non-art majors, this class is a good way to experiment with different materials and push your creativity, but remember that it can be very time consuming. For art majors, you have no choice. This class is a pre-req.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student to foster a better understanding of art. Art isn't just about talent or ability to create, but ability to evoke emotion from the audience. If an artist is longing to tap into this skill, this class is perfect.",
    "Yes, if you are genuinely interested in creating and talking about art. This course is a good way to get familiar with the critique format.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the exposure to other art forms really helps potential art majors gain a grasp of the many mediums they could potentially concentrate in other than the mediums they already like!"
