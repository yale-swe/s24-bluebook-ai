                "Strengths: The course is unique in that it allows for an immersive experience depending on the lab you are in. You really get involved in an independent project with experiments, and as a result, I grew a lot in terms of scientific inquiry. I was able to gain some experience in making a poster, presenting, and writing.\r\nWeaknesses: Outside of lab, the course is almost nonexistent. I wish that the course had more structure, even if that means having meetings together as seniors in the intensive major to discuss best ways to write and present science or to be exposed to other topics in science. We could have each other read our reports and give feedback throughout the semester so that we have a better idea of how to improve our writing. Furthermore, it would have been better perhaps to be able to write our final report as a thesis rather than being limited to 15 pages, double-spaced. This would allow us to include more of our research. The current structure of the course makes the experience and feedback you receive very heavily dependent on the lab you are in since no feedback comes from the professors or other students."

                "I would recommend the course but only if they really love science research and have a lab they really love working in. The >20 hour a week requirement is a huge time commitment and very draining. The large amount of time spent allows you to go deep on a research project and learn a variety of techniques in a hands-on and independent manner that not a lot of courses have. I was able to improve my experimental design strategies, data interpretation, and presentation skills. However, the course could have more structure and feedback to improve our learning experiences.",
