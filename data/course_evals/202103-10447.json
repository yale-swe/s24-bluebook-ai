                "Humanitarian interventions exposed me to a great array of perspectives on ideas and practices within the field of humanitarianism. It was a course that allowed for open discussion and offered new perspectives with every session of it, thus allowing students to challenge the views they had on issues, but also the views they developed during the course. In that way, I was able to formulate opinions through understanding these different perspectives, and being able to look both at the idealism and pragmatism of a lot of  the topics we discussed. The readings also taught me a lot about the behind the scenes work that happens within the humanitarian field, and how difficult it is at times for questions within the field to have a concrete answer."

                "The course welcomes discussion and different opinions, and Professor Panter-Brick ensures to foster a welcoming environment for all opinions to be heard. The readings are very informative and offer great discussion starters for the class sessions. The class sessions are lead with ease and there is no stress for students to constantly be talking or express opinions on things they do not feel comfortable talking about. The class sessions had a good balance of student discussions and exploration of different topics through either guest lectures or student-led presentations. It might be good for the course sessions to have a bit more structure and organization. At times, sessions felt a bit floaty, and so providing some structure could significantly help with that."

                "Absolutely! The course was very engaging and informative and offered unique experiences to be exposed to a great diversity of ideas within the field of humanitarianism. The course strikes a good balance in between talking about notions and ideas and anchoring down to case studies and pragmatic applications of perspectives. In doing so, it avoids being a philosophy course on practices in humanitarianism, and allows students to understand the realities that humanitarians in the field many times experience. If you are interested in gaining a realistic perspective into the work of humanitarian aid workers, and being exposed to very cool speakers then take this course. Also, Professor Panter-Brick is such a kind-hearted professor and deeply cares for her students!"
