                "I came into this class not knowing any Italian at all. Then, after just one semester of this class, I was able to give a 20 minute presentation in Italian. Obviously it wasn't perfect, but it is really incredible how much progress you can make over a single semester. You learn approx 3,000 words of vocabulary, as well was every verb tense in the Italian language. Fantastic class, fantastic professor, highly recommend.",
                "Basic understanding of Italian language and grammar, both comprehension and ability to express myself.",
                "I gained a grasp of a wide variety of vocabulary, an understanding of basic grammatical structures, an appreciation for Italian culture in areas pertaining to music, food, history, movies and more. I learned basic conversational skills and the ability to understand written work as well as my own compositional skills.",
                "We calculated, and I think it came out to about the 2,000ish most common Italian words and phrases--far from fluency but enough to hold a well-formatted conversation about most topics for a significant period of time. Looking at the syllabus for L3 and L4, I can confirm that you learn essentially all of the grammar one can expect to see throughout the entire Italian sequence.",
                "Learned a great deal of Italian (vocab, grammar, culture etc).",
                "I learned how to speak intermediate Italian. I spoke every day, learned probably 100 new words every day, learned grammar every day, and stretched my brain like I havent in a while. I also learned how to study every day again which I havent gotten in college with class only once or twice a week.",
                "This course gives back what you put in. I feel I got a very proficient working knowledge of the Italian language. Lessons also included points of Italian culture which were engaging and useful.",

                "AMAZING CLASS!!!!! Daily quizzes make sure you don't fall behind in the material. No weaknesses.",
                "This course is incredibly strong in getting students to learn L1 and L2 Italian in the course of one semester, I do not know that I could come up with any ways to change it as it is incredibly well structured.",
                "The course moves quickly which I think pertains to both its weaknesses and its strengths. In a matter of 4 months the students in this course are able to speak in Italian and would do just fine walking the streets of Italy. I feel like the quick pace allows for the coverage of a lot of material that allows for this, but simultaneously, if language isn't something that comes naturally to a student, the pace can make it difficult to keep up and break down pieces for a deeper understanding.",
                "Strengths: essentially everything. This class is just about the only one I would ever devote 10 hours of in-class instruction and waking up every day for a 9 AM for. Weakness: 2 credits is without a doubt underselling the workload for this class if you want to succeed.",
                "Great teacher and teaching, very engaging classes and fun projects.",
                "the main strength is Michael. He is the best instructor Ive ever had, and is incredibly attentive, helpful, and kind. He makes language learning so simple and accessible and so so enjoyable!!! No weaknesses really, maybe a little lack of structure in the second half of the course.",
                "Strengths - I have to say the professor is the absolute greatest asset of this course. If Michael is teaching it, take it. I also appreciated the flipped classroom method Michael used as it helped me see vocabulary words multiple times within a day before needing to use them in class. \r\nWeaknesses - It had to end. I truly loved this course so much.",

                "You need to take this class. This class was truly the highlight of my year. Going to class was really fun and engaging, and it's a fantastic way to measure how much you are learning. It can be a little intimidating at first, but stick with it because you'll get the hang of it. There are daily vocabulary\/grammar quizzes and weekly tests, but they're really nothing to worry about. Class itself is really engaging, and we also watched two movies in Italian, went to the YUAG, and filmed various videos throughout the semester. It definitely helps to have experience with a romance language (for context, I took Spanish growing up and took an L5 class here my freshman year, and I think most people in the class had similar backgrounds). Also if you can take this class with a friend, definitely do that, but you'll also become close with the other people in the class. Michael is absolutely amazing and really cares about his students, and he always finds a way to make class engaging. This class is a big time commitment, but honestly it doesn't really feel that bad once you're doing it, and the class period itself tends to fly by. Ciaooooo",
                "Yes I would reccommend this course to anyone interested in learning Italian who is willing to commit to it.",
                "All of my classmates really enjoyed the course. I struggled in the class due to my own difficulties with grasping the language but still found it enjoyable. I feel that the speed of the course is good for people who have taken a language before, people with time to do lots of vocab studying and projects on the weekends, and people who have a personal reason for taking Italian specifically as it will motivate them. If someone is to take this course, I highly recommend they take it with Michael Farina, he is the reason I made it through the class. He is exuberant and an amazing person. He makes sure we have fun while still maintaining high standards. His class is wonderful because he creates such a light atmosphere that students don't fear to make mistakes which allows them to stumble through and learn rather than being so focused on being perfect every time.",
                "Take it.",
                "Yes- well taught, fun, and very satisfying end result.",
                "If youre clicking through the reviews of this course with the smallest shred of interest, TAKE IT. EMAIL MICHAEL AND MEET HIM. GO TO THE FIRST WEEK. I am so happy I took this class and I feel like I got more out of it than any other class Ive taken at Yale. Dont be scared off by the workload  the first few days were super hard to adjust to and then you get in the swing of it and its the same amount of work everyday. Theres also no other class where you can map your growth and learning as easily. You literally learn to speak Italian conversationally by spring break, and know every tense by the end of the course. Take this class!!!",
                "Absolutely take this course if Michael is teaching it! This was the most enjoyable course I took all year. It looks long when you first begin but it truly became the thing that I was waking up for. The energy in the class and the rapid pace are all conducive to great satisfaction in seeing your Italian proficiency rapidly improve. But I will say, you need to be prepared to put in a hefty amount of work for this class. There is a lot of vocabulary, so plan for time to study.",
                "Absolutelyone of the great joys of my time at Yale was taking this course.",
                "Tl;dr: Oh my gosh 1000% yes!! I know it seems crazy, and it is, but if you want to learn Italian it is totally worth it because its really fun and the professor is amazing!\r\n\r\nTo state the obvious, yes it is insane110 minutes four days a week of class (Fridays are thankfully asynchronous), a test every single week, a quiz every single day. This means for every evening you are learning 30-50 new vocab terms plus a new grammar concept or two and being quizzed on them the very next morning.\r\n\r\nBUT! It is all 100% percent worth it because Michael is probably the single best teacher I have ever had and a joy to be around every day. Every day he walks in at 9:25am with an enthusiastic BUONGIORNO! and you feel excited to learn some Italian. He somehow keeps the energy up for the entire two hours even when everyone is tired. And you learn so fast that as long as youre able to keep up (which yes, will take a lot of time every day), you feel so rewarded and accomplished by the fact youre actually able to say things and know every single Italian conjugation and almost every grammar concept in 4 months.\r\n\r\nTo clarify the workload: I would say it is definitely more work than any other class I have taken, but actually a quite reasonable amount of work considering its 2 credits (and two language credits). Theres also almost zero actual homework besides the weekly projects (which are really fun and collaborative), which means that you get to study in the way that works for you and skip all the boring exercises most language classes have! For me, that meant tons and tons of Quizlet. Just make sure you find some way. It will likely be less difficult if you already know another romance language, although this is not necessary. \r\n\r\nOne other thing: besides being an awesome teacher, Michael also wins our hearts over with free food. Frequently we would all head over to Common Grounds during our break and he would buy us coffee. One time, we went to Donut Crazy for donuts. Another time, we were learning about simple Italian cafe sandwiches called tramezzini and then suddenly he pulled out a bag with a cutting board and all the ingredients to make some delicious sandwiches. One afternoon, he took us all out to Zaneli Pizza for a really nice meal and Italian conversation.\r\n\r\nSummarize the strengths and weaknesses of the instructor. In what ways was their teaching effective and in what ways could their teaching be improved?\r\n\r\nMichael has been doing this for decades and has maximally fun and efficient language learning down to a science. We have a great time. He is at the same time never afraid to try something new, like having ChatGPT write us stories using a certain tense for us to practice with. No weaknesses."
