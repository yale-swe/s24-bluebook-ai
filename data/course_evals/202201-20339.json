                "I learnt how to write much better. I found it much easier to write essays after taking this class.",
                "I learned how to write with concision. In high school, I always thought my writing was good and naturally thought it would transfer over to college. This, however, quickly turned out to be a false assumption. Taking this class taught me proper writing style. Moreover, it was extremely fun to learn about all of the different cultural histories covered in the syllabus. If you are even remotely interested in global history - take this class.",
                "It was a great introductory History seminar. You learn a lot as a first-year like how to read texts appropriately, how to write concisely, etc. You get familiarised with the format of a seminar.",
                "I learned how to write well.",
                "learned a lot about history, ancient historians. Learned how to refine and polish my writing skills, as well as public speaking.",
                "This course will absolutely teach you to be a better writer. It will help you be more concise, more aptly state your thoughts, and communicate academically. In terms of the course content, I was really intrigued by comparing and contrasting historians over different historical periods. This is not a memorization class. It's the study of history rather than the history itself.",
                "I learned a great deal about the tradition of history writing and the debates around what constitutes good history.",
                "I learned about some ancient historians (Herodotus, Polybius, Sima Qian, and al-Tabari). Prof. Hansen designed the course to cover useful skills for history classes (or any classes) going forward---how to do history reading, write an in-class essay, take reading notes, and improve my writing. At the beginning of the class, I learned more about how to use Yale's libraries and think about plagiarism. I learned skills that I think everyone should have the chance to learn."

                "It is a great course with very interesting historians in the syllabus.",
                "The class is excellently paced. Professor Hansens syllabus is followed to a T right from the start, so its incredibly easy to plan your schedule ahead of time. Also, she is very flexible with assignment deadlines if you happen to have conflicts. Most importantly though, I really enjoyed how much personal engagement there was in the class, as the small seminar setting facilitates plenty of opportunities to share your own voice.",
                "No weakness.",
                "strength is that the classmates are really fun and nice. my classmates and I got a long really well and joke around a lot. This is partly due to our class field trip to NYC, where we got to bond and know each other better.\r\n\r\nweakness is that professor hansen can be a little stubborn/narrow minded. She is very particular about certain views and ideas, and that can translate towards her grading on papers, assignments, etc.\r\nanother weakness is that i feel like theres not enough time to right papers. we usually only have one draft for each paper so it is really make or break.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professor (Professor Hansen), promotes good reading and study habits, will really break you out of your shell if seminars daunt you as a first year\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: often feels as though there's a right answer you're trying to guess at, particularly during discussions, which can be discouraging at first",
                "I think the course was stronger when we focused on the bigger picture. When we just focused on one chapter in one historian's work, it felt like there wasn't much connection to the rest of the course, and it was harder to know what we were supposed to be taking away. I think the course would be more cohesive if it picked more specific questions to focus on answering as the semester progressed.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Hansen--she really cares and is super helpful. I think the reading selections are really neat. We get to do so many different things in the course--write history essays, do debates, public speaking, write book reviews, and lead discussions. I think we learn a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think it was valuable to have students leading discussions, but I was never sure if I got everything out of the reading that I would have if Prof. Hansen had led discussions. For example, I didn't always know what historical techniques to take away from the ancient historian readings."

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student interested in improving their writing skills.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to another Yale student! Coming in as a STEM major with little history background, I had an absolute blast with this class.",
                "Yes, it is invaluable to someone taking History and you learn a lot.",
                "Yes. I became a much better reader and writer.",
                "i would recommend it to people seeking a community of students. the actual material is somewhat interesting and professor hansen is a nice person but not the best in terms of grades.",
                "To a first year? Absolutely, particularly if you want a broader overview of the study of history (rather than a particular historical topic, as many other first year seminars are). Professor Hansen is great. You'll get as much out of this class as you put into it, and it's structured to help first years adapt to college expectations (how do you read concisely? how do seminars work? what kind of writing is expected of you?)",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who felt they needed to build their writing from the ground up, especially if they struggle with clarity or structure. Well-formed writers would probably be better off taking higher level courses.",
                "Yes! I loved this class! You get to do so many different things (public speaking, debating, writing, go to the Met, and of course class discussions), and you learn so much. Prof. Hansen is undoubtedly a harsh critic, but she cares a lot about helping you (she once held office hours on a Saturday!) So go to office hours, start papers early and discuss them with her while writing and after writing, and ask her for life advice. Also I think there are chances to make friends in the class. Grab a meal with one of your classmates sometime."
