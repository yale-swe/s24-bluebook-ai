                "Close investigation of various queer productions (novels, academic papers, art, photography) of the modernist era/early 20th/late 19th century. I learned how queerness developed in the modernist era and how those developments provided a foundation for later queer life and activism, and how queerness and race intersected in the production of moderns and knowledge.",
                "Critical reading skills, seminar participation, source scouting, and creating an enriched history with interconnecting themes",
                "This course was incredible! I learned all about the formations of queer identities in the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries in the United States. Prof. Herring was incredible and had such a wealth of resources to share with us. Class was so well structured for learning.",
                "The history of queerness and modernity in the United States is incredibly extensive and interesting. This class goes through a lot of this fascinating material in amazing ways. Though there was writing involved, I don't think my writing necessarily improved very much as a result of the course. Rather, I gained a lot of new knowledge about a topic I wasn't too familiar with, and I learned different ways to apply this knowledge to trends we see even today.",
                "so many!! how sex, gender, and modernity was shaped in the early twentieth century across race and geographies, building how all of these things intertwine into one another and are truly incomplete without each other",
                "I learned about how heterosexuality/homosexuality came to be an identity. This class was an amazing opportunity to learn about the lives of queer people who lived 100+ years ago. I also learned how to write a paper that blends several types of analysishistorical, literary, and theoretical.",
                "This course helped me begin to explore the history of marginalized groups in the U.S. through its central focus on the idea of what it meant to be \"modern\" to those who transgressed racial / sexual / gender boundaries across history. Whether in reading historical fiction, scholarly articles, or primary sources, I honed my analytical skills through this class. The discussions, well-guided by Professor Herring, were always fabulous and helped me draw out the main ideas of the text we were reading & their relation to the broader themes of the course. Prof Herring supported all of my writing assignments with open office hours and extensive feedback on each assignment.",
                "I learned a lot about US modernity, especially what it meant for queer individuals and people of color. We spent a lot of time talking about how different queer subcultures/identities emerged. We covered a lot of interesting history and read a variety of materials, ranging from academic scholarship to a play to novels.",
                "I learned a lot about LGBT history in the 20th century. It was really interesting to delve into how gender, class, and race impacted the experiences of the queer individuals we discussed. In addition to this, I learned how to analyze sources better through the critical analysis we did for class and learned how to put texts in conversation with each other.",

                "This is a GREAT course, but make SURE you do the readings -- the course won't make any sense otherwise!! It's well structured and engaging. A bit reading-heavy at times but all interesting and relevant content.",
                "prof. herring is fantastic! he is absolutely a strength and cares deeply about his students' success. he is also organized and expects a reasonable amount of work from us. the texts are really varied so you get a little bit of knowledge about a lot of topics that relate to sex, gender, and american moderns. some of the texts, however, were not all that interesting, and because we only discussed most of the texts for one day, we were not able to talk about a lot of things that i personally found interesting.",
                "No weaknesses, only strengths! Prof. Herring truly works to meet every student where they are at and ensure that class is informative and engaging. His instructional style was incredible and class was organized so that through the entire semester we were constantly building on and connecting to previous things we learned instead of learning topics in isolation. I loved the archival materials and the Beinecke visit.",
                "i really cannot think of any weaknesses of this course! all of the readings were so thoughtfully chosen and intentional, the assignments were perfectly spaced and manageable, and the discussions were always interesting and illuminating",
                "No glaring weaknesses! Teaching was strong, pacing was good, and readings felt productive. As for strengths, I really liked how the class was structured as an argumentI've taken survey classes that left me feeling like I'd learned a lot, but couldn't come up with a takeaway. But with this class I felt like each discussion left everyone thinking about something new (eg where did physique culture come from? what are the ethics of huge age differences in queer relationships? who's left out of the harlem renaissance? how did romantic friendship / female husbands become modern lesbian / trans identity?)",
                "One of the biggest strengths of this course is Professor Herring. He is an absolute GEM, and I was so lucky to be in a class with him. He brought energy, excitement, and a huge level of preparation into any class. He seamlessly led each class in interesting discussions and fascinating lectures / historical contextualizations that made me walk away from each class with my mind blown. He also crafted such a wonderful syllabus -- another strength lies in the power of the texts / art / sources he had us read throughout the semester. The diverse array of authors helped reflect the diverse movements of the time they were crafted in, as well as the diversity of the class itself. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: you read a wide range of material which keeps it really interesting. You also cover a wide range of topics within modernity which I found fun. The material in general is very cool, which helped make the class great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it was a bit hard to see how everything connected, but the professor works hard to help you make all the connections. All of the individual pieces are interesting, though, and it was always fun to see how he would connect everything",
                "Strengths: The readings were really interesting, and Professor Herrings teaching style was super engaging. Instructions were also always clear. Professor Herring was also always understanding when it came to work,  providing a grace period and handing comprehensive feedback back quickly. Overall, it was a fantastic class, and I definitely recommend. \r\nWeaknesses: The readings would sometimes be heavy for a week.",

I had never studied this time period in any of my classes, so I really benefitted from the opportunity and from learning about queerness in the modernist era. The course was incredibly well-structured, and if you're interested in queer history and modernism, this is definitely the class for you!",
                "yes, if the topic interests you, then absolutely take it.",

                "Yes.",
                "yes!! wholeheartedly. such an interesting and necessary course. i learned so much and the learning environment was truly one of the best i have experienced.",
                "Yes. Great course to learn about queer history (and also about heterosexuality, which is a relatively recent invention). Prof. Herring has you read everything from interviews with badass older queer women to news reports about drag shows from 100+ years ago. We talked about thought-provoking works of fiction, collage, paintings, avant-garde photographythe class was super warm, but you also just get to meet really cool people from throughout the past two centuries!",
                "YES! Everyone should take this course, or just a course w Prof Herring generally. Taking this course will allow you to learn so much about American history that you probably never discussed in high school. This course does a beautiful job of establishing a sense of lineage and genealogy to queer BIPOC history that is all too often lost. It's extremely intersectional in its attention to non-white queerness, disability studies, trans histories, etc. etc. This was absolutely my favorite course I've ever taken at Yale.",
                "Yes! I was very new to WGSS, but it was both engaging and manageable. If it's the same professor, he does an amazing job of making the classroom incredibly welcoming. He also clearly cares a ton about teaching students, so if it's offered by him and you like the look of the syllabus, absolutely worth taking",
                "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. I learned a ton and loved nearly all of the readings. I think everyone can come away with something valuable from the course, and I feel like Professor Herring does a great job making the course topics easy to understand and engage with.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Herring is one of the best professors I've had. He is an excellent listener, is excited and energized by student participation and thought, and he is a tremendously warm and understanding individual. He is phenomenal!\r\n\r\nThe class material is very strong and interesting, and I felt as if I learned a lot about the breadth of queer American history."
