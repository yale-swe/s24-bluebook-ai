It could potentially be improved by adding some kind of regular office hours, one every week or two, for students to ask any course-related questions they may have.",

In my opinion, there's really no better way to learn about a field of interest than devoting a semester towards reading the primary literature and collating this information into an organized narrative. The thesis project is manageable and, as long as you choose a field of interest, it's highly enjoyable as well!",
