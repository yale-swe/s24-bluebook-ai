                "A strength of this course is that it has some structure to it beyond simply producing a thesis at the end of the semester, which helps keep students on track in terms of the pacing. It could potentially be improved by adding some kind of regular office hours, one every week or two, for students to ask any course-related questions they may have.",

In my opinion, there's really no better way to learn about a field of interest than devoting a semester towards reading the primary literature and collating this information into an organized narrative. The thesis project is manageable and, as long as you choose a field of interest, it's highly enjoyable as well!",
