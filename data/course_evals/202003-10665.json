If you would like to learn a language, but aren't quite sure which, here are some notes: Russian has been much harder than other languages I've studied; Russia and its associated countries have deep and rich histories and cultures; at times, this class can feel very quick-paced. In sum, if you're looking for a linguistic challenge, I recommend giving Russian a shot.",
