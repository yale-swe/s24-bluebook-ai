The graduate student advisors are a nice addition, but really, our actual academic advisor (the DUS) should be way more involved. EP&E is not a political economy department. Other EP&E students and I don't feel surrounded by faculty and grad students who are truly excited about interdisciplinary study. When I applied to EP&E, it was marketed as a small, supportive, and close-knit intellectual community. I met EP&E students in my year for the first time at Collin's office hours during the last week of the course, where he brought students together over coffee and grocery store cookies.  I am confident EP&E has the money to invest in facilitating relationships among students and truly getting to know each student intellectually."

                "My thesis advisor was excellent and I am passionate about my topic, but writing a year-long 100-page thesis is exhausting. Nothing can really make it not exhausting. I'm glad I did it, but I am not eager to tell my peers to jump at the opportunity to write a year-long EP&E thesis. I generally encourage people not to major in EP&E at this point, unless their primary interests are political theory or political economy."
