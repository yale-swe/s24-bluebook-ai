                "Strengths: Manageable and engaging workload. Weaknesses: Not a lot of guidance with papers\/presentations. I appreciate how open-ended the prompts were, but there was no grading rubric, so I didnt know what kind of writing was expected nor what to include in my papers. I got a lower grade on my first paper and was told I didnt include enough personal reflection (which I didnt know I needed to do). I did more personal reflection in my second paper and got a much higher grade, but it wouldve been nice to know from the start what the professor was looking for (especially since there were only two papers). Ways to improve: Be clearer about writing expectations. Perhaps provide previous essay examples or give students a chance to rewrite their papers?",

I felt very isolated in them because there were so few people and I felt disconnected from the class.

                "100% YES! If you have a relationship with food (and everyone does) you should take this class. Even if your relationship with food is difficult or hard, this is a safe space to explore that. If your relationship with food is great, this course is a chance to see how food really impacts your life and the lives of people around you. Through this course you will have experiences that you wouldn't have otherwise had (through the interview paper) and you have discussions that really open your eyes to discussions surrounding food. I promise this class will make you a better person and student. 10\/10 recommend.",

The readings were engaging and the class environment felt supportive and low-stakes. I appreciated Prof Trumpler's inclusive vision of the type of content and methods that should count as worthy of academic study.",

However, I wouldnt say I learned a ton in this course. I mainly just became more aware of other peoples experiences with food and got a couple of insights into the food service industry.",
