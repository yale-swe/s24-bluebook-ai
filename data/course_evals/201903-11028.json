    "A working knowledge of the French medical system and the vocabulary necessary to talk about it in French",
    "French conversational skills",
    "Learned a lot of about health systems on a broad scale, as well as at the francophone level. Vocal skills, as well as understanding of health-related issues, were improved. Found out about certain health related topics (historical and modern) through film, text, and conversation.",
    "French speaking, writing, and listening skills.",
    "This class explores a super wide variety of topics in the context of France, the U.S., and other Francophone countries. Topics included reproductive rights, homeopathy, humanitarian intervention, medical education\/practitioner training, contraception, malaria, HIV\/AIDS, euthanasia, and organ donation.",
    "I learned about the medical world in France, looking specifically at certain facets including education for doctors in France, specific diseases, and controversial issues.",
    "I really improved both my medical French vocabulary but also my writing skills and my fluidity of speech."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Really interesting material and pretty relaxed, engaging class conversations. The weakness of the course is the volume of film that is required for the class - unlike reading assignments which you can complete at your own pace, skim if needed, films require your attention for the duration. They are very time consuming especially when the selection is niche and can only be watched at the film study center or at specified times during the week. I would have preferred more reading and fewer films",
    "Too many long documentaries; overall interesting",
    "Great course that teaches you a lot, and improves your language skills without stressing you past your limits. Loved the use of films in the course, especially because the topic (medicine) could potentially give rise to less engaging forms. Course really had a variety of interesting content and was something to look forward to. However, one thing that was somewhat inconvenient was the frequent use of the Film Study Center to watch films. Some documentaries (for example, MSF documentary) seemed like they could be replaced with newer or better films that were available on streaming services. Also would be nice to have smaller vocabulary reviews rather than one large one.",
    "Strengths  instructor creates a wonderful and relaxing classroom environment, topics explored are very interesting and not commonly talked about (healthcare systems and current medical issues in the US, France, and abroad).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses  homework can often feel like busy work, having to watch full-length documentaries for each class gets overwhelming at times.",
    "Strengths: The class explores a really wide variety of topics and beyond the French that you learn, you also learn a lot about the world. The class explores the topics through movies, and some reading, so you have a chance to watch a lot of different films!\r\nWeaknesses: The only vocabulary assessment (in class, very casual) was at the very end of the semester, so we had to review a lot of vocabulary at the very end. Also, because there was no accountability, we probably didn't retain it as well.",
    "I really enjoyed the movies and readings for the course. It was really convenient when the movies were available online instead of requiring the DVD. I also felt like the end was packed with really long movies. But overall I loved the material and topics that we discussed.",
    "Perhaps if there was a better way for students to watch films that wasn't meeting up the night before class in the basement of WLH. It was just difficult to find a time when all 14 people were free, and it didn't help that the DVDs themselves were region-locked and so had to be played in very specific locations on campus."

   "comments": [
    "yes - relaxed and good opportunity to speak French, learn more French and learn more about France. Not a big intellectual challenge",
    "Yes; good way to learn to discuss healthcare topics",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in French, take this. Really, I don't even think you need to have a good understanding of any sort of medical system before taking the course, as things are explained as you go. Health topics can be really touching, controversial, and thought-provoking. A good chance to watch films and improve French language skills.",
    "Yes! If you need to fulfill a language credit, this is a great class with overall engaging material\/discussions and much more doable than other L5 French classes. Professor is wonderful.",
    "Yes! The class explores some really interesting topics and you learn a lot of interesting\/practical vocabulary while also learning about some really interesting issues related to health. The workload varies somewhat through the semester. There are 2 writing assignments and 3 presentations, and if it's not a week with one of those bigger assignments, the only work is readings\/movies.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in medicine and want to take a course spoken fully in French.",
    "Great class if you are interested in health issues\/medicine."
