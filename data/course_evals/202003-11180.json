                "This course is very good at making you engage with the language, yet, there were some assignments that felt unnecessarily long. For example, we would have to rewrite our essays by hand after being given corrections, each time with increasing minimum character count. These were helpful assignments, but could have been kept to the same length for equal effect.",
                "This is definitely a rigorous course and I found myself spending a lot of time every day reviewing the new vocabulary and grammar, but I saw tremendous improvement across my reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Also, the teachers are super helpful and passionate about what they are teaching.",
                "I appreciate the type of the assignments given (the content), but at times it felt quite overwhelming when we had back-to-back essays, presentations, and assessments. It would be nice if they could be spread out because it felt as if at times I wasn't really learning anything, but moreso just cramming knowledge in my head for a test."

Since the class meets every day, I found my Chinese improved significantly and so it was very rewarding.",
