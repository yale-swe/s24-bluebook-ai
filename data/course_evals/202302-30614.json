                "I learned about the different types of study designs, how to critically assess the methods chosen in a study and how to calculate different measures of disease occurrence.",
                "This course provided me with a robust understanding of chronic diseases, enabling me to analyze their distribution, determinants, and risk factors at both the population and individual levels.\r\n\r\nBy engaging with real-world data sets, I've developed valuable analytical skills using statistical tools, enhancing my ability to interpret and evaluate epidemiological studies in the context of chronic disease.\r\n\r\nThe course's focus on preventative strategies has given me insights into designing and implementing public health interventions, leading to a more profound appreciation for the complexities involved in chronic disease control.\r\n\r\nThrough collaborative projects, I've cultivated teamwork and communication skills, learning to effectively articulate and share ideas with a diverse group of peers.\r\n\r\nBy critically assessing contemporary research, I've gained the ability to discern the strengths and weaknesses in study designs, fostering a more nuanced approach to scientific inquiry in the field of epidemiology.\r\n\r\nI've gained exposure to ethical considerations and cultural contexts in chronic disease epidemiology, shaping my perspective on the multifaceted role that socio-economic factors play in health outcomes.",

                "Great introduction to epidemiology, understanding measures of disease frequency, measures of disease comparison, study designs, confounding and effect modification, bias and screening",
                "I learned the basics of study design, measures of disease frequency, and methods of assessing the validity of studies.",
                "Through this course, I was able to learn the foundations of epidemiology. This included foundational definitions, concepts, types of studies and how to apply it to real-life practice in public health.",
                "I learned a lot of topics I had seen before but never truly had the background for. I feel like I now have the tools to effectively read an article and understand every aspect from it (tables, methods, etc.).",

                "Dr. Desai's was phenomenal and I walked away with the following:\r\n1. ability to understand and interpret the common terms of measures of disease occurrence and epidemiology, which were previously confusing and misleading for me,\r\n2. the clear understanding of the various types of study designs and the type of research question each study design hopes to answer. This was a major takeaway for me since research articles on each of the various types of study design were discussed and dissected in class till we were absolutely clear on the concepts,\r\n3. the ability to decide on the most suitable type of study design given a particular research question. This again was an incredible outcome from the class,\r\n4. the knowledge of measures of associations in epidemiology and the appropriate interpretation of them in studies.",

This proactive approach allowed me to clarify any uncertainties and apply the theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, enriching my overall learning experience.\r\n\r\nDedicated Self-Study and Utilization of Resources: Recognizing the importance of individual effort, I devoted time outside of class to review lecture materials, read supplementary texts, and practice using statistical tools. By leveraging the resources provided by Instructor Desai and exploring additional reference materials, I was able to reinforce my understanding of the subject matter, ensuring a well-rounded and comprehensive grasp of chronic disease epidemiology.",
