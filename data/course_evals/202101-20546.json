                "This course is a wonderful synthesis of literary styles and themes between North and South American literature. We went in in-depth analyses of various short-stories and novels, analyzing Spanish-written and translated texts.",
                "This class offered me a wonderful opportunity to read closely and engage in thorough discussions of literature. The course improved my abilities to absorb large amounts of Spanish language prose, and allowed me to draw connections between texts.",
                "I learned a lot about some literary classics and about the Spanish language.",
                "Reading skills in Spanish were strengthened in this class. Writing skills were as well, but not to the same extent, understandably so. Professor Adorno's ability to help out with reading skills is really quite underrated.",
                "Improved knowledge of Spanish language, understanding of interconnected aspects of literature of North and South America",
                "This is a good class with a great reading list.",
                "This course helped me improve my reading and comprehension skills in Spanish, and the in-class conversations enabled me to get a better command of the spoken Spanish language.",
                "We read and analyzed number of influential American and Latin American works, as well as gained insight into the connections between these genres.",
                "I was able to learn sharpen my Spanish comprehension skills through the short stories and books that we read. I also learned about various Latin American authors and their connection to American (U.S.) authors in their writing",

                "Improving skill in reading and interpreting complex Spanish.",
                "I loved how Adorno was able to connect classic literature from North America and Latin America and highlight the themes that were prevalent in both. In addition to learning the plots and characters from some of the most famous novels and stories of the Americas, we also learned how to read carefully, looking for allusions and hints in the writing.",
                "This class was enjoyable and insightful. I was encouraged to analyze literature in Spanish just as I would in any English class, which gave me the same skills I needed to either write argumentative essays or in this case, create a script for a play. Managing the same literary devices I was taught in English in a Spanish class was very useful in aiding Spanish reading skills. I felt far more comfortable picking up Spanish literature after I took this class.",

                "I think there's great exposure to many interesting short stories and novels from famous authors. For the novels, it is more difficult to discuss them in their entirety in the lecture slides so we tended to only cover certain passages from our reading assignment.",
                "Strengths: Professor and TA are very kind, and extremely passionate about the subject material. Great reading list as well. Weaknesses: Im not sure how well the combined lecture-seminar format worked. I think the course would have functioned much better as either a lecture, or a limited enrollment seminar - 35 students is a bit too large for a discussion based course.",
                "For anyone who loves reading and literature, this is an amazing class that really taught me to appreciate literature.  The class was a little big so it was sometimes hard to participate, but I loved being able to read the text out loud in class and see the beauty of the words.  I also enjoyed the collaborative work, since it allowed me to talk to my classmates and see all of their wonderful creativity!",
                "The class size made it a bit difficult to fully express oneself because it was a bit intimidating in a class where skill level varied greatly. In addition, it often meant that it could sometimes be difficult to find a time to jump into the conversation. I loved the fact that Professor Adorno and Esteban (our TF) were always available to discuss any questions we had about the course or just to simply discuss the reading materials.",
                "We were helped to ease us in by structuring the course with lighter readings at the beginning. The escenficaciones are a lot of fun and divided well throughout the semester.",
                "The strengths of this course are the diverse course material and wonderful teaching of Dr. Adorno. Her style is wonderful and easy to follow along. This course can be improved with small group discussions in the form of break-out rooms or small group discussions if in person. This would give students more ability to analyze and engage with the texts together.",
                "I really enjoyed how Professor Adorno sent out PDFs of the texts/class notes so that we could engage in very focused readings. However, I felt the class was too big to provide all students enough time to really engage with the material verbally. It was less of a conversation and more of a lecture, which is not necessarily a weakness, just an element of the class and the demand.",
                "The professor was so engaged in the lectures and she really made sure to make the presentations in a way that could help us understand the literature better because they were sometimes difficult to understand. She was also open to all ideas.",
                "Strengths: Professor Adorno and Esteban are wonderful, caring instructors. Weaknesses: the course runs like a seminar, but there were 40+ students, so not everyone could participate each class.",
                "Srengths: \r\n- The professor's personality is amazing. \r\n- The work was quite low outside of class besides the reading (no tests, so that really took the stress off the shoulders and encouraged deeper engagement and reading\r\n- Great TA\r\n- She would always be helpful during her office hours if we had any concerns or questions. (Tbh, they were quite infrequent, once every two weeks, but she would be willing to have hold private meetings if one desired)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It was online, so ya (to be expected). Make of that what you wish.",
                "The main weakness of the course was the online format, which made the discussions harder to focus on, breakout rooms or activities may have helped this",
                "I think it was weird because of COVID, but there were very very few assignments for the entire semester, which was great. The reading list was excellent, but I think I would have enjoyed this class much more if the English works were read in English instead of translated into Spanish.",
                "Strengths: fantastic selection of texts, readings were always carefully selected to keep the reading very manageable, Professor Adorno is incredibly knowledgeable and has tons of energy, and the final assignment (performance of a literary passage) really enhanced my understanding of the material. V\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For the second half of the course (longer novels), the Powerpoint summaries were hard to follow.",
                "Great for those who love reading fiction",
                "Strengths: very understanding Professor and TA; the lectures were very helpful in understanding and deciphering the literature that we were reading; class discussions also helped bring new insights into view",
                "Strengths:\r\n- easy to follow\r\n- clear organization of topics and learning\r\n- final theater project is fun\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- large amount of students, limited participation in class",
                "One strength of the course is how in-depth the novels and stories are analyzed, as well as the context that is given before each class to not only explain the author's perspective and background, but also to help us better understand the setting and time period in which the story or novel takes place. One weakness is that since there were so many people in the course, it was sometimes hard to participate despite it being designed to be a seminar class. As such, I didn't get a chance to develop my own ideas about the stories we read as much as I would have liked.",
                "The strength of this course is in the syllabus. All the readings are wonderful, and the course ends in \"Cien anos de soledad\" which is absolutely breathtaking. It is now one of my favorite books ever. I also really liked the 'escenificaciones' that we had to put on. It was awesome to extend the readings in a creative way. I think the weakness of this class was in the format. Going to class and just re-reading the pages that we had already read for homework was often boring. It got better as time went on, but definitely at the beginning, I was disappointed with how much we actually got to comment on and discuss things. I think things got better by the time we got to Garcia Marquez.",
                "Prof Adorno is a wonderful person. The course was incredibly stale, however.",
                "The readings were incredibly interesting and entertaining, which made the course generally engaging. A potential weakness of the course is that there isn't much comparison between North and South American authors specifically, but rather, comparison is more implied."

If you're hoping to practice speaking/writing, this course may not be suited to help you improve those areas. I thought it was a fine course to take for the Advanced Language Certificate requirement for a 300-level class.",

She is always more than willing to meet and discuss the literature. Frankly, she has been one of my favorite professor's at Yale thus far.",
                "Absolutely! Profesora Adorno is an effective lecturer and this is a great 300-level class to ease you into harder literature. If you're not interested in literature and are just looking for a Spanish class, I might look another direction.",
                "Yes 100% you should take this course. One of the best Spanish literature courses at Yale and with the most amazing professor and TA!",

                "Absolutely. It's a privilege to learn from Professor Adorno.",
                "Absolutely! This course is a great balance of a very (VERY) manageable workload and interesting topics. First off, the selection of texts is fantastic. The readings were all super enjoyable and I never knew there could be so many connections between US and Latin American works. Professor Adorno did an incredible job assigning specific selections, and short stories, so we could focus on a shorter text rather than getting lost in a very long reading assignment. Class was thought-provoking and lively, although sometimes the Powerpoint-and-discuss format got a bit dry. Professor Adorno has an incredible amount of energy and really cares for her students, and this is clear throughout the course. I'm not sure how this course would be in a normal year, but Prof. Adorno really took student needs into consideration and left the only graded assignments as a few tiny writing commentaries and a group skit that was actually really fun and a good way to get to know the works. Accordingly, this was the lowest-pressure class I've taken at Yale and nonetheless I learned a lot and loved doing the readings even too. Highly recommend this class for anyone who wants to take a Spanish course.",

Mostly because i think that Cien aos de soledad is an amazing book, and learning about some background in literature as well as comparing it to North American literature makes it much better still.  But you can also just read these books on your own.",
