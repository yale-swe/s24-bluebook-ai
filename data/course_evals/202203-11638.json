                "The primary purpose of the course from my understanding was learning different ways to estimate causal effects from data. From base OLS regressions to Instrumental Variables to Randomized Experiments to Dynamic Models, I learned a lot of foundational skills for properly analyzing data. I think the key idea I took away from the whole course was to be very critical about analyzing data, since many types of regressions require certain assumptions and techniques to properly use and analyze. Overall, I think the knowledge and skills I learned in this course will be extremely valuable, especially as data grows more and more important.",

            "comments": [
                "The course teaches important material, and the exams were very fair. Prof. Meghir and Pedro, the TA, were kind and encouraging, and clearly wanted us to learn a lot. The projects were especially helpful in cementing concepts (in particular the second one, when we had more guidance), and TA section was really helpful as well. However, the workload was quite unbalanced at times (there was a relatively difficult problem set every week, and on weeks when we also had a project or the midterm, it could become overwhelming), and expectations could be unclear. Also, since problem sets were due on different days of the week, it was hard to pace the work at times. Pedro was amazing, and hosted a lot of office hours for just one person, but I think the course would have benefited from a second TA or some ULAs or peer tutors. Office hours were super important for understanding things and working collaboratively, particularly on the projects, and I think there could easily have been twice as many.",
                "I think the project aspect of the course is a strength - it encourages you to synthesize information across lectures. I also appreciated that the professor gave us a review guide for the exam.",
                "The professor and the TF were very very good. They both taught at a reasonable pace and always invited questions. I did find the set up of the lecture slides a little confusing. Sometimes I would get lost between the actual content and the application of the content. I think if the first half of the slides was strictly the content and was concise so it was easy to pull out formulas and concepts from, and the second half application, it wouldve been easier to follow.",
                "I really enjoyed the course. Professor Meghir and Pedro were both excellent at teaching and explaining concepts.",
                "Wish we had more guided help on psets, it was mainly asking the TA and him guiding us",
                "Strengths - fantastic professor, high quality course",
                "Good pace through material, lectures very thorough and TA section helpful for solidifying knowledge.",
                "I think one strength of this course was that it covered a wide breadth of topics while making sure to connect each topic back to the base ideas introduced at the beginning of the course. In particular, we started the course with OLS, which required a number of assumptions to use properly. Afterwards, each subsequent topic essentially was a different way to address potential issues that arose if the OLS assumptions were not satisfied, therefore requiring a slightly more complicated analysis. I think the course was structured in a way that facilitated connections between all these topics. I think the main way the course could be improved is potentially more clarity on problem set and exam questions. While I understand that part of the point is that many questions are very open-ended depending on how you argue for certain assumptions, I found it was often unclear how problem set questions matched up with topics we discussed during lecture, which sometimes made it more difficult to reinforce knowledge.",
                "First project was too vague and unguided whereas second project was well-structured. I would change first project to look more like second project.",
                "Strengths: Section and office hours are useful, gives a mathematical basis for many of the concepts introduced in econ 117.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I often found lectures to be confusing and convoluted, taking a pretty straightforward concept and explaining it in a very confusing way. The material tested on assignments often felt unrelated to the material covered in lecture, which made assignments frustrating and confusing. The grading on assignments and projects also seemed confusing, and there was no rubric or grading scheme with point deductions - it just seemed like points were taken off sometimes at random, and this made the grading feel very unfair at times. The pace of lectures in the semester was also pretty poor, with a ton of material packed into the first couple of weeks, which we moved through at an incredibly fast pace. This was also the most difficult material to understand, and I got the sense that most of the other students were completely lost during those lectures. However, the pace of the class eventually stabilized towards the end of the semester.",
                "Despite being quite stressful at times, I found the course extremely rewarding. Costas truly cares about his students. He certainly has high standards and demands good work, but in the end youll feel a great sense of accomplishment.",
                "Strengths: the course teaches many complex econometrics concepts, which are useful if you're interested in the field. Pedro is also an incredible TF. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt the workload was pretty high - weekly problem sets PLUS 2 larger projects (only having one project due towards the end of the semester would have helped a lot with workload)",
                "This course was very well organized, and the TA (Pedro) was probably the best TA I've ever had. The lecture material was engaging and interesting, and I felt that I had enough time to fully digest and practice subject matter before the course moved on to the next topic.",
                "Weakness: at times problem set questions werent very clear. Thankfully the TA was generous at grading.",
                "Strengths: very hands on with the projects and the p sets, great balance of theoretical and practical.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the final were not as high stakes as it is, since we do so much work during the semester that feels it should count more.",
                "Strengths: Very rigorous material which makes you learn the material \r\nWeaknesses: Lack of relation from class to psets. Made it very necessary to have to go to office hours.",
                "A strength of the course was the teaching assistant we were given throughout the course, Pedro. Sometimes in class, it might have been difficult to understand the material right away during lectures, but once you go to office hours or TA sessions, you come to understand the problem sets and the lessons. A weakness that I may have for this course, would be that the lectures aren't recorded; for some students I think having lectures to revisit and see what the professor meant really help."

                "I would recommend this course as a way to learn econometrics with the caveat that it's not easy, and took up way more of my time than I expected. It's pretty theory and math heavy, and while by the end of the semester I had a good understanding of how the theory connected to the applications, it took me a while to get there. Also, you need to have a pretty solid understanding of R or STATA, or else problem sets and projects will be extremely hard. Also, I think it would be difficult to do well in the course without attending every class, so keep that in mind!",
                "If you are looking to write an Econ thesis or just really like Econ 117, this is a great course. Don't expect it to be easy - I ended up putting a lot of time in to the class but feel like I learned way more than I was expecting.",
                "If you are want to do an Econ thesis you have to. But also if you are interested in working in any finance\/econ related field at a high level I think its important.",

                "I enjoyed learning about the different methods and models used in the field of econometrics to run experiments. I think this course is valuable for people who would like to learn about how to construct a strong experiment and get useful results.",
                "I think this course is definitely a good course to take to really build your foundational knowledge in data analysis. I felt like it was a rather natural continuation from ECON 117 (as intended) and built on many of the topics discussed in that course. I will admit that some topics may be kind of dry if you are not very invested\/interested in learning about data analysis, but I think overall, if you intend to do anything related to economics or data analysis, this is a good course to build the foundational knowledge and skills needed to properly perform those types of tasks.",
                "Absolutely not. The workload in this class was pretty unreasonable, with 10 psets (none of which were dropped), 2 projects, a midterm, and a final. Deadlines often overlapped (pset and project due same day) or were assigned over breaks. Also the late policy for this class was 5% off for every 30m past the deadline, which is the most insanely intense late policy I've ever seen. If you must take this class, I would definitely recommend taking it a different semester. The concepts in this class are not that intellectually challenging - most of the class is just expanding on concepts taught in econ 117, and this makes the steep jump in workload seem even more unwarranted. Lectures were generally not too difficult to follow along, but I felt that the lectures didn't prepare me well (at all) for the assignments, and section and office hours were pretty much a requirement in order to figure out the psets. However, if you go to section and office hours, it isn't that bad. I generally feel very conflicted towards this class because I found the professor and TA to be pretty likeable, and they were definitely trying to make the class an enriching experience, but I just thought the class was very disorganized and my experience was far more frustrating than enjoyable.",
                "Id recommend this course to students who enjoyed ECON 117 and want to understand econometrics in a less structured environment. Everything in ECON 117 is presented with very simple, clear examples. Costas does a good job highlighting that econometrics is just as much an art as it is a science. If you take this course, try to take it with Costas.",

                "I would recommend this course to Econ majors, even if you don't want to do a thesis. It's what will really get you to be able to navigate econ research papers if you want to do that, which I think is an important skill for an econ major to have.",
                "no, but you have to take this course if you're a cs\/econ major.",
                "Honestly this was one of the hardest courses of the CS\/ECON core for me. Make sure you keep pace and go to OH or you might drown.",
                "If you are a student who wants to conduct a thesis that requires collecting data and running tests, then I would recommend this course. It gives you the skills to be able to meet this goal. The course provides you with the knowledge on how to design experiments\/tests, improve your tests, and be able to interpret them the correct way. All while being able to utilize either Stata or R-studio which has proven to be a very useful tool in this class and outside projects."
