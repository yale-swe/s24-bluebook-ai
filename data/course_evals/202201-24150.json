                "I really appreciated the chance to learn how to write a research paper. This class is hands down one of the most fun (think a ton of discussions and debate) and practical poli sci classes you could take in the major.",
                "This course is fantastic for skill-building and knowledge-building for all students of social science. The final assignment, which was broken out into manageable chunks through the semester, gave us the chance to do a proper literature review, assess and choose research methods, and craft compelling arguments. And to adjust and refine our final assignment plan all throughout the entire semester, which is a rare opportunity. In terms of substance, we took a tour of all major areas of democratization theory and research. Professor Brancati was incredibly thoughtful in her choice of readings, which complemented each other very well. I walked away with a firm grasp of the major works, findings, and debates in the field.",
                "I learned a ton about designing and writing a research paper in this class, definitely much more helpful than most of the other plsc seminars i've taken at Yale. Prof Brancati gave us a lot of guidance and clear expectations to successfully execute a research project. We critically analyzed papers and their arguments in a way that was really helpful for strengthening my own. The course material covered different drivers of democracy in a global context, as well as the factors that break it down.",
                "I learned about conditions that facilitate democratization (did you know that remittances make it more likely that people protest in favor of democracy?) I also gained the skill of producing my own political science original research paper. We also learned a lot about how to critique and analyze other research papers by looking critically at its different components- methodology, argument, etc.",
                "This is one of the courses so far at Yale that has best helped me develop new skills. First and foremost, the course helped me become much better at reading and discussing political science research -- providing me the insight necessary to improve my capacity for identifying the strengths and weaknesses behind arguments and research. In addition, I feel like I learned a lot about how to carry out political science research myself and build my own arguments. Great course to develop your research and writing. Learned a lot from the readings.",
                "This course helped me develop perspectives on how to critically analyze academic papers. I loved how every class looked at the broad theme from different angles through academic research. Within each paper, we evaluated the arguments and the quality of research of the paper.\r\n\r\nThis course also helped me build a deeper understanding of factors influencing democracy."

                "strengths- amazing prof, interesting discussions and readings, well organized, clear expectations, lots of support from prof\r\nweaknesses- some weeks had pretty high reading load, a few readings could only be accessed by physically going to the library to check it out for a 2 hour period",
                "Strengths: really interesting readings, Prof Brancati was SUPER engaging and knowledgeable, you learn to write an original research paper and the course walks you through the steps/ gives you as much help as you need, Brancati makes a really warm class environment where youll feel comfortable sharing but also feel challenged to think more deeply about the material",
                "Strengths -- interesting readings, good feedback, assignments helped develop your skills, prof. Brancati is very willing to help, good class discussion of readings, well organized syllabus, good support for writing final paper\r\n\r\nWeakness (though not really weaknesses, more like things to keep in mind) -- readings can get long, a lot of assignments (though they are useful for the final paper and lessens the stress at the end), picking the final paper topic early might mean you come up with better ideas later"

                "YES!!!!!! PLEASE TAKE THIS. hands down one of the best poli sci classes both in subject material and in practical skills  you write a publishable paper on your own research which is crazy cool. professor brancati is so kind and willing to help you really learn.",

                "yes! if you are interested in transition states and learning about democratization, it is a great course. also is a great course if you're trying to improve your social science research and writing skills, or wanting to gain experience reading quantitative papers. the prof is very helpful and gives you all the resources you need to do well, and she definitely encourages students to do well. the papers we read are interesting and relevant, and the prof does a great job at guiding discussions.",
                "YES YES YES!!! Its been one of my favorite courses at yale. I came into this course not having a ton of prior knowledge about course material but prof Brancati always encouraged me to share my perspective in class and it allowed me to build my confidence about dissecting and discussing political science papers/ theories. The discussions are super interesting (as long as you do the readings!) and youll get to produce an original research paper by the end (Brancati really walks you through the steps of it and gives you as much guidance as you need). I cant recommend this class enough",
                "Yes. This course is great for developing political science research skills and the readings are overall interesting. The course has a fair amount of assignments but I feel like they are useful for developing your skills and help you write a good final paper. Prof. Brancati is very helpful and gives good feedback + ideas of how to improve your writing / research.",
