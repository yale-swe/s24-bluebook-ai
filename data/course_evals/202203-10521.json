                "I developed knowledge about music theory especially in the context of modern pop.

I also began developing skills in transcription and generally improving my listening abilities.",

                "Form, meter, hypermeter, rhythm, melody, chord loops, transcription, song analysis, covers and interpolation",
                "Learned how to isolate rhythm, harmony, melody, and other musical concepts while listening to a pop song, and to appreciate how they all come together to create a cohesive experience.",
                "As is clear from the title of the course, I learned a lot about music theory as it relates to popular music! This is not something I'd been exposed to before, and it will definitely inform my listening whenever I hear new music.",
                "I learned a lot about how music theory applies to popular music. I improved my ear, as I was able to hear chords much better after this course.",
                "This course is a 15-week exercise of music analysis. In it, I developed my ability to discuss music in concrete terms, ie with a comprehension of chord progressions and their general types (modal mixture, major diatonic, etc.), stepwise vs. intervallic melodies, metric details. In general, also developed confidence talking about music in front of others, even at risk of being wrong.",
                "I got a lot better at identifying the chords of a song by ear, and learned about different types of chord progressions."

                "I think it's a great course for interested students who aren't as committed to a classical music education/are just interested in modern music theory. The discussion section was especially helpful for making sure we understand topics and asking questions. I think one weakness is that I often felt nervous in class because my listening skills weren't great (no perfect pitch/relative pitch etc.)",
                "Strengths: Nate is super knowledgeable and has very insightful things to say about music.\r\nRoom for improvement: The class participation could be stronger, but we may just have had a quiet group.",
                "Professor Adam is great and the class is a really low-stress environment. The class did a good job of covering the important topics for analyzing pop music, and even though it felt slower-paced at times, we got the chance to hear examples of all the concepts we discussed in practice.",
                "This course is awesome. It is low-stress and low-workload, as are all of Nate's courses, but I felt like I learned more than I did in my other courses which took up 5x as much time. The only small weakness of the course was the feedback speed on assignments, but the feedback was always very thoughtful and well worth the wait.",
                "This course is truly about student learning -- Professor Adam really cares about his students and wants them to learn, so learning is very much prioritized over grading. I really appreciated that he created a classroom environment that encouraged student input -- he genuinely wanted to hear our thoughts, and valued our opinions. I think perhaps the assignments could have been a bit more creative -- they were very open-ended, which was wonderful (i.e. we could choose to analyze any song), but they required only a simple understanding of what we had learned in class.",
                "I loved the format of the course, examining various songs each class was exciting and insightful.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Adam is very engaging, the class is very casual/colloquial which is a nice change from some other seminars, and there is a lot of grade leniency. Weaknesses: it would be more engaging/interesting if classes were a bit more structured.",
                "Strengths. Professor Adam and the teaching staff. Professor Adam exudes competence. Other professors about whom this is true can be intimidating to the point of discouraging student participation -- not so with Prof. Adam. He is a well of knowledge, eager to take any student's point and run with it, adding layers of details and analysis to it. He does a great job making this course a comfortable place for students while also making it a place for students to venture out of their comfort zones when it comes to the material. Course is very well organized in its movement through topics. The paper assignments were all relevant and never felt like busy work. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None!",
                "I liked the material a lot, and Professor Adam is really nice. The TAs were very helpful and engaged, and wanted us to succeed. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness was that the class could get repetitive. It would be nice to vary up the class time with some activities other than listening to and analyzing songs the whole time."

                "Yes, I think the course is great for students looking to learn music theory in the modern context. It's much more applicable to students who aren't looking to be classical musicians (which I feel is the majority of students at Yale actually).",
                "If you want a relaxed environment to learn about pop music theory, then yes! Would recommend coming in with some music theory background - there were a few points in class where I thought students with more theory knowledge probably got more out of the class than I did.",
                "Yes! Professor Adam is great, and the content is very interesting. It's a really chill class and environment, but if you've taken a music theory class before, a lot of it might not be new.",
                "Yes! Make this the course you sign up for right at 8am on whatever random Tuesday in midterm season that Yale opens registration so you can nab a spot. Do it!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! If you are interested in having a deeper understanding of pop music (from any time period), you will find this course really interesting.",
                "Yes, I would. I learned a lot and it was very insightful.",
                "Absolutely",
                "100000% take it. And don't be discouraged from taking it if you haven't specifically taken the prerequisites. I had not and had a wonderful time and didn't feel like I lagged behind other students. The knowledge of key signatures, scales, roman numeral notation, etc. from those courses is important and does come into play, but if you've primarily learned those things on your own time through youtube videos (like I had), I'd say go for this class. There may be brief stretches where you feel a little shaky, but that's a great opportunity to grow your knowledge. \r\n\r\nBut yeah can't say enough good things, outstanding.",
                "Yes! Id recommend it if you are interested in pop music theory or want to get better at songwriting in more contemporary genres (folk, rock, pop, etc.). Its very little work and a super chill class, but I still learned a lot."
