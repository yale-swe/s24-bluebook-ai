                "I learned about the connections between 18th and 21st century literature, many philosophical arguments related to what the novel is and why people read it, and what \"experimental\" literature is.",
                "I learned a lot about novels of the 18th century, their tropes, characteristics, the context surrounding them. I now feel like I can identify aspects of 18th century novels in current literature and discuss what these characteristics are and how they function within the text. In addition to this, I gained valuable insight into becoming a stronger writer from Professor Campbell.",
                "I learned a lot about different forms of the novel and how the novel is an experimental attempt to communicate the human condition. The books we read showed me new realizations about time and memory and history, about the possibilities of human connection, about race and gender and queerness, and about the limitations and possibilities of language."

                "Strengths: The absolute best reading list I've ever had in a course. Some of the 18th century novels were difficult to get through (Pamela and Tristram Shandy mainly) but the in-class discussions made me so glad to have read them. It was really amazing to make connections between novels, especially as we got farther into the course. The student informational reports also brought in so much interesting context. The papers were honestly a joy to write, both because of the creative options available and just because of how much interesting material there was to work with.\r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Professor Campbell is the BEST. She included a range of 18th/19th and 20th/21st century novels in this class, and she made sure each one was discussed in an engaging way. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: The informational reports are so fun to do and to learn from! Professor Campbell is also so responsive in leading seminar and her adept skills in letting the discussion ebb and flow create a unique, engaging space to tackle key threads between texts and unique aspects within individual novels.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the reading load is a bit high and, personally, I wished I had made a better schedule for completing it all."

            "comments": [
                "Absolutely!!! It is a lot of reading but if you're willing to put in the time you will get so much out of the course.",
                "Yes! Professor Campbell is a true gem, and I'm convinced she would make any literature interesting. She gives excellent feedback on writing, and she is a thoughtful discussion facilitator. Even if 18th/19th c lit isn't your thing, the books on this syllabus are incredible and worth reading with Professor Campbell!",
                "Yes! Especially if you are majoring in English/Humanities. I really enjoyed this course and Professor Campbell is an incredible seminar leader and leaves thorough comments on how you can grow as a writer which is valuable.",
                "Yes! This is my favorite English course I've taken at Yale (and maybe my favorite course overall). Prof Campbell is the best and the books we read are so illuminating. So many moments from our class conversations will stay with me."
