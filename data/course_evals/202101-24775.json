                "I learned a tremendous amount about effective teaching. Out of all other education courses I've taken at Yale, I feel this practically would help me the most as a teacher.",
                "I learned A LOT about what it means to be an effective teacher and what kinds of practices are conducive to it. I gained both theoretical and practical knowledge about what makes an effective teacher.",
                "This course gave a nice introduction into what it takes to be a teacher, and I came out of it realizing what is important to focus on (because there are many things to improve on to become an expert teacher) when entering the teaching profession.",
                "If there is any course that gave me practical skills on how to not only teach but also how to be a better communicator and person, this is the one. We learned about how other people learn, how to teach (and communicate) in group settings, and critically think about what we're learning and teaching. I learned a lot about how most educational models are just...not great and tend to perpetuate all of the -isms while also learning about how we can avoid the same pitfalls.",
                "Learned about different core principles of effective teaching in the secondary classroom and different educational inequities we should consider. Topics included teaching to the whole child, understanding by design framework for curriculum development, restorative justice circles, creating a sense of belonging in the school and classroom, affirming students across multiple axes of identity (like gender, class, and culture), special education, multi-lingual education, scaffolding while maintaining rigor, creating authentic assessments, developing authentic assessments, and giving good feedback.",
                "This class is vital for anyone who wants to become a good teacher. We covered very important topics like addressing race equitably in the classroom, making plans for students with different ability levels and potential IEPs, and we covered how to best get students to engage with subject matter. We also got experience with teaching through practice teaching segments, which got lots of helpful feedback.",
                "I learned more than I can possibly express about how to be a good teacher: from Professor Scheve, from my peers, and from my teacher partner. This is one of the few courses I have taken at Yale that I feel has given me not only theoretical knowledge of education, but tangible skills that I will use in my future career as a teacher."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: getting paired with a secondary school teacher as a mentor (and while it is virtual, how well Melissa matched the teacher with the student's interests/background), how Melissa organized the class itself as an embodiment of an effective classroom (in a cool meta way), how well organized each class was (literally timed to the minute), the low weighting of each assignment so no assignment was particularly stressful, the ability to revise any assignment (which also relieved stress), the spoon policy (allowing you to miss one class or turn in an assignment late no questions asked), the case study (and the creativity involved), the teaching segments (it was especially informative getting to make your own lesson plans), the extensive feedback Melissa provides on each assignment, experimenting with platforms teachers actually use for weekly reading responses, the classroom discussions, mix of readings and videos/podcasts as class prep materials,...literally the whole class is a strength. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses come to mind!",
                "The biggest strength of the course is definitely the case study, which involved working with an assigned teacher partner throughout the semester and interviewing them regarding the principles of effective teaching. We also had to observe our teacher partner's classroom. This was IMMENSELY helpful because it allowed us to connect these very theoretical principles to real life teacher's pedagogical practices. The course excels at margining the theoretical with the practical in a way that no other course I've taken ever has.\r\n\r\nAnother huge strength of the course is the extent to which it is student-led. Oftentimes we are given options about which activities we want to do (so going to different breakout rooms for people interested in having a discussion about the readings vs. those who want to actually apply the readings to a particular case study). Professor Scheve also always took our feedback seriously and adapted the course as we went along to best met the needs of students. Thus, another strength is the extent to which the course was student-centered.",
                "Prof Scheve is incredible -- she truly practices the effective teaching practices she teaches. The class is well-structured but flexible to student needs, with a doable and meaningful workload, timely and thoughtful feedback. With a focus on trust and conversation, the class is more than just a collection of students, but a true learning community. Prof Scheve did the almost impossible and managed to make a two-hour Zoom seminar engaging, rigorous, and comfortable.",
                "Professor Scheve is absolutely amazing. She teaches by example and demonstrates exactly what it looks like to be an effective educator. The only weakness was not meeting more often! This is the one class I would have gladly taken on more time and work for, because it was genuinely a pleasure to participate in.",
                "1. The instructor is phenomenal. Melissa is very receptive to feedback and very supportive. She leads classes extraordinarily well, offers time for students to turn off videos and rest, creates time for breaks and room for people to share feelings. There were numerous classes where she spent the beginning of class acknowledging that we are human and affected by outside events and likely grieving at many points in the semester. She cares about you--about us--as humans before students. When someone offered the idea of the spoons theory, she was very on-board with the idea and said that if there was ever any day that we were just not feeling okay, we could request an extension on an assignment or skip class with no justification needed. Her feedback is often extensive and useful, and she's always very open to meeting with students--about anything from \"I have no clue how to be a teacher\" to \"what am I doing for this assignment\" to \"I need someone to talk to\"\r\n\r\n2. The readings are focused. There aren't many readings and the readings aren't that long (or you can get the main points of the readings from the summaries/conclusions), so you really hone in on a few ideas each week. During discussion, we'd push those ideas further and/or put those ideas into practice, which made me feel like I was learning something every week.\r\n\r\n3. There aren't many assignments, so you can really focus on those few assignments and think about the main ideas of the readings and how you can put them into practice.\r\n\r\n4. The class really came together as a community which made discussions flow very smoothly and people felt comfortable reflecting and sharing vulnerable thoughts.",
                "Strengths: genuinely interesting readings, discussion posts, and class plans & materials\r\nWeaknesses: there simply wasn't enough time to do all that we wanted to do; wish there was more discussion time with classmates",
                "This course was very strong. The biggest strength was the teacher partner pairing. I think one of the best parts of the class was getting to interview a real high school teacher and gain perspective and context for the readings we were doing. That really solidified why what we were learning was important. One potential weakness of this class is that it was really catering to the digital format and may be hard to replicate post-pandemic when everyone returns to in-person instruction.",
                "This course was EXTREMELY well-organizedat the beginning of every class, Professor Scheve shared a Google Doc with an agenda for the day. Not only was it helpful to see the agenda each day, the agenda itself always included a variety of modes of learningwhole-group discussions, breakout rooms, watching videos, breaks, time with our cameras offwhich meant that there was never a dull moment and I was always completely engaged even over Zoom, which is a feat! The course had the strongest sense of community I've ever felt in a Yale course. Readings and discussions were lively and fascinating. This course not only modeled the way I want to lead my classroom as a future high school teacher, but also the way that every college professor should ideally conduct their courses."

It was also cool experimenting with different student-response platforms virtually too for the weekly readings.",
                "The biggest thing for me about this class was allotting specific times during the class where students could turn their cameras off. She is the only instructor to have ever done that for my courses this year, and is very much appreciated because constantly having to worry about how you're appearing on camera or what other people can see in your room is exhausting and detracts from my ability to engage in the course fully. There are also just some instances where you don't really need to have your camera on!",

                "Despite being online, this class was incredible at creating a sense of community and a welcoming environment that adapted to life and current events as they occurred. The community gatherings, student shout outs & student of the weeks, and community agreements helped with creating a sense of belonging and allowed us to better get to know each other while on zoom. I really appreciated the spoon policy that let us ask for (and receive!) extensions or miss class without having to expose private details to our professor and dean -- coupled with the ability to re-submit assignments after receiving feedback -- helped tremendously with reducing our stress levels. Taking a full class (about 2 hours) to check in with each other after Rachel's death and acknowledge how difficult the year has been really helped us process and shift towards a better headspace to actually learn.",
                "One thing I am very grateful for was our community openers, which really made the class feel like a community despite the Zoom format. We started every class with some sort of check-in or ice breaker to prepare for the topic of the class and also get to know one another. \r\nAdditionally, the course was incredibly accessible with all the materials being available online, as well as weekly reminders of what was due and expected for the week. I think this class was very well suited and organized for online learning during the pandemic. There was also very appropriate flexibility with the syllabus when needed to accommodate the needs of students, especially during particularly difficult parts of the semester.",
                "The variety of media incorporated both in class and for homework was amazing! Additionally, in the first half of the semester, we used different ed-tech platforms every week for discussion posts, which served not only to keep things interesting, but to familiarize me with tools that I will definitely be using going forward as a teacher! The course's policies on extensions, absences, etc. were also deeply attentive to the needs of each of us as students and people during an extremely challenging year."
