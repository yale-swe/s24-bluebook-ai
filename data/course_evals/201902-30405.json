    "First, the reading part only involves reading the book 1984 after class, which is kind of tedious and can hardly improve my reading skills in fact.\r\nMoreover, the writing part is much less than reading, only involves writing a passage once a week after class. I hope it can have more improvise writing in class.",
    "Strengths: Students can communicate with each other freely and develop the ability of critical thinking. Also, the feedbacks and suggestions of my performance are very clear and useful.\r\nWeaknesses and ways to improve: Some students were too shy to take part in the interaction. To ensure that everyone gets involved in the class, I suggest that teacher can come up with more ideas to encourage those students."
