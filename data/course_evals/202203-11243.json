                "The lab set up was a little further behind than my Chen course I think weekly overlap would help fully tie in concepts.",
                "The course itself was really amplified by Dr. Cooper. I took it previously with Dr. G and had to withdraw, but Dr. Cooper made the workload much more manageable and the material more approachable. Even though I was doing almost identical assignments, I felt much more confident with the material and comfortable working in the lab. The class can be really difficult to do well in if the professor isn't approachable, but Dr. Cooper was.",
                "The workload was made very manageable compared to previous years. I enjoyed the occasional workshops, especially since they gave us more time to work on our lab reports. They also taught us how to analyze our data in excel. Labs were also relatively short, with only a couple taking up the whole lab time.",
                "Some strengths of this class were: instructor would post lecture videos prior to lab so that we could understand what we were going to do, a helpful TA, workshops to enhance skills, and clear lab guides. Weaknesses: it would be helpful if prelab quizzes were graded towards completion instead of accuracy, and if the answers were posted after submitting them.",
                "No weaknesses! I loved how the prelab were so informative.",
                "Really good well organized course. More office hours would be nice",
                "Strengths: very well organized course, well designed experiments, and fantastic support from TA and Dr. Cooper\r\nWeaknesses: lab reports were a bit long and could have been shortened or been more consistently spread out",
                "Strengths: good at improving and using the statistical analysis with science\r\nWeakness: lab work was not that exciting",
                "Sometimes the lab was quite long and involved a lot of waiting, on other days it was more engaging.",
                "I feel that I did not do much more experiments that I had not already done in CHEM 134L, which made the course feel a bit boring.",
                "Lab templates need to be more specific. Lots of time spent trying to understand what the lab was asking rather than actually answering the questions.",

I would particularly recommend taking it off sequence because the professors give you more attention than they could if taken on sequence.",
