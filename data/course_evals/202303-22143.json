                "Directed Studies is a truly special course, and literature is an essential component. While Lit was my least favorite track (not because of Prof. McGowan, who is wonderful and who I will talk about later), I still think it is really worthwhile and interesting. You get to see how the European written tradition developed in a super neat way, and everything we read is engaging and fun. You become a better writer, speaker, and thinker while simultaneously broadening your horizons and reading works that have influenced academic for generations. You wont like all of the books, of course, but each is important and necessary. And the constant analysis and writing that is asked of you helps you to really improve your writing, no matter how accomplished you feel that you may be. If you want to guarantee intellectual fulfillment, or at the very least satisfaction, from your Frosh Fall, take DSif you dont, youll probably regret it.",
                "The course gave me the chance to read texts to read the classical texts I have always wanted to, but likely would not without the support of a whole seminar. It taught me how literature is a progression of stories; the novels connected to each other throughout time, evolving as culture did while still holding onto even the core themes of Gilgamesh.",
                "I now feel equipped with a good overview of the first few thousand years of western literature (as DS promises). I found myself frequently surprised by just how fascinating and strange the texts we read were, even if I should have expected no less. The biggest skills I developed were more effortless close reading--i.e., to pay attention to what's happening in a text constantly, not just when I come back to a page to plan an essay--and writing. Prof McGowan gives great feedback on papers (more thorough than any of my other professors this semester), so I feel like I've seriously improved my approach to essay writing over the semester.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The classroom environment was always very positive, and I think that that was encouraged by Professor McGowan's guiding of discussion. His consistency in gauging class feedback made me feel more comfortable with participating. He would encourage us to propose sections of the text to discuss, and would often start us off with passages that would get to the heart of major themes in these texts. He definitely has an eye for literature and breaking it down into class sessions. Considering the amount of texts we are expected to cover, I would say Professor McGowan's understanding of the texts really shines through. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would say that aren't any beyond the high reading load.",
                "I think the greatest strengths of DS are the reading list, professors, and seminar environment. You read a lot of really cool stuff, talk about it with some of wonderful and intelligent people under the guidance of excellent mentors, and actually are able to interact with other people in your class. Its great.\r\n\r\nThe one ostensible weakness is the reading load, which is hefty but manageable. And, its all interesting so its worthwhile. You will actually end up wanting to read more at the end, which is another weakness of DS (you could teach a whole semester on each of our units), but necessary in such a broad course.",
                "Engaging with the text in discussion was a strength of this course. Another strength was the pockets of in class time dedicated to improving our essays. I really appreciated the time analyzing snippets of past essays because it exposed me to my classmates style of analysis. In turn, this made me more aware of my own writing.",
                "I think the first half of the semester was more engaging than the second. If Prof. McGowan did the whole semester what he did in the second half, an amazing course would have twice such."

                "I would definitely recommend it, and especially with Professor McGowan. Incredibly considerate and in-tune with the texts, he is a great guide through the world of literature that you will get to know in this course.",
                "Absolutely! Now that youre hopefully convinced to take DS, let me say why you should take it with Prof. McGowan, who is really a gem. To start, youll get your essays back within 48 hours, and sometimes 24, with detailed, rich feedback and comments. Youre also always encouraged to meet with Prof. McGowan to discuss the essay, which is even more useful. This consistent, clear, timely, and readily available feedback was invaluable to me as I think it helped me become a much better writer. What Prof. McGowan does, in this regard, is unheard of.\r\n\r\nBut hes also way more than just a fast grader! Prof. McGowan is consistently brilliant in class, nonchalantly bringing up genius points without intruding on the conversation. He does not lecture, rather allowing his students to participate and giving his own thoughts at natural points. He responds to the interests and concerns of the class and seems genuinely involved in each persons success. \r\n\r\nHes also just a crazy nice guy who is super accommodating with conflicts and other issues, but I dont want to diminish him as just that, as he is also really bright. You go to office hours, speak to him for 20-odd minutes, and leave with a fully formed essay topic, coming from solely your own ideas and guided by his prompting.",
                "I would reccomend this course to others. But I have to attribute a lot of my enjoyment to the professor and my classmates. In seminars, professors often make or break the course. Professor McGowan made it for me.",
                "This is a really wonderful course, and I think it's the best out of the fall DS courses. Even though the reading load is quite high, the reading itself is very approachable and interesting for anyone who likes literature.",
                "If you're doing DS, I absolutely recommend McGowan's section. He is an incredibly engaging, helpful, and caring professor.\r\nIf the question is doing DS in general: I'm glad I did it (I'm continuing in the spring), but only take it if it fits well with your academic goals. I came into DS thinking it would just be a good way of making myself read a bunch of books that I wouldn't get to otherwise and that it would give me a nice footing to read and study the books I'm actually interested in. Throughout the semester I've realized that 1) if you're seriously studying literature this definitely won't be the last time you engage with or read most of these texts and 2) there are plenty of reasons you'll want to come back to them. So if you're someone who really cares about lit, I can recommend DS as a really good first pass through the canon. If you're not that interested in the material, it's probably going to be pretty rough--it is a lot of reading. That said, I do think DS is a great way of condensing a humanities education (6 courses might be as tight as you can pack it) for people in other disciplines, so if you can manage this on top of a STEM major or whatever it's a great way of enriching yourself.",
                "I would recommend this course. The classroom environment was great, the texts we read were very interesting, and you take away alot of valuable skills surrounding time management and readings.",
                "DS gives you thousands of years of Western tradition in a little over a dozen weeks. It is therefore not for the faint of heart, and even the sturdy-hearted will have trouble keeping up at times. But this is less of a problem in Lit than in other tracks, because literature in the classroom (at least, as Prof. McGowan's method implied) is all about possibility: how many things can one say about a line, a sentence, a stanza, etc.? how do these readings fit together, stand apart? what do they imply on their own, what do they suggest in conversation with each other? and the wheel of speculation keeps turning. If this seems fun to you (and, contrary to the apparent congruency with a crippling kind of skepticism, it very much is), then this is your course.",
