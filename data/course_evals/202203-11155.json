I learned and practiced every essential skill and language speaker can have. Reading, writing, speaking, fluency, etc."

                "Yes -- only if you have previous Chinese knowledge. It goes by really fast and you'll struggle to catch up if you're really behind at times. It is really rewarding at the end and you'll find yourself loving learning the language.",
                "Yes, I would. It's really satisfying at the end of the semester when you know 400+ Chinese characters under your belt and can apply them in the real world.",
