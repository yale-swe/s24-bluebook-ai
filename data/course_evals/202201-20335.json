                "Learned a lot about the history of New England, but also how history is portrayed in ways that we might not expect or be immediately drawn to. Learned how to read a lot of history in a short period of time as well.",
                "This course was a really interesting introduction to a lot of concepts and ideas. History, the historical record, events in New England, witchcraft, Pilgrims.. this course really probed a lot of interesting historical depths, and the discussions were insightful in more ways than just illuminating the readings. The course really encouraged us to take a deep dive into primary sources, secondary sources, and other ways we represent history. In this lens, you start to question how history works, and how myths\/legends can in some cases become historical events in themselves.",
                "I think my writing improved in this class, although not too much. I grew better at reading older texts, though.",
                "I learned so much about New England (and England) history in general. This was also my first seminar and it was a great experience to learn how to read effectively and discuss topics in class.",
                "In this course I learned about New Haven history, of stories that were proven true and others that held less credibility. We discussed regicide judges, the Pilgrims, the Salem Witch Trials, famous authors, founders of Yale, and much more.",
                "I learned a lot about how to view historical documents critically, as well as a good amount of New England and New Haven history! I also was able to critically engage with nearly all of the sources discussed in class, which I think will be valuable in any future history class."

                "I described the strengths of the course in my \"would you recommend\" answer, but: the professor, the readings, the syllabus, the assignments, and the general organization of the class are all highlights. It's a very well-composed course, ideal in some ways as a comfortable environment to discuss weighty issues of how we tell histories and remember the past. Anyone (not just those interested in early American history) will find this course interesting.\r\n\r\nThis course had zero weaknesses.",
                "There are numerous strengths to this course including its in-depth examination of various New England sources that help students to better understand the true history and myths of New England. The only weakness is the length of reading due before specific classes, such as assigning over 150 pages of reading.",
                "Strengths: great professor (responsive, patient, understanding, very knowledgeable), well outlined, learned from the assignments without them being too stressful.\r\nWeaknesses: a little too much about the pilgrims (but this is a personal opinion), course assignments were vague and therefore it was hard to understand what was wanted of me at times.",
                "Maybe slightly less reading so we could focus on everything we are reading during class time. Discussions were the best part of this class, but I felt like we sometimes weren't able to discuss everything we read, which was often very interesting, because of the amount of reading.",
                "Strengths: Professor Peterson is fantastic. He guides discussions without ever dominating the discussion. Class discussions were interesting, wide-ranging, and never dull. The topics (Puritans, Witchcraft, representation of history and myths) are really fascinating.  The short writing assignments are quite manageable, and there is a lot of freedom to choose topics with the final project. It's an amazing first-year seminar overall. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The readings could be somewhat difficult because we didn't always have context to understand them. Sometimes, we would be assigned primary sources like Bradford's Plymouth Plantation, but it could be difficult for the whole class to evaluate the sources properly without more context about the history of the source, or why it is important. Everyone has a different level of understanding\/depth with American history, so I think a broad survey over some events could really be helpful to even out the discussions. But this is a very minor critique in an otherwise excellent class.",
                "I think this class is meant for people considering history majors\/people who really really like the 17th century of New England, not a strength or weakness.",
                "No weaknesses of this course! It was such a fun course and a great first-year seminar. A great way to bond with fellow classmates as well as your professor. I do wish the syllabus was updated regularly so that students would know which readings would be omitted\/ added to the list.",
                "The course was very well thought out and organized. The only section that was a little less interesting was the one on the Pilgrims. I also think it could be improved in one other specific aspect. Respectively, I think it would have been beneficial to notify us a little earlier about choosing a book from the Yale libraries for a \"history of a town\" assignment. I realized very late in the game what work had to be done and somehow averted a disaster before I had to leave for a tournament."

                "Without question. It is the platonic ideal of a Yale first-year seminar. Take this course, if you are the slightest bit interested in history. It isn't just talking about early New England. It is discussing the basic questions and ideas that motivate historical inquiry, trying to grapple with how we remember things, as historians and laypeople. It is the best course I have taken yet at Yale. \r\n\r\nThe course and its syllabus is also just beautifully crafted. Professor Peterson is a truly gifted writing instructor and lecturer\/ discussion leader. Every reading flows so wonderfully into the next; we were constantly bringing the sources in conversation with one another. He is so enthusiastic for this material, and that enthusiasm spread to the course as a whole. Every class, I would come away with insights from him and my amazing classmates. I felt that the level of engagement in the discussions was extremely high, and Professor Peterson played a huge part in motivating that discussion. Even as we were engaging in serious, deep discussion of weighty matters, everything felt informal. It was the perfect environment for investigating history and how we talk about it. Professor Peterson is also a hilarious guy.\r\n\r\nThe amount of writing you will have to do (for a WR credit) is very reasonable, and all the prompts fit well into the discussions and readings. The reading load was very manageable. The final project has a really open prompt, which is an amazing opportunity to have in a first-year seminar.\r\n\r\nThis is a fun, intellectually fascinating course taught by one of Yale's best professors. Take the course.",
                "I would highly recommend this class to another student, because it was an incredibly informative and interesting class on New England history. The environment is very welcoming and friendly, and Professor Peterson is an amazing instructor.",
                "Yes, it is a good writing credit. The professor is great, he gives good comments, is very knowledgeable and will help you whenever possible. Also, the workload is very reasonable and the grading is fair. I do think my writing as improved after this semester. However, the assignments are purposefully vague which was difficult at times (the professor will explain it as many times and in as many ways as he can if asked though). Also, 2\/3 of the semester is about the pilgrims which I found pretty boring. All in all, I am happy I took this course.",
                "Yes. Professor Peterson is great and understands the student really well, and the material is a lot of fun. The final project was such a fun assignment, I felt able to explore my creativity in a way that wasn't pure english writing, which is super cool to me!",
                "Yes! This course is really fantastic. Even if you're not as interested in early American history, the questions about how history is told and its representation are important -- and interesting -- even for prospective majors in lots of other fields.",
                "I would if you're a big fan of 17th century New England!! Be very sure that you really like talking about Puritans, among other things, for a semester.",
                "Yes yes yes! Professor Peterson is amazing and makes the course extremely interesting. Class goes by so fast and we are always given new perspectives\/ things to notice in readings.",
                "Yes, I seriously enjoyed this class, so I would definitely recommend it to another student. The research we did was very interesting, and we even got to go on a few field trips! The professor was very kind and very knowledgeable as well, so he was a great resource to have.",
                "Yes!! Not only do you get to learn fascinating new things about New England, ranging from witchcraft trials to primary sources about the rich history of New Haven. This class was so wonderful! The writing assignments were reasonable in length and all worked towards helping me become a better historian-like thinker overall."
