   "comments": [
    "I became a stronger reader and writer, and I read a lot of great poetry.",
    "I gained a deeper ability to analyze and appreciate various forms of poetry.",
    "I learned how to analyze poetry through close readings and write papers with an argumentative thesis on the poems that we read.",
    "My close-reading ability poetry sharpened a lot; this is an intro course, however, and I had little experience with poetry in the past. That said, the class really helped me feel more comfortable and confident interpreting poetry, even when it became more modern\/ obscure with Eliot, Stein, and Bishop. The essays that Prof. Eccles assigned were designed for personal growth as the semester went on, and I definitely feel as though my arguments grew even more refined and complex each time around, and the encouraged use of outside\/ third-party resources for writing\/understanding works of poetry throughout the process was an extremely helpful addition to the final essay. I feel as though I emerged with a deepened appreciation for poetry and a greater understanding of what interpreting a work of poetry entails, although I still feel as confused about poetry since the very beginning of the course -- in a good way.",
    "I learned about the tradition of modern poetry, the skills of poetic analysis, and composing analytical essays.",
    "This course really helped me improve as a reader as well as a writer. I became a lot more detail oriented in the poems we read and learned how to put my thoughts into academic work and wording."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Prof. Eccles is one of the sweetest professors I've had at Yale. Extremely nice and helpful, and is great at leading discussions. We also read a lot of great poetry.",
    "I think it's a very good introductory course. maybe have a class where each student could bring their own poem in to foster a discussion about poets not usually featured on the syllabus",
    "Strengths: the course books\/readings were varied and wide reaching; we had plenty of time on each section of the course and I feel that I got to really know several canonized poets. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The grades depend almost completely on the papers, even though most of the weeks were spent with discussions and exercises instead of papers.",
    "I think a lot of the strengths in the course emerged towards the end of the semester, where seminars became more of a collaborative effort for understanding a work of poetry. Specifically, I really liked the critical analysis assignment (where we read analytical works of other academics on the poetry) and the subsequent discussion out of it, the presentation element where students began the discussion, and the workshopping activity for the final essay. I think trying to avoid a routine-like discussion where the professor begins and the students chip in would be a good point for moving forward, and I felt as though the introduction of different talking points such as the critical article or different students' presentation were good additions later in the semester -- but I think the course could do more with that even earlier on.",
    "I thought the course was great at providing information on various poets as well as facilitating discussions among peers. I liked how the homework assignments varied. I feel as though sometimes the class structure was a bit repetitive, but it was in line with most of my seminars.",
    "The course has an incredibly wide range of poems and poets to discuss but I think could benefit from early on lessons about poetic structure and terms so we have a better repertoire of knowledge and terms to use in our writing."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to English majors who need this as a prereq or to anyone interested in English poetry from the 1700's through the 1900's. Professor Eccles is very nice and very helpful, and is very good at leading discussions. I looked forward to coming to class. The workload was manageable; the readings took me, on average, around 2 hours per class.",
    "Yes. I chose to take this course to fulfill one of my English major requirements, and I feel as if I'm leaving the course with a good understanding of the shift in poetry over the course of the syllabus. We read a wide variety of poetry but I did not feel as if I was forced to write on poems that I didn't appreciate as fully as others (syllabus was set up where I wasn't forced to write about Stein, even though we read her.)",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for a class to stretch their horizons on poetry and art.  I am a pre-med student and take many sciences courses.   This class allowed me to engage in a different type of discussion with my fellow students and I appreciated the break from p-sets.",
    "Yes. A solid class that is not too hard and has important material.",
    "Yes, but especially with Prof. Eccles! The material itself is a bit difficult to maneuver and the curriculum isn't particularly linear, but the professor really helped facilitate our different backgrounds and contributions and turned them into a productive, worthwhile course each day. Particularly in office hours, discussing interpretations of poetry was always very interesting and fulfilling,",
    "It's a great intro into modern poetry. You read great stuff and even if you go in not loving the medium (as I did), you will gain an appreciation for it.",
    "Absolutely yes, I think even if someone wasn't extremely interested in poetry this course does a good job of assessing and explaining various strategies in the English language and in creative writing that could be easily applied to other studies."
