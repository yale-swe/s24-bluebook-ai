                "I learned a decent amount about a number of significant policy issues: health care, housing and racial inequality, abortion, climate change... but what was more significant was learning about frameworks for understanding policy. This includes the idea that policy shapes and is shaped by politics, as well as the key concept that the possibilities for new policy are defined by historical policy structures. I also learned a lot about how federalism and the US constitution shapes the arena of policy battles in the US. As far as skills, I learned a huge amount about how to write about policy as one would in a real government role: policy memos and white papers that are concise, analytical, well-researched, and strongly argumentative.",
                "I learned a lot about how policy applies to the \"real world\" and practical skills for future work in policy (i.e. writing a policy memo).",

                "Through this course, I learned the inner workings of public policy and the principles that guide policy analysts and politicians in decision-making. I also learned how to structure and write a policy memo, which I found very valuable. If you are considering a career in public policy, this class will help you decide whether or not that's the path for you.",
                "This course, whether you choose to take it as a WR credit or a non-WR credit, is a writing class. The main skill you learn is how to write policy memos which, if you are interested in government, law, political science, or just writing in general, is invaluable!",
                "This class was a great crash course in American public policy, the policymaking process, and policy history.  It was a very practically-oriented course and I felt like the topics we covered were important and topical.",

There were a lot of political science concepts that we attached real world examples to in class which was extremely helpful. I learned so much about why actors do what they do in politics and what systems they are restricted by.",
                "I developed many insights about public policy which is something that I really wasn't fully engaged in before but now feel like it could be something that I could go into as a career.

                "I learned a great deal from this class. I now better understand terms to identify political trends that I had (or had not) seen in the news. I also gained a much stronger sense of political history and context to different issues.",
                "So so so much knowledge on the US political landscape, structure, history. more than just knowing facts. understanding how the US political system is set up. super important stuff that makes me a more informed voter and made me want to work in public policy.",

                "This class was great, it taught me the foundations of government starting with the federalist papers and moving forward to prominent issues like abortion rights, housing policy, etc. I learned about terms used in public policy that I had never really grasped before like \"path-dependence\", \"drift\", \"gridlock\", etc. I also gained a very useful skill of writing white papers and policy memos.",

                "Strengths: great TF\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes felt like the class political agenda was too preachy, scattered and late assignment admin problems.",
                "It is a good course! Professor Hacker and the guest lecturers are excellent, though I wish Professor Hacker would speak in a slightly slower and more measured way -- he sometimes speaks faster than his train of thought and trips over words and sentences, which can make it hard to follow.",
                "This course is very insightful, but not the most engaging. I really liked being able to work on practical things like policy memos, but sometimes going to lecture felt like a chore.",
                "I think the weaknesses were that there was a lot of political jargon involved in this course, which sometimes made it difficult to understand the issues at hand. I also thought it was a very one-sided and agenda-based class and found it difficult to agree with every point being made as there was a strong political leaning that was not very concealed. As for strengths, Professor Hacker is extremely passionate and wants his students to engage with the readings which I enjoyed. I also thought my TF was super supportive and helpful throughout the semester.",
                "One weakness in this class is that the professor made many references to how policies disproportionately effect people of color, but never went in depth.",
                "I enjoyed the class lectures and found it interesting. Sometimes it was hard to follow along since it became very theoretical at points. My main issue in the class was writing the policy memo; we never really practiced that or discussed it in lecture, so the jump to the first assignment was hard, specifically regarding the recommendations. However, section facilitated this for the second memo and I felt more at ease.",
                "This class is a great survey course on the ways in which public policy in American functions (and doesn't) on the federal and state levels. The lectures are informative, and you learn a lot of political science concepts that illuminate what lies within the complicated entity of government. Professor Hacker is nice and funny, but he assigns at least one article per week that he wrote, and it gets old very quickly. You honestly don't even need to do the readings most of the time because he covers most of the material in lecture. Also, this isn't a normative statement, but it is pretty obvious that he comes at the issues he teaches from a progressive perspective. Do with all of that what you will; I considered the course worth taking!",
                "The policy memos, generally, are not as connected to the lecture material as they could be. I would recommend creating prompts for the memos based on detailed work from the lectures.",
                "Strengths:  I enjoyed Prof. Hacker's lecturing style and the guest speakers he brought in were phenomenal\r\nWeaknesses: The course readings felt a bit disconnected from the lectures at times.  The course also jumped around quite a bit, but this didn't feel overly disorienting.",
                "Strengths: Hacker is an incredibly knowledgeable source for this class, and has literally written the book on half the content we learn about. He brings in great guest lecturers and is an engaging speaker. The policy memos are also a good opportunity to practice your own thinking about policies that are interesting to you. Overall structure of the class is really organized. Cons: lectures tended to blend together, especially as the class went on, and I felt like we often got bogged down in details that I didn't take much away from.",
                "No changes! Professor Hacker is an amazing lecturer - anyone skipping lecture was just cheating themselves.",
                "I like the flexibility of being able to write a final paper or take the final exam. I enjoyed the writing skills that I learned through this course as well.",
                "Strengths: Really relevant and engaging. Professor Hacker is brilliant and the lectures, to me, were really engaging. Really great at taking complex theoretical concepts and attaching them to real world examples. Also, section was a great space to just talk about politics and hear from your peers about their thoughts about complex issues.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Advanced terminology, many assumptions that you would know at least something about the US political system, which many people didn't.",
                "Could offer more diverse perspectives.",
                "I really liked this course, and I thought the memos were very useful exercises. My biggest point of feedback is that I think there should be more interactivity between lectures and assignments. I think it is theoretically quite possible to pay no attention at all in lectures and still do well on all the memos so long as you knew a few readings and key terms. This is a shame because the lectures are really interesting! I would have liked more of an incentive to give them the attention they deserved.",
                "Lectures were fascinating and intellectually engaging. However, there was occasionally jargon that was not explained which could be confusing.",
                "Awesome course. I learned so much, it was super well organized, and the assignments were interesting and helpful. I really enjoyed this. Hard to say how it could be improved, it's such a good experience already and Hacker makes sure it is up to date.",
                "Strength  the faculty is wonderful. Hacker is a really great and engaging lecturer, and Micah, who was my TF, was outstanding. Section genuinely supported learning from class, and didnt feel like a waste of 50 min. I also loved the format of assignments in the policy memo style, it felt more tangible and like I was both learning new content + formatting.\r\nNo weaknesses come to mind.",
                "Strengths: lectures are great. Really well thought out and informative. And I appreciated the variety of topics and the guest speakers were awesome.\r\nweaknesses: it would be cool if lecture were a bit more participatory, and the audience were asked questions. Also, it would be nice if section went beyond just talking about what was said in class or the readings, and raising new points besides just regurgitating what we had just heard.",
                "strengths: packed with valuable information during lectures, gave a broad survey of policy areas that affect our lives and the past laws  and supreme court decision that shape politics today, identified clear actors and how they affect policy\r\n\r\nweakness: sometimes we were introduced to new terms without being taught them.",
                "Professor Hacker is a great lecturer and section was engaging. No improvements!",
                "Strengths: Great content, organized well, manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: Can be a lack of student engagement at times, but that comes with the territory I suppose. Instituting short, weekly quizzes during section (nothing too intense) that go over lectures\/readings is a good way to promote further engagement",
                "Strengths: The lectures were amazing. I looked forward to learning in class. The professors and lecturers were all clearly experts in their fields and very interested in what they do. \r\nWeaknesses: Some things are not explained in detail.",
                "Strengths: great lectures, amazing guest lecturers, the assignments feel worthwhile. Weaknesses: The memo prompts were very confusingly worded and required explanation and advice from TFs to decipher what we were expected to do.",
                "The course has many strengths, mostly that it is so well organized with visiting lecturers and amazing TFs that are there to help you better understand the content. The assignments are purposeful, they slowly expand to give you more control and freedom to research and learn about the things you like. I think a weakness of this course is that it is very biased, the professor often chooses all the content and the visiting lecturers that align with his opinions and I think diversifying the information we receive would allow us to tackle issues more holistically.",
                "While the module construction and topic selection of the class was very interesting, the class suffered from strong biases. Both the Professor and the TFs had difficulty masking their political leanings when attempting to present a neutral image of American politics and government. For example, Professor Hacker frequently presented data on the polarization of Fox News but did not present corresponding data for CNN. The underlying biases were not addressed until the very last lecture. This was particularly problematic in an introductory course, which for many students was their first exposure to politics and government. The guest lecturers expounded upon these biases in their presentations. The \"correct\" answers in the class assignments adopted the objective lens of the class, preventing a more nuanced analysis of the processes surrounding public policy. \r\n\r\nAssignments were not explained and graded in an effective manner. There was very little connection between the class material and the papers students had to write, giving students very little to go off of with little support. This left a lot of uncertainty in terms of completing the assignment and grading. Feedback was few and far between. The Professor and TFs kept assuring students that their papers would be returned shortly but they were returned too late to make substantial changes for the subsequent assignments.",
                "This course is solid, Hacker is a great lecturer and the course content is very interesting and important. The course could be improved by doing a better job breaking down the political sciencey terms (like path dependence, drift, etc) and breaking these big academic ideas into more bite sized pieces. Overall, I really enjoyed the class and it helped me develop a lens to understand policy issues."

                "I would, but only if you are prepared to deal with topics that while I agreed with the political stances being talked about, they were still preached at me. It was the first time that I felt like I was in a Yale classroom with an outside agenda with the guest lecturers brought in, but the content was still interesting. Take this class as a writing credit, you literally do the same amount of work with more TF engagement and feedback.",
                "Yes, this is a course worth taking regardless of your major, as long as you are interested in US policy and understanding why today's politics work (or don't work!) in the way they do. You will come to have much more perspective on understanding, for example, why Congress struggling to get stuff done is not just lazy or bad politicians!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a way to get in a writing credit or to become literate in policy--the writing assignments are very practical and are not traditional essays.",

                "Yes, if you are interested in policy or how to write it this class is very interesting. Professor Hacker is very knowledgable and the things we learn are very applicable to real life.",
                "I would recommend it if you don't already have a solid understanding of how policymaking works in America. Though, I would be careful as this course did not offer many rebuttals for other political philosophies outside the ones that fit the mold of the professor's.",
                "Absolutely",
                "I would if you like the theoretical aspect of public policy -- this was more of an overview on public policy and how it works rather than diving into specific policies themselves, although at times we did that",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is potentially interested in public policy as a career! The readings can be a drag, but the class is a worthwhile endeavor just for the experience of writing the policy memos.",
                "Yes. First, Jacob Hacker is awesome. Hes sweet, kind, and understanding. Second, while it has work, this class is not hard to get an A in. The memos (which are almost the entirety of the grade) are usually given As if you put in decent effort, and they arent really connected to the lecture material (like at all), so you mostly chill in this class, and then gun it for a dozen hours when a memo is due. Just make sure, for the final, you write the paper and dont take the final exam, which is based strictly on the lecture material. In writing the memos, though, you do learn a lot. Writing a memo is a great skill and I recommend it for anyone with an interest in law, political science, or writing in general. Some people say you should take the WR writing if this classI would generally agree. But its not a big deal if you have a schedule conflict and need to take a non-WR section; I doubt its a big difference.",
                "I would recommend this course to other students!  It wasn't my favorite class ever, but was definitely solid and I learned a lot.  The topics we covered are important to learn about whether you are interested in policy or just want to be an informed voter.",
                "I would not recommend this class to someone with a general interest in politics who is not a poli sci major. It got pretty technical pretty fast, and though I think there's a lot to learn its easier to build on if you have some specific policy interest and want to potentially do policy research in the future.",
                "Yes, the paper assignments are interesting because you get to dig into a topic that is politically relevant at the time. The grading is also fair. Overall, I had a fun time with this course.",
                "Absolutely",
                "Potentially, I wasnt extremely interested in the course but if you like and want to learn about policy then yes.",
                "Yes! Everyone needs to understand current politics, and this is the class to do so. You understand the background of all current political debates (healthcare, environment, inequality, abortion, etc) and the theory that underpins everything.",
                "This class is relevant for anyone interested in how policy affects the American population. The class goes into great detail about policy, and is pretty advanced in The terminology used. If you are not interested in political science, you may not thrive in this class. But if you are, it will be interesting and a medium-level courseload made it pretty manageable. Stay ahead of the assignments for sure and if you can, do the class for a writing credit. It will be worth it.",
                "I would not, nobody did the readings, section discussion was uninteresting because no one did the readings, and the course has little continuity. This is probably the worst course I have taken here at Yale, im not trying to be mean, it was just really unengaging.",
                "No",
                "I would because it give you a much better understanding of the most important policy discussions for our country.",

She's super good.\r\n\r\nI do think you need some background\/interest in political science or politics to take this course. You won't get too much out of it if you're coming in with nothing. E.g. its probably best if you follow the news somewhat and at least understand how the US political system works in a vague sense\/",
                "For sure! This class pushed me to want to do PLSC. I especially recommend requesting Micah as your TF: she does a great job and makes herself very accessible for feedback throughout the semester.",
                "Fabulous class. Prof Hacker is super smart and lectures are fun. the assignments are really doable and i love writing in policy memo style.  \r\n\r\nTotally agree with previous reviews that suggest taking the Writing section over the non-WR even if you dont need a writing credit. I had already taken a bunch of WR credits and took the WR section anyway. You get feedback on a draft of each paper so you have a clear path to do well on the memos. I got a lot of really detailed feedback on my writing, more than some of my other English classes honestly. Really helpful to learn to write in polisci style.",
                "Yes, if they would like to learn how to write policy memos and experiment with their own ideas on how to garner support for them.",
                "Yes, if one were at all interested in political science.",
                "Yes, it's a great political science credit. Hacker is a fantastic teacher.",
                "Yes. I think it was a great way to learn how to write policy memos and learn about the US government. Not a hard writing class.",
                "Yes, I think it's a great intro into American public policy. It helped me feel more informed about political processes and institutions and how policy gets passed.",
                "I definitely would! Professor Hacker is a great lecturer and truly knows the content he teaches well. I think the course meets students where they are in their exposure and knowledge of public policy.",
                "Yes",
                "Do not take this course if this is your first exposure to politics and government. It is incredibly biased and it is difficult to translate the class material into the assignments. However, if you have experience in this field and want to learn more, the concepts are very interesting and the assignments are good practice for professional memo-writing.",
                "Yes. Probably the best course out there in terms of understanding how the U.S. government actually functions. Professor Hacker is great, and course materials and lecture are always really interesting. Every single lecture left me feeling like the mystery had been removed from understanding how government gets things done, would definitely recommend, even if political science isnt your wheelhouse.",
                "Yes! Great course for any student interested in politics and public policy. As a political science major, I have written many papers about policy issues and their history, but this was the first time I have written a formal policy memo. This was a great experience and I enjoyed the assignments and lectures. Would definitely recommend the writing section; I had more feedback and felt prepared to produce great policy memos."
