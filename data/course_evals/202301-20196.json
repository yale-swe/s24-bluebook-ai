                "I learned so much in this class, but the biggest thing I took away was how history and its telling is entirely subjective. Historical narratives are crafted by historical actors and creating one coherent narrative of \"what happened\" is extremely difficult. I learned that the ways that history is presented often uphold sociohistorical institutions of power. I learned how to analyze a historical document critically, not just looking for obvious signs of bias but digging deeper into historical contexts, identity, and pairing historical documents in conversation with one another.",
                "I learned a great amount of skills from this class. I took away research, writing, reading, and most importantly, critically thinking skills. This was developed through the course reading and discussions.",
                "I learned a lot about the United States and the legacy of colonialism that it has. I learned a lot more about American history as it relates to American imperialism. I learned to critically engage with sources and examine primary sources with a specific lens.",
                "Comprehensive re-evaluation of U.S. history regarding its colonies and empire. This course really pushes students to think about the U.S. as an empire, not just as a group of contiguous states in North America. It covers a wide span of time and geography in a really engaging way.",
                "This class is an eye-opener! I learned so much about the reality of the US Empire, then and now. I realized that, from Puerto Rico to the Philippines, the effects of American imperialism are still evident in the status quo of the previous and current US territories. The American occupation in their colonies in the early twentieth century was discussed from a more critical view than in usual history classes. We discussed material that are usually too brutal or would sound bad for the American government (I think) to be included in US history classes  or even in Philippine history classes, in my case. This class explained so much of my questions on national identity as a former colony of the US.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the assignments, grading, and readings for this class heavily focuses on analyzing primary sources. We learned how to critically read a primary source, a skill that I will most certainly use in future classes.",
                "I gained a greater understanding of how the U.S. took territories during the 1800s and 1900s, which is important as while the U.S.A. started as colonies, its own imperialist history is not well documented.",

                "I have learned more about U.S. history and world history in this semester-long course than the rest of my years of education combined. I learned about the history of U.S. colonial empire through primary sources, research papers, scholarly articles, and creative projects. Above all, I learned from Professor Akiboh the importance of knowing and sharing this history. I cannot recommend this course enough  take it!!!",
                "I learned so much, not just historical facts and events, but also their conflicting narratives, their interpretations and misinterpretations, and how much history can change depending on who you ask about it.",
                "I gained knowledge in US imperial history from the annexation of Hawaii to the colonization of the Marshall islands.",
                "I learned to process, summarize and think critically. We analyzed primary and secondary sources and created content.",
                "I learned extensively about the history of US Colonialism and territory holdings, that I otherwise would not have known.",
                "I cannot emphasize enough how much perspective this course gave me. I entered with extraordinarily little knowledge about the United States' colonial empire, and I left every class with a much broader understanding of U.S. history and the present-day consequences of this country's colonial presence across the world.",
                "I developed insight into evaluating sources from different viewpoints, communicating complex historical ideas to a general audience, and understanding the past and present of the U.S. colonial empire."

                "Professor Akiboh is brilliant and presents the information in very consumable ways. Her lectures were always understandable; I appreciated how her language was very plain and easy to understand. Our TF Monique was equally brilliant and incredibly approachable. The readings were exceptionally curatedsuccinct yet powerful and I felt like I learned a lot from each one. I never did a reading and had to question why I read what I just read (which has happened in most, if not all, of my other reading-heavy classes). There are also no deadlines in the class which gave me a lot of time to think critically about the content and my assignments and actually learn something from them before turning them in.\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I was honestly just disappointed by my peers' lack of engagement. Our conversations in section weren't always super fruitful because it was obvious that people had not completed the readings or weren't able to think critically about the subject. I'm not sure what could be done to fix this. The syllabus was very clear about being lenient about absences and such (which is good!) but I think this leniency led to very few people coming to lecture which meant they lacked a lot of fundamental knowledge when it came time to discuss the course content in section.",
                "Good professor and interesting lectures. Grading scheme seemed slightly unfair at points.",
                "The strengths are the flexibility and professor and TA; they were all incredibly kind and supportive, fostering a supportive environment for learning through discussion and the lectures. I don't really have any weaknesses to note.",
                "This course is very easy to follow and everything feels incredibly cohesive. I really enjoyed the lectures and learned a lot from them, and note-taking was very easy in this class because of lecture design.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Akiboh's lectures were phenomenal. The research and dedication she put in to lectures was evident; no lecture went over time. Her ability to distill complex historical concepts into a few slides is a trait that few history profs have. The ones who do are exceptional. I also liked the emphasis on primary sources, which made discussions in section really fun as we got to interpret the author and their motivations. Finally, the assignments did SO MUCH for my history knowledge without being overly taxing or stressful. They emphasize all the important skills of history (primary source analysis, writing strong arguments, connecting to the present) without focusing on length or stressing students out. Overall, a very well thought out course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Few. The readings could probably benefit from some secondary sources to give more background on the history, but I understand that this would sacrifice the primary source focus. Also, I personally felt discussion section was usually better as a full group discussion rather than breaking into smaller groups.",
                "The unorthodox structure of the class is both a strength and a weakness. The assignment structure is interesting and more useful for learning skills that are important for communications and jobs; however, the structure also makes learning some of the lessons in the course optional.",
                "I hope there could be mandatory lecture policy",
                "Professor Akiboh relates the course material in an engaging, effective way during each lecture. Her lecture format reflects deep knowledge on the topic, careful organization of information, and thoughtfulness and care for her students. \r\n\r\nAs the course is now, I have no weaknesses to comment on. My sole suggestion is that an interesting assignment could be for students to share their own connection to US Colonial Empire, whether through their family or a friend. I think that this could allow students to learn from the lived experiences of peers and \"humanize\" the course further.",
                "The course was extremely well organized and Professor Akiboh is a fantastic lecturer. I would put her in the ranks of the younger members of the department who have great public speaking skills, so class was always a joy to attend. The sources with which we engaged were also worth reading, and course load wasnt too stressful. Weakness: none",
                "Professor Akiboh is absolutely brilliant and every lecture is captivating. Rather than feeling like a lecture, it feels like an engaging TED Talk where you walk away with infinitely more knowledge than you walked in with. The course material is incredible, and Professor Akiboh breaks down hundreds of years of history in an accessible and interesting way. The assignments are also very fun to do and feel meaningful beyond completing a requirement for a class. There are no weaknesses. Take this course!!! Best course you can take at Yale.",
                "I don't think there were much weaknesses as I enjoyed it a lot, but maybe having more open-ended discussions in section as a whole?",
                "Strengths: Class lectures were easy to follow yet very informative\r\nWeaknesses: n\/a",
                "This is a fantastic course for anyone willing to have new perspectives on American Empire. It has a good balance of lecture and discussion learning.",
                "I think the course was very conducive to learning in that we did not sit for conventional examinations; Prof. Akiboh and TF Monique made sure to create and design assignments that allowed for active engagement with history.",
                "No weaknesses. Professor Akiboh is an incredible lecturer, but most importantly, she knows how to teach. By this I mean every lecture, reading, and assignment was clearly created with our learning in mind (which isn't always the case-- for lectures especially!). I also really appreciated how she began each lecture with an overview of the topics she was going to cover, as well emphasizing the \"key takeaways,\" which were always incredibly helpful foundational context and allowed me to walk away from each class with concrete knowledge. The assignments for this class were also enjoyable-- each one was constructed to best facilitate each student's individual learning and growth, while also giving us the freedom to choose topics that we were most interested in. I've told many people that this is one of the best courses I've taken here, both through its content and structure!!",
                "I appreciated the focus this class placed on evaluating primary sources. Reading the sources assigned for each week helped me grasp the political dialogue surrounding moments in the history of U.S. empire, and the first assignment on comparing viewpoints grounded my interpretation of sources throughout the rest of class and when I was finding my own sources during research for the final project. While there are many history classes that teach how to make a historical argument for an academic audience, Professor Akiboh stressed the importance of community history to a wider audience. This felt like an especially important approach, considering the confusion or gaps in information that often surround conversations on U.S. empire. Professor Akiboh designed her assignments with this in mind, and by the end of the class I felt capable of preparing historical arguments for both an academic audience and a more general audience. The Talking about Empire assignment was one of my favorite assignments I've ever had at Yale. It pushed me to broach complicated history with one of my friends, and I realized that people are often really receptive to having these conversations. \r\n\r\nThe class was an excellent survey of the history of U.S. empire, balancing history from a wide range of different territories and time periods with an in-depth synthesis of the themes these histories illustrate. By the end of the class, I felt like I had already learned a lot, wanted to learn more, and had the tools to seek out, understand, and effectively communicate new information. Since the readings for the class were all primary sources, I would have loved a reading list of secondary sources to check out in the future at the end of class, or maybe suggested secondary source readings throughout. Professor Akiboh mentioned many of these sources in her lectures, but a list or additional sources would have been great too."

                "ABSOLUTELY YES. PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. The history of U.S. colonies and the fact that they even exist is so hidden from mainstream sources of knowledge but is so incredibly important. If you actually engage in this classdo the readings, come to lectures, come to section, pay attentionyou will leave with such an expansive breadth of knowledge that completely shatters your previous understandings of American history but creates a greater, more accurate, more nuanced historical mosaic. The readings are well-curated, relatively short, and engaging. The assignments are incredibly unconventional, lowkey fun, and you genuinely learn a lot from completing them. I think\/hope\/assume that people will be fighting to get into Akiboh's classes in the near future.",
                "Yes I would. I certainly learned a lot from it---that I didn't know about my own country of the US. It is important to understand the US' role as a colonizer in the world, and this class dealt with that with grace and understanding.",
                "Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to anyone. This class is easy to follow, and super interesting. I feel I have learned more this semester than ever.",
                "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. I learned so much and got to do assignments that didn't suck--I felt like everything I wrote had purpose.",
                "Yes! Prof. Akiboh is fantastic, and this course is really engaging without being too taxing in terms of workload. Changed my perspective on American history to encompass more than just \"1898\" when discussing U.S. Empire.",
                "I would recommend it, as it shines a light on a neglected part of American history.",
                "Yes absolutely. No matter what major you are in, this is a super interesting and chill course. The lectures are super well organized, the assignments are creative and theres not a lot of work to do. Its a course that you will find very interesting and have a lot of knowledge yet also a gut because courseload isnt big. Absolutely recommend to everyone!",
                "YES! All students interested in US history and empire should take this course without a doubt. Professor Akiboh will amaze you with her interesting anecdotes and leave you with topics that you won't forget after you leave Yale. You will be able to better understand why Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, and Guam are the way they are today and expand your worldview. You will also be able to contextualize important events in US history like the Spanish-American War and World War II through the frame of US colonial empire. This was definitely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale as a history major. I cannot recommend Professor Akiboh and this course enough! Professor Akiboh deserves tenure - no one else is presenting these topics at Yale!",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE!! I cannot recommend it enough. Professor Akiboh is incredible, the assignments are genuinely interesting, and the lectures are fascinating. Best course at Yale, hands down.",
                "Yes! It teaches you so much outside of the typical American history narrative, and as someone who grew up with that, this class was eye-opening and very, very relevant.",
                "Yes as this class has shifted the way I view the United States as this class has exposed me to the true, negative side of US foreign policy",
                "Yes, Dr. Akiboh is fantastic at synthesizing information efficiently while also taking care to honor personal narratives throughout historical events.",
                "I definitely would recommend this class to another student; the amount of material that I learned was extremely great, the professor and TF were amazing, and I really enjoyed the class.",
                "Absolutely-- I took this my junior spring and can honestly say it was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I think the history of U.S. empire is key for understanding America's military, economic, and social history and the current state of foreign policy. I've noticed that historical arguments often separate military\/economic history from social history, and this class convinced me that a complete understanding of the past necessitates an a synthesis of all these themes: social politics influence military and economic strategies, and those strategies in turn have a social impact. Beyond the importance of understanding this history, Professor Akiboh is a brilliant researcher and lecturer, and it would be worthwhile to take any class with her  but especially this one."
