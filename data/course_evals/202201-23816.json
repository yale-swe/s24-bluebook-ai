                "In this course we took a deep dive into Yugoslavian culture, literature, film, and academia. We covered a vast array of themes and topics. Luckily, because Yugoslavia was a only country for roughly 50 years, even a vast array is relatively pointed and direct. I gained insight into the complexity of Yugoslavia and the Balkans as a region, and while touching on history was inevitable, the course was designed well enough to avoid getting bogged down in the history of the region. My writing greatly improved as there are many writing assignments and Prof. Todorovi is direct and pointed in his critique.",
                "Learned so much about the culture of Yugoslavia and got introduced to many fantastic novels and films from the region.",
                "Introduction into Yugoslav lit and film, academic writing about Yugoslavia.",
                "This class really helped me learn about former yugoslavia as well as how to write close reading papers as well as public facing ones. I also learned about culture is shown through film, literature, and music."

                "Prof. Todorovi is certainly one of the classes strengths. His passion for the material and enthusiasm for discussion made the class an exciting place to be. The crossover between literature, film, and academia also provided a wonderfully ripe environment for cross examination of scenes and works. The class did not have \"one type\" of student, in this class we had art majors, math majors, computer science majors, foreign affairs majors, and classics majors. Everyone brought their own tools of interpretation and as a result the class was always a rich and diverse place.\r\n\r\nThe only major weakness of the class is in its scheduling. I think it suffered from being twice a week. There isn't enough time in between classes to assign new reading and an hour and fifteen minutes each class period isn't enough time as the discussion-heavy seminar format does need a bit of time for everyone to get loose and warmed up. I think the class would greatly benefit from being once a week for two and a half to three hours, giving students more time in between classes to cover all the material and giving more time in class to explore it.",
                "The class discussions were great - even when I hadn't done the readings  (which tended to happen often) I always felt like I learned a lot. Nebo is a super fascinating lecturer and cares about the class so much.",
                "The course was very accessible to those who didn't have any knowledge about Yugoslavia and was well-structured. The materials were also diverse and interesting.",
                "This course was fantastic. The only way that it could have been improved was if there were some shorter readings some weeks, but other than that it was an amazing class."

                "I would 1000% recommend this class to anyone who will listen. Prof. Todorovi is a wonderful and engaging professor and the class is fascinating. Yugoslavian culture is largely eschewed in both Western and Eastern European studies, and its rich cultural output and unique political ideologies are certainly worth exploring. This class is largely run like a graduate level seminar. It is the responsibly of the student to stay on top of their reading and engage in class. In other words you will get out what you put into it. The amount of reading and writing is no joke, and if learning about Yugoslavian cinema, literature, and culture is not something you're actively excited about, this class probably isn't for you. But the reward is well worth the work, and much of this work you'll probably never hear of outside of this class or, in the case of the films, potentially won't be able to see outside of the class.",
                "Highly recommend to any students from the Balkans/Eastern Europe. There are truly no other courses at Yale that engage with the region in such a progressive way. As a STEM major I was a bit intimidated by the amount of readings on the syllabus, but they were all fascinating.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the themes and material listed on the syllabus.",
                "Yes, Absolutely.  This class was really insightful and very well taught. You interact with a variety of different sources and all of the readings were super interesting."
