                "Strengths: The lectures are great and clearly communicate concepts. I don't think I ever felt confused after a lecture and always had a clear understanding of the concepts as they were being taught. I like that Dr. Bennett types up thorough lecture notes which really help when you want to go back and review something. The problem sets are also really interesting applications of the programming languages that you're taught. This class should be listed as one of the options for an introductory programming experience on the computer science major page because it's better than any of the other introductory courses at Yale except maybe CS50 (the quality of each class varies depending on what you're looking for). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There aren't really any weaknesses for this course. The exams are a bit of a time crunch but still doable. The grading on the problem sets can be a bit harsh (which is probably due to the fact that there are some overqualified people taking this course), and I think the rubrics should focus more on fundamentals in programming rather than subjective errors like \"not having enough comments\", but it's not really that big of a deal (just remember to double check that you've stayed consistent with the \"good coding style\" tips that Dr. Bennett puts in her lecture slides). My only real criticism of the course is that Qt has to be the worst IDE I've ever used (sorry if Qt holds sentimental value to anyone reading this). It's just not friendly with Macs and it's not visually appealing in my opinion). I think the course should simply cut the computer graphics component covered in C and C++ (which is the only reason why we really use Qt), lengthen the time spent on MATLAB to supplement this, and move the coverage of C and C++ to VS Code or GitHub Codespaces. I'm yet to meet somebody that uses C and C++ to implement graphics into code, so I don't think it's an integral component to the coverage of C and C++ in this course and moving to VS Code would make things so much easier in my opinion. If this is, in fact, your first introduction to programming, you probably won't notice that Qt is not that great, but if you've been spoiled with good-looking IDEs like me in the past, just be prepared. Despite this, it's still a great course, and if Dr. Bennett continues to use Qt, you'll live.",
                "Strengths\r\n- Teaches useful coding for engineering majors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- Moves very fast, can be difficult for those without prior knowledge",

While readability and memory efficiency are definitely important, in a \"real-world\" setting you might have someone else to look over your code for you and help you fix these errors (but our collaboration policy prohibits this), so taking off so many points for coding style on a code that already perfectly produces the specified output seems a bit unnecessary.\r\n- Maybe spend a bit less time on sample codes in lecture, since we can easily look through those on our own.",

I also found exams to be very difficult, as the timespan of the exam was too short to allow me to properly debug my code. I also found the requirements of problem sets to be a bit opaque, as I often lost a lot of points for arbitrary formatting that did not relate to my understanding of the problem and the correct output. However, this course does cover a lot of material and gives students a lot of practice with each coding language.",

She is obviously dedicated to seeing her students succeed and has so many resources available to help them, including drop-in help sessions, office hours, lecture and super clear instructions. She explained everything in a clear and straightforward manner and always provided examples, such that I was rarely (if ever) confused during the course. Problem sets are reasonable in terms of difficulty and amount of work. The only one that I spent a significant amount of time completing was the final problem set. The material is also super useful for future classes, jobs, etc. Weaknesses: sometimes the lectures were a bit dry. However, this is probably more the fault of the material than the class. Does not help that this course was offered at 9 AM.",

            "comments": [
                "Yes. This course is a fantastically structured intro to CS class, especially for those going into engineering. While most people are going to take this because it's required for their major (myself included), I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good intro to CS class that isn't CS 50. Beth is a fantastic professor; she literally has the most clearly structured canvas page I have ever seen. She provides so many resources to students for use. In terms of lectures, she always posts the lecture slides, lectures are recorded, edited, and posted to Canvas, and you can even live stream into the lecture if you don't want to walk to class. There are also sample codes posted which are invaluable for psets, and she has an abundance of office hours/drop in help sessions with TAs. If you start psets at least a few days before the deadline, they're very manageable. Before each midterm, a full practice exam is posted with the same structure as the actual exam, and she uses one full lecture as a review session. Some people say that the lectures are slightly dry, but I didn't really find that to be the case. I thought all the material was well explained and interesting enough on its own, perhaps not more than average but sufficient enough for me to stay engaged. Overall, this is a beautifully organized class that I would recommend to anyone who doesn't have coding experience and/or needs it for their major.",
                "Definitely, although, I would recommend you have some coding experience in any language of choice just so that your problem-solving skills are well developed before you enter this course. In all honesty, if they cut the computer graphics from this course, I would recommend making this the prerequisite to the computer science major. Dr. Bennett's lectures are very thorough, and she gives THE BEST introduction to C programming at Yale (if you don't know, C is the primary language in the core courses of the computer science major). Dr. Bennett's introduction to C is even better than CS50 (I took both CS50 and ENAS 130) in my opinion because her lecture notes are really good and she provides so many sample codes that you can review and learn from. If you're deciding between CS50 and ENAS 130, I'd take CS50 if you want more breadth in your introduction to programming and ENAS 130 if you want more depth in your introduction to programming. I'd say the workload of CS50 is higher on average relative to ENAS 130, but at the end of the semester (last 2 or three weeks), the workload of ENAS 130 spikes and probably surpasses CS50. The connection with your instructor will definitely be better in ENAS 130, though, because Dr. Bennett actively reaches out to students, hosts frequent office hours, and is very friendly. Once again the introduction to C in ENAS 130 is unmatched and is better than any introductory course offered at Yale in this regard. I also haven't found many courses that use C++ as one of the primary languages, so if you want to get exposed to it, this course is a good option. I wasn't a fan of the computer graphics, but you have to recognize that this class is actually an introduction to computing for engineers, so it makes sense that computer graphics are covered. Also, it's still fun to apply your knowledge of the programming languages to the computer graphics problems and computer graphics concepts are not covered on the exams, so it's not too bad. My only warning to you if you're considering this class is that there are a good number of people that take this course that may have a stronger computing background than you and pretty much ruin the curve. I had been coding for a while before taking this class, so the problem sets were really not that much of a challenge, and the final problem set and project took me about one night, but I definitely think it would've taken me a lot longer had this been my first introductory computer science class (sorry fellow classmates). Also, elementary knowledge in linear algebra and multivariable calculus helped in the sense that I didn't really need to read some of the specifications for problem sets. What I'm saying is that Dr. Bennett is a great professor and you can definitely learn the concepts being taught, but your grade may be brought down by the fact that there are people with a lot more experience in the course who solve coding problems with ease. While this may be hypocritical since I took both CS50 and ENAS 130, I think that, in the future, you should not be able to take this class if you've already taken CS50 because the concepts are similar enough in the two courses that taking either class will be a review of what you've learned in the other, which gives you a noticeably unfair advantage to students that have no experience at all.",
                "No, only take if required",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to learn new programming languages. It is a thorough introduction and so you could take it as a total beginner, but it will be easier if you have experience with object-oriented programming (eg. Java). You probably shouldn't take this course if you already know C or C++.",
                "I would recommend this course for students looking to learn C and C++. Most of the matlab we learned was looking things up on the internet for specific use cases on the psets.",
                "Yes, great comprehensive introduction to C and C++. Only touches a little on MATLAB.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn coding skills that can be readily applicable in STEM fields.",
                "Yes I would! I gained a lot of intuition on how to tackle problems with coding. It was challenging as a first time coder, but there's enough help and resources to get it done. You just have to put in the work. I might be easily amazed, but it was fun doing the psets with graphics. I felt those were especially rewarding.",
                "I feel like this class could be easy for some and potentially the hardest class they have ever taken for others. If you already know about conditional statements and loops, you will enjoy this course.",
                "Yes I would because it will challenge you and you must understand the content and learn how to code in C,C++ and Matlab in order to get a good grade",

                "Yes! This course is an amazing start to coding in the engineering field and will be crucial for any prospective engineer's time at yale.",
                "Yes! Professor Bennett is great and she makes it so easy to learn in her classes. I personally really liked the material and how logical it felt. The workload is totally manageable as long as you start the psets early so that you can attend the less-crowded office hours. Be aware that the pset grading can feel harsh at times (i.e. getting a few points off for \"little\" things even when your code overall works) but overall (like for the final grades) the grading seems fair. Also, if you have any trouble in the course, reach out to Professor Bennett to let her know.",
                "Yes, this course is a good introduction to programming.",
                "Yes, this course was a fantastic programming course and Dr. Bennett is an amazing professor who really cares about her students and wants to see them succeed. As someone without much experience coming in, I attended many help sessions and office hours and really appreciate all the resources she has for students who need extra help. The course is time-consuming and requires a high level of effort, but it is time well-spent. This course is super rewarding and completing problem sets is very satisfying because you can clearly see yourself growing and learning and Dr. Bennett is very deliberate and intentional with her problem designs.",
