    "Cultivated my skills in writing, researching in many languages, and investigating the early modern period through a pre-industrial lens of historical analysis.",
    "Material-wise, I learned quite a bit about the Mediterranean world during the 15-17th centuries, and in particular about Venice during this period. More importantly, this class helped me learn how to pose questions about historical issues and how to engage critically with primary and secondary sources.",
    "I absolutely adored this class - it genuinely made me want to be a history major! The texts we read were completely fascinating, and class discussions were always engaging, as Professor Trivellato seemed to have a real sense of how to direct conversation and inspire us to think more deeply.",
    "Essay writing, historical document reading and discussion skills!"

    "I would say it's a very good History seminar. The material is interesting and organized very well and the readings, a good mix of primary and secondary sources, are very engaging. The workload is also reasonable and very well spaced-out. I can't think of any significant weaknesses.",
    "Fantastic course; do not have any complaints.",
    "Good texts, fantastic professor, fun assignments. Could maybe have better discussions."

   "comments": [
    "Most definitely would recommend this course! An engaging syllabus led by an exemplary professor!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Even if you don't care about the Mediterranean world specifically, this class is very engaging and will make you think critically about primary and secondary sources. It also delves into very important questions regarding religion, gender, race and ethnicity during the Early Modern Era in Europe, which is fascinating.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes! Best history class ever!",
    "This is a great history seminar, especially for history majors looking to prepare themselves for thesis research. Professor Trivellato emphasizes learning how to classify and analyze primary sources and gives detailed feedback on the midterm paper and final paper abstract. It's a wonderful way to fulfill the preindustrial requirement while researching and discussing interesting, relevant material about Mediterranean history as a whole. The readings are not overwhelming by any means, but make sure you do them. Having a limited amount to read each week means Professor Trivellato expects you to know them well.",
    "Great course for history and non-history majors alike."
