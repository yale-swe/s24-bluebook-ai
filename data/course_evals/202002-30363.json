   "comments": [
    "As a language course, I firmly believe that everything we learn is invaluable. Whether strengthening oral skills or learning and analyzing texts and music and art in historical cultural context, I found this course to be extremely informative and pertinent to maintaining and furthering my language skills. I think, however, the most important lesson I learned in this course was to never be afraid to talk and share my opinions. How else can I learn how to talk if I don't talk? Learning a language is all about making the necessary steps to further expose yourself and put yourself in situations where you're constantly thinking in that language, whether conversing or reading or watching a film. This course helped me a lot in becoming more confident in throwing myself out there, speaking off the cuff, and willingly put myself in situations where I'd normally be a little uncomfortable.",
    "I learned French writing skills and oral speaking. The course greatly improve my  use of language.",
    "All aspects of French language skills, especially my French speaking. I thoroughly reviewed grammar and became much more confident in discussing societal problems and French literature. I could also write French with greater precision and richer vocabulary.",
    "How to become more fluent in my speaking and more advanced in my own writing skills by using complex grammar and style",
    "I refined my skills in reading, writing, speaking, and understanding French.",
    "I developed skills in oral comprehension and my language-speaking abilities vastly improved! I feel so much more comfortable watching French films and reading French literature because of this class, Merci Mme Sherak!",
    "I improved my French speaking and comprehension skills and broadened my vocabulary. I improved my grammar and became more at ease with using more complex grammar in speech.",
    "I learned lots of French! A good mix of grammar and vocabulary. The small course size is ideal for improving speaking, but you need to force yourself to talk."

    "I understand that this course is extremely difficult to do online, as it's a very discussion-based class. That being said, I found the level of engagement from everyone, especially the instructor, to help alleviate this awkwardness and difficulty. While I found the 3 1\/2 hour long course to be a little long, I really did appreciate the break in the middle, and I understand that it had to be pretty long since we were only meeting twice a week. The level of work required in the course was pretty high, but again, I find that to be a consequence of meeting only twice a week.",
    "I think the course is well designed, from the materials for discussion to the atmosphere of the class. I really like it.",
    "Strengths: Well-designed, very comprehensive class. The small class size. We read a variety of works from the Francophone world that were often coupled with relevant films. Even though I didn't like all of the films, it felt great to realize that I could understand more and more French directly from films. I also appreciate how Madame Sherak would tell us which questions we should think about before class, so that we could have a more productive discussion in class. A slight weakness: For every essay, we had to submit a first and final draft. However, it wasn't always clear what the grader expected us to change before we submit the final draft. Sometimes the drafts came back with no particular mention of improvements to be made (apart from grammar\/vocab corrections), but the final grade clearly implies that there's more improvement to be expected.",
    "Strengths: Madame Sherak is an amazing and patient professor who will correct you in order for you to get better. By the end, you'll be able to start thinking in French. The texts that we read were also very compelling and I enjoyed discussing their themes and symbolism. All the grammar lessons were super clear and in-depth (sometimes I wish the explanations had been that clear in earlier French classes). You'll be a pro at the subjunctive by the end of this course! I thought all the exercises were really helpful and I was always super engaged in this course. You also get really clear feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much. Obviously online was not ideal but Mme Sherak did a good job of making it work. I would have liked more time to discuss in smaller groups though as I felt that most of our discussions were in large groups. I also wish that we had received some assignments in advance, like the prompts for the oral exam, as it would have given us more time to prepare.",
    "This was an amazing course! I really appreciated Madame Sherak's efforts to keep us engaged, even as we were limited to the digital platform of Zoom.",
    "The class was well organized, it didn't feel rushed and all assignments really developed my language skills through writing essays and emphasis on both thematic and grammar elements of our writings.",
    "This course is well-geared toward improving student's French abilities for those who actively participate in the class activities and work assigned. The course is well designed so that homework has a direct correlation with in-class activities and exams.",
    "Strengths: Lots of vocab, professor does a good job incorporating vocabulary, very organized, quick turnaround on papers, good reading assignments!\r\n\r\nWeakness: It can be difficult to keep up with the fast-paced workload for a five week course. Our professor cut down a few assignments, which really helped me out."

    "Absolutely! Especially if this course goes back to in-person, and especially abroad, this course would be incredibly fun and engaging. I think there were a lot of things that Madame Sherak wanted to share with us had we been in person, and while it's unfortunate that that couldn't happen, this course online was still very fun. I loved the texts we read, the films we watched, and the art pieces we examined. And I also enjoyed the size of the class; it wasn't too big where people couldn't get a chance to talk, but it wasn't too small where it felt like you were forced to say something just because nobody else was even if you had nothing to say.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I would never regret having it. \r\nI really enjoyed the movie Trois couleurs : Rouge, which was assigned in the course. The other books and films assigned are also great work. The discussion in class was also really impressive, and I enjoyed sharing my ideas and listening to others' thoughts.",
    "Definitely, for anyone that wants to improve their French language skills, especially speaking. The in-class discussions and the final oral exam can be very daunting, and the class overall is a lot of work, but you will become much more confident in formulating sentences in French.",
    "Yes, although not online. This was originally going to be a course abroad in Paris and I feel that my speaking would have improved at a much greater rate if I had had that experience. The class is engaging but again, sometimes there were technical difficulties. Madame Sherak is so great and kind though, and she really made this difficult situation work!",
    "Absolutely! I learned so much from this course, and I felt that my level of French increased with every class that I attended and every assignment that I completed.",
    "Absolutely! It's a great bridge course between L4 and upper-level literature classes, and solidifies vocabulary and the strong knowledge base acquired from L1-L4",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is looking to improve their French. This course was engaging, challenging, and fun. You are able to see a direct payoff with the work that you put into the course.",
    "Yes if you need credit or want to go on to read more French literature."
