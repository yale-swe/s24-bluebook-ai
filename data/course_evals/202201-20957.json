I also would love to have the term project be a bit more involved and have a wider scope. Also an emphasis on topics outside of the ones discussed could make the course more well rounded. I envision a introductory week discussing the philosophy of decision making, a methods week discussing different numerical measurements to quantify things (maybe some light econometrics), and then diving into the topics so everyone has a good, similar base to work off.",
