I feel I have been taught to develop a bit more of a backbone in defending my artistic choices.",

                "I felt there was very little time to actually do group exercises together and bond as a collective. I understand that this class was specifically a studio format, but even so, I rarely felt connected to my classmates and it was only through James that we experienced shared memories. Ideally, I would have liked our class bonding to come from our relationships with one another and not as a mere byproduct of the teacher's 1-on-1 instruction with each actor.",
                "The strength of this course was in James instruction, coupled with that of Bobbin, our TA. Their differences in style and expression of similar ideas was very compatible and allowed for different spaces and means by which to achieve your goal. I would have loved to have more opportunity for collaboration and discussion, and perhaps receiving ideas and feedback from class, not least to release some of the tension and intensity and put some of the play back into the performance aspect. But overall it was one of the most formative experiences I have had at Yale and wish I could take it again.",
                "Strength: weekly tutorials with the TF were SO helpful because it was a less stressful environment to try things out\r\n\r\nWeakness: there were not predetermined office hours. I suppose if we had emailed him we could have set up a meeting, but that made it feel like getting extra help or clarification was discouraged."

                "Unclear. This class is not for the faint of heart, or at least, not for actors with fragile egos. You will be challenged in this course and knocked down several pegs, oftentimes in ways that seem fruitless. So take it at your own risk, but I do think the class provides some important lessons on how to act more truthfully.",
                "YES! Best acting class Ive ever taken. You learn so much but dont ever feel like youre busy learning; you just absorb. Ill be drawing on stuff from this course every time I act now for the rest of my life."
