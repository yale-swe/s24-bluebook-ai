I also gained an appreciation for and familiarity with Seneca's unique style, as well as Silver Age Latin in general. Our discussion of the actual content of the letters further developed my understanding of Stoicism and its essential concepts, the relation of Stoicism to Epicureanism, and Seneca's own relation to other philosophical traditions. I also learned a bit about Neronian Rome and Roman culture in the first century CE."

                "This course had many strengths. One was Professor Inwood's teaching manner, which was excellent, rigorous, and specific. Another was the assignments: there were few of them (two grammar quizzes, a midterm commentary project, a final oral exam plus a paper), but each was substantive and thought-provoking. I also enjoyed the precision sought in our translation work. And it was interesting to be in such a mixed undergraduate\/graduate class  the balance actually tilted in favor of the graduate students!\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think there were some challenges created by the class make-up. I definitely learned a lot from the graduate students, but I often felt too intimidated to share my thoughts, since a lot of the discourse was highly technical and philosophical. The graduate students formed a coterie (understandably)  but I think this negatively impacted the class dynamic. Professor Inwood did a good job in trying to balance the philosophical letters with more literary ones, and during the last part of the semester, he created separate sessions for undergrads and grad students. Although I appreciated this idea, I am not sure how well it worked out in reality: a couple of the most vocal graduate students continued to attend the undergraduate sessions."

                "I think this class succeeded very well in its virtual iteration. The translation-heavy bent of this Latin class actually worked very well as a Zoom seminar. I think there were about eleven of us, which was also a good number for a Zoom seminar. Every seminar was recorded  we were encouraged to refer to previous sessions for review. We were given a day to take each of our asynchronous quizzes; I really appreciated that all assessments were given outside of class. Our final exam was orally given in a one-on-one meeting with Professor Inwood. I think it worked out very well. I can't really think of ways to enhance this class's virtual methods. Similar to other seminars, I did notice that engagement was lower than I think it would have been in-person, but I think that's probably inevitable."

                "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who loves Latin. Despite the philosophical flavor of the course, this class was still primarily a language class. Of course we discussed what we read, but most class time was spent ironing out elusive syntax and refining vocabulary. Seneca can be hyperbolic and deceptively subtle at the same time; a precise understanding of the sentence structure and the words themselves is necessary in order to see the larger shape of each letter. I think this course will be particularly exciting to students with philosophical, comparative, and historical interests. My deep engagement with Seneca in this course has broadened my interests in Classics and I feel sure that I will return to the scholarship that I first encountered in this class; for instance, I am still thinking about the evolution of the letter into the essay. Latin can be frustrating and this class demands painstaking precision  and it is all the more worthwhile as a result."
