                "My ability to understand Spanish texts and Spanish speaking improved a lot through this class. I also learned how to better analyze texts, poetry, and plays, especially their symbolism and themes.",
                "I interacted with classical Spanish and Latin American literature for the first time, and gained an understanding of how writing is changed, influenced, and shaped over time. In addition to gaining a greater ability to analyze and interpret writing in different ways, I also was able to interact with my peers in a smaller setting, and gained collaboration skills.",

                "This course is not a course on Spanish language, but rather a course in literature. Yes, the class helped develop my literary writing in Spanish, but more importantly it deepened my insights into texts. Prof. Valis chooses a selection of excellent texts such that even the poetry was incredibly interesting.",
                "The ability to synthesize material and create a strong thesis driven essay, all while expanding my knowledge of another language.",
                "I learned new terminology in the Spanish language (historical, biblical, literary) from regions across Spain and Latin America, historical contexts for different Spanish speaking countries, context about influential authors and poets across Latin America, Central America, and Spain, and effective techniques for analyzing literature in the Spanish language. This class expanded my understanding of literary analysis, teaching me how to incorporate outside ideas (ex. from a relevant essay) to my literary analysis, and provided me with a greater understanding of rhetorical and literary devices in Spanish.",
                "I gained a lot more confidence in my speaking and listening abilities in Spanish, which I considered my weak points before taking this course. I learned a lot about Spanish and Latin America Literature throughout history, as well as the surrounding cultural context for each story and literary movement. I also felt more comfortable doing more complex analyses in Spanish, whether writing or speaking.",

                "I think this class is well-structured.",
                "Sometimes it felt like people didn't engage as much, but Professor Valis always had really interesting points to stimulate discussion. I also just really enjoyed the readings.",
                "Strengths: very engaging instructor, small seminar class, interesting stories, papers have flexible topics\r\n\r\nweaknesses: a lot of reading at times, mostly lecture-based seminars, disparities in Spanish abilities among students, difficult to understand material at times because written in older Spanish",
                "The strengths of the course include exploring a large variety of Spanish-language literature ranging across centuries and continents. I also enjoyed the three separate parts to the class material (prose, poetry, and theater). However, at times, the class felt a bit unstructured and repetitive; perhaps it would be beneficial to add some diversity in terms of class activities. For instance, I enjoyed the last few days of class, when we acted out scenes from a play. Perhaps adding in a few more activities such as these would improve the class overall.",
                "Strengths: good assigned readings, great discussion in class\r\nWeaknesses: feedback could be a little clearer",
                "You get to read a lot of texts, not very engaging",
                "The course has many strengths, from its relatively low workload to its intimate discussion environment. The only weakness I can identify is that the course assumes a certain proficiency in writing. What you come into the course with is what you have to work with; there is no teaching of how to write. Nevertheless, through feedback on essays and office hours, Prof. Valis makes it very easy to quickly improve.",
                "weakness: some students engaged far more than others \r\n\r\nstrength: extremely thought provoking and enriching, as well as enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Professor Valis is a great teacher, class discussions are well-structured, the course material is unique (very different from English literature) and fascinating, and feedback on assignments was clear and helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A very minor detail, but the class might benefit from a bit of review of basic literary devices/poetic forms in Spanish. A review of certain Spanish poetic devices in advance can really help students make sense of plays and poetry when they have never taken a Spanish literature class before.",
                "The format of the course, with each class entirely based on discussing the assigned works, definitely had upsides and downsides. It could be really easy to lose track of what was being said, especially if you don't have perfect knowledge of Spanish vocabulary like I did. There also was not a lot to keep you absorbed in the discussion if you got distracted. \r\n\r\nHowever, I felt like Professor Valis did a good job of creating an environment where I felt comfortable speaking my mind, even if I was not entirely on the mark with my comments. I liked the parts of the class where we were doing something other than discussions, like the student presentations on poems and the presentation of scenes from plays.",
                "Strengths: feeling of being included, easy to understand and contribute, great enthusiasm from professor. \r\n\r\nWeakness: requires texts not provided by Yale.",
                "I really enjoyed the discussion-based format of the course, which allowed us to listen to each other's ideas and learn from each other's insights about the works we were reading. However, the course could be improved if there was slightly more structure in teaching us some of the terminology, which not everyone might be familiar with (for example, if I had not learned how to analyze a poem/la versificacin in high school, I would probably have been quite confused at some point during class)."

                "Yes. This course was extremely enriching, especially since I have never been exposed to Spanish-language literature before. It offered insights into classic texts, which bolstered my love of literature and the Spanish language.",
                "Yes; interesting material and good way to improve spanish",

                "I would certainly, without hesitation, recommend the course to another student. The workload is relatively low, Prof. Valis is incredibly kind and understanding, and the material is incredibly interesting. If you enjoy discussing literature, this is the course for you.",
                "Yes, I think its the most well rounded L5 Spanish course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course was definitely challengingthe literature that we read could be dense and difficult to understand, juggling abstract themes and complex structures all in Spanish. That said, the workload, while difficult, was never overwhelming, the class discussions were fascinating, and the course greatly improved my ability to formulate and understand complex ideas in Spanish. Most importantly, Professor Valis is a great first-year teacher, and she is extremely approachable, offering help to students whenever they need it.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It provided me an supportive, collaborative environment to practice my Spanish speaking skills (and my listening skills) in a small-seminar setting. The course allowed me to explore texts in a manner similar to my English seminar, which was a huge development from some Spanish classes I'd taken previously, in which there was much less of an opportunity for exploration and self-guided usage of the language. We received great feedback from our professor on our essays, and in our class discussions.",
                "This is probably a great class for anyone really interested in getting a good introduction to Spanish and Latin American literature. I never took AP Spanish Literature, but it seems like the works we covered were different enough for the students in the class that did. This is definitely a class where you could not pay attention in discussions and not try to understand the readings, but in my opinion, you'll get a lot more out of participation. The same goes for assignments and the feedback you receive. Overall, this is a good L5 class to take if you're looking to try out a discussion-based seminar class and improve your Spanish abilities with relatively low stakes.",
                "Yes, I think it is the perfect language class to fulfill the required credit while also teaching students what is expected of them when analyzing literature and discussing.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed reading & analyzing the works we encountered as a class, and found it a very insightful & thought-provoking experience."
