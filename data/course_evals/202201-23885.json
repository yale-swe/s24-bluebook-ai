Considered driving variables in the propagation of extremism, the process of radicalization, and defined terms with normative implications to rights, trial, and national security.",
                "Learnt a lot about American extremism, including how it relates to elsewhere, its origins and more recent developments, and what it means for this country.",
                "I learned how to craft a political science argument and write a literature review. I learned a lot of very applicable skills to political science research.",

Our readings were very interesting and gave me a better appreciation for the links between rising right-wing sentiment and militarism, capitalism, socioeconomic status, etc.",
                "I learned a lot about how extremism develops and spreads, and gained some much needed context about its history in the United States.",

                "This course was pretty disappointing -- we never really defined \"extremist\" and much of the literature we read was unsatisfying. It was also pretty unorganized and took forever to get any feedback, if any. Almost every class we had the same discussions. I once didn't do any of the reading and was able to jump into the discussion still understanding everything -- a bad sign for a seminar.",
                "Strengths: strong selections of readings, although some more readings by POC would have been appreciated at certain points in the course. Professor Lotito is great and flexible, which is beyond appreciated in a semester as rough as this one. The topics were all incredibly fascinating and nuanced, and we often ran out of time in discussion. The final paper is also not too bad at all considering you work on it throughout the semester. Weakness: (the reading comment above) and maybe that some more variation in topic and geography would be great!",
                "Strengths: Good readings and overall topics. Also GREAT approach to an essay, with a lot of support in the form of a literature review and then research design leading up to the final paper. Weaknesses: Prof. Lotito did have a baby over spring break, and while he had prepared to not teach us for the first two weeks after that it was still disappointing that he did not give us feedback on our work and frankly we did not have a class happen for all of that time post-spring break. If this were to happen again I would not recommend taking this class unless you have a reason to want to have an easier second half of the semester, because frankly it made it difficult before the break and frustratingly irrelevant for the second half of the break.",
                "I think some more left wing extremist groups could be studied or also compared to right wing extremist groups.",
                "The syllabus could definitely be diversified to include non-white authors\/perspectives as well as more radical and\/or critical theory readings. I wrote a paper incorporating abolitionist theory\/politics because I found that those perspectives were not very prevalent in the course or the literature.",
                "This course was pretty engaging and reading was diverse and interesting. Sometimes because the course was so broad I felt like we didnt get to everything surrounding the issue topic of the week."

                "I would! It's an interesting seminar that is super applicable to the status quo",
                "Again it depends on what you need. If you need a pretty chill class where you write one essay and don't do anything post-spring break, go for it it's a lot of fun. If you need a somewhat more consistent and sustained approach for a class, then find someone else.",
                "Yes, the only thing is that I felt like it was assumed that many students have the same beliefs politically by other peers and I think there could at times be more acknowledgement that there may be some students that have different opinions. Prof Lotito did a great job in encouraging different opinions though",
                "I would, particularly for non-PLSC majors (I am a major and still got a lot out of the class, but I also think that the way the class is structured is very conducive to giving non-majors an engaging and interesting experience). The readings are very accessible yet still interesting\/engaging, and Professor Lotito is VERY good at giving productive feedback and guidance to people who may not have PLSC reading\/writing experience.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone that is curious about extremism in all its forms."
