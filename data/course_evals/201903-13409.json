   "comments": [
    "This course exposed to different works of literature at all different levels, from dense philosophical texts to argumentative writing on all sorts of different subjects. From the papers, I was able to learn more about the art of writing, and also the repeated drafting enabled me to build on my progress. The research essay showed me how to analyze difficult issues and read with a purpose.",
    "How to write an argumentative paper that addresses multiple perspectives. How to write cohesive, interesting, and unique research papers. How to have civil discourse about contentious issues in a classroom setting.",
    "I developed my academic writing and critical thinking skills.",
    "I significantly improved my writing skills and developed a stronger understanding of the expectations associated with college essays. I also learned about different perspectives on progress and moral revolutions, ranging from optimists like Steven Pinker to pessimists like Frank B. Wilderson.",
    "This class greatly helped me to build my writing and analysis skills.",
    "Learn about the proper structure and the content of essays.",
    "Taking this course I learned about various ideas surrounding moral change, examined different historical and modern \"moral revolutions\" through foundational works, film, and other relevant writings. We worked on skills of understanding and analyzing the arguments of others, as well as how to write in conversation with those works on our own. The various perspectives on moral change that we looked at were very insightful and thought-provoking, having roots in different disciplines.",
    "I guess I learned more about topics that I may have never considered since I want to be an engineering major.",
    "Introduction to academic writing. Learn how to construct and evaluate arguments. Readings covered different philosophies and theories of moral change, arguments for particular social movements (i.e. feminism, civil rights, animal rights)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was very intellectually stimulating, and I have very few suggestions for how it might be improved in actual substance. The topic and theme of the course was brilliantly devised, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. At any point in the class, I could see clearly how my reading and discussion connected to the overall purpose of the course, and I greatly appreciated it. The course theme also gave great flexibility to explore topics that I personally was interested in, and that really drew me in and forced me to push myself. The only thing I would say could be improved in the course would be the first paper, as the purpose of the first paper was ambiguous, and I found myself slightly confused by the prompt when I was drafting.",
    "The main strength of this course is the content. Professor Conroy picks readings that are directly related to what we are learning and they are always engaging and interesting to read. We have really good discussions in the class that usually get taken outside of the classroom because people are so eager to continue talking.",
    "This course had very interesting content and captured my interest from the onset. The strengths of this course lay in the format (discussion) and teacher (Mr. Conroy). The course had no weaknesses aside from occasional lack of participation.",
    "The most prominent strength is certainly the discussions in class. The professor is encouraging to shy students and ensures that we cover the important parts of each reading, while still allowing discussions to develop organically. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are comparatively minor, but it was sometimes unclear whether we were answering the questions we posed at the beginning of class, such as what a moral revolution is and how we can know when it has occurred. Still, I appreciated both the breadth and depth of our readings.",
    "This course was great for building a foundation in writing. We read a lot of very interesting essays and books. I think the level of guidance with my writing could have been increased and I would have benefited from that.",
    "The readings and class discussions that served as the backbone of the course were definitely its greatest strength. All the pieces we looked at were extremely interesting and relevant to the topics at hand, and that made class discussions much more engaging. The reading load was never overwhelming, and for the most part writing assignments were well spaced-out. In terms of potential weaknesses, I do feel that there was less of a direct emphasis on improving writing skills than I expected going into the classthere is a greater focus on the ideas being put forwards. I think that in the future a more equal balance could be achieved between the writing and analyzing elements of the class, although I found the greater focus on ideas to be much more interesting and engaging. I think that it would be ideal if the two elements could be more smoothly blended.",
    "The strengths are the in depth discussions. The weaknesses are the fact that we have all of these papers, and they get corrected. The issue I see is we dont build off of that. You just submit the paper and then it doesnt matter anymore. You dont learn as much from your mistakes.",
    "+ Interesting reads, interesting class discussions.\r\n+ Received thorough feedback on papers\r\n- Class discussions would often run over the alotted time, so we didn't have as many opportunities to workshop our writing in class.\r\n- 4-5:15PM is a really late time slot. It would have been nice if the class was scheduled earlier in the day."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the topic is very engaging, and when I took this course with Mr. Conroy, it was brilliantly executed by the instructor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class and wish I could take it again myself. I learned how to put various philosophers and theorists in discussion with each other while adding in my own perspective. This class made me more confident in my writing abilities.",
    "I would recommend this course. It incorporates a wide array of moral issues and examines the causes behind them in a way that is never stale and always building on top of the last unit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in pragmatic applications of complex philosophies, or for students interested in finding logically coherent theories of dignity or rights.",
    "Yes this class was very interesting and beneficial.",
    "I would if they are under consideration of majors that may not have to deal with these types of topics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it pushed me to think more critically about arguments and it introduced me to topics in critical theory that I probably would not have explored otherwise. Listening to my classmates' ideas also pushed me to view moral issues from new perspectives."
