                "This course was amazing! I can't believe how much we learned and how fun this class was. MB&B 050 is a comprehensive overview of cancer biology. Some of the topics we covered include Src and tyrosine kinases, Bcr-Abl and CML, Ras, carcinogens, Rb, p53, telomeres and telomerase, metastasis and angiogenesis, cancer immunology (immune cell blockade, CAR T-cells) and breast cancer genomics. We also learned many experimental techniques including gel electrophoresis, site directed mutagenesis, immunoprecipitation, FISH, PCR, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA interference, and CRISPR-CAS9, among many others. This course taught me how to better read scientific papers and analyze data. Additionally, I learned how to write a research grant proposal and was able to improve my presentation skills.",

In a nutshell, essential skills that any scientist needs.",

                "Strengths is that Dean Chang is a fantastic professor on the history and building blocks of cancer research his enthusiasm, his research expertise (especially on telomeres), and his clinical oncology stories helped us understand how subtle changes to our molecular biology impacts people's lives. The class trip to NYC was great. \r\nSince Dean Chang's academic interest is in cellular aging/death, I think some of the later lectures, such as on breast cancer genomics or immunology could be a good opportunity to bring in Yale researchers or outside experts to speak on the field.",
                "Strengths: This course was amazing! Dean Chang is very knowledgeable and passionate about cancer. The material itself was very interesting and the course is well organized. While learning A LOT about cancer biology, we also learned to read scientific papers, analyze data, write a research grant proposal, and improve our presentation skills. Although the material is challenging, Dean Chang is very fair about workload, grading, exam difficulty, etc. which made the course very enjoyable. It was also helpful being able to collaborate on psets with group members. Dean Chang kept students engaged by having interactive lectures, weekly student presentations, a review game, etc. We also took a class trip to NYC which was very fun and allowed the class to bond! By far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. Weaknesses: None!!",
                "really fun and interesting",
                "Course format, organization, and homework were all great.",
                "Extremely well-structured course, emphasized collaboration, p-sets and exams were fair and really helped develop skills fundamental to a scientist",
                "The seminar format was really effective at getting us to be engaged. I made a lot of close friends here and as such the class was really valuable.",
                "Every class was very engaging and I always learned something new. It was definitely challenging but rewarding.",
                "Strengths: Dean Chang is an amazing teacher and he makes this class really enjoyable. One develops useful scientific knowledge and skills that can be applied into any biological field. Incredible cohort of peers that one can learn a lot from. Fun activities that make the course even more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course can feel intense at certain times, especially in the beginning. However, you get used to that as you write p-sets and read papers every week going on.",
                "Dean Chang is the greatest strength of the class. He is a phenomenal professor. He is an engaging lecturer who encourages any and all questions from the class. It is clear how passionate he is about the material and that makes it so much more exciting to learn about each subject we cover. I also like that we were asked to read \"The Emperor of All Maladies\" before the semester began because it was fascinating to have some of the historical context for the topics in cancer that we would later study the science of.",
                "This was the best course I have taken at Yale so far. I loved how in-depth and engaging the course material was in addition to the community of the class."

                "Yes, I'd. As Dean Chang put it in the beginning of the course, if you put in the needed effort in this course, you will gain a lot. It is definitely worth it.",
                "Absolutely. This is hands down the best class I've taken at Yale (and probably in my life). Although the material may be difficult, the lectures, in-class presentations on papers, and problem sets really help build the skills you need to propel you into science at Yale and beyond.",
                "Absolutely. This course teaches you how to read research papers and goes through landmark papers in cancer biology. For me, it likely changed the direction that I might want to head toward in the future.",
                "Yes I would. I developed a lot as a scientific thinker and experimenter. It also reminded me of why I love biology and research by giving me the opportunity to ask questions and dive into complex topics."
