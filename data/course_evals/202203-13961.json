As an international student whose first language is not English, this class has made me much more comfortable with my writing and ability to communicate through writing. The assignments are designed to improve the students writing while also letting them explore topics they're interested in. An overall great course!",

I felt like the class built on itself, which was really helpful because I worked up to writing longer papers after starting with shorter papers. I really appreciated the class conversations and group work. I was able to learn a lot from my peers in this class, in addition to our professor. The entire class was encouraged to participate during class which kept classes very interesting.",

This helped to make the grading process objective.  \r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes class discussions could be dry because participation wasn't the greatest but the topics that we were discussing always had substance.",

The class discussions were always enlightening and I truly feel that I learned so much about myself and my values from this class. If you can, take the class.",
