                "the course was great, incredibly engaging and the lectures were consistently clear, informative and interesting",
                "Spring DS literature definitely has a good selection of works: while you (of course!) want to spend more time on just about all of them, it's a good mix of works that hits a lot of the big ones. Prof. Valis was also clearly deeply excited to be teaching this class and these texts, which is always a benefit. For me, the biggest weakness was the feedback we received on our papers - it was far less comprehensive than any of my other 5 DS classes last semester and this semester, which both didn't help me become a better writer and frequently left me wondering why I had received a certain grade (either positive or negative).",
                "We moved very quickly through authors, but that's the nature of DS.",
                "I believe that a strength of this course was how engaging it was. Specifically, how the students are prompted into discussing some of the major questions regarding the work they are studying and collecting each others' ideas to help their own understanding.",
                "I thought the discussions had an incredibly open and welcoming environment! The class culture was the greatest strength. I suppose discussions could have been a little more guided/focused on occasion just so we could cover more thematic ground given the limited time with each text.",
                "The syllabus and discussion formats were great! I loved almost all of the texts this semester and would gladly revisit them. That being said, perhaps the faculty could cut out some of the less pertinent texts since we already move so quickly and are unable to discuss most of what we are assigned to read.",
                "More poetry!",
                "Strengths: Fantastic texts, available instructor, and constructive discussions/lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of reading, which takes away from the significance of individual texts when only a day or two are spent discussing them",
                "Strengths: well-directed discussions, important and interesting texts, good thematic development in the curriculum and in the choice of texts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "Most of the books on the syllabus are really enjoyable to read. The problem is that there's just so much reading that it's hard to find time to really appreciate them because you so often have to either skip parts of the reading or speed-read."

Although I personally enjoyed the fall semester of DS literature more than the spring semester, I think that's largely just because I love ancient literature, and the spring semester is well worth it after having done the fall semester. Prof. Valis is a perfectly decent instructor to guide you through the texts we read.",

                "Yes! Anyone with an interest in literature, humanities, or reading/writing would love this course and find it very valuable.",
                "Yes - its a great continuation of the first semester and I loved the syllabus!",
                "Definitely! A great foundation, and especially with someone as engaging as professor Valis",
                "As long as you are willing to put in the time and effort, this class is worth it. DS as a whole is a significant commitment for which you have to be all-in.",
