                "Strenghts: Prof. Boorman is extremely knowledgeable and extremely invested in his students. He would constantly offer to meet 1on1 to discuss topics that interested us, and was always willing to take questions and engage with our interventions. The readings are also not that hard and distill some interesting concepts that, even if they might seem pointless at first, you quickly understand their value to understand and evaluate policy. The class is also very organized around table 6.1 and leaves you with a solid baggage to use in the future\r\n\r\nCons: Lectures could be better organized. Although Prof. Boorman's tangents and anecdotes are interesting, I felt like some of the more technical content (both historical and mathematical) could have been covered more thoroughly if these tangents were kept shorter.",

The only caveat I would offer is that the \"vision\" the course supplies is one that you may not resonate with. But if you do, it will be an excellent experience. Also, Professor Boorman may be the smartest man I have ever met, and this shines through in the class."
