   "comments": [
    "Speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. I would say that I developed the first two skills more so because the class was entirely conducted in Spanish. Also, as some students were native speakers, it felt like a more immersive experience and there were less people stumbling their way through sentences.",
    "My Spanish speaking\/writing skills improved so much during this class!!!",
    "Speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish.",
    "I thought this course did the best job at improving my spanish reading and comprehension. The readings, if done properly, are challenging but good a reinforcing the grammar concepts you need to know in a natural way.",
    "I learned how to read, write, and speak in Spanish with greater confidence and fluency.",
    "I improved my Spanish writing and speaking skills particularly regarding grammar and vocabular.",
    "I was able to develop college-level Spanish writing and grammar skills. I also gained the skills needed to pursue research in Spanish through research paper assignments. I was exposed to different forms of Spanish-language media from different corners of the globe.",
    "I gained a lot of practice with speaking Spanish conversationally and writing with fewer errors. There was a good mix of readings\/literature and grammar review."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a weakness is that some material is covered incredibly fast, and the readings are all very similar to each other. I think a strength is that my instructor was amazing and the videos\/films we watched were very interesting and helped to deepen my knowledge of not just the language, but the culture as well.",
    "Strengths: makes you learn so much due to the workload, my professor was amazing!!",
    "No evident weaknesses; you have to write a lot, but it's spread out over lots of different assignments so it's very manageable.",
    "The grammar instruction was just okay. If you feel like you need to improve your grammar, you will have to spend a decent amount of out of class time with the professor or doing your own studying. I think the strength of the class is the variation in the type of work. It is a mix of watching movies, submitting oral video assignments, writing essays and doing grammar exercises, so it never felt too boring.",
    "Profesora Symons was such a great teacher and made it so easy to feel comfortable speaking in class. Our discussions were really interesting and made me a better speaker and listener. The writing and speaking assignments were challenging and improved my skills a lot over the course of the semester. I wish we were assigned much more vocabulary to study, especially early in the semester  there wasn't enough vocabulary in the textbook and course packet to make me feel prepared to speak and write fluidly on a wide range of topics. And I would have liked some more targeted speaking assignments to practice some of the advanced grammar.",
    "This course was effective in incorporating new concepts and vocabulary into lessons with practice.",
    "The greatest strengths of the course could be found in the professors willingness to ensure that no one was left behind and the group activities like debates or presentations that allowed the class to practice communicating with one another.\r\n\r\nOne minor weakness of the course would be that the course packet seemed to have typos here and there. Again, nothing serious, but nonetheless distracting.",
    "One strength of this course was that classes were generally discussion-based, but there were lots of different homework assignments to practice different skills. For example, we had short compositions, discussion posts, oral assignments, and grammar reviews. One weakness was that there were a lot of schedule changes in the second half of the semester that made it difficult to keep up with what was due."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but the course is a lot of work. I would recommend it if a student really wants to strengthen their Spanish skills (especially grammar).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you want a Spanish class that will push you to the next level. It was a lot of work but so rewarding because I could see how directly my efforts turned into results! If you're looking for a fifth class to fulfill a language requirement, I don't know if this is the class for you--it is a significant amount of work. The workload was manageable though!",
    "Yes; it's pretty fun and is a good way to improve grammar and writing.",
    "Yes, I think this a good course if you are trying to improve your Spanish. Sometimes the homework can take a decent amount of time, but in the end it is to improve your Spanish. So, if you don't plan on actually dedicating time to thoroughly do the work in the class, you won't get too much out of it and i wouldn't recommend it.",
    "This class is challenging but very rewarding  there's a pretty constant stream of work over the course of semester, but it really helped me improve. The readings and films are generally really fun and there's a lot of discussion time in class, which is a good chance to practice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a Spanish student seeking to improve their writing, reading, and speaking skills. The material of this course was engaging, and it was easy to incorporate new concepts with the assignments given.",
    "I would recommend this course to other native Spanish speakers like myself. It was a great way for me to refine my skills and challenge myself to speak in an academic setting. I am able to hold longer, more meaningful conversations with my friends and family.\r\n\r\nI also highly recommend this course for people learning Spanish as a second language. It is highly engaging and allows for the exploration of the language as it is used by a variety of nationalities spanning Latin America and Spain.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because it was a good introduction to L5 Spanish. I enjoyed how we spent more time around readings and discussions with just enough grammar review to keep us refreshed on it. The workload sometimes seemed like a lot, but at the end of the day, the work was less challenging\/intense than my other classes, so it was manageable and easier to do."
