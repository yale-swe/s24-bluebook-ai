                "I developed a lot of practical knowledge by taking this course. I was intimidated to take it as a junior, as it is a senior seminar, but felt that I learned a lot regardless. Both Professor Pascutti and our TA, Ahyan, were very knowledgeable and helpful, and the slides, while about complex topics, were interesting and easy to navigate. I learned the details of the 2008 financial crisis and how the United States banking system works, from topics such as shadow banking through the inner workings of Government Sponsored Enterprises such as Fannie and Freddie. I gained both qualitative skills such as how to navigate the nuances of government regulations, along with important quantitative skills such as bond math.",
                "I gained a thorough understanding of the US Banking System, especially what makes it so strange and vulnerable.",
                "I learned a variety about banking regulations, bond math, and current events. If you're interested in finance, particularly in how financial institutions operate, this is a fantastic class.",
                "It was helpful but the final exam was so hard and so long! it feels like they just increased the hardness like crazy from Quiz 1 to Quiz 3",
                "Overview of banking system. Includes legislation to regulate certain financial factors, financial products, real word financial examples (Elon and Twitter, inflation)",
                "I learned how the banking system in the US works, examples of banking policies in American history and the impacts of those policies, how to price bonds, and how to think about policies and current events in finance through a more informed lens.",
                "Taught me how the government and banks work as a whole in the economy.",
                "learned how diff security transactions work like repo and haircuts. learned about the US banking system, actors in it, diff between commercial and investment banks, MMMFs, and diff policies and actions taken by regulators like FDIC, SEC, and Fed during the crisis",
                "history, function, and regulation of banks and entities which perform bank-like functions in the US",
                "I learned the inner mechanics of the U.S. financial system as well as some incredibly interesting information about current events.  This is a phenomenal course that teaches you all about how finance as an industry actually operates.  You'll learn about different institutions, the risks they take, how they're regulated, and how they fit into the broader system as a whole.",
                "Had a thorough understanding of the US banking system, history and the financial crisis.",

                "I thought that Professor Pascutti was a great seminar leader. His slides were very well organized, and he is an engaging professor clearly passionate about the material, especially important in a seminar. The three quizzes, while challenging, helped me keep up with the material, and each class was filled with useful information with corresponding examples. My only suggestion for improvement would be that the course felt very grade-heavy at the end. While I completed reading responses and quizzes throughout the course, the final paper and exam felt like a lot when given at a similar time, especially when they counted for so much of our grade.",
                "Strengths: Professor Pascutti is an extremely engaging lecturer. Great, often funny anecdotes and interesting commentary on current events. The subject matter is also very relevant for understanding the current economy.\r\nWeaknesses: With Pascutti, the class is not particularly well-organized. He jumps from one topic to another, and it's sometimes hard to follow. The tests are sometimes strange, too; for example, the second test was almost entirely on bond math, but we spent almost no time on bond math in class (and bond math is only somewhat relevant to what we're discussing with the US banking system).",
                "It's a fun course to be in with all the current events Professor Pascutti likes to talk about. Weakness, the course seems difficult to follow at times/doesn't seem to be organized extremely well",
                "The weakness of this course is also its strength, in that it is pretty unstructured. This is because Professor Pascutti wants to take the course where the students are interested. At times we went on tangents, but in the best of ways.",
                "Strengths: useful financial knowledge, Weakness: hard content, lectures not that clear",
                "Weaknesses: quizzes felt really hard at times. A lot of work: three quizzes, final project and final. Maybe add in psets instead of quizzes",
                "Professor Pascutti and the TF (Ahyan Panjwani this year) are the strengths of this course, as they have some of the best teaching skills I have seen at Yale. There could be more feedback throughout the course, but overall have no complaints.",
                "Readings could be shorter. Some of the slides can be more brief and simple.",
                "strengths are prof. weaknesses are somewhat scattered content and specificity on exam questions",
                "Strengths: when we talked about current events as well as how banking related to past events (like the financial crisis)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is very little organization to the course and teaching and the content of the tests could be sort of a wildcard. Also some of the more dry lessons about very specific banking regulations or things like going through the fed balance sheet",
                "The course is great in that it balances learning material and current events very well.  We spent roughly half of class covering each, and each informed my understanding of the other.  I also think the course is great in covering historical events such as the global financial crisis, and it's a very manageable workload.",
                "Professor Pascutti is an amazing professor who makes class very engaging. The material is also interesting and I like how the professor ties it to current events. A weakness is that the quiz and test dates aren't decided until a few weeks before it occurs.",
                "strength: truly learnt a lot and am now literate in terms of banking/finance \r\nweakness: sort of unorganized sometimes (quiz timing/lec content)",
                "It specifically focused on finance, and taught material that is directly helpful for people intending on a career in finance. There are some guest lecturer events as well throughout the semester, and I really enjoyed them. There were not much weaknesses."

It was an engaging senior seminar with a considerable amount of work but not overwhelming, and the skills that I gained were very practical. Both the professor and the TA were very helpful, and I feel that I gained a lot by taking this course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone going into finance. It provides great knowledge for going into the industry, and Pascutti is a fun and engaging lecturer. Workload is manageable (mainly just readings and short responses every week), although it's annoying that you have effectively have 3 midterms (\"quizzes,\" but they're collectively worth a fair portion of the final grade) to study for. Beware that Pascutti courses are not as organized as others - he will jump around. But it's worth it; he has great insights and is passionate about the subject matter.",
                "Yes, overall its a good course, especially in the ECON major. Pascutti is extremely fun to listen to in class and makes the interesting things very interesting and at least acknowledges the boring stuff as boring.",
                "Absolutely - it is both practical and interesting. This was a wonderful culmination of everything I've learned about finance while at school, and I think it has better prepared me for work ahead.",
                "I would not really recommend this course to another student. If I remember correctly, the prof started out the one of the first classes saying that most of us were going to get Bs (so I was like yikes and tried to change to another seminar but there was no more space in the other ones I wanted). The topics are not that hard if you listen but especially the last quiz and the final exam were quite brutal. The questions were niche and had us apply knowledge to things we hadn't gone over in class in depth. I feel like it benefited the people who are EXTREMELY interested in finance and all its jargon anyway (much harder than anything you'd need for an investment banking interview). I didn't think it was the most crazy amount of work, somewhat manageable, but I feel like at one point I was just thinking I need to pass this and did not care about the grade anymore since I was so stressed. The final paper was also just too long and not properly announced or emphasized in my view.",
                "Yes if you want to gain an overview of the financial system which will help to contextualize any finance internship",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students at Yale. It is critical to understand banking to understand history and politics, let alone finance.",
                "Yes, very good course to learn about economy and financial markets.",
                "yes if ur interested in the topic, willing to stay engaged, and put in the work",
                "If you are interested in the history of the banking system and the functions of banks, and don't mind having a disorganized lecture style and some dryer lessons on bank regulations.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  As someone going into finance, I found the course very insightful and more engaging than other classes offered at Yale.  Professor Pascutti is wonderful and makes class very engaging.  I also think the course truly gives you a greater appreciation for banks and the types of risks they manage.",
                "Yes. As a senior, I can wholeheartedly say that this is one of my top 3 classes I've ever taken at Yale. The challenging nature of the course, immense knowledge I've gained, and the engaging class environment really made it a memorable class.",
                "yes, if you want a career in finance, very useful",
                "I would only recommend the class to people intending on going into finance, as the information is field specific."
