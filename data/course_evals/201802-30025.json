    "I developed laboratory safety skills and basic technique skills by taking this course. Safety was heavily stressed, with good reason.",
    "I developed some of the basic skills required for work in a standard professional laboratory.",
    "In this class, I learned a lot about how to properly work in a lab setting. Specifically, organic chemistry lab techniques, such as filtration, IR spectra, and extraction, were incredibly useful to learn, as I am planning to take the second half of organic chemistry in the fall.",
    "I learned a lot of practical skills and even life skills through this course. I am extremely impressed at how well I was taught in this course during such a short period of time.",
    "It was a good baseline class. Felt that I gain a lot of skills.",
    "I gained knowledge (and skills) regarding different lab techniques and equipment used in lab.  We also briefly discussed some basic chemistry concepts during lab.",
    "I learned a lot about lab procedures, organic chemistry, and scientific writing.",
    "New techniques for organic lab such as separation, IR spectroscopy, and MP reading",
    "I learned the basic lab skills and lab techniques for organic chemistry"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The course teaches safety and technique skills very well. The experiments are straightforward. The requirement to write experimental plans ensures that students know what they are doing and why throughout the experiment.\r\nWeaknesses: The number of formatting requirements for all assignments and especially for lab notes can detract from productivity.",
    "Fantastic all around. No complaints whatsoever.",
    "This class allowed students to work very independently in the lab, which I think was very important in building the confidence of students being comfortable working in this type of environment.",
    "This course provides a safe space for students to learn entirely new skills with plenty of support and ways of dealing with failure positively. I cannot at the moment think of any criticism aside from sometimes unclear feedback.",
    "The first few weeks were a bit boring but because it was summer it was good.",
    "It is well organized - the course packet is very helpful and a sufficient organizational tool.",
    "I think this lab overall has a good structure. I think it may be helpful to have students do more lab-report type scientific writing rather than just answering questions in their post lab assignments, but I hear this happens more in the second semester anyway.",
    "Lot of busywork and repetitive tasks such as having to write the procedure multiple times for",
    "Making the pre-lab sheets were a weakness because I felt as though they were unnecessary. The safety data sheets were a strength."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It teaches lab safety skills that are essential for any teaching or research lab setting. The workload is completely manageable. The experiments are interesting. Expectations for submitted work are made clear, and the grading is fair. The formatting requirements for all submitted work can be annoying, but the assignments themselves are straightforward.",
    "Yes. A fun, interesting, and helpful course. It is especially fun to take this course over the summer!",
    "Yes! Organic Chemistry Lab is a lot of fun!",
    "Yes, it's a great stepping stone to further lab work and teaches a variety of essential skills in a controlled environment. I also found it to be fair and very fun.",
    "Yes. Over the summer it is very fun and very relaxed.",
    "Yes.  I learned a lot as a result of taking this course.  It was enjoyable at times.",
    "Summer orgo lab was very chill, and because it was so small it gave you an opportunity to personally know Christine and for her to know you which is great! Also, it did not feel as intensely compressed as the orgo lecture. The pace was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it to students who have to take orgo.",
    "No, since it takes place right after lecture and discussion, leaving little time to rest in between. Time it takes to work on experiments can be exhausting.",
    "Yes!"
