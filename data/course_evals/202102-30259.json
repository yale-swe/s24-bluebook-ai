                "More Italian, of course! This course seemed to be more of a review of L1 and L2 concepts, but maybe that had more to do with my instructor last semester preparing us for L3\/L4. The amount of new content was not large. Overall, we spent most time becoming more fluent.",
                "I further honed the skills I learned in L1 and L2. You do not really learn any new grammatical concepts in L3. The course really focuses on expanding vocabulary and practicing the language more. Our class in particular focused a lot on Italian culture, which was really nice to learn about.",
                "I gained a deeper knowledge of Italian culture and practiced fluency in the language.",

                "Very strong at encouragement and strengthening understanding.",
                "The course's strengths included a flexible, compassionate, and understanding collection of instructors who were willing to work with you and whatever your situation may be.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness was that it started a little early for me because I was in a time zone 3hrs ahead of east coast time. Other than that, no complaints!",
                "Strengths: they made online learning relatively enjoyable, lot of conversational practice and improvement, cultural segments were great, the professors are amazing!\r\nWeaknesses: 2hrs a day is a lot, but thats not their fault",
                "It's miserable waking up so early for a long class every weekday, especially if you have a time difference. Otherwise, I can't think of another way to improve the course. I think it was assembled really well and drove me to become a better speaker of Italian even though I don't really have an academic interest in it!",
                "The course was structured very well, and we always knew what to expect. Once we got into the rhyme of the course, it flowed very nicely from week to week. Classes were always a lot of fun and super engaging. Simona and Sarah were very passionate and caring professors who really wanted their students to do well. Class was dedicated to practicing our conversation skills, and it was the perfect balance between pushing us but not being an overly stressful environment in the case we didn't know something.",
                "The course has zero weaknesses. Each class is explicitly outlined with the content to be covered and grading was prompt.",
                "Strengths: Sarah and Simona take turns teaching the course, so it was nice being able to experience both of their teaching styles and experience a variety of activities. There's a strong focus on reading literature and conversation practice, and my skills improved greatly because the vast majority of the grammar topics were covered in L1 and L2. The class environment is very fun and laidback. Weaknesses: The course activities can feel a little repetitive at times, but overall they were really well-selected and enjoyable"

                "Yes, if youre taking Italian I highly recommend L3 and both Sarah and simona!",
                "The instructors did a GREAT job in teaching us some of the more nitpicky things of the language to build our fluency. You have a lot to look forward to.",
                "Yes, absolutely! The Italian department is incredible, and this course was no different. Sarah and Simona are great professors, and you will learn a lot. Italian is a very beautiful language, and taking it at Yale has been so much fun.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course with Professor Simona and Professor Sarah. They are the reason the course was perfect. Quite possibly the best professors Ive had yet.",
                "I'd definitely recommend this L3 summer course -- even though it's covered at an accelerated pace, the fact that the material is all review makes it fairly manageable. Roberto, the course grader, is super encouraging and generous, while Simona and Sarah keep the class fast-paced, fun, and interesting. I feel like my conversational skills improved immensely after oral exams and speaking practice in class, and the tema assignments pushed me to learn new vocabulary and work on clearly communicating my thoughts in written Italian."
