    "The Senior Essay is like looking in the mirror at your own soul. The subject, and the finished product, are less important than what you learn about your own abilities along the way. It is the ultimate test in your college career, because it's just you and your brain and the books and a Word Document. How terrifying and how exciting! I learned, among other things, that I have a lot to learn. I learned that arguing in a long form is very different from arguing in 10-20 pages, and that ideas are slippery, and that thinking is as important to the writing process as writing. I learned that the finished product is never what you want it to be, but that you can learn to be proud of the work nonetheless. I learned that a good education can be gained from books alone, and that's such an important thing to realize before graduating!",

    "The English Department runs a slightly different senior essay\/thesis than other departments. It's more laid back in terms of requirements, deadlines etc. At the end of the day, the professor defines what sort of experience the student has in the class. Sometimes I wished the English Department had given the program more structure (the other senior essayists never met?) but at the end of the day, the essay is just between you and your sources and your professor. It's a conversation, not a regimented procession through a syllabus, so flexibility is just what is needed.",
    "Really good at helping you find your academic voice, but less good in terms of structure! (Although my advisor was awesome in that regard)"

    "Not everyone should do the Senior Essay, but then again, not everyone should be an English major, or go to Yale for that matter. If you are wondering whether it is a lot of work: yes, it is a lot of work. If you are unsure about whether your ideas are good, or if your writing is up to the task: they probably aren't, and it most likely isn't. But being fully ready for the Senior Essay isn't as important as doing it. You learn things about yourself along the way that makes the whole project worthwhile. It won't be the best piece of writing you've produced at Yale. Heck, it won't even be the second best. But, and I can't state this enough, that's not the point of the essay! It is an exercise in serious scholarship, an attempt to produce something resembling an original idea, a head-on collision with the best that has been thought and said. You'll survive it, and if you put your blood, sweat and tears into the paper, you might even be somewhat proud of what you produce at the end of it all. I really don't understand English students who shy away from the Senior Essay, because it suggests they either aren't confident enough in their own abilities, or aren't even that interested in academic pursuits. It would be like training for the Olympics, and then dropping out before the Finals to take up knitting. If you're serious about the study of English and American literature, and have worked hard in the English department, then you owe it to yourself to write a Senior Essay. (Also, just take the one-semester version; nobody needs a full year to write 50 pages.)",
    "Yes.  If you have a topic that you are passionate about or that you want to study further, I would very much recommend this course!"
