The readings were some of the best works I have gotten the chance to read in an English class. I also hugely appreciated Professor Howard's willingness and encouragement to apply different theoretical lenses to the texts, rather than just considering them in a vacuum while close reading.",
                "I developed a greater insight into the social construction of whiteness and blackness. I learned the basics of literary criticism.",
                "I read so many great books in this class. I also learned a lot about how to analyze the texts.",
                "I learned so much about how to approach American literature and analyze it from a critical viewpoint. I significantly improved my writing skills and learned to craft more effective essays. I also gained knowledge about the wider American literary canon from the perspective of marginalized communities.",
                "Better understanding of essay writing and literary analysis.",
                "I developed my skills of close reading and in depth review of quotes. I learned how to connect seemingly unrelated books and the importance of doing so.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Excellent selection of texts and engaging homework assignments\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we rushed through our discussions of certain texts that I wish we didn't.",
                "The strengths are Professor Howard's ability to lead discussion in interesting and generative ways paired with the readings included in the syllabus. I do think that it would have helped to take out one of the texts in order to have more class time to discuss the rest of the texts, as it felt a bit rushed towards the end of the semester.",
                "Strength: \r\nEvery American Literature class has potential to introduce a student to a new way of thinking about their nation, and this class, especially as taught by Jonathan Howard, did that for me. He talked about the American social construction of whiteness and blackness in a way that I had never heard before and it illuminated my understanding of race in America. I'll keep that with me.\r\nWeakness: He talked too much in seminar so in most classes he ended up talking more than us. I think it should have been the other way around, with us in control of the conversation and him just there to sort of guide the discussion if it gets off track.",
                "There was no emphasis on learning about writing. Professor Howard was available but every paper we turned in was the final draft so we didnt really get to revise at all which is the most important part of writing. A very small part of the class was dedicated to learning about writing, and there should be more or at least times where we give each other feedback on our writing. The feedback for the passage assignments was minimal yet helpful but I didnt even get feedback on my last two assignments that were handed back right before the final paper was due.\r\nAlso there was a near complete absence of women in the texts. We read The Color Purple but barely spoke about it and some of the class time was spent looking for flowers. I loved that exercise but it I would love it more if I felt satisfied with the level of discussion about women. The class was mostly focused on black men in American literature and I was not expecting that, though I enjoyed it a lot. However, it seemed unfair to leave out women almost entirely in an American Literature class. \r\nNonetheless I think this is a very strong class and I knew every class would be super important.",
                "Dr. Howard is an absolutely incredible professor and makes each class session a joy. His syllabus and teaching style are the greatest strength of the course. I absolutely loved reading all of the works and looked forward to every Tuesday/Thursday to discuss them. The Passage assignments were also very helpful in helping us get started on the papers ahead of time. Another strength is that we were encouraged to approach the literature from perspectives of critical theory. The only weakness is that the last book was left at the end of the semester when we were discussing the final assignment, so we did not have time to discuss the text.",
                "Incredible course, could benefit from more flexibility in letting the professors choose the required texts.",
                "I really liked the curriculum of the class and the books we read. I was exposed to so many books which I loved and found very interesting. I do think it could be improved by having an up to date syllabus with the due dates for all of the assignments in a centralized location."

                "Yes!",
                "I absolutely recommend this course to any student who is considering taking it, especially with Dr. Howard. He makes the course interesting and accessible for students outside of the English major. The literature on the syllabus is fantastic, and every class session is a joy.",
                "Yes, because I enjoyed this course and learned a lot.",
                "Definitely. This course was challenging, but very interesting. The information was relevant to who we are as people and how we interact in the Yale community.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in literature and asking important questions about America and American literature. However, I would say that while it focuses on writing, it does require some level of experience in close reading and requires a heavy load of reading."
