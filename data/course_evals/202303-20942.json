Though the structure seemed fine, there was much less participation from the cohort than I would have hoped to find among a group of majors working on their capstone projects (presumably these are the students most dedicated to the department). The workshops were structured as forums to get feedback throughout the essay process, but often students would present and be met with just one or two comments. I don't know if there is a quick fix for this, but it was sad to me that there was not a more engaged dynamic."
