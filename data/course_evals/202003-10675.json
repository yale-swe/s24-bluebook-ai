                "This was such a good course - I learned so much! The lectures were great and the readings were so interesting. Prof Brunson is really knowledgeable and smart and well-spoken (and nice) and delivered excellent lectures in addition to informative answers to students' questions during the talk-back sessions.",
                "Overall fantastic course; the lectures were all engaging and well-planned, sections were helpful for understanding\/digging deeper into course material, assignment prompts were innovative.",
                "The main strength of the course was definitely Prof. Brunson's recorded lectures. She made every topic so fascinating and easily accessible while simultaneously presenting complex and insightful arguments about Russian art. The only weakness was that the talk-back sessions were quite short and only allowed for three to four questions a week.",
                "The strengths of the course: prof Brunson does a great job in reviewing the large amount of Russian artistic history - the lectures are always interesting, and each minute is packed with information - the full amount of time is used up. This density of information was intense, but very fruitful and productive for me. The sections provided a great environment for discussion of our personal favorite pieces that week and helped facilitate a greater understanding of the material.",
                "I loved Prof. Brunson's lectures and my discussion section, felt that the assignments were reasonable (and the last one was just fun; we recreated a Russian\/Soviet piece using what we had at home), and generally enjoyed this course. There are no weaknesses to this course that could be alleviated during the pandemic  I sometimes felt that the recorded lectures were a little too long, but I think that has more to do with my decreased tolerance for watching lectures via a screen vs. in person than any fault on Prof. Brunson's part. Maybe some of the readings could have been pared down a bit.",
                "As opposed to most art history classes that I've taken at Yale, this course does not seem to encourage much free thinking. You may not write your papers in an unorthodox fashion, even if that has been acceptable for other courses in the past. Another weakness is that the instructor and teaching fellows seem to have a very strict definition on what they consider \"the right answers to be,\" which is totally unlike most things I've seen in other courses.",
                "All strengths!",
                "Professor Brunson was so knowledgeable and poetic in her lectures. I would have liked live lectures so that it felt more engaging, but that being said, it was great that we had personal meetings with the professor to supplement lectures. The assignments were great because they were varied, well adapted to the constraints of the pandemic, and each made us think differently. Each lecture covered a huge breadth of art works, so we learned so much, but at the cost of not spending that much time visually analyzing each work. That's okay, because this was an excellent course!!!",
                "Strength: Molly Brunson and wonderful TAs, who are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject and always happy to answer questions. The materials were also well-organized, with weekly readings informing and complementing the lectures. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The new assignment format of the biweekly short essay. The 3-5 page limit restricts depth of analysis yet still requires a significant amount of prior research, compromising the quality of the final product without reducing workload."

                "I liked the combination of asynchronous\/synchronous activity. I especially thought that Professor Brunson's weekly talk-back sessions were valuable for asking clarifying questions and examining course material more in-depth.",
                "The combination of recorded lectures, synchronous talk-back sessions and discussion sections worked really well. The lectures allowed for flexibility, but we still had ways to engage with TFs and Prof. Brunson. The shorter assignments and exhibition project made it much easier to write without consistent access to a library for research. It also made the workload much more manageable.",
                "The recorded lectures were really nice, because I could handle them on my own time. I would say for the talk back sessions to perhaps give multiple times at which they could be attended, if thats feasible.",
                "I thought discussion section and the talk-back sessions worked very well via Zoom. As I mentioned above, engaging with lectures via a screen has been more difficult than in-person lectures, so it could be helpful for the longer lectures (>50 mins) to be either made a bit shorter or broken into smaller segments.",
                "This class was entirely mismanaged with regards to understanding the extenuating circumstances of the pandemic. The reading load was incredibly large, at the level of some advanced seminars, which was surprising for a survey art history lecture during a pandemic. Additionally, the professor claimed to be understanding of time differences and other obligations and recorded all lectures. Great, well, you also have to attend mandatory \"talk-back sessions\" during one of the lecture blocks. Not only do you have to watch the recorded lecture that was originally planned for that day, but you do have a set time now to attend this lecture, so the original claim of being understanding holds no ground.",
                "Was excellent, everything worked very well in my opinion.",
                "Professor Brunson and the TF, Mina, did everything they could to make this course engaging during a pandemic. The change I'd like to see does not need to come from the instructors, but from the university. The only way to make this class better is to offer it in person again!"

I found the assigned papers to be burdensome, only because I wasn't really looking for practice in academic writing but just wanted to do the readings, discussions, etc.",
                "Yes! This was a fantastic course for any major. Professor Brunson provided a good mix of historical context\/background, study of specific artists\/artworks and discussion of broader concepts and questions in each lecture. Section was always helpful, as were the readings and assignments.",
                "Yes, 100%. By far the best class I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes - if youre interested in Russian artistic culture and want to receive a good survey of how history, culture, and international presence affects Russian art, and how Russian art affects the world in turn, I would definitely take.",
                "I'd absolutely recommend this class I came in with no real art history background, and I feel like I learned so much and rarely felt totally out of my depth. Prof. Brunson and my TF were very open to questions and were very understanding about how difficult this pandemic semester has been, which was so so very much appreciated.",
                "In its current state, no. It is not suited to ease the stressed mind of one in a pandemic while teaching anything.",
                "This was such a wonderful course and I cannot recommend it enough. I came in with no background in art history and only some in Russian history, but you don't need any experience in either. Professor Brunson's recorded lectures were superbly written, and every sentence made you pause to thinkI often played them at 2x speed but would find myself stopping the video at times to think about something she had just said. The talk back sessions with our professor and the discussion sections with my TF were very engaging, and I enjoyed hearing what my classmates had to say about certain works or themes. We had six 2-3 page essays to write throughout the semester and the prompts were generally good, though perhaps a couple could be made less awkward in the future. Between the essays, weekly reading responses, and final essay project, it does amount to be a somewhat substantial amount of work. I received very clear and helpful feedback on my essays, which I also thought were graded very nicely. Most importantly, you'll come away each week utterly fascinated at the astounding intellect of Russian artists, the incredible pace at which art caught up with that of the West and in many ways surpassed it, and respect for the history and culture of Russia itself. I hope to visit Russia soon so that I can see everything we discussed in class. A rare Yale gemplease take it.",
                "Russian art is dope. Strongly recommend",
                "YES!!!! I loved this class, definitely my favorite this semester. I think this would be a great class for history of art majors or people in completely different fields. No background knowledge in Russian History or art history was strictly necessary, though it probably helps. The many low-pressure writing assignments help a lot with your overall writing skills as well. Great TAs, great prof, great subject. Take it!",
                "Absolutely. I knew very little about Russian art before taking this class, and I came out of it having learned so much! It makes me want to visit Russia! It's a country with a very cool history and rich culture that is undervalued here in the U.S.! This is a super engaging art history course with a super engaging and intelligent professor. You will learn so much. Take it!",
