                "Extreme insight into literature I was unfamiliar with as well as an improved writing technique and ability to write essays and thesis statements.",
                "Better survey of modernist literature by queer authors and the historical context that surrounded them",
                "This was an amazing course! I loved learning to analyze texts through close reading! The syllabus of queer texts was so interesting! I found one of my new favorite novels!",
                "Analyzing texts, thinking about queerness in a historical context",
                "I gained familiarity with many modernist English novels which are considered classics but that I hadn't yet had the opportunity to read. On the writing side, the class specifically focuses on teaching the skill of close reading.",
                "I learned a lot about the characteristics of modernist literature and methods of expressing queerness during largely the 20th century. I also feel that I received helpful writing feedback.",
                "I learned how to do close readings of texts.",

            "comments": [
                "Strength: lectures were good, but I felt like I only truly paid attention to novels that I was writing about for the three assignments.\r\nWeakness: Course is entirely dependent on three papers. Little turn-around time between last novel and final paper deadline.",
                "The syllabus is the strongest aspect of the course. The diversity of topics and perspectives is amazing. However, the course's weakest point is its lecture style. It can feel unfulfilling to read an entire book and only get two 50-minute lectures to delve deeper into the text.",
                "I think it is all very well thought out, not anything I would really improve. A big strength is the curriculum and how interesting it is.",
                "I enjoyed the lecture's focus on the historical context of the authors and the book's public reception, and I enjoyed my section. And Juno posts the prompts for all of the written assignments at the beginning of the semester which is great because you can go into the books knowing what to keep an eye on for your papers\r\n\r\nHowever, there were a LOT of readings. But you were also able to kind of skirt by a good amount of them\/not fully read a lot of them, because with the prompts you can focus on what to fully read instead.",
                "I think there were way too many novels to read and we jumped from one to the next too fast. I would have appreciated spending more time with each, especially those that had like 400 pages. The classes\/lectures were very interesting!",
                "Strengths: the lectures were great! Prof Richards is a very engaging and funny lecturer and I was always really excited for class. The connections they made to other media were really valuable. Weaknesses: the lectures were too short - we only had 50 minutes twice a week, but Prof Richards rarely used the full 50 minutes anyway. Reading a novel a week but then only having ~1.5 hours of lecture on each novel was a bit disappointing, since I wanted to go deeper into the analysis of each one. I would have loved to have the standard two 1hr 15min lectures per week. Discussion sections were fun, but I think that time would have been much better spent giving us a third lecture.",
                "I appreciated how the course provided historical and political context as tools to approach the texts. I found this particularly compelling in out discussions of race and sexuality in Giovanis Room or in Passing as well as the role of the east in Passage to India and Orlando. I sometimes felt frustrated with reading a whole book every week and not necessarily getting enough time to leave with a very in depth understanding of the text. I think some of this is inherent in a lecture style course, but I would have loved more in depth textual analysis from Prof Richards and more time  in section to discuss the texts. I felt like two weeks per book helped with this a lot.",
                "Strengths: Lectures brought in interesting context rather than summarizing texts, and we covered a wide breadth of topics while building on earlier readings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The fast pace made it harder to have in-depth conversations during 1 50-minute section",
                "The strengths were the discussion sections. It could be improved if lectures were geared more towards graded assignments. I feel as though I could have gotten the same grade in the class regardless of if I went to lecture or not.",
                "Loved it! No improvement suggestions :)."

                "I would first recommend a seminar with Professor Richards and if that was unavailable would recommend this course.",
