It gave me a lens to analyze technology through, forcing me to observe things that I otherwise would not think of.",

She also tried different styles of going about the class topics which was very unique. The topics of the class itself were unique and very relevant to real life. The digital ethnography project at the end was super fun and interesting to undertake as well.",
                "The grading was unexpectedly harsh and didn't feel entirely fair at times. I feel that the feedback of what I was doing wrong was sometimes unclear, or when I tried to respond to feeback on the next assignments (after meet with my TA to get a better sense), it still wasn't good enough to improve the grade. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the discussions a lot.",
                "The course structure and small size of the class were very high strengths. We were able to get a lot of discussion going given how tech-involved society already is. There was always a lot to talk about!! \r\n\r\nWeakness: I liked the last segment of choosing our digital communities, but I honestly enjoyed the broader tech journal entries the most. If the final paper could somehow orient itself towards the tech journals of the first half of the semester that would be a lot more engaging.",
                "The strength of this class or that it is absolutely never boring. I am always invested in the readings and in class time. Sometimes I wasnt sure what exactly they were looking for with the papers, but overall I loved the class."

This was my first course in anthropology (as a STEM major) and I felt very comfortable yet challenged (in a good way). The digital ethnography project at the end was definitely one of the most unique tasks I've undertaken at Yale, and I really enjoyed the class discussions every week. I feel like I got a lot out of it in terms of analyzing how technology impacts our society and culture and developing a more nuanced approach to these topics.",
