   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about revolution in Latin America, as well as about contesting grand-strategy narratives of the Cold War.",
    "I learned SO much about Latin American politics and history in the 20th century. I also wrote my first long history paper and learned a lot doing that.",
    "I gained countless skills and insights into Latin America and its history during the Cold War and beyond.",
    "This course was a great overview of recent Latin American history as well as many different lenses from which to view it and a greater sense of how different events fit together.",
    "I gained critical insight into the extent of US imperialism in Latin America and a more nuanced understanding of global Cold War politics.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of several Latin American countries roles in the Cold War era and after  specifically, Chile, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Columbia. It is shocking to learn about the cooperation that occurred between the right-wing military regimes of Latin America in Operation Condor, in which the countries coordinated to carry out the murders of high-profile resistance figures at home and abroad.",
    "This course really pushed me to think critically about how there can be multiple, equally viable (at times) narratives of a history. Professor Joseph also helped to make history a lot more accessible while making giving us multiple perspectives of history.",
    "This course provides a background and information on a wide range of Latin American revolutionary situations, and introduced me to many political situations in Latin America that I had not been previously aware of.",
    "I have never learned so much as I have from this course. I came into the class never having taken before a Latin American history class, and I could not have asked for a better first one. This class made me realize more than ever how Amerocentric our education and press is in the States and helped counter the Grand Strategy narrative that rules most history classes on the Cold War.",
    "This course is an amazing overview of many of the most significant forces that have shaped Latin American societies in the past century. The class aims to transcend east\/west Cold War perspectives, analyzing social movements and revolutions as local phenomena. You will learn a great deal about Latin America today, as most units in the course will cover recent developments.",
    "specific knowledge of histories of key Latin American revolutions, the social movements that sustained them, the role of the U.S. State Department... Tools for balanced analysis of revolutions. A powerful sense of the social fabric and emotional stakes of some truly fascinating, hopeful, and tragic political situations in other countries.",
    "Prior to this course, my knowledge of Latin America was embarrassingly limited. Now, at the end of the semester, I am in absolute awe of how much I have learned. Starting with El Salvador and moving to Chile, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Colombia, and Bolivia, Professor Gilbert fills every seminar with enriching narrative, facts, and anecdotes. I walk away knowing so, so much about the history of Latin America and its complicated relationship with the United States."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor Joseph is a wonderful professor who knows so much about the material. He is also so kind, and very helpful in office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: There are no writing assignments except for a journal, due at midterm and reflecting on all the material we had covered so far, and the final paper. I didn't feel that the journal was very productive; I would have really preferred to have weekly or monthly writing assignments, in order to better distill the material in shorter increments and also receive feedback on my history writing from Professor Joseph.",
    "The course material was very interesting. I only wish that we had done one week on either Guatemala or Mexico. Mexico in particular, since Professor Joseph is an expert.",
    "This course is perfect and I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to take it!",
    "This class has an incredible syllabus. I enjoyed every book, reading, and movie. They also all play an important role in your analysis of revolution in Latin America. \r\n\r\nI would only say that I wish the course packets werent so expensive. Or offered as PDFs.",
    "The material and films are great, but I think the class size was a bit too large for everyone to have a fulfilling discussion.",
    "Discussions were always engaging and stimulated by excellent student presentations; I particularly enjoyed the simulations\/debates Professor Joseph sometimes staged. Our assigned journal was also an interesting exercise, as in my other classes I don't usually get the change to reflect more casually and personally on the course material. I appreciated Professor Joseph's efforts to integrate film into our assignments, however it was sometimes difficult to get to the Film Studies Center during the pre-set screening times and almost always a big time commitment on top of our weekly readings. The two course packs Professor Joseph asks us to purchase were unnecessary, as they are expensive and outdated. Though the readings were usually interesting, most of the readings were available online or could very easily be digitized; over half the contents of the second course pack were clippings from the New York Times and other periodicals, to which Yale already provides free online access. Though still not ideal, the course packs were available on closed reserve in the library. Another weakness was the insufficient attention to the participation (or non-participation) of indigenous peoples, women, and other social minorities in the revolutionary contexts we studied. In fact, it sometimes felt like the student presenters were trying to fill in the gaps left by the Professor \/ his syllabus.",
    "I cannot think of any weaknesses in this course. Its strengths: Professor Gilbert is fantastic; the course is small, which allows everyone to consistently engage; most of the students speak Spanish, which allows a very authentic engagement with the course materials; perspectives are diverse; and the readings and movies are captivating.",
    "This is a stellar course. I think every Yale student should take it- regardless of if they are interested in Latin America or not. Across the board strong seminar- engaging readings, lively class discussion, and a wonderful professor.",
    "This course does not try and uphold purely the US widely-held perspective on political events, and I felt that the space was one in which people from different political backgrounds could speak. I think that as much as the class initially attempted to push back on global systems approaches, this course could have included more of testimony from on-the-ground sources. I would have loved to read a larger combination of global systems theory\/scholars as well as more first-hand revolutionary perspectives and unfiltered voices.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was Professor Joseph. Firstly, he is not only incredibly knowledgable about the topic from an academic perspective, providing insightful discussion questions ahead of time every week to help us think more deeply about our readings, but he also told personal anecdotes about his experiences observing the events we were learning about. Secondly, he is one of the kindest professors I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and is so generous with his time, constantly encouraging us to talk to him during office hours and even beyond. He tries to get to know his students on a personal level in addition to on an academic one. Another huge strength of the course was its syllabus: the readings are the most diverse I have ever encountered on a syllabus, with fiction, memoirs, government documents, interviews, TV shows, fictional movies, documentaries, and more. The only weakness of this course was that I wish we had more time in the course to deep dive into the individual Latin American countries' revolutions rather than just surveying them, and more time to learn about less traditional narratives like women's roles in the revolutions and how the changing politics impacted indigenous populations.",
    "Among the many strengths of this course, I want to flag two in particular:\r\n\r\nThe first is the openness of the course. Prof. Joseph gives you plenty of opportunities to dig into topics that particularly interest you. Every student will present on a weekly unit, cover the main themes in the reading and give a little bit of background, and also has the opportunity to present on the topic with a different lens. This can be electoral material, art, literature, etc. You choose! You also will have ample space to dig further into questions that interest you in seminar discussions, which are very open, class journals, and the final paper. \r\n\r\nThe second strength I wanted to flag is the quality of the sources that Prof. Joseph has selected for the course, which will give you a much deeper understanding of the topics you are covering each week. \r\n\r\nOverall, this class is a fair amount of work. I would not recommend it as a fifth class or in a semester where you are taking three other seminars. But this workload is necessary if you want to understand the many countries and movements the class covers!",
    "Strengths: \r\nMeticulous planning of the course including weekly films and rotating opening presentations made discussions substantive and lively; they built on the course material to create something more. Chosen readings were generally excellent. The inclusion of personal\/family testimony in the opening presentations of students and Prof. Joseph brought emotional immediacy.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIn some units I felt I was getting a very high percentage of knowledge from New York Times articles. I understand there may be good reasons for this but would at least like to have discussed the nature of their coverage more.",
    "The strength is Professor Joseph but I believe that is also a weakness, also the class does not really have nuanced discussions, everyone just nods along and does not say anything interesting, unwilling to challenge Prof. Joseph",
    "Strengths: Professor Gilbert. He is an absolute treasure and I am so, so glad I got the opportunity to learn from him. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The fact that this may have been the last time Prof Gilbert is teaching the course. It is so rare to find classes that show the importance of Latin America in international relations and I am saddened by the fact that future Yale students will not be able to take advantage of this opportunity."

   "comments": [
    "I think this course would be especially great for someone who did not know about Latin America and wanted a crash-course taught by a super knowledgeable professor. I would not recommend this course to someone looking to improve their history writing.",
    "Yes I definitely would. You will learn so much and have a new view of the US as a result.",
    "Of course! Professor Joseph is an absolute gem of a professor that comes along once in a lifetime. I could not imagine a better experience.",
    "Absolutely! One of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale. Professor Joseph is an incredible Professor that is very passionate about the subject matter and that greatly shapes the conversation in classes. He is also very accessible and willing to help you with your research. A very important subject that I hope more students study!",
    "Yes; Professor Joseph is excellent and the material is fascinating. There is also no other course at Yale that covers a similar range of topics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to my peers, especially those who prior to Yale only received a very sanitized account of US history in Latin America. This course reveals the heinous motivations and painful consequences of US foreign policy in the Latin American Cold War theater, and challenges you to bring this understanding to the more contemporary political moment.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is one of the best Ive taken. Professor Joseph is an amazing instructor, the other students will almost certainly be extremely engaged, and the course materials are absolutely fascinating. Youll leave every class wishing you had it again to tomorrow.",
    "This course should be mandatory for students from my perspective. Most valuable class I've ever taken at Yale. Such a special seminar, seriously!!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, I enjoyed the combination of scholarship, literature, film, and different types of media from which we learned over the course of the semester.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN!! I wish it could be required for everyone to take this class. I have never learned so much as I have from this course. I came into the class never having taken before a Latin American history class, and I could not have asked for a better first one. This class made me realize more than ever how Amerocentric our education and press is in the States and helped counter the Grand Strategy narrative that rules most history classes on the Cold War.",
    "YES! Understanding the major forces that have shaped Latin America in the past century is essential.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It is an intensely substantive seminar with fascinating subject matter. I was thoroughly moved by some of the great hopes and letdowns of revolutionary situations we studied, sometimes to tears. Great readings, great discussion. Professor Joseph's knowledge of the field, intellectual attentiveness and commitment to students were highly admirable. I have rarely seen that level of fruitful dedication to a class while at Yale.",
    "I do not think so, the class is dominated by white thought and Joseph is definitely responsible for that. Also there is a lack of desire to address leftist movements in nuanced ways.",
    "YES!"
