After developing a basic understanding of his form, style, historical context, and influences we were then able to bring this work into our own reality and draw connections between Dante's commentary and contemporary figures."

                "Given the difficulty of transferring a seminar into the virtual format, I thought this course was very effective in fostering a community and facilitating lively discussions even via Zoom. I also really appreciated how Professor Lorenzini used all the tools at her disposal to ensure we were not overtaken by Zoom fatigue, this included guest lectures, visuals, a virtual tour of the art gallery, presentations, and more. I do however wish that this class could have been taught as a year long course. While I learned a great deal about Dante, it is difficult to understand the weight of his work if you do not have a grasp of the Aeneid, the Bible, etc. While we were exposed to other texts and always encouraged to pursue our own research I think that a course on Dante must also include an examination of the classic writers that are so present in his Comedy."
