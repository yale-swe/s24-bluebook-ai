The guest speakers were all very interesting. In terms of improvement, finding a way to incorporate and build upon the readings during lectures and discussions would make the material more engaging. Additionally, being more clear about page requirements for the journals and general guidelines for the presentations would be very helpful.",

The journals are a cool way to apply everything we learned in class to real life examples and gave me an opportunity to interact with kids during the semester which was a fun experience. If you like working with kids or are interesting in working with kids in the future, this class provides a great foundation for understanding early child development."
