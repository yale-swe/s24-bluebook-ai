                "I think it's really a personal journey with your own writing and your advisor, as you get to learn who you are as a writer and what writing style/discipline works for you. The strength of this course was the weekly check-ins, but I wish there was more of a community in the class about showing up to these meetings. A weakness of the course was the writing retreats - I wish they were actually more \"retreat\"-like, a bit away from typical study spots or writing spots on campus, such as a trek to the very beautiful Divinity School library or to a coffeeshop - adds a bit more fun incentive to the hard writing process! Also wish we discussed more about citations.",

But it's hard work, no joke, as it's a long journey or writing and working with your text, but also too short of a time to feel as though you can do everything you set out to do. It's easy to feel bogged down by all the reading you need to do to even begin, and more bogged down by all the writing you end up doing!"
