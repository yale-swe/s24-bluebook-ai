                "The course is very difficult, there are a lot of concepts thrown out, but it is hard to grasp. Potentially the course could be divided into two and allow the course content to be more spaced out.",
                "I do enjoy the pre-lecture videos of the course however having the class then just be a perfect repeat of the videos seemed very redundant. While the method and examples in the videos were very helpful, the instructor seemed to get lost trying to communicate methods as to why things worked. It seemed they were very knowledgeable just didn't know how to explain it to us. Please don't make people go to the board after we just learned the topics it is very stressful.",
                "The course was nice as it had asynchronous lecture videos as well as in person lectures, so you could learn the material more thoroughly. However, the in person lectures were sometimes very repetitive and seemingly unhelpful.",
                "The strength is its applicability but weakness is how we don't learn much about what context to use each concept",

It would be better if key concepts and equations were explained, repeated, and used in examples, instead of showing the proofs for everything.\r\nThe in-class lectures were sometimes just the same thing as the pre-recorded lectures.\r\nNot enough example questions were done.\r\nThe class was extremely fast-paced and hard to follow.",

I also really enjoyed the pre-recorded lecture videos, which allowed me to learn at my own pace before coming to class. I also thought the problem sets were fair, and didn't take too long. Prof. Puri is an amazing professor and really systematically walks through all of the complicated topics, so definitely try to take this class with her if you can!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't really think of any! I perhaps would've liked to do more practice problems in class, but that's a super minor thing.",

We were expected to watch prerecorded video lectures before our live lectures, but they were often posted very late the night before or the morning of lecture, making it impossible to reasonably engage with them. The material in the video lectures was useful, and the live lectures were not. No material was actually covered in the live lectures, making them often times feel pointless to attend.",
