In the future, it would be helpful to begin our final projects and acquire the materials for them before Spring Break, so that there is more time at the end to produce a high-quality video.",

I would recommend Introduction to Archaeological Lab Science - another course by the same professor - instead, as I felt it taught a similar topic (methods in archaeology) much more effectively.",
