I also gained more familiarity with the Japanese and Korean systems, however significantly less so than with the Chinese system. We learned about how the codes were written, circulated, promoted, interpreted along class lines, and carried over into the modern era. I discovered how to situate legal developments into a philosophical and historical context to better understand the evolution of the law code. I also gained insight into the reasoning behind the law and the ways it was tailored to society.",

            "comments": [
                "The readings are fascinating",
                "Because the professor assigned a lot of readings, there were a few that were required and a few that were optional. Therefore a lot of the time, we would all come in having focused on different things. This would have mixed results on the discussion. Nonetheless, Prof. Gant was always flexible and helpful in discussions, steering them into interesting directions.",
                "Too many disconnected reading makes it feel hard to feel motivated to do the readings. I would cut down readings and hand students do small discussion posts or have conversations about the readings in text and have that be a part of the grade. This class was kinda hectic tbh.",
                "STRENGTHS: Gant possesses a wealth of knowledge on sources and scholarly debates related to the topics that provides helpful context and material for further research, the class attempts to go beyond just the Chinese legal system and cover all of East Asia in a way most courses do not, the topics are interesting and well structured to facilitate learning, the assignments are not incredibly challenging and designed to make you go beyond class discussion and consider a range of sources that he provides for you, assignment feedback is thorough and thoughtful, the class is very self-structured in terms of choosing readings and completing assignments at your own pace (can be pro or con depending on how organized you are), class debates were a fun and engaging way to synthesize material, Gant was very intentional about allowing everyone a chance to speak, multiple trips to the Beinecke were a great way to see primary source material and enhance classes.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: The small number of assignments made them feel more high-risk since they weighed more and were primarily essay-based, the amount of reading assigned each week was quite hefty even for a seminar such that some weeks required a 300 page book (you could skim, but still) alongside 100 pages of other readings, the required readings were often assigned late in the week, there was very little guidance (unless requested) on the final project assignments until the last couple weeks of school, we did not regularly receive feedback on assignments since there were so grades were unknown til the very end, the class is meant to focus on East Asia but relies very heavily on material from China (because there is simply a lot more of it) and Japan while largely ignoring Korea.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS: I think many of theses issues were largely by virtue of this being the first semester the class was taught. The class could be greatly improved if the reading assignments were cut down and streamlined so people read similar sources instead of choosing all their own (though he did begin to do this toward the end of the class), feedback/grades were given on the lecture reports around the time of submission or simply made completion grades, and the final project was broken to into parts due in advance (proposal, annotated bib, draft, final) to make sure students have structure. It may also be worth considering to decrease the final project length, as 25-30 pages is quite a lot by current Yale standards. 15-20 may be more reasonable, but the option for creative projects was a great help to many in the class.",
                "There were a lot of readings each week, we weren't expected to do them all, but it was still a bit overwhelming and could sometimes lead to confusion in discussions, but at other times worked really well to bring in different points of view if we'd all read different sources.",
                "This course would benefit from lectures."

                "Yes",
                "Im not sure if Id recommend this to another student unless they look at the syllabus and really want to read the readings. Otherwise it will be hard to push yourself to learn in this class that very much is a class where you need to be a self starter. I did not have access to a full syllabus before I started the class (we got a like 30 page provisional syllabus with most readings missing) so this made my experience more frustrating than it will be for another student in the future. The topic and the reading is interesting!",
                "Maybe. If you are someone who is highly organized and good at facilitating your own learning, then this class is a good fit for you. Many times you will choose your own reading, you are expected to complete the lecture reflections at your own pace, you must keep track of sources because you will need them for your midterm and final project, and you will not receive feedback often (but the feedback you do receive/ask for is extremely detailed). These could all be problems for someone who is less experienced at handling course loads or prone to procrastination and disorganization. Otherwise, I truly enjoyed the class and found it to be the perfect intersection of culture, law, politics, and history. There are so few classes at Yale that explore this many scholarly dimensions of a region outside of Europe. East Asian law is sorely misunderstood and under appreciated by Western academics who don't specifically focus in the field. I would recommend this to any History/East Asian Studies/Philosophy/Political Science student, prospective law student, or student interested one expanding their horizons. The workload is heavy, but much of it is ungraded readings and optional research so you really need to be a self-starter and committed to engaging with the material to get the most out of the class. Additionally, the assignments are all writing based (two 2-page reflections, multi-essay midterm, and a 25-30 page final paper or an alternative project with a writing component) so that is something to consider. If you are willing to put the time in, you will learn a lot.",
                "If you are interested in pre-modern East Asian law, yes. If you know what you want out of the course and put in the effort it can be a great class.",
                "Yes. It really provides a good introduction to the field."
