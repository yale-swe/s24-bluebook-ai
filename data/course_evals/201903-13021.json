   "comments": [
    "During this course, we read a lot of texts that were extremely philosophical and demanded very high levels of engagement and critical thinking. This course really helped me see traditional ideas and social norms and establish new perspectives on them. As a result, I not only understood the different layers of rebellion, but learned how to write about them and apply them to my own texts. Especially during the time we had to write our research papers, I was also able to analyze texts that we would normally take at face value as just books or newspaper articles, and truly get the depths of how important they were at the time and how important they are now. Understanding why certain texts are written provided me a gateway into the norms at the time.",
    "I learned how to write more clearly and concisely. I also learned how to deepen my analysis, navigate the research paper process, and how to effectively structure an argument and enter an ongoing conversation in public discourse\/a specific field.",
    "What this amazing class really excelled at was not so much teaching me brand new skills, but rather making me incredibly more conscious of when I'm making errors in my writing and more aware of how I can make my arguments more effective. I feel like I've really refined my thought process when writing throughout this semester, and have a MUCH more acute understanding of close reading and no longer being content to take a writer's argument at face value. I'm analyzing everything now! The different forms of essays we did this semester were also helpful in developing a diversified writing portfolio which allowed my various styles to be analyzed in a similar context, which I found to be very productive. I also feel like my approach to political and academic discussion also improved during this class. My classmates were all incredibly smart and articulate, and being in that environment forced me to always try to meet them at their level. Strangely, I also think I became more empathetic as a result of this class, which is simply amazing.",
    "This class was a great introductory English course. Although definitely rigorous, it was focused on individual growth. I feel as if both my reading and my writing developed, and I had a good time as well.",
    "I learned so much about rebellions and colonial resistance. In this course you gain historical knowledge from interesting readings and you learn how to improve your writing.",
    "My writing improved substantially throughout the course. Do yourself a favor and read The Craft of Research thoroughly before the research paper assignment!",
    "At first, I was skeptical as to whether this class was actually going to improve my writing and take it to a \"college level\". To this, I will say two things. The first is go into this course with the notion that NOT all college writing is the same. What I mean by this is that there is not a one-sized fits all approach. While this course will prepare you very well for other ENGLISH writing, writing you may do in Philosophy or History classes is going to be very different. Second, yes, this course does improve your writing if you listen to the feedback and make a conscience effort to incorporate suggestions into your later drafts. You will master and refresh old schools that are, arguably, the foundation to all writing, such as paragraph construction and logical prose.",
    "I developed better riding skills and critical reading skills.\r\nI gained knowledge of true rebellion and how to make a difference in the world.",
    "Academic writing as well as knowledge of colonialism, rebellion as well as its philosophical applications, and injustice.",
    "I improved my close reading skills. I am now able to look at works that I would have deemed difficult and come to understand them due to the analytical skills i developed in this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For this course, I imagine that there isn't too much that can be improved because the dates\/guidelines for the most part follow the rest of the English 114 courses. However, I do think that students would benefit from more periodical reminders of what next class's homework is. This was on us, of course, but often most if not all students would forget\/not realize there was homework on the syllabus because we would receive a separate assignment via email. I think that students would also benefit from knowing how assignments are to be graded from the beginning as well. This is not an easy A class, but it's important to know that at the beginning so we know what to expect.",
    "I think the courses thematic focus makes it very easy for students to participate in class discussions and remain actively engaged throughout the semester. As for weaknesses, I think the course could do a better job of incorporating modern\/current readings related to the theme.",
    "One of the greatest strengths was the selection of readings for the class. The readings were diverse, authentic, wide-ranging, thought-provoking, and prime for analysis and rich discussion. I think the fact that we had readings covering colonization, free speech, ideology, Zionism, Islamic feminism, and American imperialism speaks to the depth of thought that this class was centered around. The other great strength of the course was the other students and the class discussion format. There was never a moment when I thought the overall discourse on a reading had been shallow or lacking meaning. The open nature of the class and fellow students made the reading analysis organic and genuine in its academic strength. The only real weakness I found with the course was that going from Paper 1 to Paper 2 felt a bit redundant, as the prompts were very similar. That might have just been me though, as this class was strong in pretty much every way throughout the entire semester. It was a wonderful experience.",
    "I would have appreciated a little more conversation about writing earlier in the course. I personally felt that there was more room to grow in that respect and, although we definitely did have many conversations later on (individual and in class), it might have been nice to start those talks sooner in the year.",
    "The entire course was very well structured and super interesting. The only weakness is that the grades for the papers come out too late for you to use the feedback on the next paper you are submitting.",
    "I liked how we were able to discuss our papers in class. The class could probably benefit with a few less required readings.",
    "Could incorporate more in class discussions. While I did appreciate that they were nearly all student driven which is super cool, I think more work needs to be done on behalf of the instructor at the beginning of the course to motivate students to not be scared to share ideas, even if they may be not entirely correct or fleshed out! I also enjoyed the final presentation we did. I think there should be more of those! The whole TedTalk-ish format was a lot of fun and I feel as though if there were a few more of these in the beginning of the term students would be more engaged with the activity.",
    "It was well taught and well organized. The readings were interesting, but they could be improved by some being replaced with texts that were not as dense and difficult for students to incorporate into their own writing.",
    "A strength of this course was the in-class discussions we had. The sharing of ideas was very beneficial. A weakness was that we sometimes did not get to discuss, or discuss at length, some of the works we read."

   "comments": [
    "I would totally recommend this course to others. Throughout the semester, I have noticed that I have become a much better writer (which was my original reason for taking the class). By reading different types of texts (research-based, narratives, public arguments, etc.) we've picked up different techniques of writing that I applied to my own. The texts that we do read in the class about rebellion are unlike many of which I've read before as well and are extremely confusing at first, but the elevated levels of thinking they require of you really allow you to conceive of the ideas differently.",
    "Yes, students will become better at writing and arguing while also engaging with an interesting and broadly-applicable topic via readings and discussions.",
    "Definitely. It fulfilled my expectation as an introduction to English at Yale, while also being intellectually engaging and my favorite class this year.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. If you are interested in rebels and rebellions then this is a great course that will improve your writing skills while you learn about a topic of your interest.",
    "I would if a student wants to better their writing in preparation for other writing intensive courses at Yale. However, if you are looking for a gut writing credit look somewhere else.",
    "Yes and no. It depends on what you aim to get out of it. If you want a genuine refresher of cornerstone writing mechanics, then sure. If you already feel as though you are solid on your prose, then maybe reconsider. The class is quite a lot of work, with lengthy readings and multiple papers. That being said, I really enjoyed it and would recommend.",
    "Yes, it is all you will make it to be, and Prof. Baynes-Ross is amazing.",
    "Yes, if you want to strengthen your academic writing abilities and have an interest in past rebellions and the effects of imperialism.",
    "Yes, it improves writing and critical thinking skills while exposing you to important and influential works of literature."
