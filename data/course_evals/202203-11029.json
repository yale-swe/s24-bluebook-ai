It felt like it didn't relate that much to what we were learning. I think we would've been better suited with problem sets or some other way to ensure that we could reinforce what we were learning.",
                "Professor Edwards is an incredible instructor and made class enjoyable. This class is a definite reward for getting through the entirety of the BIOL module. I also enjoyed the review session and the botanical tour as part of the discussion. It was a nice break from the weekly discussion of papers and provided some well-needed variety into the structure of discussion sections as part of the BIOL module.",
                "I wish there were more opportunities for office hours.",
                "The lecturer was good and I found enrichment to be very helpful. I also liked that one of our discussion sections included a tour of some of the resources here on campus.",
                "Strengths- great lectures and homework assignments\r\n\r\nWeakness- not much availability of course instructors outside class",
                "This course was very interesting. I really enjoyed the engaging lectures, the emphasis on the materials' relevance to modernity and the content overall.",
                "I think the content is really interesting but as with any lecture, its kind of hard to stay engaged.",
                "I loved this class! Best in the bio sequence. Its strength is that it teaches about interesting topics that I care about.",
                "This course was awesome!! I was not a fan of the bio sequence, and after taking bio 101-3 I felt I didn't love, or even like, biology so much anymore. This course completely changed that for me, and I finally felt excited to go to lecture. I think the strong point of this course was that the lectures were interesting and full of examples, and the format of the course was way less stressful because there weren't constant graded assignments.",
                "Strengths: Interesting content that was well-taught\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of info packed into every lecture, and exams were extremely detail oriented/basically came down to you being able to memorize every fact that had been taught",
                "I think Loreng does a great job at helping to organize the course. I also think Professor Edward is a good lecturer. I do wish that lecture recordings were available throughout the course instead of being released only at the end. Rewatching the lectures is extremely helpful.",
                "The strengths were that it was very well organized and the professor was fun and engaging. Weakness was that the psets could have been more helpful in my opinion. Also, there were two writing assignments that felt like busy work which (in my opinion) could have been replaced by psets to be more helpful.",
                "This course covered a lot of ground, provided relevant and interesting examples for every topic, and made really good use of discussion sections. The writing assignment was a lot of fun. I think this course balances memorization and application really well.",
                "This course was well taught, I do not think there were any weaknesses.",
                "I think that Prof. Edwards' lectures were a real strength in the course. She presented material in clear and concise manners, answered student questions appropriately, and was very warm and welcoming in her teaching styles. I was appreciative of the opportunity to meet with her in a small group lunch. It was definitely the best class of the introductory biology sequence BY FAR! In terms of weaknesses, I found topic selection of the essay really quite challenging. Without much personal interest in any one species, I had a hard time picking something and sticking with it. It might be helpful to give students a few seeds of starting information (ex: if you don't know where to start, think about these ten species or something like that). Beyond that, I think the course was great!",
                "The class was taught so well. I love how Dr. Edwards always gave us an overview of what we were learning, and where it fit in with the rest of the material. \r\nThe exams were written in ways that they tested us on important concepts  not just about random memorization.",
                "I really enjoyed the content, however I disliked the tests. Instead of measuring what youve learned, it felt more like a vocab quiz. Also, the tests would often ask questions about concepts which werent clearly outlined during lectures, and it was frustrating when it wasnt made clear what we needed to know for the tests.",
                "The strengths of this course was the lecturer, class notes, and discussion sections. Professor Edwards explained concepts well in an understandable manner. The class notes were detailed and useful for reviewing concepts. Discussion sections allowed us to enhance our knowledge through literature examples of concepts.",
                "Strengths:\r\nEngaging information\r\nDevoted TAs\r\nCreative presentations\r\nExcellent additive video links, pictures, and scientific papers\r\nThorough investigation of phylogenies and microcosmic species \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPerhaps not enough information surrounding the type of questions represented on the midterm/finals.",
                "Strength: interesting material and is better than the other modules in the sequence. Also, the course is organized. Having everything laid out on canvas made it easy to follow and stay on top of everything. Weakness: dense slides. Though the slides are all helpful, there are too many per lecture, which makes it hard to go through while studying and confusing to follow during lectures.",
                "Strengths - Erika is such a phenomenal professor! The course content is pretty interesting, and lectures were always engaging. \r\nWeakness - The tests, which make up a majority of the grade, tended to be heavily based on memorization. This also is just inherent to the content of the course.",
                "A way the course could be improved was spreading out the information more. At times it felt a little bit rushed.",
                "This class was well paced and organized to help us best synthesize information. Every piece of information is presented with an example so you can apply what you're learning to real situation, which is great and makes things more entertaining\r\n\r\nThis class doesn't have many weaknesses, but it would be great if the slides could be more detailed (similar to in lecture), because most students use these to study. In addition, the final paper project needs to be worth more of the final grade as it requires significantly more effort and time than it is awarded. The final exam and project can be better balanced out in terms of their weight. I also would have appreciated more feedback on my midterm exam, as I was able to see what I got wrong but not what the correct answer should have been.",
                "Simpler/fewer slides with main points delineated slightly more clearly",
                "Strengths: Professors, TFs, workload\r\n\r\nWeakness: Feels too short.",
                "strengths: straight-forward exams that test what was actually taught in lecture (rare in the biology sequence), understandable section papers (also rare in the biology sequence). Prof Edwards was also a big strength - really kind, funny, tried to make the material more interesting and relevant. Definitely the best of the bio sequence - the only drawback was the crazy amount of memorization required for exams, but if you start early and memorize well, exams will be fine",
                "Less focus on memorization",
                "Great course, much content on slides.",
                "This course is very dense for the time allotted.",
                "A major strength was the teaching team, with the exception of the peer tutors, who were not that helpful in my opinion. The material was presented in a clear and accessible way that was reinforced by the articles we read and the writing assignment. That being said, I wish the enrichment packet would be made available to all students as extra practice, especially given that the problem sets only pertained to material from the first few lectures. There was a decent amount of memorization involved in preparing for exams, particularly for the history of life lectures. Unfortunately, grading on exams can be quite subjective depending on which TA grades a particular page.",
                "I like the lecture format and the way discussion sections are structured.  I wish we'd had a bit more preparation for the questions on the exams.",
                "The main weakness is the emphasis on memorization. It is a very doable amount of vocabulary to know, but the midterm and final did feel quite \"regurgitation\" heavy, which I don't see the merit in.",
                "interesting topics covered and related to real world events however midterm felt very early and content load seemed heavily weighted to second half of course.",
                "Strengths: I genuinely thought the course was interesting! I liked how engaged the professor and my TA were, it makes you want to learn. I also thought the botanical garden tour was cool.\r\nWeaknesses: there is too much content and not enough support to learn it all. I made several quizlets, went through jeopardy game my TA made, went through Ed discussion, and that still wasnt enough to help me. I also rewatched the lectures and found out that my professor wasnt doing a great job of explaining the concepts that she wanted us to know for the exams, I had to Google a lot.",
                "There is a LOT of content that's covered very quickly and lots of memorization. This makes it challenging for students to do well on exams even with lots of preparation/a thorough understanding.",
                "Strengths: very clear lectures with easy to follow slides. I enjoyed the structured nature of the content and am appreciative of the teaching staffs desire for students to succeed \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the questions seemed unclear / grading seemed unclear",
                "I really liked doing the independent project. I feel like smaller stakes testing would have been better since I felt like the two exams had a ton of information that was wasnt tested on equally in the exams since it was just a lot to begin with. I liked the quizzes better in BIOL 103.",
                "This course is very well organized. The information is presented in a way that is easy to understand.",
                "Strengths: topics are very interesting and relevant, lecture notes are pretty good, Professor is excited about what shes teaching \r\nWeaknesses: some topics on lecture slides are not fully explained, also a lot of information is covered hard to tell what will be tested. Ends up being more of a memorization based class than understanding-based in the way past bio modules were",
                "The slides and lectures are very strong. The course is also easy to keep up with because the expectations are set out very clearly from the beginning. The methods of studying and preparation recommended were also effective for knowing how to do well in a class.",
                "very interesting",
                "I think some of the exam questions, especially on the final, were a bit confusing (especially in the wording) and could have been improved to be a bit clearer so that students don't get confused.",
                "I like a weekly class format rather than the midterms bc it assures me that Im properly learning the material",
                "Lecture format was a little difficult to sit through. More involvement would be good",
                "I loved Professor Edwards and her style of teaching. Also, I really liked the writing assignment.",
                "Strengths: the professor (prof edwards!!) . Could be improved by having more involved teaching fellows. \r\nWeaknesses: the teaching fellows did not seem very involved.",
                "The material for this course is super interesting and I really enjoyed the lectures. Studying for the exams wasnt even that bad because of how cool the content was. My favorite lecture was the one on plants! The weakness of this course is, in my opinion, the way it is assessed. The exams are almost completely recalling vocab alone, and the problem sets felt like busy work.",
                "Great lectures and recitations.",
                "The slides were explained very well, material was clear, and discussion sections were very helpful.",
                "All information is very clearly given to you however, I feel that making all lecture recordings available at the end of the class before the final was not as helpful as it would have been had all the lecture recordings been available as the class was progressing.",
                "The course is heavily lecture based and many times details about niche information presented in lecture could not be found elsewhere in the course materials. The course included multiple outlets to receive points that differed from exams and assessments which allows students to show their understanding in multiple forms."

                "Yes!! This is such a joy to take especially after the other 3 classes in the module.",
                "I would recommend this to anyone interested in getting started in the STEM field. Out of the entire bio sequence, I believe that 104 was the most accessible to someone with limited experience in science. It was a great overview!",
                "I think the content is really interesting and this was definitely my favorite class in the bio sequence.",
                "Absolutely. Life is so amazing!! Even if you're premed, you should learn about the whole rest of life on this planet and how weird and beautiful it is. Professor Edwards is such an inspiring professor, scientist, and person so take it with her if you can!! especially if you love plants :)",
                "Honestly most people take it as a requirement but I wouldn't discourage the course either, it was definitely one of the more palatable modules of the bio sequence because Professor Edwards was actually a good lecturer",
                "Yes, not only for major requirements but this course is very fun and is a breath of fresh air from the rest of the bio sequence.",
                "I would recommend this course since the information is laid out such that youre only obstacle is actually learning the material. There were many resources and overall it successfully fulfilled its job as an introductory course on ecology and evolution.",
                "This was by far my favorite unit of the intro bio series. Highly recommend.",
                "Yes, it is any interesting course that makes you question life and the world around you.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course, but I imagine most people are taking it because they have to. Try to have Prof. Edwards if you are taking it, she is wonderful!",
                "Yes, absolutely! With Professor Edwards. She teaches the class with such contagious enthusiasm and explains things in ways the just make sense.",
                "Yes! But taking Biol 101-103 just to take this class isnt worth it. This is definitely the most interesting of the 4 intro bio classes",
                "Yes, this course was one of my favorites of the biology intro series.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who wish to further their understanding and skills of Biology. Additionally, I would recommend this course if students were looking to facilitate a greater ability to retain further information.",
                "Yes! I mean if you are taking it, you have probably done the rest of the biology sequence. This is definitely the best section of it, and you can really engage with the content. Erika really cares about students' successes, and is always willing to help out. The content is really interesting as well.",
                "I would only recommend this course if the student needed to take it for their major or as a requirement just because it is very specialized content within the course.",
                "I took this course because it is a requirement of my major. If you have to take the bio sequence, this one is definitely in the top half of the sequence. However, if you're just looking for an ecology or evolutionary biology class, take another one instead.",
                "Not unless it's required for your major",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, you most likely have to take it anyways after 101103 unless you placed out. I found the material to be interesting and accessible despite the fact that ecology and evolutionary biology are not my field of interest. Although there was some memorization involved, the material was relatively concrete, making the exams more predictable.",
                "Yes - this was my favourite part of the intro bio sequence!",
                "Only if it is required",
                "I definitely think the course is a little harder than people say it is, but it is probably my favorite of the bio sequence, so sure!",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I probably wouldn't have taken an EEB course outside of this one and I found it really interesting.",
                "Likely you will have to take this course, and its a good start on the path towards any STEM major at Yale.",
                "Yes, but only if required for their major or for pre-med. It was super interesting, but definitely very hard. The exams were very tedious to study for and included a lot of information.",
                "Yes only for your major",
                "Yes, if you find the topic interesting. It has a manageable workload and can be interesting if you are okay with lengthier lectures.",
                "yes",
                "Yes. I think it is the most well-run and interesting of the intro bio classes. Although I would suggest that people who don't need to take it for their majors or for med school take one of the electives instead probably.",
                "Yes",
                "For basic understanding of biology or credits, take it.",
                "Yes, I think this is the better part of the biology sequence.",
                "Yes!! It was such an interesting course and the feedback on the assignments was amazing. Plus the research papers we read were fascinating.",
                "Yes! I thought this was a great finish to the bio sequence.",
                "Yes, even for non bio or premed students.",
                "Yes, it is a good wrap up to the bio sequence.",
                "Yes, the topics we covered were genuinely interesting!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students who want a wide introduction to biology."
