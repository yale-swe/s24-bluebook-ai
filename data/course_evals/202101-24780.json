                "Strengths: The stories and connection with experts is awesome\r\nWeaknesses: not too much focus on reading but it made the class very manageable so this also makes it a strength",
                "The strengths of this course were the amazing guest speakers and discussions the professor facilitated. We heard from activists around the world and gained in-depth insight into the conflicts. The only thing I would change is having a bit more time to discuss/ask questions about or have reading providing an overview of the conflict in general.",
                "More class discussion would definitely benefit the course. The guest speakers were great but some of them overstayed their welcome and ate into good class dialogue.",
                "The class was the perfect balance of lecture/background info and healthy discussion. I enjoyed the assignments as well. However, I wish there was more structure with the readings. If we had gotten certain articles/book chapters we were expected to read before class instead of a large list of suggested readings, it would have been very helpful.",
                "I don't think anything could be done to improve this course!",
                "Strengths: Excellent professor, helpful teaching assistant, wonderful guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "Strengths: guest speakers, Janine, final projects and final project presentations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough reading assigned on the syllabus, so you have to do research on all the conflicts on your own. Not that big of a deal but worth noting that self-motivated students who are willing to do more background research will get more out of the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor di Giovanni has years of experience in the region and has extremely interesting stories that make the conflicts we're learning about really come to life. The blog posts were not too much work and were great exercises in thinking and exercising problem solving. The final project of the course was an incredible opportunity with tons of flexibility that allowed us to do some very interesting primary research with few constraints and present it to each other. Weaknesses: I think at some points the class did not facilitate discussions about the ethics and reasoning behind certain decisions and actions in each of the conflicts that we could have discussed with each other."
