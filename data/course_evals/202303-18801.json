                "Strengths: great TAs, terrific Psets and a good content spread Weaknesses: Odd grading on exams (huge emphasis on True False) and Pset graders are very harsh especially for first psets.",
                "The course was structured fine, but the class should have focused more on developing intuitions regarding linear algebra rather than proving a lot of theorems that ended up not being too useful. The proofs sketches were unclear and even as someone who had competition math experience I wasn't able to follow Pablo. I think that the course really forces you to think critically about math though. Also, psets were never graded on time for the exams, and had I not had friends who knew what they were doing and I could check my psets with, I would have been much more lost.",
                "In terms of strengths, the level of depth that is covered in this course is extremely high and I think I know more conceptually about linear algebra than the average student that will take this class due to the level of rigor of the PSETs and additional studying required. However, I don't believe this was necessarily justified for the level of the class as many of the questions were pulled from past 226 PSETs, the instructor was pretty unclear (I ended up having to teach myself mostly everything using the textbook), and there wasn't a great connection between what was covered in class and the PSETs in my opinion.",
                "Weakness: have to spend a lot of time on the psets\r\nStrengths: learn a lot",
                "Very hard to follow and learn, need class to be more structured, slower, and have examples. The TAs are great.",
                "Pablo is a decent teacher, and the course is fairly easy to follow for the first half. \r\n\r\nThe homework are terrible. Terrible. Way too long, way way way above the level of the lectures. Absolutely useless. \r\n\r\nExams were relatively more easy, and were well written.",
                "Strengths: Def learned a lot in this course. PSets and final exam were the right level of challenging. Pablo's instruction was also pretty clear. Weaknesses: Wish Pablo provided some additional intuition for how to use certain ideas or theorems. A large part of the course is just about proving key theorems. While important for completion, some of those theorems were never really used, since they mainly served as lemmas to motivate ideas that were actually used in practice. Also wish that we were provided with lectures recordings or previews.",
                "In this class I mainly had issues with the way that problem sets worked. Often times, Prof. Alvarez would introduce key topics in the problem sets (eigenvalues and t-invariance for example) and not go over the topics in lecture until the week after they were due. However, the TAs in the class were extremely helpful during the frequent office hours.",
                "This is a well taught course with great TAs. The problem sets were very challenging, especially for someone who didn't have any linear algebra experience prior to the class (I wouldn't call this a weakness, just a warning).",
                "The course is well-organized with very clear lectures and relevant homework. Sometimes the homework was extremely hard and required A LOT of time and effort, but they are doable with helpful office hours. The exams were a lot easier compared to the homework, mostly concerned with fundamental concepts in the class.",
                "A strength of the course is the extensive support provided through office hours. I really appreciated the time and help of the TAs and ULAs. A weakness of the course is the lectures, which were sometimes unclear or extremely fast-paced. However, this weakness was balanced out with the support of the TAs.",
                "You will learn a lot from working out the PSETs but they will be very time consuming. The lectures are helpful but are completely proof-based, which does not really help with intuition when it comes to thinking of linear algebra as a whole.",
                "I think the lectures can sometimes be too fast to follow up with and it takes me some time to understand the theorems we proved in class. However, the problem sets and office hours are pretty helpful in understanding topics.",
                "Professor Boixeda Alvarez is a brilliant professor, with extraordinary lecturing abilities. All the lectures were very neat and well-structured, ensuring that as many students as possible grasped the difficult concepts from class. The practice materials for the midterms and the final were very helpful. I strongly appreciate that the students were able to collaborate in order to solve some of the hardest problems on the assignments, developing a very friendly and supportive community in the course, optimal for learning.",
                "A lot of lecturing that could be learned from textbook.",
                "The curriculum was very structured and easy to keep track of assignments and tests. The sheer accessibility to office hours, ULAs, TAs, the teacher, and many other resources was also a strength of this class. However, the due dates of the PSETs were inconvenient as they were due the day after the class we learned most of the material needed to complete the PSET.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by possibly incorporating an introduction at the beginning of the year that provides the students with advice on how to succeed (e.g. \"skim the corresponding textbook chapter before class\").",
                "Weaknesses: The course was intellectually challenging to the point of frustration at times. Problem sets were very time intensive and difficult; without office hours, it would be very difficult to succeed. Although the course was difficult, I don't feel like it was rewarding because I never felt like I truly mastered or understood the material. The grading of midterms was also unclear.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Professor Boixeda Alvarez was an engaging lecturer and I think my proof-writing abilities grew a lot. Furthermore, the class was set up in a way that encouraged students to ask for help; there were numerous office hour times and the TAs were invaluable resources. After our first midterm, if you got below a certain grade, students were also offered small study group tutoring. The main difficulty came from the psets -- the midterms were very reasonable in terms of difficulty level."

You will be challenged to think of math in a way you haven't before if you've never taken pure math before, and I think the possible applications of what we learn are extremely diverse, especially in the world of computer science.",

However, only take this course if you are interested in the theory behind linear algebra and the proofs. If you are taking linear algebra because you hope to apply it, I highly recommend taking 222 because the applications of linear algebra are not the focus of this course.",
                "Solid class with interesting content, but be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort for the psets.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student since it gave a very strong foundation for proof-writing, an essential skill in all higher-level math classes. However, it is quite challenging and work-heavy, so students should be prepared to put time and energy into the course.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in pursuing a math major. I took this class as a physics major interested in proof-based math, and it definitely took me by surprise how much time the PSETs took. If math is not your main thing, I would advise against taking this class as the PSETs are definitely very time consuming. I would say however that the exams are very easy relative to the PSETs. Ultimately I do think I learned a lot from this class, whether proof based thinking or linear algebra in general. It solidified a lot of the bits and pieces of linear that I learned beforehand.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in math. I think the course is challenging in a good way and can be very engaging especially if one dedicates time towards going to office hours.",
                "Absolutely, I would strongly recommend this class to the students! Even if you are not a Math major, this class represents a necessary foundation in many actual fields, including AI, cryptography, optimizations, graph algorithms, computational biology, etc.",
                "No one takes this course unless they plan to major in a stem-related field. Its sort of a necessary evil. The idea of recommending makes no sense as hardly any takes this course on their own violation.",
                "Yes. I learned a lot of math, and I learned to handle really long and intensive psets. Additionally, the collaboration in the class was great. We'd stay long after office hours together to work through things.",
                "Yes, it is foundational for many majors and in general is a solid introduction to proof-writing not just as a mathematical tool but as a new way of thinking.",
                "It depends on what the student wishes to accomplish by taking it. I would take MATH 225 if a student has intentions of pursuing any upper level math courses. Additionally, I think exploring linear algebra from a proof-based perspective allows for a deeper understanding of the material and its derivations, which could be rewarding. Personally, I would take this class with Professor Boixeda Alvarez if I had a relatively light semester, was willing to devote a lot of time to the material, and cared a lot about knowledge acquisition in math. From a more practical standpoint, I would tend to shy away from it."
