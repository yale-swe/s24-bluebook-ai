                "By taking Queer Caribbean Performance, I further developed my knowledge on the Caribbean as a place that can teach us about the world. Before taking this course, I took Caribbean Diasporic Literature and it was in that class that I felt like I somehow learned about everything. I believe that scholarship that informs the Caribbean, surrounds the Caribbean, and comes out of the Caribbean can truly teach us about everything. More specifically, I learned more profoundly about the Atlantic as a process on top of a place where queer-ing happens. I learned about Blackness and queerness being identities or social formations that are inherent to each other. We start off the course with very foundational texts from scholars such as Stuart Hall, Omiseeke Natasha Tinsley, and Audre Lorde which not only ground the rest of the course but also make sense of all that I had learned in my prior ethnic studies courses. For the first time, I learned about performance, spectacle, dance, religion, and more as embodied practices. I truly learned a great deal in this class.",
                "I really learned how to find fun in readings and engage with readings and find other media to connect to the work that we were reading and engage with topics that I had not experienced with other courses. I think I was able to find a method to organize my readings as well which was amazing.",
                "I was introduced to the field of Queer studies.",
                "I learned about thinkers across the Caribbean and their theories of the Caribbean as a definition, as a multiplicity of societies, and as a queer locale. Because most of my previous classes had not focused on this section of the world, I learned a lot in terms of concept, and, given my major is more concentrated on literature, the performance lens was a fresh education for me as well."

            "comments": [
                "A major strength of this course is that we are given mixed-media reading assignments. On top of reading written texts, we are also assigned digital media such as films or shorter clips of performances. I feel like this really enriched my experience in this theater, dance, and performance studies course.\r\n\r\nAnother major strength of this course is the weekly mixtape journals. I appreciated that they are not \"marketed\" as a traditional reading response, but rather a weekly contribution that forms part of a larger class project (that is, the mixtape that we all contribute to and create together before every class). I thought it very important that part of this weekly mixtape was offering up a piece of digital media whether it be a painting, a music video, a song, a photograph, a clip from a television show, etc. that also added to the multimedia aspect of this course that was very generative.\r\n\r\nFinally, the final project, the embodied book club, was a major strength of this course. It is a very creative and fitting way to end our time and scholarship within the course. The embodied book club allowed us to apply what we learned by creating a digital reading guide for our classmates and professor and by creating a guided embodied practice that we lead ourselves, too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an area for improvement could be the embodied component of this course. I think it would be enriching for us to spend a bit more time dissecting the embodied practices we started some of our classes with or perhaps even doing some readings specifically and concretely about embodiment and how we can employ embodied movement to complement and enrich the seminar-style component of the class.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, more in-class guidance on the embodied book club would have been very beneficial. I think I was still a little bit confused as to what was expected of us leading up to facilitating my presentation in class. Perhaps, giving us practice creating movement scores and carrying them out would be a good way to help prepare us for the final.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think providing more structure for the mixtape facilitation component of this course would have been very generative. Perhaps asking students to provide a visual aid component would have been helpful, at least for me, because sometimes it was hard to follow and stay engaged when my classmates would read aloud their facilitation without some form of visual aid helping me follow along.",
                "I think that this course really was organized and well-planned out with different topics and expanding understanding of queerness and Caribbean identity.",
                "Professor Reid curated a really well-structure syllabus that exposed us to a great range of themes/topics that related to queer Caribbean performance in diverse and thought-provoking ways. Many of these readings were challenging, but in a good way that pushed us to closely examine and think critically about the history and formations of the Caribbean that our topics of interest were situated in. Activities and discussions were structured well so that we could really engage with these themes thoroughly and holistically. The emphasis on embodiment and movement was especially uniquely powerful!",
                "The course fosters connection between students and promotes discussions.. The course should be more structured and have more variance in assignments.",
                "The class was well-constructed to take students through theory across Caribbean countries and writers, illuminating intersections of race and queerness across individual islands, the Atlantic Ocean, and diaspora stretches. I thought that the \"mixtape\" was a great way to concentrate on the themes of the readings while going back-and-forth with peers, and I enjoyed the final project and the presentations with them, which allowed us to apply performance as a critical lens.",
                "The energy and environment Professor Reid created in the class was truly amazing. It felt like such a safe space - where all of us had the freedom and peace to be ourselves and ask tough questions while also  learning and having fun."

I think especially if you are an Ethnicity, Race, & Migration major, you must take this course. I cannot stress enough how much I believe what is taught in this course is a part of the ethnic studies canon. The multidisciplinary nature of the course is very compelling as well.",

                "Yes! The themes are super expansive and sit at the intersection of Caribbean studies, queer studies, and performance studies in a way that is super intriguing to anyone interested in any (or all) of these fields. The course is really engaging and challenging, pushing students to ask really thoughtful questions that stick with us beyond the class.",

The focus on the Caribbean led to a unique, distinctive syllabus, and discussions were always involved and energetic. The assignments and projects led to a lot of wonderful engagement with Professor Reid and with other students."
