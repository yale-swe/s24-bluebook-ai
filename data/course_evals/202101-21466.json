                "This class was amazing! The experiments we performed improved my understanding of cell bio. Prof. Wolenski really cares about his students and wanted us to have fun. Life is good!",
                "only strengths!!! having a COVID-19 safe lab was the only in-person class experience I had this semester, and I was very grateful for the welcoming environment in this lab every Mon & Wed. Having little cell biology wet-lab experience going in, I also appreciated the hands-on learning in each experiment for each student, and the ability to improve as the course progressed",
                "The best STEM course I've ever taken!  The strength of this course lies completely in Professor Wolenski. The amount of thought, care, and knowledge he imparts to this lab and to his students is unmatched.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is the instructor, Prof. Wolenski. He is deeply engaged during class, and provides individual feedback to each of his students. This class is definitely designed for both experienced and inexperienced students, and teamwork is facilitated by the nature of the class's designstudents are expected to work collaboratively and help each other when needed. If there was one weakness I had to list, it would be that sometimes the procedure of experiments was not comprehensively explained. However, this was a rare occurrence and likely due to last-minute changes the instructors had to make because of Covid-19 complications.",
                "This course is taught wonderfully. It fosters a collaborative learning environment that the vast majority of Yale courses lack. You will learn loads. My only recommendation would be that it would be nice to receive written feedback on our presentations. Take the course if you can--but apply early! Email Prof Wolenski ASAP."

Labs can be long but everyone in the class got very close despite the pandemic. It was an amazing opportunity to learn fundamental lab techniques and we got to give presentations (\"job talks\") to deepen our understanding of course themes.",

                "absolutely!!! this class really became my family over the course of the semester; we were able to learn and laugh while at it. looked forward to every Mon & Wed, best class i've taken at yale so far, and will be memorable for years to come. the techniques we learned will prepare me very well for detailed wet-lab work for senior year. make sure to send an email to prof. wolenski by summer after first-year to have a spot!",
                "Yes, wholeheartedly! A phenomenal course taught by one of, if not, the best professor I've had at Yale. Professor Wolenski's engagement with his class surpasses every single expectation. The whole course is geared towards helping you develop the skills needed to become a better scientist, and you'll have the most inspiring guide and most supportive community while doing so.",
                "This is hands-down the best class I have taken at Yale, and probably the best lab course in the MCDB department. I'd definitely recommend this class to any student considering doing independent research or pursuing research as a career or graduate school option. Just be sure to apply early (by emailing Prof. Wolenski) during your first year to secure a spot during your junior year.",
                "Taking this course was one of the best decisions I've made. If you are lucky enough to get a spot (email early!!) you will not regret taking it. It's a wonderful way to learn cell biology, meet friends, and have a wonderful and close experience with a kind and thoughtful professor."
