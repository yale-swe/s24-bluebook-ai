I learned how to discern subtleties between typefaces, how to think more rigorously about choosing typefaces, and how to design at drastically different scales. I also learned how to iterate quite a bit, and most enjoyed when we were tasked with wider experimentation before narrowing in on a particular direction. I will be taking that approach with me into my future work. I also learned quite a bit about purposeful communication, and how the different mediums we were designing for communicated in particular ways. A lot of my learning came out of the critique time, seeing how others responded to work, and learning how to look and verbalize what I saw."

I appreciated how the assignments spanned a broad range of forms, and how slowly (slowly) the course went in relation to our other courses . . . the opportunity to build up a body of work around a topic was unlike most other things we were doing this semester. The timing of the projects was also spot on, wouldnt change a thing about that."
