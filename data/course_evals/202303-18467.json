It was an intellectual delight to pair theories with later readings and articles in surprising ways, and the course is very well-designed to facilitate this kind of close-analysis and commenntary. I also undertook a sociological research study of my own for the first time, which was a new and helpful experience."

                "Strengths: super interesting material. The TF provides thorough feedback on essays. Professor Alexander is very smart and encourages us to think critically with the texts.\r\nWeaknesses: way too much reading! One week we had a 5-page essay plus six readings due, which is not possible or productive for or learning. Also, the readings were each complicated, and it felt as though the professor expected us to come to class having understood everything and already be in the mindset of making connections to past readings. I really wish that we could've spent a chunk of the beginning of each class clarifying the readings. A past professor I had really walked the class through each reading and its logical flow (often on a chalkboard) so that we could pinpoint what questions we had and make connections, and I wish that Professor Alexander had done something similar to that. I also wish that I had gotten feedback on my essays from Professor Alexander himself, not just the TF even though she was great.",
                "Strengths: Material, accessible, organized.\r\nWeaknesses: Instructions were unclear at times.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- The syllabus is very tight and well-curated and everything very clearly inter-relates\r\n- The seminar was always a lively discussion\r\n- Everyone who had a comment was able to speak, and discussion was mostly helpful in furthering understanding\r\n- The class is overall very interesting and is something I've not encountered in other classes or departments\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The grade is based almost entirely on the four papers, which is not only a LOT of writing, but the Canvas posts, required presentation of a reading, and longer presentation of our final projects are not explicitly included in the grading scheme, and for how much work and preparation they require, it seems like they should be.\r\n- There are weeks with a LOT of reading, much more than other classes at Yale\r\n- Sometimes additional readings\/articles would be posted very last-minute, without much advance notification\r\n- Very little essay feedback until the final paper (which had a signifnicant amount of helpful feedback)\r\n- The syllabus was almost TOO tight; it felt sometimes that this class had a very clear lesson plan that students could not deviate from during class discussion or an essay. I would have liked more encouragement of student intellectual freedom.\r\n- Most importantly, there are a LOT of papers, and even though they are only ~5 pages each, one is a significant research project and this, compiled with the bulk of readings, makes for an enormous workload."

                "If you enjoy and have time to do a lot of reading every week, then sure. But I don't think the course is taught in the most productive way. The professor often didn't spend enough time walking us through readings or ideas and we were expected to understand a lot on our own. I didn't get a ton out of the course because I didn't do most of the readings.",
                "Yes!",
                "Maybe, but probably not. The entire first section is incredibly dense theory, so be prepared to parse through that, and it is important to understand well so one can engage with later texts, and I would say many students were not expecting such difficult readings to begin with. This was however the most interesting section, and the later readings, while often kinder, became less engaging as the course progressed. One should be VERY interested in the topic of aesthetics and the sociological method and prepared to read dense theory and write four essays alongside a significant amount of regular weekly reading to successfully navigate this course."
