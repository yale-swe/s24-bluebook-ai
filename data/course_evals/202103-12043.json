Getting to dive deeply into both poets' bibliographies chronologically, alongside their decades of correspondences, was a deeply rewarding literary and cultural study.",

                "Strengths: The poetry is great (Bishop is definitely a poet's poet) and the structure is perfect for a senior seminar. The readings are very reasonable, which allow you to spend more time on the poems before coming to class. And Professor Hammer is extremely kind and knowledgeable about the subject. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "I thought ENGL 345 was a very strong course. Unfortunately, the nature of reading one or more books of poetry each week means that there simply isn't time to discuss everything in detail, but I don't think this can be helped -- and it was still wonderful to engage with the work on my own time.",
                "Prof. Hammer has strong familiarity/ knowledge of course material, and the seminar format makes for productive conversations around the readings.",
                "I loved that this was a discussion-based course. Professor Hammer did a great job of structuring the discussion and offering insights while allowing the majority of class time to be dedicated to students sharing their ideas. I cannot think of any areas of improvement."

                "I would definitely recommend ENGL 345 to anyone interested in 20th century poetry or in the social spheres of contemporary English-language literature.",
                "I would recommend this course primarily to students who are already enthusiastic about Bishop and Lowell. Read some of their poems before applying; although there's definitely variation within their catalogues, each writer does have a very particular style that can become difficult to work with if you realize it's not your thing. If you like what you see, absolutely dive inthe discussions are fascinating and Professor Hammer is amazing.",
                "Yes! I enjoyed this course so much!",
