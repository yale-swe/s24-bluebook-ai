                "Amazing professor. Professor Mattingly is incredibly knowledgable and a great leader of discussions. Readings were always very interesting. Sometimes, I wish the readings connected more to the overarching topic we were discussing that week, but overall a very good, diverse selection.",
                "The strengths of this course include the variety of content covered, its grading scheme, and the instructor's collective approach to teaching. I encourage the instructor to maintain the general structure of this course as is. \r\n\r\nOne way to potentially improve this course is to assign a foundational text to each section for reference. One example of this could be to assign a short introduction to the mechanics of China's Golden Projects during the week on surveillance. While the academic literature is great and should be included, including a descriptive piece each week might help improve in-class discussion.",
                "Professor Mattingly is organized and gives very helpful feedback",
                "It's hard to think of weaknesses! The weekly readings were all interesting and thought-provoking, and clearly very thoughtfully put together. By far the best class on China I've taken at Yale.",
                "Professor Mattingly is bar none the best professor I've had at Yale. He makes every class incredibly engaging, and his understanding and flexibility took away so much stress throughout the semester. I'd so heavily recommend this class to anyone, not just for the material, but also to take a class with Professor Mattingly.",
                "Strengths: Incredible Professor with high flexibility and genuine care for students learning experience. Case studies and readings were always relevant and discussed and pretty compelling. Workload was reasonable. \r\nWeaknesses: Seminar size became fairly large, but that turned out to be okay.",
                "Strength: plan for each class is clear;\r\nWeakness: the quality of some reading materials is not so good.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. I thought its strengths were the quality of the discussions, the variety of the readings, and the professor. I did not find there to be any weaknesses."

I would absolutely recommend it, particularly for those who are prepared to do a significant amount of reading/prep for each session. It's worth it to put the time in!",
                "Yes, especially if you've taken and enjoyed Rise of China. Taking a seminar with Professor Mattingly was a valuable experience -- you get more individual feedback and get to hear his informed takes on the topics on the syllabus. He is also just a super approachable and kind professor.",
                "Yes! I got so much out of this class and Professor Mattingly is such a great professor who truly cares about his students. The small format of the class allowed for productive and nuanced discussion. I would highly recommend this class."
