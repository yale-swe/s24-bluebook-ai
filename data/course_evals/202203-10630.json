Course material is entirely a review of previous material learned in L1 and L2, and the textbook material is only taught up to  4. \r\nWeaknesses: RUSS 130 is less structured than RUSS 110 and RUSS 120.",
                "A bit unorganized, especially with homework and exam schedules. But the environment is very supportive, the professor is always willing and eager to help, and the material is so fun and exciting",
                "Irina Andreevna is a wonderful professor, she is the driving force behind the course's quality and dynamism. I came to class everyday excited to learn Russian because she and John (my TF) helped cultivate a really great environment I felt comfortable speaking in.",
                "Strengths: meets every day, amazing instructor, not too challenging or too much workload but you still learn a lot. I heard Irina may be gone after this year but Ilia and Anastasia are also excellent, you can't go wrong with any of them. Would've loved more readings and feedback on those but that's a very small complaint."

                "I would recommend this course. The material isn't particularly challenging at this point in learning the Russian language, but as it is a language course the workload is still high--comparable to L1 and L2.",
                "1000%. If you need a language credit, take russian. Its challenging but so so so rewarding. Irina Andreevna is one of the best and kindest professors at Yale",
                "I would in a heartbeat, the Russian department is amazing and Irina Andreevna is a great professor. Classes were informative, interactive, and full of opportunities to engage with the language. Feedback was given often and clearly. I have no complaints.",
                "Yes! Most people will be just taking it for the L3 credit and dropping after this semester, but I think Russian is a lot of fun and worth learning just for the sake of it!"
