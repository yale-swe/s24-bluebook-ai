KG brings a lot of interesting experience and unique stories from her time on the bench and in the Connecticut Innocence Project, so it's really nice to hear about her life and work.",
                "100%!! If you get into this class and you're interested in the legal system, TAKE THIS CLASS! KG will give you a firsthand experience in how the legal system fails folks with a mixture of SCOTUS cases, personal experience, and other research. Super interesting discussions and class.",
                "Definitely! KG is a wonderful professor who engages with her students wholeheartedly. (Sometimes wish she gave more feedback). It was an excellent introduction into the problems facing the world and the criminal justice system."
