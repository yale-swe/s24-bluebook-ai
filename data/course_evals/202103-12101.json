I learned how to edit in Da Vinci Resolve. Continued to learn how to be a good listener and give creative\/writing advice to my peers.",

It's a great group of people and Jon creates a really supportive and open environment. Plus, I found it very fun! \r\n\r\nWeakness - might benefit from 2 two hour sessions per week instead of one 3.5 \/ 4-hour block. Could also benefit from more support and communication from the Arts \/ extra funding from Yale \/ more importance placed on this course and the Film Major by Yale.",

Definitely a lot of work, but since it is a year-long course, you would know this before signing up."
