                "This course is fantastic in basically every way. The only flaw I can think of is the awkwardness of student presentations. This is more a question of flow and relevance because at times student presentations look very different from one another and cover such different thematic subjects that it's difficult to see the connections between the course and the student topics. However, the student presentations were so important to demonstrating the diversity of the history and philosophy being covered, that their weakness is in many ways the entire point. The presentations are meant to note how much the course itself will not cover and to keep students interested in exploring the subject matter once the course has ended. In terms of strengths, I think the course had some of the best readings I've ever had at Yale, and the professor had an insane ability to both clarify the reading but also offer contesting interpretations in a way which brought the text to life. I think the professor himself was crucial to students' sense of confidence in being able to critique such seminal pieces of writing.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I don't think there is another course at Yale that forces you to learn and apply yourself in as honest a manner as this one. I especially think this course is crucial for anyone who wants to understand modern history and social research as all of the thinkers included in the syllabus were foundational to the disciplines of history, sociology, economics, political theory, and anthropology. In addition, the professor is a walking encyclopedia who can offer insight to literally any question and I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone else on Yale's campus who enjoys teaching as much as he does. This course may be a lot of work, but I think it is truly worth it.",
                "Undoubtedly, especially if you are interested in gaining a stronger understanding and greater appreciation of Marx's (and his contemporaries'/intellectual descendents') writing.",
                "Yes, I would",
