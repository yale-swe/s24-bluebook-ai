                "This course taught me how to engage with climate science on a literary, critical level. We covered a wide range of topics, from engaging with stories that shape the modern narrative of Nature\/Climate\/Fossil Fuels to famous academic works that influence current priorities in climate science.",
                "This course highlights just how important the humanities are when considering climate change. The humanities relate to how we view nature and the human species as actors in our world. They determine how the public perceives climate change and environmental disaster, and therefore what type of response we can expect. Additionally, climate change humanities relates to how we can develop fair and equitable response to climate change and disaster. This course makes it clear that, although climate science is hugely important, the humanities cannot be discounted when it comes to planning and enacting our climate future.",

                "I think this class definitely gave me a very different perspective coming from a stem heavy background, and the readings were generally phenomenal, but I think the main way the class fell short for me was that discussions often felt kinda unproductive whether from too much editorializing by the professor or fixating on an aspect of readings\/topics while ignoring large chunks of the content. Also, less an issue with the class itself than the topic, but there were a lot of times when approaching climate change from the humanities felt very disconnected from actually addressing climate change or shaping perspectives of it.",
                "Strengths: fantastic readings, and great writing feedback\r\nWeaknesses: class could have been more seminar-style with more student discussion",
                "Strengths: The discussions and the wide range of interdisciplinary readings.",
                "Strengths- Wide range of topics that expand climate science beyond the scientific sphere. The multitude of topics means that anyone interested in the course will likely engage with the topics they hoped for.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- A bit too broad at times. It is sometimes difficult to find an overarching question to guide one's thoughts throughout the course. Students often struggle to reference prior readings, especially literary works, in discussions of academic works.",
                "The content of this course was fantastic! The reading covered a lot of ground, and varied a lot in style and time period written. So, even if there was a week that was slightly less exciting for me, the next week would surely serve as a way to reengage with the material. \r\n\r\nAlthough I liked the full-group discussion, I found that we never got to a point where a conversation flowed freely. I was waiting for us to get a point where we just jumped from student to student, instead of having Professor Lindskog respond to each student and redirect to the next, but we never quite got there. This is probably the only area of improvement I see for the course.",

                "If you do not have much experience with the natural sciences, I recommend giving this class a shot. You will learn more than you could have ever possibly imagined within the scope of a single semester. I cannot speak for environmental studies students, but it seems like they had strong engagement with the class as well. Just be prepared to find a few texts you are fascinated with and try to find time to engage with them even after their in-class time comes to a conclusion.",
                "Yes! The content is interesting, the discussion is engaging, and Professor Lindskog assigns very flexible assignments so that students can study within their chosen area of interest. I would especially recommend this course for students who tend to focus on more scientific or practical courses, because it is really quite eye-opening into just how interdisciplinary our climate response must be.",
