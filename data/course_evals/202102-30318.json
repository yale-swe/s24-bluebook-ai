                "I learned so much from this course! Ultimately, it was a lesson in perspective and considering how conflicting narratives can be true at the same time. I learned so much about the Israeli condition and Israeli culture.",
                "In this course, I was able to learn more about the history of Israel as well as current events in Israel by analyzing different works. I was able to learn how to understand and perform close analyses of movies, books, artwork, as well as other media forms.",
                "\"Israeli Narratives\" encouraged me to think critically about the Israeli condition, revealing its complexity. Discussions were based on multiple kinds of cultural productions, which led students to enriching discussions about diverse narratives. These group interactions allowed me to understand how the situation in Israel can't be reduced to a single point of view, and must comprehend varied perspectives. Even though the course's main focus was understanding political, social and domestic space in Israel, I also managed to further develop my ability to analise how different media are more effective at communicating certain parts of a story. Therefore, the course didn't only stimulate debates about the specific Israeli context, but also about aesthetic choices and the limits imposed by a medium more broadly.",
                "I developed a strong understanding of Israeli history and culture, as well as the ability to think critically about recent events in light of that history. I also strengthened my ability to analyze film, literature, and art. Finally, I feel that my writing greatly improved while taking this course."

                "Even as a summer course where each class is much longer, Prof. Goren structured it in a way with breaks and changes of pace and ideas that made the time fly by.",
                "The class was discussion based which led to a lot of interesting conversations about the readings and our interpretations of them. The guest speakers and the variety in the mediums we used to learn were a strength. From readings, tv shows, movies, books, art, everything was super interesting. A weakness would definitely be that we werent able to do our outside cultural events in person. We had to watch recordings of them, which is understandable considering that the class was taught online.",
                "Strengths -- all of the syllabus content was so interesting, I found myself recommending almost everything we did to friends\/family. We had great guest speakers, all of them were incredibly interesting. I enjoyed class discussions and I enjoyed when Shiri would lecture! \r\n\r\nAreas for improvement -- the class was such a positive experience, so it's difficult to think of any. I did enjoy all of our class discussions, but, like we talked about in class, 3 hours is a long time to be on Zoom. Maybe switching up the style of discussion (ie, more breakout rooms) would help? However, I did appreciate how most classes were discussion-based (rather than activity-based) and especially when we would all go around and share our thoughts.",
                "This course provided an in-depth approach to understanding Israel and the story of the nation of Israeli in both historical and present times which was a strength. Also, it provided many opportunities to learn about Israel in different ways such as short films, graphic novels, or traditional books. Also, there was opportunity to interact with classmates and discuss the information in the course. One weakness in the course was that sometimes the readings were long and very time consuming, especially during weeks when the midterm or final was due. This can be improved by decreasing the workload when those larger assignments are due.",
                "The \"Israeli Narratives\" course approaches its main theme through a variety of works by authors, directors, and photographers from multiple backgrounds. This allowed us to understand how the Israeli condition is complex and made up of many perspectives and points of view. Students were encouraged to read and watch most of the materials outside of synchronous meetings, so that the time we spent together was dedicated to group discussions. This allowed us to interact more, which made the course similar to an in person one. Furthermore, a few guest speakers were invited to classes, and this guided our discussions and brought more specific insights about the works analyzed. Additionally, students were given a fair amount of time to complete each assignment, and evaluations were accompanied by productive suggestions by professor Shiri Goren. I didn't notice any significant weaknesses in the course. The only idea I had was to make the second outside event report optional, because completing it on the last week of the course left less time to do the final project.",
                "Overall I really liked this course. It was well organized and the professor was considerate of the student's needs and challenges during COVID and online learning. For example, the professor always inserted a couple short breaks in the class (3hrs long) so that the students would not burn out on zoom, which I found really helpful. The environment was also positive and engaging, which made it easy to participate.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of any weaknesses other than those caused by the online format (zoom fatigue, online distractions, etc.)."

                "I would and already have recommended this class to other students. The content is extremely interesting and Dr. Goren is an amazing professor. She went above and beyond on several occasions. From making sure that I knew I had extra time if needed when I got sick, to reviewing and leaving suggestions on my rough draft when I was worried about my final paper, Dr. Goren was the professor every student hopes to have.",
                "I absolutely would! I had a great experience in this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because the material learned in class was very interesting, and I enjoyed the discussion style of the course. Also, the class is separated into segments about a different asepct of the Israeli story which made it easier to learn about a variety of topics on Israel. Although the readings for the class were a little long, they were all worth reading.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. \"Israeli Narratives\" manages to expand students' views of the Israeli condition, independently from their initial opinion about the situation and about the establishment of the State of Israel. Classes stimulated critical thinking and increased my knowledge about the Israeli culture. The course was intellectually challenging and also encouraged students to continue reading Israeli authors and watching Israeli films after classes ended. Moreover, Professor Goren gave us a lot of liberty to choose our final project's medium, so that we could further develop other skills outside of what the course expected us to discuss and work with.",
                "I would definitely recommend the course. The books we read, the films we watch, and the things we do in that class are fascinating and the discussions are engaging. Not only is it a course in Israeli literature and film, but it covers the most fundamental pieces of Israeli history and culture. Finally, this course provides historical and cultural insight into current events in Israel and in international politics involving Israel. Lastly, this course was designed so that the information was accessible to everyone, not just those within Israeli culture. Overall, the course is fascinating and enjoyable, and serves as a door into another part of the world."
