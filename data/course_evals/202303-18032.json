                "I learned about the ways in which race and gender are implicitly tied to the historical developments of technologies, and the medical field more generally. I learned how to read complex philosophical works and dense books, and understand them clearly enough to discuss them in seminar every week. I also became more appreciative of STS as a field more generally.",
                "I got insights into the interaction of race, medicine, and technology. I also learned about various sociological concepts and theories and applied them to the various works we read.",
                "This course is a wonderful STS studies course that focuses specifically on medical technologies with the insertion of the axis of race. I learnt a lot about critically examining technology through lenses of racial hierarchy, and it gave me the general skills to take critical lenses towards technology. This was a great intro to STS studies for someone who had never really engaged with it.",
                "I gained an introduction to some of the leading theories and theorists in the field of science and technology studies (ex. Bruno Latour, Donna Haraway, Pinch and Bijker, Langdon Winner, etc.) Also gained a lot of opportunities to think about the intersection of race, medicine and technology through the many texts we read. One lesson that I learned in this course that really stuck to me is that new technologies don't usually develop through applications of basic science; often times people invent new things that work (sometimes accidentally), and those technologies are then deconstructed to gain new scientific knowledge."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: This course has an amazing set of books that must be read. Some of them were more likable than others, but every single one added something new to our conversations. We came back to the same themes throughout the semester, but not to the point where we were belaboring on a point, and I think part of that is due to the diversity of books chosen. Additionally, the size of the seminar was absolutely perfect. I believe that even one or two more people would have limited the ability for really enriching discussion. I also appreciated the diverse backgrounds in the class. Having students in the graduate schools was also very exciting, as it elevated the discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: This course was so amazing that it is honestly hard to think of any weaknesses. One very minor point is that it may be beneficial for us to have a running list of key themes and ideas from the theorists that we add to after every class, much like we do for the primer. It's a little difficult (at least for me) to keep some of the theorists straight in my head in the moment, and having a little sheet that we can easily refer to with everyone's comments on the theorists may be helpful. I want to emphasize, though, that this is a super minor comment. This is one of the best courses I have ever taken!",
                "This course does a great job of introducing the concepts/theorists that are important for the future readings, and every week's readings was powerful and interesting to think about. I got clear and timely feedback on all the assignments, and Prof Menon kept me engaged throughout the class. However at times the discussions felt dominated by the graduate students who clearly had more background that me in the subject (although it is a 300 level sociology course so it is understandable).",
                "Prof Menon is so incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter and was definitely a highlight of the course. She definitely fostered a good seminar community. The readings were all really worth going through and reading.",
                "The course is structured well and the texts are ordered quite nicely. Professor Menon is a very passionate lecturer and that alone makes the course fun and interesting (even as I discovered that I actually really dislike sociology.) I think taking a bit more time early on to discuss and unpack the sociological theories introduced at the start of the course would go a long way in enriching discussions of the other texts we go through. I also think that reading a book a week is quite heavy even for a small seminar -- it was pretty apparent by the end of the semester that many people weren't getting through large parts of the assigned texts. It might be appropriate to spend two weeks going over one or two of the longer texts (maybe Traveling with Sugar?) One thing I also noticed was that there was a big gap in the quality and quantity of graduate students' contributions to in-class discussions compared to the undergraduates. I found it a little difficult at times to catch on to what they were saying because they often cited books I hadn't read or theories I hadn't heard of. Hence I had the impression that there were two conversations taking place in class, one led by the grad students and another by the undergrads. This is of course me just being nitpicky -- I learned a lot in this course, far more than I was expecting, and the focus of the course (on race, medicine and technology) is a perfect starting point to think about some of the wider issues in medicine and healthcare."

                "Absolutely, I would recommend this course! Taking this class has been one of my highlights of the Yale experience, and I am so glad I got into the seminar. I'll even go so far as to say that for anyone interested in sociology, history of medicine, medical research, or practicing medicine, this class should be required. It really teaches you about the ways in which racial biases creep into standard practices, and makes you reflect about how to address these issues as you navigate medicine. It also strikes a balance that few Yale courses successfully do in that it talks about these complex topics while actually saying something substantive. I feel that some courses at Yale say a lot about nothing, but every conversation we had in this class was so meaningful.",
                "Yes! The material is interesting and you get to think deeply about a lot of technologies that you would normally not associate with racial bias. The readings and discussions are very thought-provoking and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes! This course is such a great class to take - for anyone interested in STS, history of science, or just is considering going into medicine/medical adjacent, this is a great course. I think it really pushed me to think critically about tech and also gave me a chance to really push my academic scholarship further.",
                "Even though it is officially a sociology course and discussions of assigned readings are primarily grounded in sociological theory, it is very interdisciplinary and accessible to people from all sorts of backgrounds; pre-med, biology, engineering, history, and the other social sciences. Would highly recommend taking it (even if you find out like I did that sociology is not my subject of interest). Professor Menon is wonderful and knowledgeable, and the readings are selected in such a way that it's easy to put them in conversation with each other.",
                "YES!! Favorite Sociology course I have taken at Yale. Amazing readings, great prof, and wonderful and engaged class discussion. A class for anyone interested in medicine and race. Readings are enjoyable and eye opening. Would highly recommend."
