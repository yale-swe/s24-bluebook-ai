    "Learned Calculus 2",
    "I learned a lot about Calculus, specifically relating to integration and series.",
    "I have been able to learn more principles of calculus with their application and have covered topics which will prepare me well for studying multi-variable calculus and other subjects that involve mathematical computations. Skills like problem solving techniques, proving the reason for an answer to a question as well as choosing efficient ways to solve problems were some of the skill sets I acquired.",
    "Improved calculus skills.",
    ".",
    "Learned how to take integrals and deal with series.",
    "I truly felt that I learned very little from this course. The way the course was structured was not conducive to learning at all.",
    "Knowledge of calculus of functions with a single variable both practically in the order of solving specific problems and theoretically, understanding what these concepts mean and why they are used today.",
    "I thought this was a well taught course and that my professor was helpful in answering questions in a way that helped lead students to answers on their own."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: Structured Class\r\n\r\nWeakness: Very fast paced. Very hard for one with minor misunderstandings to keep pace",
    "The strength of the course is the amount of help available to you -- each professor holds office hours, and there are really useful peer tutor hours as well. I think the weakness of this course is its fundamental base -- the flipped structure, where we watch videos of concepts at home and do problems in class. It makes it really difficult to fully understand a topic, and often times we move onto the next topic before we comprehensively cover the previous topic.",
    "The strengths of this course were the individual professors who explained concepts during class. The weakness of this course was the homework video that was supposed to implement a \"flipped classroom.\" The videos often went through only one example and left out much of the material the textbook covered. The videos weren't that helpful and Professor Clark ended up reteaching everything in class, once realizing that the videos didn't aid the understanding for the students.",
    "A curve.",
    "Strengths: pre-class videos and quizzes that are a good way to prepare early on the assigned material, class structured well to learn the principles of single variable calculus and P-sets that cover broad range of topics\r\n\r\nWeakness: Some P-sets are longer and should be decreased but other than that, well organized and though course.",
    "I did not really like the flipped classroom structure.",
    "Make it not a flipped course. The lectures are not in-depth enough.",
    "A huge weakness would be the flip course aspect - I feel like I dont learn anything in class.",
    "I really did not enjoy the flipped classroom set-up. I would have preferred a traditional lecture-style class. I don't believe I learned the material nearly as effective on my own, and the idea of working together to solve problems with other students did not live up to its expectation.",
    "The \"flipped classroom\" structure of this course needs to be improved. I do think having students review the concepts prior to learning them in class is helpful as students are \"primed\" and it allows for students to come with prepared questions. However, the Prep Videos are in no way, shape, or form helpful. They are not taught in an easy to understand manner, nor do they follow along with the way the information is presented in the textbook. I despise the videos and believe they should be thrown out. I also am so sorely disappointed in the \"extra help\" resources of this course. Although the peer tutors were helpful, there needs to be more than just 2 tutors. They are not available enough because there are too few of them. Moreover, when I approached not only my professor but also the course director about the private tutors and the extra help sessions offered to students receiving lower than a C, my multiple emails went unreturned. When I met with my professor in-person, I was told he \"would get back to me\", which never occurred. This was the same response I received in my various emails to my professor and the course coordinator. Overall, I am very disappointed with this course and the availability of resources.",
    "I think the online videos are helpful. The problem sets often don't align with the kind of problems done in class or the ones seen on exams, and rather seem like the most complex examples of the studied topics that just take up way too much time to do. I think this class is very good at making us think conceptually instead of about formulas or specific operations which I really appreciate."

    "Only take this course if you have to",
    "I think most students take this course because it is a prerequisite for other classes, but if someone was just interested in maths -- I wouldn't recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in taking calculus.",
    "Very enjoyable Maths, how get the lack of the curve makes it a lot more stressful, unecessarily so.",
    "Yes. Learning this course will increase computational skills and problem solving techniques for calculus related problems. Also, as many subjects require this course for mathematical computation, it is a good course to take.",
    "No. I don't like the flipped course element at all.",
    ".",
    "I would probably only recommend this course if it needed to be taken as a prerequisite.",
    "Yes, it is a staple of a solid mathematical education, and needs to be learned by any student that is interested in the field of mathematics",
    "Yes I would. I think this course (at least for me) was well taught and I had many chances to seek help when I was struggling.",
    "Yes, but only if you have to. Also, make sure you have a good instructor so check coursetable\/ybb for teacher evaluations before you register."
