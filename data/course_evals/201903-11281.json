    "This class is very well organized and class notes are updated regularly which is helpful (tho they are some times not posted..) A pretty easy and fun math class if you need a QR. (It might be helpful if we are able to take back home our midterms)",
    "The material itself isn't all too bad to learn, but the tests still can get difficult.",
    "This is a well taught course, and I found it quite easy. At times it could move faster, but there were students who perhaps needed the slower pace.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to get assignments and homeworks back more quickly and consistently -- this was good at the beginning of the term but got inconsistent towards the end.",
    "I didn't like this course. I thought the lectures were very disorganized and unstructured. The problem sets also included some coding which I didn't think was relevant to the class and I felt the professor underestimated how difficult those extraneous portions would be for students who didn't have any background in computer science. Obviously those portions were never tested upon. The exams were very long- particularly the final exam, which had to be extended for most students to complete. I think the professor needs to reorganize the notes into more cohesive units and include more examples relevant to problem sets and exams. He also said at the beginning of the semester that he would be posting the notes, but stopped doing so about a month\/month and a half in. There were also long periods of time without any grades posted for previous problem sets (up to a month with no grades despite turning in problem sets in the meantime). It was clear to me throughout the course that he needed more practice teaching it. However, having open book\/note exams helped make up for the lack of understanding that was achieved through class. Also, the problem sets were fairly easy for everybody to do well on. But overall, the second half of the course needs some restructuring.",
    "The strengths were how open Professor Jaffe was to helping you if you were confused. However, the class itself was fairly disorganized and the material was not that engaging (although there is not much that can be done here).",
    "Generally this class was as expected. It would have been nice to have a little more feedback on homework and exams, and more practice problems with solutions. Also would be good to have a peer tutor\/TA as there wasnt anyone to ask for help with homework",
    "Strengths: The course covers all of the major topics in ordinary differential equations and provides a good foundation for future studies of differential equations: Weaknesses: The material doesn't represent the most exciting branch of mathematics a lot of what we did in problem sets and exams was rather formulaic and reusing the same techniques to solve problems. There's no way to get around this weakness, though.",
    "Lecture was incredibly dry"

    "Mixed. You will indeed learn about ordinary differential equations. The workload is low (2.3 hours\/week). It's not the most fascinating material in the world, however. The tests ranged from very easy (first midterm had an average score of like a 97) to moderately difficult (second midterm).",
    "It is a pretty easy and fun math class.",
    "Sure, if you want to learn about how to solve ordinary differential equations.",
    "If you want to learn Ordinary Differential Equations and don't want to have to spend too much time on it, this is a good course for you.",
    "No. I think you could probably learn more just by reading the textbook on your own than going to class (and attendance is graded). I think the professor needs to work on the structuring of the course more (and planning which notes will be presented\/posted for every class before the semester begins), before it is offered again next year. The second two exams were also a bit long and need to be reworked to be able to be completed in a shorter period of time.",
    "Yes, especially for those interested in physics or engineering. The course is good to round out the introduction to math provided by multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but it is not necessary.",
    "It is a bitter pill you have to swallow if it is a required class for your major. Otherwise,  I see no logical reason why you would want to endure a semester of differential equations just out of interest.",
    "Sure! Ordinary differential equations are applicable in many fields, and it's crucial to have at least a baseline understanding of them.",
    "No. So boring. Do not take unless required"
