By connecting the theories to the history and situations in the given period, the professor really helped to strengthen my confidence and understanding of music, even though my music theory background was shaky coming in.  I cannot recommend this class enough, even if you're not a music major.",

I learned how to dive into any piece of music I might encounter from this time period in a specific and analytical way that will continue to grow in complexity as my musical ear develops."

Strengths included the professor's engaging teaching strategies, where he'd consistently help guide us through the beginning parts of our analysis and even would bring in physical props.  This class has convinced me to take more music theory classes in the future.",

The professor was open to meeting outside of class for additional help, but even for someone with very little formal music theory background, it was taught so well that this was hardly ever neessary.",
