                "The course was very engaging, even during remote learning, but there was a heavier writing load than expected.",
                "Strengths: the course encouraged painting en plein air, and so despite the virtual format, us students could still meet outside and paint together. We also got to experiment with several different styles of watercolor painting. Weaknesses: sometimes we spent too long going over the powerpoints, which led to us not having long to paint each class.",
                "You get comfortable with how chill it is and it haunts you in the end when you skip class and homework.",
                "Painting outdoors was very fun and interesting, but lugging around a computer to paint felt like a big burden.",
                "A strength was that it was a good introduction into art for someone who hasn't taken an art class since grade school. I had minimal drawing and painting experience beforehand, and still enjoyed this class and was able to learn a lot. However, I do think that a weakness is the writing portion of this course. As someone who has more of a STEM background, I would have appreciated more guidance on how to write arts papers, since they were worth a significant portion of our grade. It's a fairly different writing style, and while I'm glad to have learned a new type of writing now, it was extremely difficult for me to write these papers.",
                "strength is that painting can be a lot of fun and Van Doren is good about giving everyone compliments and critiques no matter their skill level, weakness is sometimes the 3 paintings per week feels difficult to manage when essay due dates are approaching"

Maybe it would be nice if the instructor was taught a little better on how to upload PDFs (e.g. essays were always given back to me upside down over gmail) and how to use zoom (screen sharing wouldve been nice instead of asking us to open presentations on our own devices).",

Van Doren is not great with zoom, but it never hindered learning or teaching"
