    "I learned the basics of the Italian language and the process of learning a new language in general. I also learned a lot about Italian culture both in the classroom, on the streets of Siena, and in my host family.",
    "The course helped me develop incredible improvements in my ability to speak and comprehend Italian in a unique way. I also gained a lot of insight into the Italian lifestyle which allowed me to evaluate my own culture and lifestyles and implement some of their practices for my own betterment."

   "comments": [
    "Instruction is very good, but can be better organized. Class time could be used more effectively.",
    "strengths- pace\r\nweakness- could have focused more on vocal",
    "Fast",
    "I loved the immersion but I felt like thencourse was a bit rushed. I would say that doing 3 weeks at yale and then 5 weeks in Italy would be a better idea than just 8 weeks in Italy. Although the 8 weeks were fun, I wish I had at least a basic level of the language before getting to the country. I also think 8 weeks with one host family was too much for me, because if you didn't love your host family (like me) then 8 weeks was a LONG time. I also feel I would have studied more\/harder if I had 3 weeks at Yale because I would not have been as distracted as I was when I first arrived in Italy.",
    "A more clear and flexible support system needs to be built to facilitate student learning.",
    "I think the biggest strength of this course is that it is offered over the summer in the country where the language is spoken. It is much easier to just focus on learning Italian when you do not have to worry about any other class. You are also always surrounded by people speaking the language so you are constantly learning even if you are not in the classroom. However, there is something to be said for taking the course as it is structured on campus. Although we cover the same material, you have less time to really allow the knowledge to sink in (eight weeks vs. one year)."

    "Yes! Amazing course with great professors. I love the italian department.",
    "Of course, its a great introduction to Italian if you want to learn it for the language requirement.",
    "Yes. Loved being in Italy. Moves fast but you just need to study",
    "Yes, see same answer from the 01 evaluation.",
    "Only if you're ready to sink or swim in two hectic months",
    "I strongly recommend this course! I always wanted to study abroad, but I wasn't sure I could commit to a full semester or year away from Yale. I think this is a great option if you want to pick up a new language fairly quickly and to get the study abroad experience without losing time on campus.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were either 1) legitimately interested in Italian language and culture 2) needed to satisfy their distributional language requirements or 3) wanted an opportunity to travel Europe\/Italy. It's generally more positive than negative. The school arranged trips are incredible and their experience in Siena would be probably life altering to some degree. I would not recommend this program to students who are low-income or self-funded unless they spent a lot of time financially preparing for the program. They should beware the estimated budget provided by CIPE; it is usually on the lower side and if you want to experience Italy, extra money is necessary. A lot of unexpected and unavoidable costs associated with travel are bound to happen as well."
