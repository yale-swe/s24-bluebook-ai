                "I learned a massive amount of vocabulary and useful phrases throughout the course! It's also a fantastic way to learn/review a lot of more advanced French vocabulary (le conditionnel, le pass simple, etc.); I thought that I had a decent handle on most French vocabulary before taking FREN 150, but I quickly realized the gaps in my knowledge and was able to work towards improving them. Additionally, I had little formal exposure to French literature prior to taking this course, and I think that FREN 150 serves as a very good introduction to different styles of literature (novels, short stories, and plays) from all around the Francophonie with an emphasis on close reading. If you're interested in taking French literature courses at Yale and are still in the process of developing your language skills, then I think FREN 150 is a fantastic choice. Yes, it is fairly rigorous, but you will learn a lot! :)",

                "I learned a lot of new grammar and vocabulary. I also worked on my reading and writing skills.",
                "FREN 150 was one of my favorite courses this term, and a wonderful introduction to French at Yale. I have gained a comprehensive understanding of advanced grammatical structures, a wide range of vocabulary, and have developed methods to approach reading texts in a foreign language. Madame Schneider created an environment where it was easy to engage in complex conversations and made sure we had the arsenal to express ideas with precision and eloquence. The course's emphasis on practical communication has enhanced my fluency, allowing me to navigate topics with more confidence than when I started the semester. Madame Schneider exposed us to more of French culture through various mediums (literature, films, interviews, etc.)"

                "Strengths of this course include the diverse stories and vocabulary we focused on, the organization of the course and the course packet, the emphasis on practical communication skills, and incorporation of literature, stories, and films to connect the grammar and vocabulary we learned. Though some might argue the course went at a fast rate, I think this was necessary to cover all that we did during the semester, and I enjoyed being challenged by Madame Schneider and eagerly prepared for this course. Additionally, I appreciate the effort the French department put into exposing us to a diverse range of materials and content from various Francophone regions. I do not think there are any major weaknesses."

If you're looking to take further French literature/culture classes at Yale but are still a little rocky on your language skills (not yet comfortable with calling yourself \"fluent\"), then I think that FREN 150 is a fantastic option. If you're deciding between FREN 150 and FREN 160, then I would consider the type of course content that you prefer (more literature-focused > FREN 150; more film-, media-, and conversation-focused > FREN 160) and the type of skills that you're looking to attain (more foundational/grammatical skills with a focus on vocabulary acquisition > FREN 150; feel confident in your grammar and are looking for practice and more cultural knowledge > FREN 160).",

                "I would recommend this course if you're ready for a challenge.",
