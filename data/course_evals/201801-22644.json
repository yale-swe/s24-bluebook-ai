    "This course was organised in a way that students would be engaged very much with the topics of each sessions.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is in the subject material itself.  The journal articles were very interesting to read.  Another strength was the knowledgeable grad student who basically helped teach the class.  However, the course was ruined by 1) its lack of organization and 2) the professor's lack of professionalism.\r\n     All of the Powerpoints the professor used were hastily made and not conducive for learning.  The professor so often went on tangents during class that the important material felt very scarce.  His disorganization was also frustrating when readings had been assigned but not posted to Canvas as promised, so students had no way of accessing them.  He did not answer emails, and he did not grade our three papers until the week of the final, meaning the we couldn't learn anything from the feedback.\r\n     In terms of professionalism, I felt like many of the professor's tangents were not only a waste of time, but also insensitive (for example, talking about mental health and murderers before class, making comments on one student's hair, etc).  His lecturing style was extremely colloquial; this can have pros and cons, but I felt it hard to discern what was actual fact form what were his rather immature side comments (like \"yeah that sucked\").  He could rarely get the projector to work correctly, and once he made a student lend him their laptop rather than make the extra trip up one flight of stairs to get his own.",
    "The material was very interesting, and I appreciated the use of techniques from different disciplines (biological anthropology, archeology, historical texts) to reconstruct ancient narratives. The course could have been organized to facilitate more student discussion.",
    "The one improvement I would suggest is to focus on a smaller time period. I think students get more out of an in depth discussion of a small topic."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, i would definitely recommend this course to another student, because there are no classes offered that combines archaeology, history, linguistics and genetics.",
    "I would not.  I enjoyed writing the journal critique papers, but I dreaded interacting with the professor.  However, I would recommend you explore other classes on biological\/ancient anthropology, as it can be quite fascinating.",
    "Yes and no. The professor may need some time to improve his approach to student learning, and as such, I wouldn't strongly suggest that anyone take the course as it stands. However, the material is fascinating in its own right."
