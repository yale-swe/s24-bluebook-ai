                "This class was a super interesting class to take outside of my major which taught foundational philosophical concepts on many ideas.",
                "I developed a lot of knowledge around philosophical thinking and essay writing. Through Shelly's lectures and our assigned readings, I learned how philosophers communicate with each other and argue for their points. I also developed many insights towards the goods and meaning of life, the subject of the class. I came out of it with a stronger understanding of what is worth pursuing, what is less meaningful, why less has meaning all together and how to justify those claims philosophically. I also have a greater understanding of the nuances or contradictions in like and can articulate the reasons behind why issues are confusing.",

                "I took this course to think about how I personally might live a \"better life.\" \r\n\r\nThis is not what I ultimately learned. I feel like I learned how to \"philosophize\" (ie: jargon, theory), about the idea of well-being, which is entirely different.",
                "I learned how to think critically and analyze many of the goods that contribute to our lives and make life worthwhile. I also learned how to write a really good philosophy paper",

                "I hate to break it to you, but youre not gonna come out of this class knowing the meaning of life or anything like that. However, I will say that this course has made me reflect on my life in some very cool ways that I may not have gotten to otherwise. It made me take a step back and think about what are the things that REALLY matter to me and what are the things that are really worth pursuing! Spending my academic time actively reflecting on these questions and talking about them with friends was honestly such a privilege and I could not have asked for a better start to my college experience. I will also say that trying to write a philosophy paper at this level of sophistication can be very frustrating but you can most certainly learn A LOT from it. To think deeply and precisely about the consistency of your argument, as well as its clarity and scope is a practice that will most certainly make you a better writer and thinker - I know for me it surely has. And honestly I think there is no better place to develop these logic and rhetoric skills than in philosophy (and this class does a particularly awesome job in helping you with that).",
                "The course provides a moment to reflect on what truly makes life meaningful. You learn to interact with older philosophy works and put them into conversations with more recent texts, from books written by the professor himself to columns featured in major publications. This course provides great insight into why we place value on major components of a \"Good\" life, from careers to education to charity to friendship.",

                "You will not walk away from this class having developed a complete overarching philosophy of life, unless you take it upon yourself to do that. Instead, you learn to think in a logical, philosophical way about aspects of life that we often either take for granted or consider merely subjective (happiness, love, friendship, children, achievement, career, education, honesty, helping others, morality, decisions, the meaning of life, and failure). Each week, we talk about one of these categories, considering a. What is it? and b. How important is it for living a good, flourishing life? They dont all culminate in some overarching thesis, but there are connections between the topics. For example, we returned many times to the example of the Experience Machine. One way of framing the class is: If you believe the life of the Experience Machine (where one experiences a perfect simulation of the perfect life but is in reality merely hooked up to a machine) is missing something, then there must be things other than merely pleasure that matter for a good life. So, if you agree, what are those elements of a good life that the Experience Machine lacks? Maybe its true (i.e. not simulated) love, true accomplishment, making a real impact on the world, etc.",

                "Strengths: you dont have to do the readings. weaknesses: The lecture material is relatively un-engaging and feels drawn out. This, the discussion sections are also un-engaging and feel like a waste of time. Your experience is largely based on your TF. Shellys grade deflation policy is obnoxious, and for an low-level philosophy course, the class does not do a great job teaching you how to actually write a philosophy paper.",
                "Very harsh grading, but once it was told to us how things were evaluated, the grades assigned were high sensible. The best part of the course was probably discussion sections; they were very eye-opening, as I got to see how there could be so many perspectives on the components of what we call life just in one small section.",
                "Strengths: low workload, philosophy class made approachable for those who have no background in philosophy, interesting topics (that I think everyone should at least consider once in their college time)\r\nWeakness: you get out what you put in, getting an A\/A- in this course can be tough but if you credit d fail you will be fine",

                "This course was interesting as it brought together many different ideas. The organizations were good and Kagan is an amazing lecturer. It was difficult thought because the lectures all seemed like conjecture and then we were tasked with coming to conclusions but I had no idea how to do that because I had never taken philosophy and he had never done it in class.",
                "The lectures that cover the same topics tended to be repeats of each other.",
                "Strengths - Engaging lectures, thought-provoking questions and essay prompts, critical thinking encouraged, really interesting overall subject matter, manageable workload, lots of feedback provided and opportunities to engage directly with the professor or TFs!\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the readings were hard to understand and then ended up not being that important to the lecture after they took a while to understand. It might be good to have more guidance over which readings \/ parts or readings were essential so we could more effectively prioritize our time",

                "Strengths: The content and readings are very interesting, and actually prompt you to reflect on different aspects of your life. Shelly is a great lecturer and lectures were always really engaging. Weaknesses: This course assumes that you already know how to \"do\" philosophy, and does not teach you the skills you need to succeed. This is supposedly an intro phil class, but I felt like I was expected to know how to construct a bulletproof argument for my first paper. When I tried to get feedback and improve for my second paper, I was met with unhelpful and unproductive comments from my TF. Honestly, I really enjoyed writing my first two papers and it was a challenging but fun intellectual exercise. My excitement and enthusiasm for this course rapidly declined as I realized how demeaning it was to be treated like you were stupid for not understanding extremely complex philosophical arguments in section. I think TFs should be more carefully screened.",
                "There are not many strengths of this course except for the first two or three lectures. Other than that the course is very repetitive and fails to discuss the actual topics of each week.",

                "S: very engaging, interesting lectures; the reading material was very accessible and reasonable in length; prompts conducive to showing what we learned and applying our ways about thinking about the things we learned in lecture\r\nW: the grading is too harsh. also, for the amount of writing in this class, it needs to be a writing credit.",
                "- Strength - Kagan is an interesting and practiced speaker.\r\n- Weakness - Very poor guidance on how to write a good essay. The harsh grading is pretentious and basically serves to elevate the \"prestige\" of Kagan and the course.",
                "Strengths: This course was well-organized, very interesting, highly-engaging, and effectively delivered. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the points and presentation felt repetitive as though Shelly was saying them many times over to make a point and not progress a philosophical argument.",
                "Organized well. Clear and fair expectations.",
                "Some strengths include a great system for Discussion Section and communication with TF's and professor. Some weakness is that the grading timeline was always different- some papers taking longer than others to be graded.",
                "Wish the lectures got more technical because the discussion sections were really hard sometimes",
                "Strengths: lectures were beautiful (Shelly is awesome), class was very well organized in weekly topics, sections were fun and interesting because its not hard to have things to say about topics of life, feedback from TA on essays was GREAT (at least in my case), and essay prompts were nice and stimulating (although indeed really hard to deal with in 5 pg papers). Weaknesses: Although the harsh grading in essays is at least justified by the high level of philosophical sophistication that is expected, the harsh grades in section are kind of annoying because often times the TA wont even give you feedback on how you can improve and it almost feels like the TAs are just giving you a low grade because shelly told them to But yeah, better section feedback is the only big thing I would suggest improvement upon.",
                "This course was extremely thought-provoking and challenged me to think about life in new ways. Unfortunately, this course's grading standards were unrealistic, preventing me from truly enjoying the class.",
                "Readings were super super interesting and appeal to a wide variety of audiences - they were not just the old white men I expected from philosophy. Most readings were very short, and each week included readings of several different types, such as speeches, letters, newspaper columns, articles, and essays. Readings were never boring. The teaching assistants also all seemed to be excellent, and Shellys lectures were always of high quality.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. Very very very engaging lectures. Shelly does a phenomenal job explaining concepts and arguments clearly and succinctly. He also addresses questions\/comments very well\r\n2. Fascinating concepts made for good discussion during section (although I can only really speak for my discussion section)\r\n3. Reasonable workload (all you need to turn in is three essays throughout the semester)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1. Tough grading relative to other Yale courses (I will note, however, that Shelly is very clear about his expectations and reasoning from the beginning of the semester. With the feedback I received on my papers and section participation, I thought it seemed fair, but I understand why some might be apprehensive about this before taking the class. For reference, according to Shelly toward the end of the semester, the median grade for the first paper was a B-, and the median grade for the second paper was a B)\r\n2. Disconnect between readings and lecture\/discussion. While the readings related to the topics covered in lecture, they felt supplemental more than anything. They were very fascinating, but weren't explicitly mentioned very much in lecture or discussion section.",
                "The sections are a huge strength of this course. I had a great time every week going to section and talking about the assigned topic. The lectures were engaging as well.\r\n\r\nI think one weakness of the course is in the grading policies. I know that Professor Kagan is known to be a tough grader, which is not necessarily what I think is a drawback here. Having high standards is understandable, but I felt that they were not quite able to be explained, which made meeting them nearly impossible. For example, to get an \"A\" or truly anything over a \"B\" for participation, there was 1) the expectation set of going to section every week; and 2) Participating in that section. However, many people did both of those things and did not receive over a B. The quality of one's responses in section was also graded, prompting many students to talk over each other in an attempt to get the most speaking time in, and therefore more chance of saying something deemed worthwhile. That made having genuine discussions difficult, and as there was no set definition of what \"good\" participation consisted of, it felt a bit cruel to penalize those that tried to make their voices heard and were actively engaging with the course. This came up with the papers as well. I think the papers are a strength of the course. Three short papers spaced out over the semester gave us space to digest the large quantities of information and begin to develop ideas of our own. However, the grading structure once again worked against this goal. As we were not allowed to meet with our TAs in advance of the deadline for any kind of formal evaluation of our work, there was no way to know if you were meeting the undefined standard. I still, after turning in three papers, could not tell you what a paper over a \"B\" would look like. There is no rubric, the prompts are extremely broad, and the TAs are actively encouraged to deflate grades if Professor Kagan feels that too many people have been graded highly. I could go on about this, but I do want to be clear: I think the high standards are reasonable, the lack of explanation of those standards is not. College is hard. This is not an excuse to artificially inflate grades, but it is a reason perhaps to throw a lifeline to students who are trying their best and let them know what they need to do to actually get better at the skills this course is trying to teach.",
                "A major strength of the course is the format of the discussion sections, which are very engaging. Perhaps the course reading material could be structured differently, because it didn't always feel relevant to the current topic in lecture or section.",
                "Life was an incredibly good course. Shelly was a star at lectures: every day he came in and made me think in new ways, question new things, and reconsider many of the things I initially held to be true for what is good in my life."

He shares some very insightful and thought-provoking views of philosophers, including him, and Shelly does this in a very engaging manner. He is super compassionate and welcomes all questions. The workload is also very light and manageable (three 5-page double-spaced papers) so it motivates me to do well in each of them.",

                "No - the grading is annoying thanks to Shelly Kagan, and I found the content to be obnoxious at times. I took the course to think more about the choices in my life and the class is mostly filled with entitled, rich students who can make choices they want, not choices they have to do.",

When I say I love philosophy I mean that I love thinking deeply about the things that matter to my life - and that is exactly what this course is about. I honestly looked forward to every tuesday and thursday morning when I could just sit and listen to Shelly speak wisdom in a very engaging and entertaining way. Sections were also awesome because they were never about memorizing content or regurgitating what smart people have said about a topic, but rather about us thinking critically FOR OURSELVES about the things that matter in our lives. The harsh grading is a thing though, and some of the essays did cause me a lot of stress; but if you approach it all with a learning mindset and have that credit\/d\/fail on your back pocket Id say its an absolute win!! This class is surely an unforgettable experience.",
                "If you're looking for an easy A, this is definitely not the best course to take. However, if grades are not a concern, then this course has the potential to be interesting for students of any major.",
                "Yes! This course challenged beliefs that I held without really knowing why I held them, and it caused me to re-evaluate how I was spending my time at Yale and how I wanted to spend my time throughout my life at large. A lot of the reflection that I did in both my writing and in section probably would have taken place later on in my life, but it's nice that I was forced to tackle such topics this early on and get to further develop what I personally thought it meant to be a good friend, a good partner, a good person, etc.",
                "YES. This is my favorite class that I have taken at Yale, and I bemoan that I took this class as my first ever philosophy class too late to become a philosophy major even though this class made me fall in love with philosophy. I think every single person at Yale should take a class like this!!! This class is one of those very rare chances to actually think about what you want out of life, if you really want it or not, and why, and to discuss this with a brilliant professor, teaching assistant, and Yale peers. I got more out of this class than I have gotten out of the rest of my 2.5 years of classes at Yale COMBINED, and am certain that I will look back at my notes and readings and essays when I come to major forks in my lifes career, family, and relationships. This is just a stunning class that reminds me of why I came to Yale in the first place. I would look forward to discussion every single week and sometimes it would be the highlight of my week!!! I never missed a single section not because of attendance but because I genuinely would have so much I would want to discuss with others about the readings we did and would want to hear everyones opinion. For those who are worried about the grading in this class: this class is worth it if youre willing to put effort in. That means effort into quality discussions, quality essays, and actually thinking about the topics we cover in class. You can do this C\/DF or for a grade, but I know and you know that youll work harder if youre in this class for a grade. I can promise you that this class is worth a 0.05 drop in your GPA if it ever comes down to it. But as a STEM major, I can definitely say that the grading on the essays is fair - I dont think its true that you need to produce graduate school quality work and Shelly doesnt just give out bad grades for his own enjoyment. It is definitely possible to do well in this class if youre not a humanities person!!!! If youre reading this and on the edge of deciding whether or not to take this, PLEASE CONSIDER THIS YOUR SIGN",
                "Yes! I understand the worry that Shelly is a harsh grader, but don't think it's as bad as it gets portrayed. The majority of the class will generally end up with an A or B (and that's with many people taking it pass\/fail). Additionally, the workload really isn't that bad. Aside from grading, I genuinely think there is so much to gain from this class. Shelly does a wonderful job during lecture, and I found discussion section to be very engaging.",
                "Honestly, I don't know. It depends on the student. I took this course as a credit\/d\/fail because I am at the end of my college years and wanted to take a class with Professor Kagan. I also felt that, after realizing that his famously high standards for grading were not clearly defined, I would enjoy the class more without blindly throwing darts and hoping I got more than a \"B\". I think that the ideal student for this course must be willing to either sink hours and weeks into figuring out what magic formula makes them worthy of a good grade, or someone like me who is genuinely interested in the material and has the freedom to take it as a Cr\/D\/F. If your schedule is full or you have other commitments outside of class, or if you value your grades, proceed with caution. If you are willing to take the class, it will be a really great one.",
                "Absolutely, as long as you are willing to Credit\/D\/Fail or accept that you might get a B (at a school where 79% of grades are As or A-s thanks to grade inflation). Shellys lectures are fascinating.\r\n\r\nPlease note: the reality is, this is a class where one could in theory go to zero of the lectures and do zero of the readings and do essentially just as well (or poorly) as someone who did everything. This is because 75% of the grade comes from the papers, which are not topics not even directly addressed in the lectures or readings (this is intentional, and in my mind good, because it forces you to think for yourself instead of copying the readings or lectures). The other 25% comes from participation in section in which you are not required to actually cite any of the readings. HOWEVER, you would be absolutely insane to not go to lectures or do readings. You would miss out on so much learning and encountering of interesting ideas. What would even be the point of taking the class? Dont miss out, do the class fully!",
                "Yes. Some students are tempted not to enroll because they've heard rumors about Shelly Kagan being a really tough grader and they don't want their GPAs to suffer - to which I say, if you are genuinely concerned, you can Cred\/D\/F the class or audit it. But Shelly's class was one in which I felt the most like my grades actually meant something, and when I received a better grade on my second paper than my first, and when my final grade was better than just satisfactory, I felt like I had truly earned it, and I could identify in my memory the steps I had taken and the work I had put in to accomplish that. After so many years of an A being the minimum requirement, it was a really nice change to hear Shelly's philosophy on grades and then develop my skills over the course of the semester. \r\n\r\nRegarding the matter of the course, it is quite literally entitled \"Life,\" which is always fun, but it is genuinely an intensely valuable course. A lot of classes can feel like the work won't matter once the end of the term rolls around, and during midterms or finals it can be challenging to hold onto a concrete motivation to care about the work you're doing rather than just care about getting to the finish line. But every lecture, every assignment, every discussion section is valuable because it's about your life and what matters and what is most worthwhile. Our time on Earth is very limited. What could be more important in school than studying and examining what makes up a life worth living?",
                "It's interesting, and can expand your perspective without taking up too many hours of work per week compared to other courses, so it's a worthwhile way to add to a schedule.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. Despite reservations some may have about Shell being a tough grader, I think that this class added so much to my thinking and developed me as a philosophically minded individual that the pay-off was worth it. And, as a relatively large lecture class, it is not impossible to get an A with some hard work, which, if you want to get the most out of this class, is necessary anyway. If you truly want to maximize what you learn from the class, make sure to do the readings. Don't go into the class with the mindset that you are going to Credit\/D, otherwise, you will delude yourself into thinking that the readings\/lectures are not that important. Which, they are, and if you are fully present for this class, you will learn a lot."
