    "This course was a very positive supplement to the lecture. It allowed you to see and touch and interact with the fish we were learning about in the lecture course, and also to learn about more fish.",
    "Closer look at fish anatomy, fish diversity. Field trip exposes you to real experience of ichthyologists.",
    "Hands-on understanding of the diversity of most fish families. Practice identifying anatomical structures.",
    "Gained an ability to identify a fair number of fish species as well as give some background information on various fish orders."

   "comments": [
    "This course was a lot of fun, and the laid-back structure of the lab was appreciated. I wish there was a way to coordinate the lab and lecture a bit better. Also, the field outing was one of my favorite parts of the course, and I wish we'd been able to do more of that (i.e. a field trip to an aquarium).",
    "Very interesting, fun, and helpful. The course could be a little more fast-paced and efficient-- it felt like we often could have moved faster through looking at fish specimens, leaving room to cover more material or greater depth.",
    "The field trips were great. The identification of species made a lot of sense. It would've been great to have the note sheets on canvas."

    "Would highly recommend. I really think you don't get as much out of the lecture if you skip the lab.",
    "Yes, if you're looking for an interesting biology lab this is a good one to pair with the lecture",
    "If you're interested in biodiversity and fishes, this is a great foundational course!",
    "If you are taking the lecture course, take this also. It helps with that and is generally a pretty fun way to spend the afternoon."
