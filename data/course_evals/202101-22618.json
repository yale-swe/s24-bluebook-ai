I also learned why it is often challenging to pin something like terrorism down with one definition. Finally, I learned how to categorize groups and individuals based on the definition I had developed since the advent of the class.",
                "This course was a great introduction to terrorism, the difficulties of categorizing political violence, and the methodology used to analyse both. I learned about how data can be used to label different actions, how peace negotiations are conducted, and who has a stake in counterterrorism negotiations.",
                "The seminar \"Terrorism\" taught me about how and why terrorism occurs in a variety of contexts across the globe. The seminar's guest speakers helped me to understand why people become terrorists or join terrorist organizations. The seminar had a particular focus on the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and sparked my interest in learning more about this conflict."

                "strengths: extremely original framework for learning where we skype in with ex-terrorists, counter-terrorists, academics, and peace-negotiators. very good readings with excellent topics for conversation. Course builds in a sensible way.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: more opportunity in class to debrief about the people with whom we spoke.",
                "Strengths: All of the guest speakers really work to expand students' understanding of the theoretical concepts in a way that reading journal articles and books simply cannot. Also, Professor Weir is an absolutely incredible professor the way she engages with students and really challenges them to bring unique ideas to class is incredibly valuable. Weaknesses: I would have personally preferred more assignments to engage with the core concepts of the course.",
                "Strengths: Absolutely amazing readings and discussions. Completely driven by the students and Professor Weir is so so knowledgeable about the subject. Having guest speakers was absolutely amazing to hear from their perspective about the issues we were reading and discussing. Strengths are basically every aspect of the course (besides the one weakness below). Literally no complaints\r\n\r\nWeakness: Super personal, but would have appreciated discussing Northern Ireland less. It's Professor Weir's topic of study and she has a lot of contacts so it makes sense, but early on in the semester, we concluded that many groups in Northern Ireland didn't qualify as terrorist organizations. This was mentioned in the syllabus though, so not even really a complaint.",
                "I loved the speakers! I think there could definitely be more feedback from the professor on our assignments.",
                "Strengths - I loved the guest speakers and the topics\r\nWeakness - A bit disorganized sometimes",
                "The strengths of this course included the speakers and the thematic presentations. I found them to be really helpful in firming up certain concepts.\r\nOne weakness is that I felt we spent too much time engaging in discussions that it either cut into upcoming discussions or shortened the thematic presentations. A stricter control on time allocation might be helpful.",
                "I truly enjoyed this course but I believe it could be improved by giving students an opportunity to write a final essay on a topic of their choosing.",
                "The seminar \"Terrorism\" was extremely well-designed to facilitate student learning and engagement. The readings were interesting and relevant, the guest speakers were amazing, and student discussion was aided by both Professor Weir's insights and the insights of students from a variety of unique backgrounds. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion would be to allot a certain amount of time to each meeting's thematic presentation. Some of the presentations were shortened as a result of guest speakers and other presentations running behind, detracting from discussion."

Our guest speakers were from all over the world, so having them Zoom into class was very effective. Like any course though, discussion just isn't the same when it is done over Zoom; there's those awkward pauses and people mute and unmute themselves. Nothing to improve upon on the professor's part, we just need to get back to in-person learning.",
