I enjoyed the mix of class sessions that were purely student-discussion based and ones that were more exercise and workshop based. I did find some trouble navigating the schedule for readings, as it was changed once or twice throughout the semester, and paper copies of the new schedule were handed out but the digital schedule on canvas was not updated.",
