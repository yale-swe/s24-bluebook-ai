                "We covered so much in this course! The difference between allophones and phonemes, how to identify alternations with zero, positional neutralization, and free variation, articulatory phonetics and phonotactic constraints. We looked at autosegmental theory, including covering how to describe natural classes of sounds using features, and describe variation with feature-based rule notation. And then we looked at constraint-based phonology and optimality theory, alongside suprasegmental features like stress and tone. And then we finished up with syllable structure phonology. And! Throughout all this, we were working on a research project, in which we had to analyze and describe the phonological system of a language we did not speak, by working with a consultant who spoke that language.",

            "comments": [
                "This class had very interesting data sets and problems to analyze, but it was poorly organized and we did not receive enough feedback on our work.",
                "We did not receive enough feedback on the language squib. Quizzes I found very difficult before we discussed the material in lecture.",
                "Natalie Weber is a fantastic lecturer and a very engaging presence. Workloads and assignment deadlines were reasonable, and handouts are very well-structured for in-class discussion. My main gripe with the course - which I hate to say at all - is not the in-class content, but the sheer lack of feedback on assignments, more so towards the second half of the semester. The class is intellectually challenging, especially for someone without a linguistics background, and when a month or more goes by without you getting any grades or comments back on your homework and final project updates, it is impossible to know how you are doing and if you are only further entrenching existing issues with every new assignment you submit. I'm disappointed to say it made me frustrated, especially since otherwise I enjoyed the class so much.",
                "I really like the weekly handouts and psets as a way to learn. I also liked that the quizzes for the class were open-note, take-home quizzes that we did before we covered the content in class. This incentivized me much more to read the textbook and understand the content.\r\nThe only weakness of the class was that it was at times disorganized and we fell behind on content. But this is because Natalie always answered everyones questions, no matter how un\/related, which I think is a good thing!\r\nAlso, feedback\/grades were slow to come out.",
                "Strengths: Professor Weber is amazing! They are so enthusiastic and fun that it was incredibly easy to stay engaged with their course. I looked forward to every class, because I knew we were going to discuss something interesting. Professor Weber is really good at explaining concepts, so I always left class confident that I would be able to figure out the Psets. The Psets were quite fun, and despite being challenging, I really enjoyed trying to analyze puzzly data. Weaknesses: the quizzes were HARD, and since we had to take the quizzes before we'd discussed the chapter material in class, I often came to class very confused. Additionally, my class was kind of the guinea pig for the language sketch project, which took us all semester to complete and which we had to begin before we even learned how to effectively transcribe another speaker's speech. As such, I often felt like I was flying blind on creating the language sketch. This confusion proved warranted when I turned in my second draftnote that I had not received instructor feedback on my first draftand was told that I had done too much work, and I actually didn't have to analyze the entire phonology of the speaker I was working with. This confused me a lot, because I thought that that's what the purpose of the project had been! And since I received feedback so late, I had only three days to fix the entire thing before turning it in. Additionally, Professor Weber's grading system is really wonky. I'm sorry, but if you're answering a check-all-that-apply question on a quiz and you check two, but get one wrong, should that not be graded as 1 out of 2, not 0 out of 3?",
                "The problem sets were generally pretty interesting and a good chance to apply skills. However, they were sometimes worded in confusing ways or used different terms than were discussed in class.\r\nThe fieldwork project felt very experimental. Often the guidelines\/expectations were unclear.\r\nI didn't really enjoy the flipped classroom model of the class. Often, it seemed like the entire class was spent trying to unpack the previous day's reading to the point where I wondered why I had done the reading in the first place. I would have preferred more frequent structured, focused lectures in class instead of extended QA sessions that were often too long, tangential, and not very productive.",
                "For the most part, this class was interesting, comprehensive, and well-organized, and I learned quite a lot, but I did have a couple of big issues. The first is the language squib that we worked on over the course of the semester. The directions for the language sketch were unclear, and there was no communication about its main goals and what we were trying to accomplish until the very end of the semester. It also was significantly time-consuming, even split over the semester, and it ended up taking much longer than it should have, which Professor Weber did not account for. I know that this was the first time they were doing this project, but it was highly unpleasant to be guinea pigs for something that is going to affect what's on our transcripts. Finally, I don't think I got a single graded assignment back past the middle of the semester, with the exception of the second language sketch, which was returned to us only a few days before the final version was due. I understand that Marisha and Professor Weber are both very busy people, but the class either needed another TA or for less work to be assigned because by the end we were mostly doing the language sketch blind.",
                "strengths: squib project makes you feel like you accomplished something, problem sets pertained to quizzes and class discussions, fun worksheets, lots of additional resources at hand, fun learning environment during class\r\n\r\nweaknesses: not a personal fan of flipped classroom environments, more checkpoints for squib project could be helpful to avoid cramming",
                "strengths: \r\n- lots of independent research\r\n- chance to apply abstract ideas to real world situations\r\n\r\nimprovements:\r\n- homework assignments were lengthy",
                "Strengths: interesting material, very organized, flexible, great professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the end of the class felt like it moved much faster than the beginning, so it was easy to get confused",
                "I love the way class is taught and that deadlines are flexible. I wish we had a little more guidance with our language sketches and received feedback quicker on them.",
                "Strengths: The flipped classroom model allowed for a lot more discussion and q&a-ing than would normally be possible in a lecture course. The mini-fieldwork project was extremely rewarding and allowed us to feel like everything we learned could come together. The optional sections were very helpful. Weaknesses: Problem sets could sometimes feel a bit repetitive (perhaps necessary to get the hang of doing phonological analyses, but nevertheless not the most exciting). Expectations for the final fieldwork project squib were a bit vague: since we were apparently supposed to explore a specific phonological phenomenon in our language in \"more depth\", it might've been helpful to spend some time in class\/readings looking at actual journal articles so we had a better sense of how to approach the phonological literature."

It's required for majors, but it's also a good course to take for anyone interested in studying Language, so long as they have the interest and willingness to learn about how linguistics works. If a student does not have an interest in linguistics or a willingness to pick up the skills needed for an intermediate linguistics course, I would not recommend this class. Otherwise I definitely would recommend this course. I had a great time learning from Natalie and Marisha.",
                "Yes! I honestly think this is a good first linguistics class to take, rather than one of the intro courses. You learn all the essentials and more! Your perception of the world and its sounds is fundamentally challenged. Its a great course, yes, I recommend it.",
                "Highly recommend this course! Professor Weber is awesome! And phonology is so so so so much fun. I tell everyone I meet that they HAVE to take a linguistics course at some point, because linguistics is amazing, but phonology is especially amazing. So take this course! I just hope that Professor Weber has figured out the language sketch project by the time you take it. The project is super fun, but the rubric was incredibly vague and confusing, and I honestly had no idea whether or not my analysis fulfilled what Natalie was looking for.",

If you haven't taken a linguistics course before, I might suggest LING 110 over this one; but if you're already majoring or have taken a few classes, definitely try this one, especially with Professor Weber! You get to do your own research, and the PSETs are pretty fun if the subject interests you. Very much like puzzle-solving.",
                "Yes, I definitely would.",
                "Yes - this is a very well-taught core\/required linguistics course. If you're a linguistics major, look forward to it, because it'll be enjoyable to take whether or not phonology is a subfield that's particularly interesting to you. If you're not a linguistics major, you'll certainly have no problem in the class - it's very welcoming."
