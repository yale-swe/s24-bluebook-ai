                "The course was amazing. Professor Saraceni is a great mentor and every seminar was interesting and memorable in its own way. The discussions were great and the feedback on essays was really helpful. No weaknesses!",
                "One of the best courses at Yale, super well organized and interesting. The readings are diverse and not too long, so it engages all the students. Classes are formatted in discussion and with good classmates this definitely turns your twice-a-week english seminar into lively sessions that you look forward to. Prof. Saraceni is also creative with the class assignments, from free-writes to small group presentations on a particular reading. The essays being graded on second draft is by far the best aspect of this class; it means that you really get a chance to improve your work and grow as a writer without the pressure of doing super well on the first go. Loved the workshop format too.",
                "Strengths: Professor Saraceni is amazing, readings were very interesting, and essays were fairly spaced. I don't think this course has any weaknesses.",

                "The revisions and workshops process was the biggest strength. I would've liked to write another essay, though, about a place. I know that this essay was removed to lighten the workload, but I think it would have been manageable."

All the readings have something interesting for you to learn. All class discussions are a resource for your development. All the assignments push you as a writer. Take it take it take it.",

Workload is manageable. Prof Saraceni is great. Overall, one of the best courses I have taken here at Yale!",

                "Yes, it was an interesting and enjoyable class, I feel like the stories we read were mostly interesting and helped improve my writing, but it wasn't an intense class and there wasn't too much work.",
                "Absolutely. The structure of the course allowed me to explore various forms of nonfiction prose that I wouldn't have been able to explore otherwise. The multiple revisions and workshops greatly improved both my writing and my ability to assess other's writing and my own."
