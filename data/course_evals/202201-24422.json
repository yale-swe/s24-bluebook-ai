On the other hand, I think some more concrete assignments would be helpful because most of the time we were just supposed to \"work on our plays\" which I feel like did not happen as frequently as I wanted to.",

More scene prompts/exercises and a structured shift from standalone scenes to pursuing a longer piece would have potentially benefited the class."
