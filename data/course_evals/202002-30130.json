    "This course definitely teaches the more technical skills of introductory microeconomic analysis. We discussed consumer theory, labor theory, factor markets, etc. But more importantly, it introduces an economic worldview through which all kinds of decisions, ideas, and policies can be examined.",
    "Basic microeconomic concepts. A better understanding of individual and firm behaviours in a market.",
    "I learnt a huge amount about the mechanisms behind consumer behaviour and theory, as well as the behaviour of firms. This class was great for putting a name and explanation to everything I knew intuitively to be true about markets and exchange from experience, but had never studied.",
    "\"300 years of economics research in 5 weeks,\" loads of practical examples and applying microeconomic principles to real life. Ability to solve simple economic problem set-ups with math.",
    "Basics of microeconomics, application of mathematics, how to think like an economist.",
    "A good overview of microeconomics.",
    "Basic econ concepts",
    "This course taught me introductory microeconomics and its applications in the short run, long run, national and international scale. In addition to specific microeconomic information, we learned math and problem-solving skills.",
    "I was able to increase my economical intuition and also gain a deeper understanding of human behavior both quantitatively and qualitatively.",
    "Fusing analytical tools with economic concepts to understand individual firms, consumers, and markets.",
    "This course helped develop a strong foundation for Economics and has left me feeling confident that I can succeed in other Econ courses in the future.",
    "I learned mathematical ways to predict market and firm behavior as well as the psychology of buying behavior. It does not closely align with what is taught in AP Microeconomics. It covers more topics and skims over them more."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the challenges of the online model was that there were three avenues through which we were learning new information (textbook chapters, prerecorded lectures, live lectures). Sometimes it felt like there was a lack of continuity between the three. I think that increasing the amount of time spent on practice problems would be helpful, as well as some sort of practice problem review sheet for the exams.",
    "I liked the professor, and I thought the prerecorded lectures were excellent. The textbook was dull and repetitive. The in person lectures were good. I thought the problem sets were poor. The questions were often unclear and confusing and all the answers were given in the section meetings with the TA.",
    "This course is an okay intro to microeconomics. However, it is excessively demanding. Professor Koker expects students to watch six hours of prerecorded video lectures, spend five hours on zoom calls, read at least four textbook chapters, study for at least nine hours, and do a problem set each week. While this is all intended to facilitate student learning, the information gets redundant, and actively begins to impede the process, very quickly. The live zoom sessions would be much more helpful if conducted in a more question-based, office hours style rather than serving as a vehicle for Tolga to hear himself talk about unrelated tangencies for hours on end.",
    "I felt that the course was extremely well down and well paced prior to the first midterm but the second half of the course was much too rushed. The professor even mentioned that the second half of the material was more difficult. I think that in order for the students that have the adequate time to understand the material, the course must be restructured to provide more explanation of the more challenging material covered after the midterm",
    "The material covered in this class gives an excellent grounding in economics. The pace of the class is understandably quick, as it is a condensed summer course. However, it was made worse by the fact that both the midterm and the final were scheduled for during the Thursday class times of the third and final weeks of class respectively so we effectively lost that teaching time. It's a lot of material to cover in 10 classes but doing it in 8 definitely left me feeling like certain topics had been brushed over. An obvious improvement would be to fix this scheduling!",
    "Strengths: Real-life examples (super helpful for contextualizing principles and seeing how they apply - usually very broadly), Tolga (he shares the best examples and truly is a very dedicated professor!), TA hours (Marianne is really good and patient in going through answers).\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook can get dry and difficult to get through (especially when the text describes a mathematical graph in words), but i guess that's just something we learn to get through.",
    "The course had a very fast pace and a lot of content was covered. I felt a high level of engagement though, despite the online medium. The psets and TA help were very useful.",
    "Very well taught and organized. Only weakness is the pace, which is too quick.",
    "Recorded lectures were great but the live sessions always felt a bit rushed.",
    "The strength of this course was the teaching from Professor Koker and support from the TA. The course was difficult because it was a high-intensity workload in a short amount of time. On average, I was doing econ-related work at least 40 hours a week. Furthermore, for people who are looking to take this as a QR credit I recommend at least some calc knowledge before you enroll because there are math sections that require calc and are not necessarily explained in class. With that being said, Professor Koker has an excellent organization to the course that, if you follow, will always keep you at a high level of understanding. Furthermore, the TA we had for the first session did a great job of answering specific problem set questions and explaining the context and knowledge behind it so we were constantly encouraged to think about answers in a broader context. The course was difficult because of the time constraint but is organized well.",
    "Strengths: Great, engaging and truly passionate professor. Platform with multiple streams on content and lots of help available was great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Intermediate level content was at times quite challenging, this is more of a labeling concern from a non-Yale summer school student.",
    "The strengths of the course were the video lectures and Zoom discussions. I found them to be very clear and Professor Koker did an excellent job of describing\/illustrating the concepts. The textbook readings however, were a weakness for the course. I found them to be very long, confusing, and dry.",
    "Weakenss: Brutal pace and lack of practice problems makes understanding concepts difficult.",
    "Strengths: engaging lecture videos, reinforcement of important topics in the live session, fair exams, relevant and helpful textbook \r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "This course was hard because it was taught online and in a short amount of time (summer session). We watched ~6 hours of pre-recorded lectures a week, then attended 4 hours of Zoom a week (prof held us overtime each time), where all of the lecture content was simply repeated in brief with no new content or really any practice problems, and then we spent hours reading the textbook for info we were responsible for but that was not necessarily covered in lectures, doing psets and office hours to get pset answers was necessary. Overall, it was a ton of time that was not planned out efficiently. Also, the lack of practice problems made me feel less prepared for the exams and less able to check my understanding and if I could really apply the chapter concepts."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if you aren't interested in majoring in economics, the foundational ideas you'll learn in this course are helpful in life generally.",
    "Probably not. I thought the workload was out of proportion to the amount I learned.",
    "This course is not worth it. Take micro during the fall or spring semester for a much better experience.",
    "Absolutely!! The professor and TA are both incredible and engaging, and although it is a difficult course because of timing, I felt prepared and was given clear explanations of material. Compared to other online courses available, this one is designed to be taken online and because of this, it is much easier to understand material because the course is already structured for that kind of learning.",
    "Yes - I think an understanding of economics, however basic, is very useful and will inform many of the choices I will make in my career and in the rest of my life. As someone who is not naturally inclined towards maths, elements of the course were a bit tricky, but I think it was still very worthwhile.",
    "Yes. Tolga is good, examples are great, the principles are amazing, even if you don't end up an econ major.",
    "Yes, very comprehensive coverage of microeconomics. I did not have any economics background in high school but found this course very approachable and interesting.",
    "Yes, because it taught me all the basics of micro.",
    "Only if needed",
    "This is a good course to take if you have plenty of time to study it. As a summer course, it is definitely a lot of information to take in at once and it has a very high intensity (about 40 or more hours of week of studying, office hours, live sessions, and lectures). If you are looking to take this as a QR I strongly recommend having some calculus knowledge before you enroll as the course requires knowledge of derivatives, limits, and other calc concepts that I knew from former classes but were not truly taught by the class. This is a great course to take if you are strong in math and are looking for an interesting social science. The content is very interesting and the professor does a good job of synthesizing the content with what is occurring in the current news. If you have the time and are interested, definitely take it!",
    "Yes, as long as they very clearly understood the pace and rigor of doing this class specifically in five weeks.",
    "If the student was interested in microeconomics and willing to put it in the hard work over the summer, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "If a student wants a rapid introduction to microeconomics, yes.",
    "Yes, even if you are not interested in Economics this course really helps you understand really important concepts about society in general and is a fairly easy QR credit.",
    "The class will not \"intellectually challenge\" you. It will frustrate you to the maximum and wish you had not taken the course unless it was required of you. There must be a better way of teaching economics: more practice problems, less time wasted repeating the same content in lecture and zoom, and feedback on exam questions instead of giving a blanket score back with no test markups to know what we got wrong. This class will take up more time than it is worth, and you will not end up with a grade that reflects your effort or even your econ understanding."
