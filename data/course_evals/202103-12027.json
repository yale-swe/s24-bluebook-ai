One strength is definitely the format - writing 2 pages every week. It's a challenging exercise, but the consistency is really useful for improving and practicing writing.",
                "Strengths: Professor Verlyn is AMAZING. You get clear feedback. You get to write about whatever you want each week. Everyone's piece gets workshopped during the semester. You learn how to be critical of what you write and read. A super awesome class overall. \r\nWeakness: Not really a weakness, but the two page assignment each weak sounds easy\/quick. It's not! Also, the assignments were due on Saturday this semester, but Friday would've been a nicer due date.",
                "There are only strengths, no weaknesses. The assignment of two pages a week is very manageable, and I looked forward to writing every week. The feedback I got on my papers was always clear and helpful. The only improvement would be if this class was a year long, or four years long. That's how amazing it is."

                "Yes!",
                "YES! You learn so much, and you will see improvement in your writing. This isn't a class where you have to be good at writing already- you'll become good! Professor Verlyn really cares about his students and is super encouraging!",
                "Yes! Above all, the community built by the course is warm and welcoming. If you like writing, or if youre looking to improve your writing, this is the place to do it. The pace of the course is very helpful, and the structure of the class made the time pass quickly. I loved going to class every week, and so would highly recommend the course.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this to everyone and anyone. There is no wrong person for a class like this. If you like to write, or want to get better at it, I can think of no better course for you than this one."
