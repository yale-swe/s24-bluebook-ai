A technique that I learned that applies to modern music is the idea of basso continuo for the piano/harpsichord which begins to harmonize parts by having the left hand with a bass part playing a melody and the right hand playing chords to match it."

                "great course but difficult to teach on zoom",
                "One of the strengths of the course is the structure of the course which allows my schedule to be more flexible in turning in recordings of different pieces. For example, some weeks I had a lot of work for other classes and was unable to get recordings of the pieces in, but I was allowed to delay it for a week in order to finish other classes' work and not having set due dates really helped me to enjoy the course and appreciate the music as I could practice when I wanted to most of the time. A weakness of the course is its virtual nature. This course would be much better in person in order to see it all come together; however, because of COVID we had to turn in recordings."

The lectures did not provide as much room for engagement as being able to practice on the instrument and could be improved using software such as PollEv or even trying to make the lectures more personal to the music we were playing as for my part sometimes, the lectures did not really apply as much as others."

It was a fun experience to be able to play an instrument I had never played before and for anyone that has prior experience playing an instrument and even a slight instrument in early music, this would be the course for them. Especially during COVID times where I did not have access to a piano to practice on, being able to play the harpsichord was even more valuable and I recommend it for those with previous instrument experience looking to try something new."
