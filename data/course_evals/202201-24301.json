                "This course provides students with an opportunity to think through questions of nonfiction vs. fiction, real vs. fake, and documentary vs. fiction film. You develop your film analysis skills, and you combine that with literary and theoretical analysis skills.",
                "I learned so much about Soviet and Eastern European film in particular, but also about the genre of documentary as a whole. I think the course strengthened my reading skills as well, because we encountered so many pieces that previously I was very unfamiliar with.",
                "I learned a lot about film analysis and film history, and also learned to think critically about works of nonfiction and their handling of truth.",
                "I learned a lot about film and media theory, as well as Soviet and post-Soviet history. The movies chosen for this class are very good and interesting. The readings are also good supplements and provide a challenging yet reasonably accessible understanding of media theory. I like Prof MacKay a lot. He's very friendly and easy to talk to.",
                "I learned quite a bit about Soviet cinema! Also: documentary, historiography, and fiction; the poetics of documentary prose; documentary surrealism; propaganda.",
                "This semester expanded my ability to examine film ideas though a Marxist historical lens and conversely examine historical ideas through the thinking of filmmakers whose thoughts we read and films we watched. The essays were also great learning experiences, as we were provided with thoughtful prompts and a fantastic syllabus to draw from.",
                "As a newly designed course on docufiction, it offers an opportunity into this burgeoning field. The course also offers great theoretical background alongside specific works. I have learned a great deal about the Soviet film history."

            "comments": [
                "The strengths of the course include the bizarre but incredible list of films, Professor MacKays passion, and the great theoretical background the syllabus provides. The work load can be quite a bit  especially for someone with limited exposure to film before. However, Professor MacKay definitely encourages unorthodox thinking.",
                "Logistically, having the screenings on the same day of the already two hour class was a little challenging.",
                "This is a really strong, fascinating course. Perhaps the only weakness is that we didn't always get to all the films and readings in our class discussions. I might advise more clearly delineating which subjects will be focused on in class and which are more optional or supplemental.",
                "My only criticism of this class was that it was essentially a two and a half hour lecture that met once a week. Prof MacKay is very interesting and obviously an expert in his field, but we almost never had discussion. Outside of the student presentations, Prof MacKay speaks uninterrupted for almost the entire duration of the class. Some seminars are just like this. I do think sometimes it would have helped to hear from other students about the film, as Prof MacKay is so familiar with the material that sometimes he assumes we have too high of an understanding of the films.",
                "I loved listening to Prof. MacKay lecture in class; I had next to no familiarity with Soviet cinema before this class, so it was very helpful when he could contextualize the screenings / readings for us. I really liked the theoretical readings for this class and I wish I had spent more time on those.  The assigned presentation was kind of daunting at first; I've never had to do a 20+ minute presentation before, but then it ended up being pretty low stress and very rewarding. The ability to work on that presentation with a partner was really helpful and probably the highlight of my experience in this class.",
                "It is a bit overloaded and front loaded. The ambition might be better supplemented when yale starts offering courses in consecutive terms."

                "Yes! This course is perfect for film majors or Slavic majors that want to learn more about film. It is a great class for a student looking to push the boundaries on concepts we have long taken as a given.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to both students already studying film and students looking to experiment with a film class. Professor MacKay is a very kind professor who clearly cares about all the students very personally, making even challenging material digestible and interesting to learn.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Professor MacKay is a great thinker and a very kind professor who is great to work with. You will learn fascinating material in this course, though it may help to come with a bit of a background in film theory or leftist thought.",
                "I would, but with a caveat that this is a high level seminar. There is not a lot of instructional guidance in this course. The two papers are heavily weighted in grading and you have to make an effort to reach the professor outside of class hours. There were a handful of graduate students in film in this class as well. I don't really know that I would recommend this course unless you are already a film major or have a strong interest in the Soviet Union.",
                "If you're considering taking this class, I highly recommend that you look at the syllabus and preview at least a quarter of the films being screened. Make sure that you're truly interested in watching and writing about these films. I feel like the course content is geared towards a very specific kind of student, which maybe I was not. I was kind of taken by surprise by the emphasis on Soviet cinema (esp. early on in the semester); I later realized that the class is cross listed with the Slavic lit/lang department, which explains a lot! So if that is your area of interest, you'll have a great time. Prof. MacKay is very kind and he really seems to enjoy teaching this class a lot.",
                "Yes. The course was designed to facilitate conversation between students and professor Mackay and professor Mackay urged students to bring their outside areas of expertise to the seminar room. Assuming the class is composed of similarly thoughtful student, I would highly recommend the course.",
                "Yes. It is crucial that we do not simply linger upon the past and goes into the current trend."
