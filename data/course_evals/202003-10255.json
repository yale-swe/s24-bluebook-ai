                "I really appreciated the way I was able to write shorter papers in order to hone my style and voice. This is something that I don't always get time to focus on in my other classes--especially in final papers--but this has probably been the most valuable writing class I've ever taken because it focused on quality over quantity. In addition, the first and second drafts as well as feedback\/workshop session were built into the syllabi so I got to spend time tweaking my work in a way I had not been able to before.",
                "I developed much stronger writing skills -- from making pieces more dynamic and engaging to using more author's authority in my writing. I learned how to discuss art and make arguments about it in interesting and exciting ways. This included exploring the medium, content, and scale of artwork, among its other characteristics.",
                "I really honed my writing skills, especially my voice as an author. I am used to writing analytically, but this course taught me how to write journalistically, which I thoroughly enjoyed! I also gained a lot of knowledge on contemporary artists.",
                "Really great class teaching about how we speak about visual art. Weekly writing assignments are a page or two and help you learn how to write concise, interesting pieces about art\/artists."

                "I like the blog posts each week, but I wish that they had been posted on Saturdays and that they had been included in the syllabus. Sometimes there were incongruencies between the professor's in class instructions, the syllabus PDF, and the Canvas submission prompt which was mostly a technical error and not a fault of the professor. This could be remedied with a few extra hours of organizational work before the semester and would save students a lot of hassle and potential confusion.",

Everything -- from the material we studied to the assignments we completed to the time we spent in class -- was very effective, thought-provoking, and above all else, well-taught.",

                "I think Professor Spillane did a wonderful job of being aware of issues of Zoom fatigue and of ensuring that different teaching tactics she used were effective throughout the course. She was very open to feedback, and I found that the seminar teaching worked really well despite the constraints of a virtual format. While being in person would have been better (of course), I felt that the main group and breakout rooms worked well for discussion.",
                "I think this course went quite well on the digital platform. The discussions were rich, the workshops were thorough, and Prof Spillane even organized a virtual Q&A with art critic, Roberta Smith. Overall, I think this course was very well adapted to the virtual formatno complaints!",
                "There were a lot of assignments in different areas (video,reading,movies,blog posts) which was engaging and important, but just be aware that it is a lot of screen time. Good to break up and spread responsibilities over the week!"

                "Yes, absolutely. Professor Spillane is the most attentive and caring professor I have had during my time at Yale, and her investment in you and your progress as a student makes this class (and any class she teaches) a can't-miss. Plus, the course material is exceptionally interesting and is taught in a non-intimidating way even for those who do not have experience discussing art of any form.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys writing and is interested in art. You do not have to come in with experience, but I guarantee you will leave a much stronger writer.",
                "Yes! It is a good amount of work but extremely rewarding- you walk away with tons of exposure to all kinds of contemporary art\/artists and Professor Spillane is so knowledgeable\/engaging."
