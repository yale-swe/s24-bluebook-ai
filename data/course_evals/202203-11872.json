                "I gained a lot of knowledge about postcolonial Indian politics and culture. I also  had the opportunity to write two history papers, which pushed me in great ways. I really enjoyed how diverse the course material was, which also speaks to the nature of Seths work itself.",
                "I gained an appreciation of Vikram Seths A Suitable Boy and deepened my knowledge of the complexities of post-independence India. This was one of the most amazing English\/History courses I have ever taken at Yale!",
                "I read A SUITABLE BOY, one of the longest single-volume novels ever written in the English language, and I loved it. Simultaneously, I learned so much about post-Partition India, the social relationships that make up the foundation of its political institutions, and the way novels can converse with the past.",
                "I learned about South Asian postcolonial literature and history through the lens of Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy. I learned how to read a novel and historical texts side by side.",
                "I learned about post-Partition India, an era I knew pretty much nothing about prior to this class.",
                "I learned about the social and political landscape in India in the 1950s post partition. I also learned how to use fiction as a way to discuss history.",
                "I gained a thorough and broad understanding of postcolonial postpartition India, and the social and historical forces that were at play in the building of the nation",
                "I learned how to read historical and political texts in parallel, switching more deftly between them both in class and in writing.",
                "Learned about gender, religion, ethnicity and class in postcolonial India through Vikram Seths epic novel! Learned more about how to conduct deep literary analysis synthesized with history",
                "I learned a great deal about post-independence India  but what I enjoyed most was seeing how literature and history could be studied together. This was a delightfully interdisciplinary course!"

                "The professors were wonderful and I thought the class flowed very well. In other classes, co-teaching has not gone so smoothly, especially the first time is taught. I think the course could be improved by front loading the reading more (the first several weeks were quite light, and then there was a significant increase). I also was frustrated to learn midway through the semester that the final paper was a 20-page research paper; the syllabus had said 12 pages, and it would have been helpful to know that when planning out my semester.",
                "It was well-structured, though I would have preferred fewer reading responses and a shorter final paper.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professors who are available for meetings and gave good feedback on the midterm, really interesting material (I enjoyed the novel, as long as it is), I enjoyed coming every week. It's awesome that the course is between history and english -- it gave more perspectives on the course material which I loved.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the readings got a little long, which I get because the novel is 1500 pages!",
                "Strengths-- amazing professors!! Prof De and Prof Mukhopadhyay were a highlight of the course and I learnt so much because of them. They guided class conversations and always had more suggestions for sources\/questions\/ideas to consider. I loved this course and thought the pacing was also really well done; while we often couldn't get to everything, this was more because of the size and scope of the novel than anything else. I also think the blending of history and literature was pretty seamless and there was freedom to explore whichever side or aspect interested you more.\r\nWeaknesses-- Compared to other English seminars, this felt like just a few too many people, which meant it was sometimes hard to interject and the conversations could kind of meander along instead of being focused or structured.",
                "I think that this course was really engaging when we hit on a topic that people were excited about but there were moments where it felt like we were digging into something that wasnt particularly accessible to the room. As someone who came into the class with very little context, it would have been great if more of the secondary readings had explicitly provided context instead of serving as parallel, additional texts that we often didnt have time to get to. The primary book is so dense that it always felt like we had enough to tackle there and there were parts I would have liked to understood better. The dual professor mode was great since Professor De and Professor Mukhopadyay clearly have a rapport and were able to tackle how many students were in the class.",
                "The strengths are that it balances literary analysis and reading with historical discussion. Another strength is the discussion post style of engagement. Some weaknesses are that there were too many secondary readings sometimes or just reading generally.",
                "I enjoyed the way the reading was broken down. I think the student cap could have been more strictly observed, as a smaller group might have led to more engagement",
                "A huge strength is the syllabus - I found the readings both diverse and comprehensive. The class was high energy - students generously but critically engaged with each other. This is the best classroom dynamic I have participated in at Yale. A weakness is simply the sheer volume of work! Although I mainly felt like the work for this class was a pleasure, sometimes the amount felt daunting. The professors worked excellently together, and I received more feedback on my essay, both positive and negative, than in any other humanities class I've taken previously.",
                "Weaknesses - wouldve loved either more discussion of secondary readings or for them to be removed from the syllabus altogether, sometimes felt like a strange liminal space \r\nStrengths - professors were very kind and helpful at facilitating discussion, provided great feedback, very engaged discussions, fascinating book!",
                "I thought overall the course was excellent. Really well-organized, and it was surprising that this was the first time it was taught because it really did work so well! My one suggestion would be that, in the final week or two weeks of the course, there could be some class time directed towards helping students with their final papers  thesis workshops etc.",
                "I loved much of the novel and found Professor De and Professor Mukhopadhyay so delightful and intelligent. A real strength of the course was each week's pairing of historical readings with a chapter or two from A Suitable Boy  the class felt directed and fascinating. It was a lot of reading, but definitely worth it. A weakness of the course was that there were really far too many people in the room. I hate saying it because otherwise I wouldn't have been let in, but the seminar was overfull. People would talk at the professors instead of talking to each other. It was hard to sustain a real discussion when people (especially upperclassmen) were doing other work really obviously and would only participate when elaborating on their own discussion posts. Why reiterate your discussion post!? We all read them!!"

                "I think this was a great course! The class is mostly made up of English and History majors and South Asian students. It was a great opportunity to gain exposure to the English department in a way where I felt still in my wheelhouse.",
                "Yes! Our lives as students can be so hectic that to be in a class where the focus is a single text is incredibly grounding and fun. I often called it my \"one big book class.\" The more we read, the more immersed I became, and the more excited I was by the narrative and the history. To be able to read a book of this size with a dozen brilliant classmates is a great time and a course that I'm so glad I took.",
                "Yes! Wonderful course, interesting material, great professors. Take it whenever you can!!! So many amazing South Asian Studies courses are being offered and I encourage anyone to take advantage of them. Even if you haven't taken any courses focusing on South Asia, you'll very much enjoy this course.",
                "Yes!! I would recommend any course with Prof De or Prof Mukhopadhyay, and both of them together was amazing. This ended up being one of my favorite classes of the semester and I felt like I had the space to hone in on my own interests within the scope of the class. The novel is great as a piece of literature but really adds so much as a commentary on Indian history too. I also think the discussion\/forum post system was particularly good-- it was clear the professors and the rest of the class actually were reading the posts and this not only helped guide discussion but also meant that, even if you were quieter, your ideas would be picked up on. I loved this course fr, 10\/10 recommend.",
                "Yesthe professors are great and it is lovely to just be able to intensely read a piece of fiction with such a historical, political bent. I was happy to have my homework be so engaging.",
                "Yes! It was awesome to be in a class with such lively discussion and such engaging reading and to take a novel about romance so seriously in its work and commentary about sociopolitics.",
                "This is a great senior seminar for those interested in world or postcolonial literatures. Would recommend",
                "I absolutely would, but only if they were very interested in the subject matter. They will not enjoy this class if they are planning on half-assing it, and it would do the professors and the rest of the class a disservice.",
                "Yes! Great course especially for those interested in disciplinary intersection between literature and history",
                "Absolutely! I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and I felt like the atmosphere was really great for learning  it felt like our conversations often had real direction and enthusiasm.",
                "I love courses spent on one novel or author and really got so much out of reading A Suitable Boy. The professors were so much fun and it was interesting to take a course that was both a history and english class, even if it at times felt confused or overly existential. I don't know if they're going to be teaching it again but if you're interested in long good funny books then I would recommend!"
