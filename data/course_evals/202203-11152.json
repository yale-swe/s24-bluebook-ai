There was no emphasis on retention until the final because the class moved on from each lesson so quickly it was hard to keep up. Additionally, the presentations seemed like busy work; instead of memorizing dialogue they should be actual conversations you have with the teacher or another student that are not so rehearsed and rigid. Finally, the character writing aspect did not make a great deal of sense. In an increasingly digital world, students should not be spending hours each night practicing characters that they will most likely only ever type in their lifetime."
