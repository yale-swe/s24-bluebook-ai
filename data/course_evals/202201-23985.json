I learned what role each president since Lyndon Johnson has played in the shaping of the modern carceral state, the failures of liberal reformers, the role of the media in generating a moral panic about young Black people in cities, and a wide variety of preemptive policing practices that create crime rather than prevent it. This course also covered a history of Black resistance to mass incarceration that was very inspiring and generative, especially in the last few weeks of the semester.",

                "The strengths of this course are Prof. Hinton's incredible insights/endless knowledge,  the readings, and the class discussions that were always lively and generative and built off our Canvas reading reflections. This course was a narrative of history and each class built off the one before it seamlessly. Can't think of any weaknesses, except I wish we had more time together. The final research paper was also so fun to write.",
                "Professor Hinton is wonderful and so knowledgeable. She is a strength of the course, and the syllabus is excellent. My only criticism is that sometimes we did activities in class that meant we couldnt discuss the reading.",
                "This course has a lot of readings, though the selections are very thoughtfully chosen and speak to each other week-to-week. Unfortunately, much of class time is not necessarily spent engaging the readings in a very direct manner. I'd suggest that the number of readings be cut down or made optional. I think more direction going into the mid-term assignment may be helpful. The strengths include having the opportunity to hear Professor Hinton engage these issues alongside the class and hear from classmates who are oftentimes doing critical work that's related as well."

                "YES! This course was an incredible community and I had the best time and learned so much. I will never forget what I learned with Prof. Hinton this semester, and I know I will use all this knowledge in my future. It is essential for all Americans to understand the history of our carceral system, and this course will give you the knowledge of that history and then motivate you to go out into the world and do something about it.",

                "Simply put, yes. I truly believe the readings from the class and the incredible people I learned from (including prof Hinton) have changed the trajectory of my academic and personal life for the better",
