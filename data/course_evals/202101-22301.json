                "This course covers extremely interesting history and the readings are very engaging if you are interested in the history of Africa and/or socialism. However the discussions are very hands-off of Professor Machava's part, which means that sometimes it can be hard to have meaningful exchanges or to know what to make of the readings and themes of the class.",

                "It was a very strong course with lots of interesting information.",
                "This class's strengths would have to be the structure of the syllabus and caliber of class discussions, both of which were exceptional. The reading material each week was varied and exposed students to a diverse range of topics while also remaining coherent with the overall themes of the class. Discussions were consistently deep, thoughtful, and respectful even when there was disagreement. The one area of improvement I would suggest is to potentially eliminate the final paper rough draft requirement which I felt came a bit too early on in the semester even after being extended for students to produce quality work. Perhaps replacing it with a requirement for a first 5-10 pages or a more comprehensive prospectus might have the same effect of requiring students to think about their topics in advance without creating too much of a time crunch so far out from the actual deadline.",
                "I enjoyed the open discussions led by students. I only wish that Professor Machava led more PowerPoint presentations because they were quite informational. I also wish we had started earlier on the final writing assignment.",
                "Discussions were great and Prof Machava was able to facilitate them in an engaging way; I wish we had more benchmarks and check-ins for the final paper throughout the semester and also feedback on the reviews!!"

Discussions are run well and the professor provides great feedback and support, overall a really phenomenal course I would recommend to anybody.",

The course material and its organization helped to create a solid foundation in my understanding of socialism in a broad context and also in more country-specific circumstances (Ghana, Tanzania, Senegal, etc.). I talked about this course so much that I even got a friend interested to join a Zoom class. Just be mindful that there are a lot of assigned weekly readings.",

If you are at all interested in understanding the factors that led Africans to experiment with socialism after the fall of colonial and imperial powers + want to understand the history/development of African socialism, this is a great class that introduces you to important African socialist thinkers."
