                "Very strong participation aspect, the guests were also a great addition. Weakness- some weeks felt a little dry as we were just discussing papers. Perhaps there could be a way to improve student engagement, maybe space out the presentations so they are through the semester instead of the last few weeks of material?",
                "strengths\r\n- good selection of readings\r\n- great discussions and engagement from prof\r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- sometimes reading load was a bit much\r\n- would have loved more space to discuss projects in class\r\n- would have liked to turn focus toward papers earlier on in course (maybe replace response papers with project proposals and early writing drafts, e.g. lit review)",
                "Strengths: Professor Hacker is the number one strength of the this course. He is genuinely one of the most intelligent and engaging professors I have ever had and makes every lecture interesting. His curation of readings were amazing and he was very responsive to the critiques we had of any paper. This is one of the only classes where it felt like we really critically read every research paper and it felt like we were true political scientists!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of reading and the 2 hour seminar can sometimes go by very slowly at times. Final project also could've been started a bit earlier",
                "This was a great course! Undoubtedly, one of the greatest strengths is Professor Hacker's knowledge and engagement with the field. He had so much to add in each conversation and brought in a great slate of other political scientists to discuss their research with the course. The course was well organized and offered opportunities for engagement. I think the course could be improved by revamping the response papers -- I would have rather done a shorter, weekly discussion post that everyone had to do each week than the 3 or 4 response papers. I enjoyed reading my classmate's insights and it would have been nice to streamline that and offer some more time for us to read them before class.",
                "Strengths: great Professor, you learn about a wide range of topics, the chance to conduct your own research\r\nWeaknesses: more benchmarks for the final project earlier in the semester"

It was especially interesting to take this course preceding an election year, and I'm sure it will only improve in the future. This was a great seminar and I really enjoyed the syllabus and the application to the final project at the end of the course.",
