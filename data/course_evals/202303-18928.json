                "Improved understanding of special relativity (more solid than I got from the 2 weeks of relativity at the end of mechanics). Some idea of what's up with general relativity - curved spacetime, geodesics, Schwarzschild geometry (black holes), gravitational waves, expansion of the universe. I also have a much improved understanding of physics tensors (includes things like the metric tensor, christoffel symbols, and covariant derivatives), and I can use them with general and special relativity. By the end of the class, I could look back at my (very confused) early notes on tensor math, and understand what was really going on.",
                "tensors.",
                "In this course we covered special and general relativity, and spent a fair amount of time on tensor formalism. I got a better handle on special relativity and how it \"works\" then I'd had a chance to in my intermediate mechanics course, and I gained a greater understanding of the properties governing gravitational waves, black holes, and cosmology in general by discussing GR.",
                "Both special and general relativity. In SR, we covered Lorentz transformation and how the mechanics and E&M formulae can be updated and represented by four vectors. We then introduced tensors and the concepts that led to Einstein's equation (Christoffel symbol, metric, Riemann/Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, etc). Lastly, we talked about the weak field metric, Schwarzchild metric, leading to a bit of cosmology."

                "This was the best fucking course I have ever taken at yale. Professor skiba is a wondeful teacher always prepared each class to share the secrets of the universe. He treats each class as an adventure through physics and is dedicated to making the learning experience the best he can for each of his students. He is friendly and devoted to making the class a fun and inclusive space. He understands that we are students who want to learn and respects that in the way he sets up his assignments and exams. This class made me want to continue studying relativity and one day aspire to be a professor like him.",
                "There is a nice balance between phenomenology and math. The course catered well to physics majors with all different specialties and to math majors with a physics interest. At the end of the course, some of our material on cosmology felt a little smushed in, so maybe a bit more organizational planning could be done so that the end of the course doesn't feel rushed.",
                "Strengths: Professor Skiba is a fun and engaging lecturer, and happy to stick around after class answering questions. There was also a nice class dynamic, I think facilitated by Professor Skiba's jokes. The material is inherently very cool (black holes! gravitational waves!). We spend a lot of time with the mathematics of tensors, and by the end of the class, I had some real understanding of what physics tensors are and how to use them. I think splitting the class half-SR, half-GR works fairly well - it's nice to get some sense of the ideas of the course with the more familiar special relativity, before moving on to the unfamiliar GR. The TA was wonderful, and together with the professor provided clear feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: during a few of the more tensor/blackboard-heavy lectures, I was almost completely lost. I think this is in part because of a lack of physical intuition - the physical situation we're dealing with often gets abstracted away under a mountain of tensors, such that it's hard to see what's really going on. This is more about the material than the teaching, I think - humans aren't really built to think in 4D, and there's only so much you can intuit about a 20-component tensor. \r\n\r\nOne area for improvement: there were a few lectures in which we made first-order type approximations, and it was somewhat unclear to me what we were and weren't assuming. Perhaps the lecture could begin with a list of assumptions/approximations? I'm honestly not sure how helpful this would be, but I think it might provide a little more intuition, and help prevent some \"why can you do that?\" moments.",
                "Strengths: Professor Skiba is likely the most funny and entertaining professor I've ever had at Yale. The content of the course is like a different language and rather intriguing. Professor Skiba is also very kind and willing to help his students. Naveen, the TF, was also awesome and super intelligent\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, it felt like Professor Skiba and Naveen were both too smart to the point where I couldn't understand what they were saying. There were times where I felt extremely lost -- probably more lost than I've been in any class in my life and I thought I was screwed. But I did feel like Professor Skiba and Naveen were there to help in those times",
                "The structure of the course (half the semester on SR, half on GR) works well, with the midterm serving to split the topics in two. The order of topics covered is for the most part well thought out, and each week tended to build on the previous weeks' material so that was satisfying.\r\n\r\nI would have appreciated having the reading laid out at the start of the semester, instead of starting to receive page/chapter numbers by piecemeal halfway through. Turns out the newest edition of the GR textbook also covers SR, so 1) I didn't need to buy the \"recommended\" SR textbook and 2) I could have started reading from the GR book at the start of the semester. Reading associated chapters BEFORE the lecture would have been super-helpful to me, but we didn't find out which pages were connected until after the class - sometimes not until the end of the week.\r\n\r\nProblem sets were sometimes extremely difficult to parse - there were problems I legitimately didn't know how to do, but there were others I only thought I didn't know how to do because I couldn't understand what was being asked of me. That extra mental load made the weekly homeworks stressful. There was also sometimes an expectation that we knew or remembered certain concepts from other areas of physics which definitely made the problems more difficult! Exams were rough, but I feel like the curve was significant and fair in consideration of that.",
                "Strengths: Skiba and Naveen, as well as the material itself. I can't think of many weaknesses other than the fact that I would love to learn more about GR, especially the cosmology unit at the end."

They technically aren't prerequisites but make the material so much more accessible!! Be prepared to learn some challenging math methods as well in the class; but it is not so hard that it makes it un-enjoyable.",
                "Yes if interested in tensors and/or general relativity. There is some really cool physics here, and I'm glad to have spent some time learning about it. This said, my understanding of much of GR is still shaky at best, and there may be other Yale classes which cover the same material more intuitively. The upside of this course is that you get an understanding of the mathematics of special and general relativity, and get quite comfortable with tensors. However, I personally didn't get much physical intuition. For example, I can solve an equation showing that if you watch someone fall into a black hole (with some simplifications/constraints), you never actually see them fall in. Instead, they just appear to move slower and slower, always falling but never passing the black hole's radius. However, I don't have the intuition to say if this is a reasonable result, and I could not even begin to explain why things work this way.",
                "I'm not sure, depending on what your goals are. I took this course for the physical science requirement of the Math B.S. and it was kinda painful. You definitely don't need a lot of physics knowledge per se, but I think this class was harder than any math class I've take at Yale so far\r\n\r\nIf you're very intrigued by the material and willing to put in the time to understand it's intricacies, I think you can get a lot out of it. For me, I don't feel like I really understand anything about relativity still because I put in minimal effort to do well in the class (e.g. never even opened the textbook). I wish I had more time and could have delved deeper into the content",
                "This course is going to require a lot of time if you want to really understand the material. Be prepared for some pretty advanced math, and you'll want to go to all the office hours you can plus find a study partner in the class because you will need it! I'd recommend this class only if you're willing to spend a lot of time outside of lecture doing extra reading because you're not going to make it on the lectures alone. They are entertaining, but they move really fast and often skip over the \"trivial\" steps that make the concept actually click for a beginner.",
                "take this class. you will discover the meaning of life. i'm not kidding.",
                "As a math major only having taken PHYS 402, I fell in love with the class. The material is incredibly fascinating, the presentation fast but enriching, and the assessments (psets and exams) challenging but fair and well-written. I would highly recommend this class to other math majors and certainly physics majors, considering relativity is rarely taught at the undergrad level."
