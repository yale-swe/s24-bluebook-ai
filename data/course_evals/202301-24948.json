                "I learned about public space and deep considerations for who is the public, who does it exclude, who governs the public. It was so interesting to me to lean that the way that cities are and the way that we navigate parks isnt natural but completely cultivated by someone or a group of individuals. Unconscious associations that we have with public space and parks are all determined by some other person. Thats wild.",
                "This course allowed me to learn how to analyze difficult texts and artwork in a more critical way.",
                "I learned a lot about how to work with materials, at the YUAG and Beinecke, and learned a lot about public spaces. I also, surprisingly, learned a lot about art and art history, I don't say surprisingly in a bad way, it was definitely interesting, just not what I necessarily expected from this course.",
                "I learned how to do a lot of critical analysis in this class. It was really challenging, but I found a lot of support built in with my peers and my professor. It felt like an essential class to take for any major, and especially for an urban studies major. Themes and readings and discussions from this class are applicable to so many fields, and throughout the semester I found myself calling back to this class as a supplement to my thinking in other classes!",
                "I learned so much about a) what it means for something to be public or private, b) all about parks and their creation and existence in the United States, and c) how socioeconomic differences play a role both a and b, as well as the perception of wilderness/nature in the U.S..",

                "I loved how involved the professor was along with the fact that she incorporated deadlines for our final paper into the syllabus. Thats super useful for students like me who are still learning time management skills and balancing a heavy course load. What confused me just a bit was the amount of art analysis in the class. I feel like that wasnt super emphasized in the syllabus and came as a surprise to the students. I didnt dislike it but I felt unprepared for the level of analysis that we did.",
                "Professor Hobart is a strength of the course. She is deeply caring, extremely knowledgeable, and committed to the success of all of the students. The readings are both a strength and weakness. Sometimes, they felt too off topic and odd for the topic of the course or even the topic of the week. Other times they were exceptional. The course would best be improved by making it less catered to the focus on art history and more catered to real analysis of parks and recreation. The visit to the New Haven Green was a great step. More trips like that, to parks like Edgewood Park and beyond New Haven, can help improve the course and take it beyond the classroom.",
                "The class was very engaging and I think the amount of engagement Prof. Hobart facilitates with the YUAG and the Beinecke is fantastic, there were definitely times when the class lacked direction and I wasn't sure how the materials we were reading, though interesting, connected back to the main theme of the course.",
                "Professor Hobart is the courses biggest strength. She has such a strong syllabus that combines insightful readings with a balance of discussion and projects/assignments. This class truly has no weakness!",
                "Strengths - Professor Hobart really is such an intelligent, kind, and funny person, and so I looked forward to each class and hearing her insight on the readings. The class discussions were also very productive and allowed for really meaningful interactions between peers, and so I learned a lot. \r\nWeaknesses - I felt like the final paper was a bit overwhelming, and so I wasn't able to put as much care into it as I think I would've been able to for a less complex project.",

                "Yes! Its a great class that focuses on specifically on issues of land involving indigenous peoples but also people of color in general. The professor is super involved so you feel supported all the way through. And the trips to the YUAG and on the Green are so informative and a great break from the classroom.",
                "Yes, with reservation. I will absolutely recommend it for Professor Hobart, as well as the insight and contributions she provides. It is also very well structured to ensure no student gets overwhelmed. The reservation comes with the readings. At points, they felt like a chore, rather than contributing to a broader conversation about parks and recreation, making it difficult to enjoy them. Additionally, the multiple trips to the Yale University Art Gallery felt unnecessary and tedious. Learning to use the resources there was useful, but felt very disconnected from the course itself.",
                "I would recommend taking any course with Professor Hobart, who is an amazing instructor, but this was not my favorite of her courses. It was just a little less focused to my field of study, but was still interesting.",
                "Absolutely. Its such an intellectually stimulating class, and you can get so so much out of it.",
                "Yes! The material is so interesting and definitely changed my perception of a lot of things I took for granted, like public space and how I interact with the nature and the wilderness. Professor Hobart is also just an excellent professor and I don't think you can go wrong taking a course of hers.",
                "Yes, I recommend taking this class to anyone, regardless of their major! I think it really influenced the way that I interpret parks as well as urban/rural spaces that I move through."
