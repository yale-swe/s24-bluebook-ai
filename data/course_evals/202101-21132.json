Homework is not too difficult, but it is easy to make many small mistakes in crafting sentences etc. Content is designed to be relevant and applicable to common situations\/life, which is very nice. A weakness might be that the teachers like to ask trick-esque questions on tests, which, while helpful for making sure students are paying attention, sometimes feel cheap\/not reflective of class material."

In my opinion, 153 content\/vocab-wise was easier to master than 152, but some of the unit topics could be a bit more boring depending on what you're interested in. Xu laoshi is super super caring though and very genuinely wants to see her students succeed. Definitely recommend for anyone trying to improve their grasp of the language and culture.",

Content is very practical and overall handy to know, and has helped me in common situations outside the classroom (which is always nice); additionally you get a lot of opportunities to use Chinese to talk about things that you care about (essays\/projects), etc. Nice class."
