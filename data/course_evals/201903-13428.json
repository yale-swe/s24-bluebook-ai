   "comments": [
    "I learned much more about how to write an academic essay through examples that the professor provided. I also loved learning about African-American identity and questioning who really is an African-American. Even though the question is still too complicated to fully solve, Ive acquired deep thinking skills that have allowed me to analyze and reflect on real-life issues and events.",
    "This class has made me most aware of how clear my writing appears to myself, but just how unclear\/muddled it may appear to others who are reading it. I think becoming aware of this has been my biggest take away and helps me modify and alter all other aspects of my writing accordingly.",
    "My critical thinking and writing skills grew exponentially through this course! I loved the professor, my peers in the class, and the readings; they all contributed to my learning.",
    "I learned how to analyze a variety of text closely  and how to write a well formed argumentative paper.",
    "Skills: critical thinking, writing, analyzing texts in different disciplines",
    "I learned to question my identity as an African American in new lenses that I never understood before. I also feel like I learned how to write effective arguments that aren't dressed up but rather have substance. Understanding the importance of content and analysis rather than the sheer use of fancy words changed my priorities while writing. My writing has definitely improved from the high school type of writing I once thought was advanced. Additionally, being in a comfortable environment allowed me to gain the confidence to contribute to class discussions, which carried into my other classes and sections.",
    "I learned how to be more clear and to the point with my writing while also being persuasive."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: amazing class discussions, detailed  feedback from professor on writing, in-depth analysis of texts\r\nWeaknesses: none!",
    "Strengths:\r\n- the professor was very open and wiling to help students work through their ideas\r\n- subject matter was very relevant and relateable which made participating not a burden or a hassle\r\n- writing tips\/feedback were instrumental to improving my work and helped me write in other classes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- having the main learning objective of this course be writing and not the actual subject was hard to get used to at first\r\n- not enough workshops that mixed the subject matter with the writing goal of the week\r\n- didn't feel as if each week had a theme or a larger topic; this made progress\/the sense of time in the course feel odd",
    "Strength: the way discussions about the weekly readings were facilitated. The conversations were always insightful. \r\nWeakness: sometimes difficult to discern if what you've written meets all the standards properly.",
    "Strengths: manageable workload, captivating discussion, different types of readings \r\nWeaknesses: course needs more in-depth discussion of writing skills, instructor expectations",
    "This course did a very good job of teaching me how to properly write, and being considerate of different levels of skill from different students who came from vastly differing high school backgrounds. It also did an incredible job of balancing engagement with the material and teaching writing skills. I feel like the harshness in grading could be improved, as it many times is disheartening when there is a lack of improvement in grades even though there might be an increase in effort."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! Come to this class open and willing to be challenge both through your writing and your conceptions about African Americanness. This class was most fun by having an open mind and being excited to change how you may present your ideas to others around you.",
    "YES!!!! Take this course! Professor Smith is excellent and EXTREMELY organized which helped foster an environment conducive to learning. She chose excellent readings that always prompted fiery discussions during class time that were always engaging. This class really pushed everyone to not only higher heights writing wise, but also to self reflect on their identity in a different and more challenging way. It was an excellent class!",
    "Yes. It's a class I believe everyone at Yale would take. I would make it a required course if I could. I, a black person, learned a lot about being black in the US and it's significance and nonblack people would learn even more from it.",
    "Yes! It was refreshing to take a class that focused entirely on the experiences of one group.",
    "Yes, I recommend this to students who have a future in a writing-intensive major and wish to question their identity with vast questions of African Americanness. I think this class does an incredible job of improving one's writing while teaching African-American studies related material in a way that engages the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students, not only students who identify with the African American diaspora."
