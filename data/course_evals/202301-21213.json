In this course, we specifically focused on syntax and other elements that build a comprehensive signer that does not solely include knowing \"sign words\". Some aspects included a more in-depth look at classifiers, visual vernacular, and facial expressions. In addition, we focused on different elements that build Deaf Culture and Deaf Space.",

The teachers are Deaf, so you only communicate in ASL, which helps with language retention.\r\n\r\nWeakness - pen pal, it was hard to set up times to\r\nmeet with them with the busyness of the week.",
