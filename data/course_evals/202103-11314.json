                "Historical analyses; writing shorter response papers as opposed to longer essays (brief and to the point); seeing history from many different perspectives as opposed to just accepting what we're told; helps me see the world differently, especially regarding international politics and relations and seeing deeper than just what the surface looks like (ie. there are a lot of local resistances to dictatorships, or at least more than we think); also learning how to synthesize different sources together.",
                "Visual analysis of maps/photos/illustrations relating to the colonial city and a broad set of knowledge pertaining to 18th-20th century colonial cities and their many aspects (sanitation, health, planning, architectural style, housing) at a theoretical and literal scale.",
                "World colonialism circa 1800-1950. Theoretical readings to go along with specific case studies.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: structured routine of what to do and when to do what; Professor really encouraging and friendly!; touches upon a wide array of topics relating to colonial cities (I originally came in thinking just about learning a specific set of cities and their histories and that was it, but it turned out to be much more); got to go to the library to see manuscripts and actually view and touch them! (highly encourage this again in the future if possible and schedule allows)\r\nWeaknesses: only weakness I think is for the response papers/storymap/other assignments, having a little more guidance or structure on what to write about would be helpful (just for me but some people may like the really open-ended prompts)",
                "Engaging scope of readings and class topics; felt that the timing of and balance between theoretical and more first-hand readings was great and helpful in understanding main ideas of the class, but I wish there would have been more built-in opportunities to compare colonial cities against each other.",
                "I thought the weekly course themes and readings were for the most part really interesting and engaging. I also think Professor Shepherd was great at keeping class meetings interesting using a variety of discussion techniques. I really liked the assignments too; they were very manageable for a seminar and the use of storymaps was a great alternative to a traditional paper. I appreciated that weekly reading engagement was through discussion questions rather than extended responses on Canvas.\r\n\r\nI think the only thing that may be improved is showing more examples for the visual source analysis assignment.",
                "The course material and the reading selections were incredibly engaging. It sometimes felt that we didn't have enough time to cover all of the readings in detail, though.",
                "The storymaps and multimedia elements were a MAJOR strengthit was refreshing to engage with history in a different way. The readings were mostly good, but some of the more dry theoretical works (e.g. king) should probably be culled from the syllabus (maybe a documentary could replace them?).",
                "I think the class is very well-structured, with a good combination of lecture and discussion. It's way better than some discussion-only seminars when people sit around and awkwardly try to find things to say about readings.\r\nI wish we had more object-related sessions - we had one optional trip to the Beinecke but I feel like there could be more sessions as such added, since the subject we study is closely related to visual analysis.",
                "Strengths: loved reading Yeoh and the consistency in having multiple chapters assigned over a series of weeks. I also liked the amount/spacing of assignments and thought there were enough to remain engaged in the course. Loved going to archives and manuscripts. \r\nWeaknesses: lack of feedback made turning in similar assignments confusing and wished there would have been more structure in the assigned readings (didn't like King) and didn't like that there didn't seem to be a direction/grounding themes in the course. The visual source assignment, mapping assignment, and final assignment should have been less open-ended and it didn't make sense to have to include two readings from the course in the final assignment when it was possible to write them on anything.",
                "Wish we could have gotten more consistent, specific feedback as well as really clear instructions for the response papers. Perhaps calling the papers \"critiques\" instead of responses would help communicate the kind of the paper Prof Shepherd is looking for. Also, a wider array of more diverse authors would have been interesting to read, especially given the fact that the course discusses the dangers of the \"Western perspective\" as the primary source found in historical archives."

                "YES! This is such a great course on colonial city history, and we touch upon many different topicsespecially a lot of topics that I would never have really thought I would touch upon. These topics include like sanitation in colonial cities, urban design and planning, combination of indigenous and imperial \"elements,\" etc. and how all of these different factors affect colonial government policy and thus the responses and reactions of the colonial subjects. Really changes way I view history and today.",
                "Yes, absolutely for anyone interested in urbanization and colonialism, architecture, aspects of the city, race and the city, etc..",
                "Yes! Professor Shepherd is a really engaging professor, and she really cares about her students. Class is always really insightful, and it was my first time understanding colonialism under the lens of urban planning. The reading workload is pretty manageable, and there is not that much writing involved as a WR credit.",
                "Would definitely recommend this to anyone with any interest in the study of imperialism, of history, or of thinking through space and the built environment. Even if geographically, you might not see an area of interest represented in the readings, the themes are applicable and you get to explore your own interests through the assignments.",
                "Yes! Very great survey course on colonialism.",
                "Yes! I think this is a class not only history majors will benefit from, and if you're up for the workload it can also be a great humanities credit.",
                "Yes, this was a great seminar with interesting readings and engaging discussions. I really enjoyed the assignments and the flexibility Professor Shepherd gave us with our topics so that we could all focus on cities and subjects of particular interest to us."
