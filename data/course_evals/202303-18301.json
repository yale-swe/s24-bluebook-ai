The class sections were sometimes combined, and sometimes separate, which meant that the time was different a lot of weeks, and also some students hardly came to the class cause it overlapped with another class they were taking.",
                "The policy brief portion of the course felt incredibly rushed. We were only given roughly a month to understand our assignment, speak with mentors, and create the policy brief. Being that this was the first policy brief many of us created, it felt incredibly difficult to complete this task, especially considering that we didn't have structured class periods during this time.",
                "I think it was difficult for some people to see the speakers but overall I really loved our readings and discussion. I thought the in-class critical analysis was a little stressful and was held to a higher standard than I expected for an in class essay, but the class overall was so amazing and I really engaged with the texts.",
                "Timing of the course was difficult; the seminar is split into two sections, but near the end of the semester we are assigned into teams from across different sections. I was the only member from one section, so the rest of the team could easily meet while I had an overlapping class."
