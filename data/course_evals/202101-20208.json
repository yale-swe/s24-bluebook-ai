                "I learned so much about arts criticism\/journalism in this course, particularly about embracing and leaning into our natural subjectivity as a way into writing about art the reader may not have consumed. I learned how to approach reviews on films, theatre, music, and dance, as well as writing an artist profile."

                "Love that we get to review different art forms and are constantly reading how professionals are doing it. The workshops are so helpful, intentional, and approachable (which isn't always the case).",
                "Strengths: Professor Spillane is a FABULOUS professor. She brings in every voice around the seminar table, writes detailed feedback for every piece of writing we submit, and focuses on student wellbeing throughout (our break days were essentially turned into break weeks, which was amazing). The syllabus emphasizes work from marginalized artists, which you rarely get at Yale.\r\nWeaknesses: The class blog. Weekly posts felt more like a chore than an inspiration, and we were required to comment between 10pm and 11:45pm the night before class each week. Never felt like students were interacting in a blog-like discourse, which was clearly the goal. I think a way to change this is by having more structured student presentations in class.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Spillane gave constant and thorough feedback on drafts before handing the second versions of each of our reviews. Everyone gets to workshop one piece during the semester, in which all the other students write critique letters and then discuss student work with the same rigor we discuss New Yorker pieces. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Perhaps a personal pet-peeve but we often had deadlines on the weekend (Saturday at 3:00 pm), which I didn't particularly appreciate, but for the most part, it was a truly wonderful class!"

To repeat, Zoom is terrible and Yale failed us this semester by forcing classes virtual when they could have been conducted safely in person.\r\n\r\nProfessor Spillane made every effort to foster connection despite our virtual environment.",
                "Prof. Spillane very intelligently planned the course for online learning, supplanting what would have been live performances with recordings of live performances; for the theatre unit, we watched the Public Theater's Much Ado About Nothing from 2019's Shakespeare in the Park and watched recordings of a Bill T. Jones \"Still\/Here\" for the dance unit, for instance. Breakout rooms were also employed to break down different pieces we'd read, and have the group reconvene with representatives extracting insights from each of the 5-6 reviews we'd read per class meeting."

                "Yes, absolutely!!! Especially if you're apprehensive about writing on different styles of art. This course is also helpful for your writing IN GENERAL. Professor Spillane gives the most specific, thoughtful, and generous feedback I've ever received in an English class.",
                "TAKE THIS COURSE! It allows you to develop a sense of subjectivity and personal authority on the arts that you won't get elsewhere.",
                "Yes absolutely. Professor Spillane is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale thus far. She pushes her students to critically engage with the material assigned and was always able to draw out insightful lessons. If you have the chance to take a writing class with her, I really recommend you do. I will be referencing the lessons learned in this class for a long time.",
                "Absolutely! But know what you're getting into. As a deep dive into arts criticism\/journalism, it is a major time commitment, which for the sake of generating cogent and compelling writing is not as mechanical as say, writing a literary essay. Thus, in my experience, it is an incredible course where you learn about so many performing artforms and artists, but which deserve a lot of space to breathe in your schedule."
