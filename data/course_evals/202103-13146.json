In addition, I learned about different physics concepts ranging from light refraction to nuclear decay, and I was able to apply the concepts I learned in my physics lecture to practice. Moreover, I learned a lot about defining error and uncertainty. I also developed insight into how college level laboratories operate and learned the importance of teamwork in working with my lab partner.",
                "I developed no skills and lost knowledge to this course. I learned that the Yale Physics Department might want to weed out students by forcing them to take this boring course.",
                "I got to experience operating instruments that I encountered only theoretically in physics classrooms. I was also able to consistently practice thinking like an experimental physicist, being always aware of uncertainties and inherent biases.",
                "Data analysis, familiarity with physics equipment, Jupyter Notebook, Python",

I took this after I had completed the lecture physics sequence last year, so it was interesting to look back at the key points in the lab.",
                "Basic data processing and collection. Some basic statistical analysis.",
                "This course helped me develop my skills in experimentation and experimental design in the physical sciences. I also gained insight on how the physical phenomenon I've learned about in previous courses actually occur in real life.",
                "I learned how to conduct basic lab analysis techniques by using Python code, such as plotting points and graphs, generating curves of best fit (linear, polynomial, exponential), and extracting uncertainty values. I also learned how to think more like a physicist\/engineer by designing experiments to find certain parameters or to verify certain physical laws.",
                "Not only did I learn the physics behind some classic experiments but I also learned a lot about statistics, uncertainty, and Python programming.",
                "This course did provide some useful instruction and experience in using equipment I hadn't used before (ie an oscilloscope). It also left us to figure out a LOT on our own via googling, like our Python and other steps in analysis, which wasn't helpful at all.",
                "I learned how to just brute-force-get-though a course.",
                "I didn't really",

We saw concepts learned in lecture reflected in the experiments we conducted.",

            "comments": [
                "The write-ups are obnoxiously long but aside from that it is a very fun and interesting course.",
                "The class is an absolute blast in lab, and the labs themselves are engaging even when writing the report. Since this is the majority of the class, I think it's a very good course overall. I think one of the weaknesses in this course was the prelabs. Most prelabs were fine, but some included questions that were poorly explained or whose answers were not at all clear even after reading and understanding the text and looking for supplemental resources online. Another weakness is the summary reports, which were quick to write but felt like busywork.",
                "I think the hands-on approach to this course is a huge strength as it allows students to experiment with the physics concepts and to fully understand how they operate in the real world. In addition, the lab reports help students develop good habits whilst working in a lab. One thing that I think could be improved is how students are taught the material on the pre-labs. Sometimes, the material would be extremely difficult to comprehend, and completing the pre-lab would be extremely time-consuming. A possibility is to add a short lecture during the week whether in-person or online to allow students the opportunity to learn the material in a class setting.",
                "No strengths. It was a mountain of busy work that made me lose sleep to pointless reports. I think students should be able to skip this course and take 206L directly should they prove that they know the material.",
                "The course seems structured and well-organized. However, there feels to be too many unnecessary or at least redundant parts that only slow the learning process. Also, while the lab guides are structured, there is no clear format for the lab books and other reports to be followed. To me, the instructions are too vague.",
                "Strengths: Helpful Profs\/TFs. A few very interesting labs. Weaknesses: Pre-labs can be confusing, especially if you don't have a background in physics. A decent bit of knowledge is expected. The write-ups aren't hard, but they can be tedious.",
                "It is extremely time consuming, and not much is learned from the laboratory experiments.",
                "There's a lot of emphasis on error analysis, which is quite helpful, and some of the experiments are fun. However, you have to complete weekly prelabs, lab notebooks, and summary reports, which adds up to a lot of work for a half-credit class. Some weeks, I spent more time on this class than I did for any other class.",
                "I think the strengths of the course were the actual lab time. We investigated some interesting principles, and I enjoyed being able to work with a partner over the course of the semester. It was much more collaborative than any of my other classes. My TA, Sierra, also did a great job and was very helpful both inside and outside of the actual lab time. There is a very high time commitment. I spent about 12 hours a week outside of the lab working on the assignments which I did not anticipate given the 0.5 credit given for the class. The course requires a great deal of work.",
                "The labs themselves were engaging, but I felt like the class definitely expected a lot of work from students.",
                "The strengths of this course are how there are experiments dealing with nearly every topic you would come across in a mechanics course. The experiments you carry out make sense and yield satisfying results if you put the work in. The only downside is that writing up a good lab report and doing the pre-lab work every week takes a long time. This, however, is probably expected for a more advanced lab such as 205L.",
                "Weaknesses: For context, I am a premed biology major who enrolled in this course because there was no room in the typical PHYS 166L lab course that many premeds\/bio majors typically take. As someone who didn't have as much physics\/engineering\/coding\/electronics background as most people in the lab, I felt lost at times - the material was actually pretty rigorous, and it felt like I was studying for a full credit class some weeks, especially when we got into circuits. The material was relatively inaccessible for someone who has never done these types of experiments before, and I found myself spending a lot of time (5-10 hrs) preparing the pre-lab and writing up the post-lab notebook report.\r\n\r\nStrengths: That being said, my TA and professor were absolute gems (shoutout to Andrew and Dr. Caines). He was always super helpful and awesome at explaining concepts. He tried to challenge us and definitely was not easy on the grading, but it helped me become better at thinking through how to design experiments and be a better scientist. I also think despite how overwhelming it can be, the material and skills I learned were relatively interesting and definitely things that will help me later on in my career, whether it is small bit of coding experience I gained or the understanding of how important uncertainty can be in experiments.",
                "strengths: the teaching staff are always there to help you\r\nweaknesses: often very time consuming outside of lab",
                "This course can be good to get familiar with tools you may not have used before. But overwhelmingly, the labs are incredible basic and tedious, followed by obscenely long write-ups and analysis (ie, rolling a cart down an incline plane then having to write 8ish pages about it). Because of this, the workload and time spent on the course is ridiculously high (on average, about 10 hours a week) when compared to the amount learned and the half credit earned.",
                "The weaknesses of this course have a lot to do with how convoluted the pre-labs are and how the course fails to really teach anything well. Because every topic only has one lab attached to it, we zoom though the concepts to immediately apply them and without any guidance as to how the lab book should work.",
                "This course was brutal. It wasn't even just the level of busywork, it was the lack of guidance on the physics behind all the busywork. Our pre-labs had conceptual questions about many areas of physics with not much explanation. I felt like I was constantly having to teach myself random things that, more often than not, had no bearing on what we'd actually do. It was waaaaaaay more work, both intellectually and work-wise, than half a credit. This is not even mentioning that you're expected to teach yourself python at the beginning. There's actual textbook homework for most of it! The standards changed each week but they never told us how. Every week more error analysis is \"learned\" through the prelab and textbook and you're expected to utilize that in your next lab book, but there's no rubric given to you so you have to guess what they'll want. There's also just way more work needed for each lab than you can actually get to. The course is \"organized\" in that there's stuff written for everything, but it's just brutal. The only highlights were our TA, Andrew, and maybe our instructor, Professor Caines.",
                "This course did teach very valuable information; however, it was an extreme amount of work. The expectations for what needed to be completed each week in the lab reports was not exactly clear and each week the work took a large amount of time, often more time than the work for full credit courses.",
                "This course taught critical thinking skills but the experiments required a lot of previous knowledge.",
                "The greatest weakness of the course was the lack of support for students with no prior exposure to engineering\/physics lab reports. This course unfairly grades students and does not take into account the 10+ hours that goes into a single lab report. Some of the grading seems arbitrary and there is a fear of messing up any part as they can dock 10% off. In my opinion, this course should write better grading rubrics and provide an example report up front as opposed to leaving students in limbo as to what TAs want. Other than that, I really enjoyed the Python aspect and the way in which the labs make you critically think. All of the TAs and Staff are very friendly.",
                "I think a strength was that we only had to submit a lab summary, lab notebook, and prelab for each week instead of writing up a whole formal lab report. The weakness, however, was that these assignments typically took a significant amount of time. The grading was generally reasonable and the feedback was helpful, but I do think that sometimes the criticism of different submissions was a bit excessive.",
                "A strength of the course is the sequence of labs that follows the physics curriculum well and thoroughly introduces the students to all the aspects of mechanic and then introducing electrical physics labs. A weakness is the workload of the course which is very large given the half credit nature of the course.",
                "Strengths: the experiments we conducted were very interesting, and it was fun to work in the lab with our partners. I enjoyed seeing real-world examples of the topics learned in physics lecture. After taking the class, I have a file understanding of error analysis and Python. \r\nWeaknesses: since the experiments did not correspond with what we learned in physics lecture, I often had to self-teach the concepts covered in the experiment based on the pre-lab and was confused in lab. There was little instruction during the lab, which was understandable given the nature of the course, but it left us often having to ask for help from the professors. The lab wrote-ups are also fairly tedious.",
                "This is an excellent course for anyone who loves getting their hands dirty with scientific concepts. The course was as rigorous as it was engaging, and demanded a high level of commitment in and outside of class. Labs were interesting and well prepared. My only critique is that this is designated a 0.5 credit lab course. I dedicated 50-100% more time to this course than any of my full credit courses this semester, and wish there was some way to reflect that effort.",
                "A huge weakness was its reliance on Python despite claiming you not needing any experience. Though I got the hang of it in the end I had absolutely no experience with Python going in and I suffered for a lot of the semester as a consequence. They barely offered any way to work around it. Another huge weakness were the lab worksheets. I felt that the lab directions were often ambiguous, confusing, and messy. I felt similarly about the prelabs--and if you messed up in the prelab there was no way to catch your own mistake until in the lab and many times not until you were writing up the lab report later. That is, if you messed up you wouldn't notice until much too late. The biggest fault of these sheets were that they entirely lacked any clear sense of \"why\" and didn't present any good reasoning for undergoing any of the experiments. Another significant weakness was the quantity of labs. I felt that on maybe 2 days you were able to finish the labs comfortably within the given timeframe but for all the other labs I felt very rushed. This is among other things a result of the unclear prelab and lab handouts but regardless some days were way too packed with experiments. Another weakness was how ambiguous the expectations around the lab notebook and summary reports were. Finally, the grading system punished small mistakes quite significantly which felt ridiculous.\r\n\r\nA strength was the occasional prelab demonstrations.",
                "The workload rating of this course is deceptive because it was required so much time. Lab reports shouldnt be required to be so long",
                "Workload is too heavy and often ends up being repetitive busy work. The first few assignments are helpful and instructive but because every assignment follows the same pattern, less and less is learned from each assignment."

Lab is a blast and the class is an easy A if you can put in the work, but this class has an insane workload. There were weeks where this class was about as much work as all my other classes combined. I turned in multiple 20+ page lab reports and had some weeks where I easily spent 20 or more hours on the lab. I still really enjoyed the course, so I recommend it with the caveat that the student have enough time in their schedule.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course. Through this course, students gain a valuable introduction to working in a laboratory. In addition, carrying out the experiments in the lab helps solidify many of the concepts learned in lecture.",
                "No. Its just a time sink that is just not worth it for half a credit. Only take it if you need it for your major.",
                "If the major requires, yes. The course introduces good ways to practice experimental thinking.",
                "Only if it's a prereq",
                "I would not recommend this course to a student who wants to take it for fun. The half-credit description is very misleading.",
                "I would only take this class if you have to for your major (aka if you're doing a physical science and plan to go to grad school). If you're not doing the intensive version of your major and\/or planning to apply to grad school, PHYS 165L might be better suited for you.",
                "Yes, I would. It is a pre-requisite for a wide variety of majors. However, I also think it is a generally useful course. I genuinely enjoyed the time in the lab every week. You get to see many things you have learned in action which is quite interesting. The opportunity to work with a partner is also fun and gives a chance to really get to know someone while in class. However, you must be willing to put in a lot of work in terms of the number of hours. If you do put in a lot of time, the grading is very fair and you can perform incredibly well.",
                "Only if you have to take it.  The experiments are moderately interesting, and the staff are great, but the workload is absurd for a half-credit course.  Weekly lab notebooks, summary reports, and prelabs would usually add up to 10 hours per week outside of class time.   Best of luck!",
                "If you can take 165 over 205, I probably would. I just didn't feel that strong of a connection to this class, and probably would not have opted to take this class over 165 if I had the option.",
                "If you need this lab for your major, take it; it's very interesting and validates a lot of the theory you've likely come across in the past. If you don't need it for your major, I don't think its worth the amount of time you need to put in every week to get a good grade.",
                "Although I had a mostly positive experience, it would definitely be more work than it was worth for most people. I only recommend this course if you need it for your major. If you are considering taking it to learn some coding, consider taking a CS course because it does not give a very good foundation for coding.",
                "I mean, if you have to take it, you have to take it. Not sure why anyone would take this otherwise - you won't learn much, won't be intellectually engaged, and won't have time to give your other courses the attention they deserve.",
                "No, absolutely not (unless it was a prerequisite). It is a large amount of work with little to offer intellectually. It's a waste of time if one is not taking the course to fulfill some major prerequisite\/requirement.",
                "Absolutely not. Take 165, you can still do the intensive major. The one consideration is that the course gets a LITTLE BIT lighter at the end of the semester but it's just brutal. If you're gonna take it consider it at least one full credit of work when you're blue booking, maybe even more. I'm glad I got it out of the way but in the weeds it's awful.",
                "If this course is required for a given major, I would recommend taking it; however, if you have the option to take other physics lab classes I would suggest taking those other courses as they likely have less work requirements.",

                "Please do not take this unless you have a light course-load. I took this as 5.5 credits and it was absolutely terrible. The workload is enough to consider this a full credit.",
                "I would mainly recommend this course to other students who either need it for a major requirement. Otherwise, I think that a research opportunity might be a better way to get hands-on physics experience since this class can often feel like a lot of busy-work. There are definitely fun parts of this class, and I think the labs themselves are a lot of fun, but a lot of the work done outside of the class can feel a bit tedious.",
                "If it is not required for your prospective major I would not recommend this course as the workload is difficult to manage along with other classes and it only gives a half credit. However the lab environment is not stressful at all and the experiments are generally fun and interesting so if it is required it is not a bad course.",
                "Yes, but only if that student were interested in physics. The class would be worth the effort to a student who is particularly engaged in the material.",
                "Yes, but only if you really love physics and experimentation. This course requires significant dedication, and if you just want the requirement, take 165L.",
                "No, unless you have to take it for the major I wouldn't recommend it. Though they claim you don't need Python experience you most definitely do need it. The workload is ridiculously high considering it's only half a credit. It also gets really repetitive--the lab notebook and summary report at least. \r\n\r\nMaybe I wasn't used to a 3 hour class but I felt really exhausted after every lab--it's really tough to sit for that long.\r\n\r\nI just don't think the format of the course was optimized for learning and I think the problem was the prelab and lab handouts\/worksheets. I felt that we lacked a sense of \"why\" for every single lab and I felt like I was just trudging through directions for no good reason. Furthermore, they seemed to contain only the bare minimum of information.\r\n\r\nIt's very clear that the structure and material presented in this course assumed a higher level of experience and knowledge of Physics, Python, and lab-lingo than it ever made clear.",
