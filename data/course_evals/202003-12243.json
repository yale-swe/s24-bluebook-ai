                "Strengths of this class include keeping students engaged in classes, the questions, discussion in French, etc. I also felt that the course being conducted entirely in French aided in becoming more comfortable with the language. A weakness, I believe, is the frequency of exams. Throughout the semester, I felt as though I was always studying for an exam instead of focusing on other assignments as well.",
                "I found the French-in-Action series to be the weakest part of this course, I don't think it really added to my learning like the course packet did. As a complete beginner, deciphering what characters were saying was frustrating and I spent hours re-listening to the audio questions that I would have understood were they on paper.",
                "Strengths: It is very hard to walk away from this course not having learned anything if effort is put in. There is plenty of material for reviewing in the coursepack. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Fitting 2 lessons into a week was challenging. The workload was intense, especially with the weekly tests, and I often felt rushed when we had 2 lessons to go through."

I learned more French in a single semester than I ever would have thought possible, but it did not come easily. This is not high school language class--it's very intense and you'll have to work hard, but the results are well worth it. Also, be warned that the grading is tough, so don't expect an A.",
