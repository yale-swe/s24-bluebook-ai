We used many essays to learn about how accomplished writers have applied these tools, but more importantly, the seminar-style of this class aids to learning from each other.",

                "How to be more concise, how to learn from reading/emulate strategies, ways to write certain types of narratives",

I do think that there was a lot of feedback to dissect when writing papers, which can be a bonus, but also difficult. I didn't see any major weaknesses with the class, although, the people you are placed with can either make this course a positive or a negative experience. It was very fast-paced.",
                "Strengths: course format (you learn through modeling the essays you read and peer reviewing your classmates work in workshops), the essays are well-chosen to demonstrate craft moves you can use in your papers, and the pace of the class is not too demanding. Plus they added in an option to drop an essay, which is really helpful. Pam is also a great instructor who challenges what you think you are capable of as a writer in each unit.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to find any, really.",
                "The strengths were definitely the readings, the intimacy, the teacher support, and diversity in material. Weaknesses possibly were structural in times when papers were due or some papers having more time than others.",
                "Strengths: Feedback from Pam: it was always clear and thoughtful. Class discussions: Pam facilitated an engaging class with both full group discussions, partner work, and small group activities. Assignments: each assignment felt necessary and not like busy work which was greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only real weakness I can think of is that some of the readings assigned for a night had a lot of overlap and were thus somewhat repetitive. Nevertheless, they were always interesting and enjoyable, so it was okay."

                "I would! I think it's a great opportunity to try a kind of writing that we have all tried but probably have not sharpened. It's great for a writing requirement, and overall, even though it's fast-paced, does not feel overwhelming. They do let you skip a paper, which was a helpful tool for in the semester when classes were busy. I also feel more confident as a writing and more willing to take creative risks.",
                "Yes, highly highly recommended it. I took it just to get a writing credit and found myself inspired keep writing after. Plus the essays we read were moving. It never felt like work.",
                "Yes! It pushed my creativity and allowed me to learn from readings and actually stay really engaged while also overall improving my writing!",
                "I would 100% recommend ENGL 120 with Pam. She is an amazing professor who is considerate and compassionate, and she really cares about her students. The class itself is so well organized and a must take for all Yale students I believe.",
                "I would recommend this class. This course is a great opportunity to read pieces from great writers and write consistently. There are five units and it may seem like there is a quick turn around from starting a unit to writing the essay for that unit, but you are able to learn about different types of non-fiction writing in one semester."
