                "I learned the importance of brevity in writing and how to get my argument across in a concise way. I learned the basic principles that create the foundation for justice, the history of environmental writing, and how to put these two together. I enjoyed learning about resources at Yale in a way that specifically related to our course.",
                "The course's main focus was to help us develop critical research skills for our academic careers later on. I believe I learned exactly that in our classes. I know which sources to consult to delve into a comparative analysis of the arguments of different authors interested in my topic. It is also important to mention that not all sources are reliable; oftentimes, in fact, unverified sources produce unreliable data. Professor Fotos taught us how to identify an authentic paper, statistical report, or case-based investigative journalism and effectively integrate them into our research endeavors, avoiding untrustworthy and biased sources.\r\n\r\nFinding sources is the first big step in conducting successful research. The next challenging task is to assemble a comprehensive list of those sources, collected around the aim of the research. I learned a successful list supports the main argument made by the author of the paper while acknowledging other possible interpretations of the text, case, or event investigated. The Final Project of the course was to create a list of sources for annotated bibliography on my research topic. The assignment enabled me to apply the knowledge we gained in our seminars about synthesizing sources to have a meaningful research experience.",
