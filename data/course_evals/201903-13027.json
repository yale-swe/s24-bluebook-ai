    "Appreciation for creative nonfiction and an increased awareness of it in publications. Also, an increased ability to write on creative subjects more fluidly.",
    "We read a wide range of writing in terms of genre, author, and style, mixing classic works with more recent ones, such as New Yorker essays. You gain experience writing five different kinds of essays (personal experience, location, humor, cultural artifact, profile) and you talk about specific techniques and tricks you can use in your own writing.",
    "This class exposed me to the genre on Non-Fiction Narrative, and all of it's different sub genres.",
    "I read a lot of good writing that will serve as inspiration for writing I do in the future. I gained skills in drafting,  revision, and learning from my peers' writing."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very solid. The reading are simply the best essays written and that makes the readings short and engaging. The work load is reasonable and rewarding and the essay topics run the gamut to give students a grasp of many types of writing. My one complaint is that my professor was very congratulatory on some of my writing that I knew wasn't that great and this wasn't constructive as I had hoped.",
    "The course lacks in teaching actual writing techniques, chiefly leaning toward a focus on analyzing others' writing and attempting to incorporate the techniques in that writing into your own.",
    "Strengths: interesting readings and they are not too long, you get to read work by a whole range of authors, workshop is really helpful, Prof. Deli is nice, helpful, and super energetic (even at 9 a.m., which definitely helped with the early time.) Weaknesses: because there are five essays and you turn in a draft for each one, it seems like there are deadlines all the time, but it is really very manageable; reading responses for each class are annoying at the time but a helpful boost to your grade.",
    "Strengths- I had a very small class size that allowed us to all contribute to conversations and discussions. There is a lot of feedback for your essays, especially during Writer's Workshop!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- The class is a moderate amount of reading and writing, as is to be expected, but there are plenty of opportunities for office hours and help.",
    "Strengths- lots of good reading material, manageable deadlines, feedback on rough drafts before final drafts.\r\nWeaknesses- the learning we do is all specific to the texts we've read and what we can learn from them- no general principles of writing are taught."

    "Yes, if you want to improve your writing and read some good stuff",

    "Yes! Regardless of whether or not you consider yourself a writer, this is a great course for anyone who is looking to improve their writing skills and read some interesting material. Prof. Deli is super nice and eager to help you improve. It's a very manageable amount of work. Note that even though the essays are non-fiction, it is still a creative writing class.",
    "Yes, but know that this is not academic writing! This is personal narratives and non-fiction accounts. The title is a little misleading, but the class is excellent all the same!",
