    "This class covers nearly all of what one would learn in Calc AB and some of what one would learn in Calc BC.",
    "Basic differential calculus",
    "I learned about calculus and some of its applications.",
    "I feel that I was given a strong foundation in calculus that has prepared me to do well in MATH115 next semester.",
    "I learned key concepts in the fundamental aspects of calculus, namely the nature of limits and its application in differentiation and integration. I also learned how to apply these are applied to real world problems.",
    "This course greatly improved my problem solving skills.",
    "While I already knew how to find basic derivatives, through this course I went much further in depth in this area and now understand not only how they are used, but how they are used in unfamiliar situations.",
    "The course covered limits, derivative calculus, and started on integration. The material was discussed in greater depth than in most previous math classes I have taken.",
    "I learned more insight into calculus and a greater breadth of information than I had learned in high school."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: There are many peer tutors and office hours so help is there for those who seek it. \r\n\r\nWeakness: This class moves far too quickly for someone who hasn't taken Calc before. Furthermore, very few practice problems are done in class. As a result, one is expected to learn the content from usually confusing and quick explanations.",
    "WebAssign questions are sometimes a bit unclear (not a huge deal though because you only lose a tenth of a point for incorrect answers.) I also believe that far too much weight is placed on the final.",
    "I do not think this course was very well organized. The lessons taught in class were not in-depth enough to help with the problem sets, let alone the examinations. After a few weeks of this class, I decided to switch majors due to the dread I had going to class and doing problem sets. I absolutely hate math after taking this course.",
    "I thought that the teaching could have been more hands-on and interactive.",
    "It would be helpful if we focused more time in class on going over problem set questions we had trouble with.",
    "It is nice that this course has a variety of \"extra-help\" options available to students, such as office hours, peer tutors, and extra review sessions. However, I did not like the way in which the course was taught as a flipped classroom. I did not find it beneficial in any way to be \"tested\" (via WebAssign homework assignments) on material we had not yet learned. It did not help to grasp the material any better and ended up just producing unnecessary stress about WebAssign grades.",
    "They say you can take this course without ever taking calculus before, but I find this hard to believe. A lot of things that are crucial to calculus are brushed over but expected for you to have mastered in order to perform well in the rest of class.",
    "I felt as though I understood the concepts, but when put into application such as in the practice midterms and finals, it became much more difficult than the applications we discussed in class."

   "comments": [
    "If one needs Calc for their major or simply wants to learn Calc, then yes. However, if sonmeone has never taken Calc before, they should probably take MATH 110 in order to actually understand the content that they are learning.",
    "Yes, if you need to take calculus. The Psets take a significant amount of time every week (around 5 hours for written Psets and 90 minutes for each WebAssign (2 per week) = 8 hours",
    "Unfortunately it is a prerequisite for many majors.",
    "It's a good foundational course for calculus.",
    "Although I have my qualms about this course, overall I do think it is a good course that sets up students for success in mathematics. For this reason, I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Yes. It provides a really strong foundation for Calculus.",
    "No, simply because I believe it is very difficult for someone who has never taken calculus before, especially because the difficulty of work discussed in class does not reflect the tests."
