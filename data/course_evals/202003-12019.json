                "The strengths of the course are the exposure to so many different kinds of Japanese cinema. The weakness would be the sheer amount of reading necessary to have foundational discussions about said cinema became quite overwhelming at times. Furthermore, the desired paper style was not completely clear, even after reading Professor Gerow's guide on writing papers for film.",
                "Strengths: Really great diversity in films. Really appreciated when the professor decided to experiment with the films on the syllabus. Nice breaks provided by the prerecorded lecture. Breakout room and clip viewing was more sophisticated with my other courses--very swift usage of tech this semester. I felt I was able to learn a great deal from both the instructor and the grad students. The professor is skilled at maximizing learning and keeping assignments\/workload at a reasonable level.\r\nWeaknesses: Wish we could have dwelled on a few units for a little long but this may be hard to achieve what w\/ the survey nature of the course.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they are interested in Japanese culture or film. The films that Prof Gerow selects are pretty interesting, and they usually aren't too long. Many of them were only around 90 minutes long, which is pretty rare for film majors who are used to taking seminars with back to back screenings of 2.5 hour films. Combined with the films, the reading can be a bit extensive, but it is definitely manageable. I found the historical readings more interesting than the academic\/philosophical ones as many of the readings were quite dense and convoluted. Prof Gerow is great, and his power points at the beginning of class are well-organized introductions into the theme of each class. However, I do think this class could have functioned better as a small lecture ~25-35 students as opposed to a seminar.  Half of the class was entirely lecture, and students' engagement was centered around answering specific questions rather than back-and-forth discussions.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who has taken at least one film class before! I think the environment could be at times intense given the expertise of the instructor and the expertise of the grad students. Be prepared to use your critical thinking skills [perhaps to a greater degree than other classes here] and take many notes.",
                "Yes. Prof. Gerow was a great professor and the material was very engaging. It is an awesome course for anyone interested in Japanese film or film studies more generally.",
                "Yes. This course teaches a lot about Japan and Japanese films. It is very engaging"
