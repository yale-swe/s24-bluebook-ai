   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learnt about many important words and grammar patterns that deepened my appreciation for the complexities of the Korean language. It enabled me to move beyond simplistic grammar patterns and focus on expressing myself more accurately and precisely. The range of vocabulary covered in the class was also very wide - I learnt important words that I could use in an office setting, or even when just talking to friends over text. The class also gave me valuable insights into Korean culture through the folk-tales that we learnt, which helped me connect better with my Korean heritage roots.",
    "Writing practice, knowledge of Korean current business culture and traditional folktales, improved vocabulary",
    "I was able to improve my oral and writing skills in the Korean language, while learning about the culture in an environment of other heritage speakers.",
    "I learned a lot about my culture from my home country. Whether it be ancient culture from folk tales or modern culture from dramas, I definitely gained a lot of insights on South Korean culture. I became much more comfortable writing and speaking Korean.",
    "My Korean vocabulary increased through this class. I also learned a lot more about Korean culture as a whole.",
    "improved Korean cultural literacy through folk tale readings and K-drama assignments, speaking skills through class debates, ability to write longer essays and film\/literary critiques in Korean",
    "I am a heritage learner so I could speak the language but this class was my first introduction into writing. Through writing assignments I grew a foundation in my writing (spelling, grammar, etc.). I also gained some insight on cultural aspects of South Korea that I may have otherwise not have thought about, such as the office culture or popular bedtime stories.",
    "A lot of Korean vocabulary\/culture through reading children stories, watching Misaeng, and different projects.",
    "High level vocabulary and expressions along with Korean cultural content to take your Korean to the next step.",
    "Not only did I develop my Korean speaking and grammar skills, I also learned about Korean culture and folktales through multiple different activities.",
    "I was able to develop a better understanding of both past and modern culture in Korea. In addition, I was able to pick up on Korean vocabulary that can be used in professional settings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was good in that I was able to learn practical aspects of Korean and a wide range of words that I had not encountered before. However, I felt that the class size was too large and perhaps not as conducive to in depth study of the language because the students ability levels varied too widely.",
    "This class really felt like a community which I liked. I wish we had gone over more grammar forms in class and possibly had more speaking practice. The writing focus was helpful and I feel like I improved my writing a lot.",
    "The strengths were definitely the professor, who really catered to each of the students and was constantly allowing an environment for learning.",
    "The course definitely stretches your writing ability. There is a LOT of homework--though it isn't harshly graded or anything, I did feel that the homework was excessive. It did force me to write in Korean more often.",
    "The strengths of this class was how interesting it was--the professor always mixed things up and tried to keep the students interested, while still teaching us something new. I feel as thought the weaknesses of the class were the K-Drama (Misaeng) assignments, as they took up a lot of time, leading students to just search up the plot of the episodes.",
    "Strengths: Professor Lee-Smith brings so much enthusiasm and care for her students to the classroom! Language tables and class speaking activities made coming to class and getting to know my classmates a fun experience. What could be improved: While very well-organized, I felt that the weekly K-drama episodes and folk tales were a bit repetitive and could have been replaced by more in-class activities and relevant vocab\/grammar lessons (similar to L4 Korean class). I also think I preferred the daily 50-minute language classes in L4; 1 hr 15 min classes for just discussion during some days felt a bit long.",
    "Strengths: the professor is mom. She cares about the students and even cooks for us. Learning Korean in this class was not an academic pressure. I learned naturally through the TV dramas and stories we read in class. The discussions we had in class were very relaxed and all the professor really wanted was for us to speak more Korean. The assignments were nice because students write at different levels and the professor understood that. I grew comfortably from the writing level that I started at. The class is also small enough where you can get to know people well. You are going to get as much as you put in this class. \r\nWeaknesses: Not much. Sometimes the assignments got repetitive because we did the same thing every week. But nothing wrong with having some rhythm in life.",
    "More one on one tutoring",
    "I was exposed to a lot of new vocabulary but I don't think it forced me to actually learn and remember them well. We had a quiz almost every class so I just memorized it for the quiz. The class is much more writing heavy than conversation. I think the class would be better with less students.",
    "I believe that one way this course could be improved is more group projects or collaboration between students.",
    "The course fosters a very engaging and comfortable learning environment for students. It also provides consistent feedback to students.",
    "Strengths: Very enthusiastic, caring and passionate professor who deeply cares for the students, interesting folk stories, and very engaging discussions\r\nWeaknesses: The Misaeng homework can be a bit overwhelming - it feels like you would have to write a paragraph for each question but it does help improve your writing abilities \r\n\r\nStudents just need to review their assignments, so that they're not making the same mistakes so maybe leaving some time at the beginning of the class for students to revise might help."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. It provides a good way to reconnect with cultural roots and learn practical Korean that will be immediately applicable to everyday life.",
    "Yes, I liked the variety of topics covered and the communal atmosphere of the class.",
    "Absolutely, especially if you are a heritage speaker. It is a great course to truly immerse yourself in the Korean language and culture and learn a great deal, especially being away from home.",
    "Yes! It's an interesting course, no doubt, and instead of focusing on the nit-picky details of the Korean language, it focuses more on Korean culture and cultural literacy. I found that to be a lot more useful because through just being exposed to Korean everyday, my language skills increased, but also my knowledge of Korean culture increased. It's a good course to take if you're looking for more of a broad approach.",
    "definitely. the korean professors are all really nice, and i'd say professor lee is just such a nice lady, but also a GREAT professor and teacher.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they're into learning more about Korean culture. I would not recommend this course for someone who is trying to further their learning in terms of grammar and the technical aspects of the language.",
    "Yes! L5 has a manageable workload and will also improve your writing and speaking skills. Some of the weekly assignments might feel like \"busy work,\" but the chance to learn from Professor Lee-Smith and surround yourself with other heritage Korean speakers is totally worth it.",
    "Highly recommend. Very relaxed class and the professor is super nice. I am grateful that I had this class as an option to fulfill my language requirement.",
    "Yes! Wish there was more rigorous spelling teaching, although I learned a lot about culture!",
    "I would recommend! I really enjoyed class, Professor Lee, and the students! You get to improve your Korean a lot more, or at least maintain it.",
    "Definitely, the skill level of class may vary a bit, but she is very good at making sure you are engaged in the Korean content in the best way.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course as it not only teaches you a lot, but also provides you with a great community.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students because it is very accommodating and engaging.",
    "ABSOLUTELY - Professor Lee is such an amazing lecturer. She truly cares for the students and for what she teaches, so it made going to class really enjoyable.",
    "Yes! The class & everything that comes with it is so much fun."
