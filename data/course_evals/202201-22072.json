                "I conducted molecular biological lab techniques that I had not done in my employed lab setting nor in other biological lab classes. I also learned more about the contents of specific lab reagents and conditions for protocols I had conducted before, but did not know the full resigning of their experimental design and components.",
                "I learned lab techniques like protein gels, centrifugation, etc. Basic but essential assays in a wet biology lab.",
                "I learned a lot about how to work in a cell biology lab. I learned proper techniques and most importantly, I learned how to be a better scientist.",
                "I learned many skills that are used in the laboratory. Through this introduction, I feel more comfortable with the lab and my decision making for what should be done.",
                "I learned valuable skills in the laboratory through this course. By going through different experiments and procedures, I gained familiarity with microscopy, cell culturing, centrifugation, protein purification, and other techniques necessary for cell biology. In addition, I gained a better perspective and understanding of life in academia and biological research.",
                "MCDB 344-345 gave me not only a broad overview of and hands on approach to the techniques and science that make up the field of cell biology but also a space and community to develop as a scientist and a person.",
                "This course is great for learning wet lab techniques and for learning about the science of how\/why they work.",
                "I learned a lot of important techniques to cell biology such as gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE,  microscopy, and how to give chalk talks explaining cell biology techniques",
                "This class was a fantastic introduction to basic techniques in cell biology. It was a great hands-on learning experience applicable to wet lab research. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about research techniques.",
                "The entirety of this class was spent learning laboratory skills in biology. This was absolutely amazing. I can safely say that I mastered each and every one of the techniques we learned and would be able to apply them on command. More importantly, however, I would say that I understood when each of these techniques are used and would feel very comfortable designing an experiment that uses these skills. I was able to learn how to think like a research scientist, how to ask the right questions, and how to learn relevant skills to what you want to research.",
                "I learned fundamental skills to complete experiments in molecular biology laboratories, such as differential centrifugation, dissection, and gel staining. In addition, I learned how to be critical of data and present it in a way that is both defensible and accessible."

            "comments": [
                "Live love Wolenski. Good technique, and life is good.",
                "The class could be more efficient. Some of the techniques in class take about three times as long in class as they do in normal lab settings. However, detail is not compromised, so the tediousness is warranted.",
                "strength: wolenski is a great professor, highly engaged with his students, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic\r\nweakness: can't think of any",
                "Strengths: Prof Wolenski is extremely enthusiastic, and creates a great learning environment. The labs are very practical and helpful for anyone doing basic biology research, and we covered a lot of different techniques in detail. Since there was a wide variety of labs and everyone had different background research experiences, everyone had at least one lab where they got to demonstrate their skills and lead their tablemates, and at least one lab where they had no experience and had to learn from their tablemates instead. It's a very fun and useful class!\r\nWeaknesses: This course takes up a lot of time in your schedule, and really should be a full credit. Sometimes experiments were not designed as efficiently as they could have been, so we had a lot of down time and spent more time in class than we needed to.",
                "Strengths- The student focused learning environment and the family unit the the course creates. Dr. Wolenski is a wonderful person and professor, and it was an honor getting to learn from him. \r\nWeakness- Sometimes the labs felt a bit unorganized and there was a little bit of sitting around and waiting on the next instruction. However, this is minuscule and I am super glad that I took this course.",
                "I think that this course has a strong team building atmosphere where everyone in the class gets involved.",
                "The biggest strength by far is Prof Wolenski and his enthusiasm for teaching students. He always was excited and ready for each class, and his energy and positive outlook encouraged all of the students in the course to be engaged and learn.",
                "The subject matter is super interesting. With the small class size, hands on approach, and student presentations, the course provides an incredible space to learn. But, the thing that really makes this course special is Professor Wolenski. He's unparalleled in his kindness and earnestness in wanting his students to succeed. I think this course could be improved with a little more focus at times; it felt like there were some lab sessions where we could have been more efficient without taking away from learning or making anyone feel rushed.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wolenski and the cohort-style organization of the course. Professor Wolenski is very knowledgeable, positive, and encouraging. The classroom atmosphere is one where you can make mistakes with little risk. And, you learn a lot by doing things hands-on. I also enjoyed the \"chalk talks\" which gave us the opportunity to practice presentation skills. Weaknesses: About the chalk talks, I wish there was more guidance on how to create a good chalk talk. I think a lot of us struggled, since it was our first time presenting in this style. Perhaps a quick lesson on \"do's\" and \"don't\" or tips to keep in mind would be helpful. I also wish that there was clear communication of assessment from the beginning of the class. I would've liked to know there was a \"final quiz\" at the beginning of the semester so I could set-up my learning in a way conducive to reviewing the course material.",
                "Strengths - Awesome, fun course where you learn a lot and have fun doing it \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- not really any, sometimes class can be a little long",
                "This class fostered class collaboration with a highly involved professor. Learning was much more effective than in other labs because students could discuss with their classmates and work together towards reaching an answer. I think that the labs could be a bit more organized so that things happen in a more timely manner. Providing protocols for the lab 24 hours prior may make class time run more smoothly.",
                "This course has all of the strengths and none of the weakness. The professor was incredibly engaging and fun to listen to, even though the classes could be long. He was able to hold our attention and keep us with the task at hand. Truly one of the best courses I have taken at Yale so far.",
                "I think a major strength of the class is Dr. Wolenski's teaching style: you are not afraid to fail. He genuinely wants you to learn, and the small class size is especially conducive to teaching the collaboration and teamwork that is a hallmark of working in science. One improvement I would request is being more transparent with grading and assessments, since the quizzes were a bit of a surprise."

                "yes. this class was so helpful in learning the lab techiniques every biology student needs to know if they are interested in wet lab research. Lectures only talk about them and other lab classes are so stressful, you never really learn anything because you're so afraid of falling behind or making a mistake. Not the case in the class, opening the room up for real learning.",
                "Yes, especially if you want to do wet-lab bio research at any point during your time at Yale. Also helps reinforce topics from other MCDB core courses.",
                "Yes. You aren't babied and actually learn by doing. The do not waste time doing write ups and such, but rather you focus and preparing a speech about a topic (something that really happens in science). Excellent course. You would be a fool not to take it.",
                "YES",
                "If this student is interested in learning more about the lab, I would recommend this class to them.",
                "Yes, if you are able to take this class, do it. You will gain skills in the lab, and make a group of friends throughout the semester.",
                "Yes! 100%. You learn so much while also finding an amazing community, and Professor Wolenski is the man. That all being said, if you are already established in a lab, you might find the pace a little slow.",
                "I definitely recommend this course! Email Professor Wolenski your first year to take it your junior year. It is a great way to get your lab requirement for MCDB in one semester and without too much stress. There is not much work outside of class, but don't let the low workload fool you - there is a lot of class time, and that definitely takes time and energy. The course is also amazing because of your PEERS! Because of the small class-size and many class hours, the course works to build a cohort. You become really great friends with your classmates - relationships (and connections! they're all ambitious and smart!) that I will cherish for a long time.",
                "Yes, it was a blast and you learn a lot of useful techniques and have a good time while doing it",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in doing wet lab research. This is a great learning environment and Professor Wolenski is a passionate and involved teacher.",
                "Do yourself a favor and take this course. This is absolutely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale and am so glad I did. Professor Wolenski has an awe for science that is contagious and makes you appreciate the beauty of what science can be. On top of that, I learned so many relevant labs skills that I will definitely be using in the future.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially if they are an MCDB major and 1) need their lab credit and 2) have not started their research yet. It imbues you with essential skills for molecular biology, as well as being a fun environment to learn and get better acquainted with biological science."
