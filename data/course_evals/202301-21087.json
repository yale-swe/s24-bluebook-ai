                "Strengths: Erica and the peer tutors are a wonderful resource in terms of getting help on psets. Nick is also a great and straightforward lecturer. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It can take a minute to adjust to some of the terminology/logic behind the analyses if you don't have a strong math and stats background. The one day pset turnaround time also became incredibly stressful at certain points in the semester.",
                "NTB and the teaching team were so so amazing. The only weakness was that it was very easy to fall behind as the class moved really fast and the one day pset turnaround was stressful",
                "The problem sets could be long and extremely mundane. I don't see how this could be improved, however. As I learned, only a small fraction of brain analysis is creative and exciting. Extensive preprocessing and initial data handling must first occur before the exciting analysis can be carried out. The problem sets were comprehensive (which I consider a strength), so they involved a lot of boring data processing. Conversely, the parts where we actually applied analyses (especially our own novel analyses) made it all worth it.",
                "Strength: Content, Professor, TA, peer tutor, workflow in terms of how the previous notebooks keep making more sense with newer notebooks\r\nWeakness: Condensed heavy workload for Tues-Wed",
                "Strengths: extremely useful fMRI analysis skills, fMRI acquisition techniques, trip to the scanner. Weaknesses: lack of office hours, office hours right after a long lecture, one-day turnaround time. While this class teaches EXTREMELY useful techniques, the structure was awful. After a two-hour lecture, you are expected to be able to work on that week's PSET for an hour. Then, office hours with the TA are RIGHT AFTER that. I do not think many people can focus for that long, and I don't think anyone should be able to focus for that long. In addition, placing office hours right after the PSET is presented does not make sense. Office hours should be a time when students are able to ask questions about the material they are working on, after they have determined how they are confused. Then, there is the turnaround of the assignment, which is due the following day at midnight. The instructors will tell you that the assignment is graded with this short turnaround in mind, which is true, but the reality is that as the student, you still have to understand and complete the assignment in the timeframe. I think this is entirely unreasonable and students should at least be given the weekend to complete their assignment on top of other unknown obligations. Not only will this allow for a deeper understanding of the material, it will also facilitate student interactions by allowing time for study sessions. In the current format, the only way to complete the assignment WELL in the given time is if you essentially spend an entire day on it, which is difficult for almost any student to do during the week. Therefore, allowing 6-7 days to complete an assignment of this caliber allows students to break it into smaller chunks over multiple days and understand exactly what they need help on. Also offering office hours during a broader range of times over multiple days would greatly increase the chance that students are able to attend and be mentally present.",
                "the PSETS need not have a day turnaround, it makes this course harder than needed and takes up less mental real estate as you rush to finish the PSET as fast as possible."

                "Really great class and excellent professor and TA, but way too much work to only be worth half a credit -- would be a great credit/D or audit class. Also, would definitely need to have taken CS50/another intro CS class before taking this since it is entirely Python-based.",
                "This course is extremely useful if you are conducting or will conduct fMRI research. Be prepared to spend all of your Tuesdays and Wednesdays on the problem sets, though.",
                "Do not take this course if you have little to no coding experience. The course revolved around applying reasonably complicated statistical analyses to large data sets (the size of which created their own problems) using python. If you're comfortable with python and ready for an adventure, however, this course is incredible. By the end of the course, I was running analyses I never thought I would be cable of designing on data I found and downloaded from the internet with minimal supervision. I cannot believe how much I learned. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, if you are (a)interested in the content and (b) can work well under time pressure. You will learn a lot of very important contemporary topics, but you will need to be self motivated and make time yourself to fully explore the tools, especially if you do not have a very computational background. \r\n\r\nOtherwise I will say do not take this course just to fulfill some major requirement. The course has intensive assignments, with less than 36 hours to complete it. The structure is also not very accommodating with extensions or anything. It feels like you are expected to prioritize this course over all your other courses, which is not very fair. You will likely suffer a lot more if you have ADHD/other attentional issues as you cannot afford a bad Tuesday/Wednesday evening.",
                "Unless the structure of this course changes, do not take it if you have obligations on the night of class or the following day. The stress for completing the assignments in the given time is not worth it. If you do have the time (and I'm serious, ONLY take this if you have the time), you will get a lot of useful fMRI analysis methods out of it.",
