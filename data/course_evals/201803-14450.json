    "Riting skills",
    "This class was extremely helpful in showing me my strengths and weaknesses in academic writing and how to work those into papers that one wouldn't normally write, and come up with a good result. It's also a really fun seminar, and the topics covered ranged from the most arbitrary questions like \"why do we take selfies?\" to the hard ones (the class actually starts with it) like: \"What is the self?\"\r\n\r\nEvery single class was fun and informative and made me think in new and unexpected ways, even appreciate myself and my (and others') opinions on the self and perception more in general.",
    "I learned to become a better writer",
    "This course allowed me the space to creatively approach academic essays in philosophy, and certainly improved my writing process, structure, and style.",
    "I learned how to write cohesively.",
    "This was a great English class for my first semester at Yale. The material was engaging and the assignments were meaningful. I loved the material. Overall, this was a good class.",
    "I became a much better writer",
    "In-depth analysis of complex ideas regarding who we are as people and what defines the self.",
    "I developed a more consistent and thoughtful writing style that produced more supportable claims. I also learned a lot about how to break down and view different human identities.",
    "The class was a great first transition into college writing, and I gained a greater understanding of the expectations and style of college-level writing.",
    "A much more sophisticated writing strategy and more advanced close reading technique.",
    "English writing skills and discussion"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: really engaging topic. Great discussions in the classroom. I wish that the professor did not have to follow a strict schedule common to all 114 courses. Also, I would have liked if I had access to more sample essays.",
    "This class is demanding but very fun and chill and will not make you ever want to miss a section. No negative comments; I found it engaging, informative, and the feedback was helpful.",
    "It is a very fascinating course. I loved learning the material. I also thought the feedback from the professor was very helpful.",
    "The course was very well rounded, with great attention given to improving our essays, understanding the content, and also helping review others work. I really cant find an awful lot of faults, it was a great course!",
    "I think it could be better structured.",
    "As this course is part of the collection of English 114 courses, it had to follow the same schedule and rules as the other classes. For our section, we always felt rushed as we skipped from one paper to the next within days. We would have loved to have more discussion time.",
    "Great teacher feedback but not much help with learning citations",
    "The readings are extremely interesting and not too lengthy. The discussions in class are very productive and engaging. The essay assignments are fun and allow the student to take the reigns in shaping their own prompt.",
    "I think this class has a lot of strengths. It forces students to be very thoughtful about themselves and world around them.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course may simply lie in the pseudo-philosophical nature of the subject material. While looking at human identities in an English class is a good way to make interesting writing pieces, its a poor way to actually come to any conclusion about human identities. I think the class could have used a bit more cohesion between each view of human identity we discussed.",
    "Strengths of the course was the content and enthusiasm from the professor. Students were really able to engage with course materials and gain interest in the topics they were writing about. Craig was also great and available to meet with students after the first draft of every paper in order to get feedback. Can't really name any weaknesses that come to mind immediately.",
    "S: intimate seminar setting, engaging professor, topic relevant in everyday conversation \r\nW: few, if any"

   "comments": [
    "The professor is incredible. Really friendly, always available to provide additional help. Made sure the class was enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings are extremely interesting and the topics of discussion are varied enough to  catch the interest of students regardless of what they're studying. Moreover, Craig is an excellent professor and will push you to think harder and to really improve your writing with a great attitude and sense of humor.",
    "yes",
    "Definitely take this course - you will improve your writing, read great articles, and have doing both. (As a non-writing intensive major, that's high praise right there.)",
    "yes!",
    "Absolutely. It was an excellent course in both academic writing and philosophy, Professor Elkins was a great teacher, and all in all the course was stimulating and enjoyable.",
    "I would because it helped me improve my writing.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in becoming a better writer (and exploring a variety of writing styles) while delving into cool discussions about: \r\n-consciousness\r\n-artificial intelligence\r\n-computonium\r\n-life itself\r\ntake this course.",
    "Yes. My writing skills enhanced tremendously",
    "Absolutely! The content is fascinating and makes you question many previously considered self-truths.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student has an interest in writing and a fair amount of time to spend thinking about the subject matter. Its an easy class to grow in as a writer, and we read a lot of great pieces of writing.",
    "Would absolutely recommend this as a first writing class to any Yale student, learned a lot about the style needed, how to go about writing a research paper, and all of it was done in a lower-pressure environment.",
    "Absolutely. I saw a visible improvement in my writing abilities and engaged deeply with the material. Students will enjoy interacting with the professor and students in this seminar-style course."
