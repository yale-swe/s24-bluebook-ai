                "This course was absolutely transformative. I went from knowing very little at all about Shakespeare (honestly I was never really a fan in high school) to having an excellent understanding of both his comedic works and why people care so much about him. I even became a fan myself!",
                "I gained a much deeper understanding of Shakespeare, his comedies, and the context of his plays. Because of the heavy course load, I learned how to write essays quickly and analyze plays as I read them. We also explored themes of misprision, power, forgiveness, and more in the context of Shakespeare's work.",
                "I learnt how to write in the format of a college essay, how to question my own opinions, and how to consider how the entirety of the context of a play affects a perspective. I also broadened my knowledge of Shakespeare and his life, including his typical characters and the lessons behind his plays.",
                "We read Shakespeares greatest comedies, romances and problem plays. My confidence in writing improved and Mr. Brisman inspired me to read literature with real emotion.",
                "I greatly developed my writing skills through intensive weekly writing assignments and how to connect the problem of Shakespeare to current issues.",
                "This class was a wonderful survey of Shakespeare's comedies, romances, and problem plays. I learned to read critically and write thoughtfully and truly immerse myself in Shakespeare's work. I would literally recommend this class to everyone  be prepared for insightful discussion and hard work!"

            "comments": [
                "I was confused why the last four plays were given less class time. I think it should have been balanced more.",
                "The way each class focused on certain themes guided us in our readings, giving us much deeper insights into structures of these plays. When we discussed a scene we read through it and then watched multiple screen and stage adaptations of that same scene. Being able to analyze the different interpretations of a few lines helped in understanding the nuances of tone characters or even entire plots could take depending on the reading of them. The feedback given for our essays was also very constructive and designed to get us thinking beyond what we wrote.\r\n\r\nWhile the work was doable, the fast pace of the class gave us very little time to process each play we read. During class, it was difficult to engage with the other students because of the format of our lectures - very often our professor would ask a question and one of us would answer, but there would be no opportunities for other students to interact with an answer or to ask each other questions. The issue felt exacerbated in a virtual setting, as it can be very difficult to hold fluid class discussions/conversations when everyone needs to raise their hands in order to talk.",
                "Strengths: Excellent professors who obviously enjoyed the class discussions and had a wide knowledge of Shakespeare, a fast pace which allowed several plays to be covered, opportunity for every student to voice their opinions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The time which the lessons were at made it a bit difficult for international students, but obviously that couldn't be altered, and also personally the fact that the Yale Bookstore didn't deliver the necessary books to my country.",
                "Only weakness is that each individual class is too long. This might not be fixable due to the tight schedule of the summer term, but maybe consider having more classes throughout the week? As it is, Mondays we essentially have class from 1-6:30pm with 2 breaks in between, and it gets hard to stay engaged towards the end.",
                "You will become a better writer. You will learn to think more critically and you are given a lot of freedom in your topic selection for essays. The course could be improved by giving students more opportunities to respond to one another to allow for more in-depth conversations to happen."

                "Absolutely, but only if you are extremely motivated and willing to work, especially to write. This class was a lot a lot of work, but I also gained more from it than any other class Ive taken at Yale.",
                "If they like literature, or, more specifically, Shakespeare, then I would definitely recommend this class; however, the workload is difficult enough that it should deter students who would not normally have an interest in these fields. The way we analyze Shakespeare's plays, the class discussions, and the professor himself, are all wonderful reasons to take this course. You will be asked to really push yourself in the insights you have and the way you read.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as the skills it taught me were ones which aren't readily available at school. YSS courses are the best way to prepare for college and to ensure that this is the subject you want to major in. The professors provide interesting personal insight which allows students to understand the concepts even better, and also attempt to accommodate to every students' needs.",
                "Yes if you love to read and write, and youre ready to make this class a priority for the five weeks it runs.",
                "I would only recommend this course if you have the time and have an admiration for Shakespeare's writings and influences.",
                "I absolutely would. Mr. Brisman and Maria were wonderful instructors who were truly immersed in the texts alongside us. The class is without a doubt difficult but one of the most rewarding courses I've taken at Yale. If you're excited about Shakespeare  even if you don't have any background with his texts  then this will be one of the best seminars you'll take because of its fast pace and relevant content. Both instructors did such a great job of tying the material back to present-day problems and even casual life at Yale."
