                "Weaknesses: Essays should be spaced out more",
                "Strengths: Good, speedy feedback on papers. Most readings are interesting\r\nWeaknesses: Part of the final paper is a creative project based on your research paper, with a presentation. The project felt a little rushed and the reflection on it also felt a little unnecessary.",
                "Strengths: Pam is easily the biggest strength of this course. She's really interesting and obviously knows a lot about cities and writing. Also, the material is very interesting, hard to be bored.\r\nWeaknesses: The time frame on essays, from initial assignment to submission, can make it hard to put forth the best possible work. Also, classroom discussions sometimes felt less like seminars and more like lectures with some questions in between.",
                "Strength: Collaborative and conversational learning format in class\r\nWeakness: Essay timing spacing, first two essays felt semi-rushed while final essay had a good amount of time.\r\nStrength: Focus on cities and urbanism, interesting and relevant topic that focuses on world around us and Yale.\r\nCould improve: Potentially more immersion oppuritunities in New Haven. Grounding essay and research work in real life (more work like Essay 3 prompt).",

Conceptually, the first two papers (second more than first) are a little bit hard to grasp, but the research paper is nicely paced and there are a lot of workshops/exercises to help you through it.",
