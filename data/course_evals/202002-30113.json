    "could be less presenting and more lectures",
    "The readings and lectures were engaging. The final paper was really helpful in helping us think about what we learned in the course, apply this knowledge, and engage in policy research and evaluation. I preferred when Professor Harris lectured over the student presentations, but these presentations were helpful in preparing for the midterm and further understanding and analyzing the readings.",

    "Yes! Very important course topics and the final paper was a great academic experience.",
    "Yes! Professor Harris is amazing, the readings were very interesting and I loved the course."
