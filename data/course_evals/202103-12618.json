                "My senior essay was my first large undertaking in college of this size, so I learned the different methods of research needed for such a large project. I also learned to engage with a topic deeply for a while, which was very fruitful in my art historical thinking.",
                "This was the first project at this scale that I have ever tackled so every step of the process felt very new. It was the first time in the art history discipline were I chose my own topic and had to advocate for it independently.  Although there are things I would change now that I have completed my paper, in the future I will know how to better organize my time and condense my ideas into a pitch.",
                "I learned how to pursue archival research in a virtual format due to COVID. Also sharpened my critical analysis skills as I refined my thesis multiple times. Also learned how to summarize my research to non-art historians and present it publicly in an accessible manner."

                "The workshops are really useful. I would say that it might help to set a deadline by which advisors should return feedback on the first drafts, to ensure that there is enough time between receiving these comments and the final deadline to work through the improvements.",
                "I appreciated the sense of community that was felt through the workshops and the colloquium, and Prof. Jung contributed to the camaraderie we felt. However, I wish that our workshops were more productive in terms of the feedback we got, so that it was less surface level. I also wish that there was more of an acknowledgment that we are in the midst of a pandemic, since we would get extensions for deadlines and the mood was more lax in these workshops, but the final product was set in stone for a particular date with no leeway, and we were all not as adequately prepared. We had not even seen the rubric we were graded on.",
                "I believe there was very little support and structure around this project. Although there were clear guidelines in writing, I felt that there was little clear instruction on how to organize time, ask the right questions, and frankly how to tackle something at this scale without prior experience. I felt that the process was inaccessible in that it was less about learning and generating an idea and only for the product. This is supported by the inflexible deadlines especially during a time that is very challenging for everyone and deserves consideration.",
                "This course, more like a series of three workshops over the term, gathers senior art history majors and lets us learn about each other's thesis. In providing feedback for each other, I learned how to examine my own research from a different point of view. This course, especially with the facilitation of Professor Jung, helped cement the community within the art history major."
