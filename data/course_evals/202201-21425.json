                "I learned about major texts in the Western poetic tradition of the 1400s1600s. We read pieces of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Shakespeare's Sonnets along with the entirety of Milton's Paradise Lost. In terms of essay writing, I am not sure I learned anything particularly novel.",
                "As someone entirely unfamiliar with any non-modern (pre-18th century) literature, I learned a lot about how to read and interpret older texts. I read a lot of the \"classics\" that I had no prior experience to (Paradise Lost, Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare's sonnets) and helped understand them through our class discussions. My writing also definitely improved in this course, in large part due to the Prof Elias's feedback on each of our writing assignments.",

I found the material incredibly interesting, and the conversations that we had in class were very insightful and fun. I had never been very experienced in reading Old English, but reading Chaucer was a good challenge that I greatly enjoyed doing. All of the material we covered had incredible depth, and really helped me to develop my own writing skill."

                "Strengths: breadth and quantity of material covered (having a smaller amount of material to read allowed for more in-depth discussion of the texts), discussion-based (obviously, as a seminar, the discussion was integral to the class). Weaknesses: nothing of note.",
                "A strength of this course is the small size, excellent discussions, and relatively limited scope (centered on a few key texts, not too distracted with a bunch of little things). A weakness of the course is this same limited scope -- I know it's a \"foundational course\" for the English major, but the fact that the entirety of the central texts we read were written by old white men was a little frustrating (perhaps this is more a complaint of the genre than the class itself). I appreciated Prof Elias's efforts to incorporate newer, more diverse voices, including some modern day rap \/ spoken word adaptations of the Canterbury Tales and the sonnets by Terrance Hayes.",
                "This class was informative but the points where I was most engaged were the points where we shifted away from the older, white men that the class is centered around in favor of more modern and diverse works. I do appreciate the different ways that we discussed the representation present in Chaucer and Shakespeare. I think that made it more interesting.",
                "Strengths: very discussion based, encourages participation, provides adequate time to dive into readings (and also not too much time)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: makes sense for the course, but just important to note there's not as much focus on actual essay writing. essay feedback \/ drafting is not a core focus of the class",
                "In class discussion could be dry at times, also I feel like it would have been really helpful if we could show partial drafts to Professor Elias",
                "So much material crammed into such little time, I needed more time to be able to engage.",
                "Great course! Strengths: partner sharing at beginning, highs and lows shared in class, good leadership and discussion flow. Only specific flaw would be that not much use was made of the discussion posts in class -- would be interesting to maybe pick one or two that especially caught the professor's eye and then use them as a lead-in into class discussion.",
                "I liked the breadth of the course and the fact that we got to read difficult texts in Middle English with guided instruction in class. I liked the seminar style of the class, but it was hard to go through all of the readings in one setting.",
                "I thought the clear structure of the class was incredibly strong. The material we read was well spaced out and ambitious and allowed for good depth while also providing a lot of works. I wish we could have gone more into Canterbury Tales, however."

                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the early and\/or poetic texts of the Western literary tradition. If you are an English major, then you have to take at least 3 of the 125128 courses, and I think this is a good one. At first, I was taking this class because I was an English major, but, over the course of the semester, as I realized I could not complete the requirements of the English major and my other major, I found myself enjoying the class regardless.",
                "Yes. The course is very interesting, and it was a gentle but not boring introduction to classic poetry that can be a little difficult to read alone.",
                "yes, I would! I did not have prior exposure to middle and old English, and was intimidated by the prospect, but this class was a perfect introduction!",
                "It really depends on how interested the student is in pre1800s poetry. If they are, they should definitely take this class as it illuminates a lot about the poems and how to interpret them. If they arent, it can become a serious slog to get through. Regardless, it does teach the fundamental skills of reading and writing about poetry very well.",
                "Yes, I liked it",
                "Yes! Professor Elias is kind and gives great feedback. Even though this course is a soft requirement, it was a pleasure to take.",
                "Yes! The texts can be difficult at times but I do believe its worthwhile taking the course. I would have never read these texts outside of class and I am glad that I took the course.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to other students. The course was a great introduction into fields of literature that I had not been introduced to before. I found it incredibly interesting, and the conversations we had during class were very thought provoking."
