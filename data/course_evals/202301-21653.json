The material facilitated for learning was also very useful.",
                "I think that this course could be supplemented by having more clear connections to textbook material, as the material on the homeworks often felt disconnected from material taught in class. The grading seemed to be determined based off meeting specific wording discussed in class, and it was difficult to determine what expectations were there, as the only way to understand these expectations were through TF sessions. In the TF sessions, it felt like we needed to be told what topics to connect to the questions. Maybe the homework questions could be worded more specifically to indicate what topics to connect to."
