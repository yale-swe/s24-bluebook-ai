   "comments": [
    "Literary analysis, deeper appreciation for love",
    "I learned a lot about how love has evolved in literature! And read awesome books!",
    "I have not taken a literature course in a while at Yale, and felt FREN 227 with Professor Bloch proved to be a good reintroduction into the humanities. I think I re-harnessed capacities to make thematic connections and find motifs in ways I had not done in a few years. Additionally, by virtue of exploring such a huge range of literature across time, I feel I am walking away with strong conceptions of how love departed through the ages.",
    "I learned more about perspectives love from a wide range of authors and civilizations. In particular, I had never studied much medieval literature before.",
    "I definitely got a better understanding of how love has been portrayed throughout western (i.e. european) literature.",
    "Critical reading and presentation skills",
    "I read a good spread of literature from many different time periods, and I learned how to read them critically for learning and not just for enjoyment.",
    "I learned about different strains of thought regarding love in the western world, and especially how modern conceptions of love come from deep lineages.",
    "As Professor Bloch observed during the first class, paying for the dozen or so novels explored in this course will be much cheaper... than the therapy needed to cover love-life mistakes. \r\nHumor aside, if college provides moral education as well as intellectual education, this would be a valuable contribution to the former. Sure, almost never does a love story in the Western canon end \"happily ever after\" (e.g. Romeo and Juliet), but learning about all the different kinds of love and how cultural history has dealt with love provides valuable insight. Intellectually, the course acts as a in-depth series of close readings--in short, a literature course almost in the style of Directed Studies Literature. Love in the Western World, however, avoids a survey or introductory feel due to its intimate treatment of a single topic. Replete with Professor Bloch's illuminating insights, the course delightfully interweaves literary commentary and critique with meditation over a fundamental human passion (along with a few life lessons seminar-style.)",
    "I have learnt how to view and examine love in different lenses and was exposed to many different and beautiful texts ranging vast time periods. Learning from my classmates and Professor Bloch made for a very enthralling experience."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Excellent reading and discussions \r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
    "Great books. Prof. Bloch offered great insight. I wish the class had been slightly smaller.",
    "The course's strength is certainly its professor. I think Howard Bloch is absolutely brilliant, but does not unduly extend the same expectations for genius to his students. That is not to imply he does not push the class discussion, but he certainly makes students feel at ease when they choose to participate. Additionally, I enjoyed that, while ambitious, the course tackled work from as far back as Plato to as recently as Marcel Proust. Since the course dealt with sweeping, thematic changes in love across time, this kind of approach felt adequate. I struggle to think of weaknesses, but one could perhaps be that in one 2-hour meeting, it is tricky to tackle an entire novel. It could prove useful to have Professor Bloch preface each reading with a few notes as to where he would like to direct its discussion, just to serve as a guiding thread when looking for meaning while reading.",
    "Professor Bloch provides wonderful overviews of the work and commentary. The student presentations are also helpful for establishing shared themes and questions for the rest of the class. Some students hardly participated throughout the course of the semester.",
    "The course was only once a week so it didn't feel super engaging, but that it's the professor's fault. Since it is all discussion based, sometimes it felt like the conversation was lagging because not everyone did the reading OR, probably more likely, the class was full of seniors but was at 9:25am.",
    "Strengths - canon, Professor Bloch is very knowledgable, class is suited to seminar\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes Prof lectures more than students discuss",
    "Strength - good spread of literature from different eras\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - did not feel very engaged with the course, regardless of whether I had done the reading thoroughly or not bothered doing the reading at all. Seminars felt less like a discussion amongst peers and the prof and more like disparate comments on things that were common sense and didn't contribute much. This may have been due in part to a low level of engagement from the class as a whole; sometimes Prof Bloch would ask a question and no one would answer at all.",
    "This class had a wonderfully balanced reading list, with a relatively manageable workload each week and a clear trajectory on the syllabus. I also thought Professor Bloch had interesting historical and literary insight for most of the works we read. However, despite this class seeming like it was designed to be a seminar, it never really came close to productive group discussion. This was in large part due to the size of the class: it was impossible to form any kind of intimacy in a room with 25 other people. I also wish there was more connection between the different works we read, with more explicit emphasis on the development of key ideas that return in different time periods.",
    "Great selection of texts from different perspectives with unifying themes on love; companion course with texts from outside of the Western world would be cool",
    "The course invites a lively and engaging class discussion. The reading has been insightfully curated and represents a substantial introduction to the love tradition of the Western canon. The course presents a diversity of authors across time periods and perspectives on love within the parameters of the cultural West; moreover, the course selections interact in intriguing and multi-dimensional ways. It would be hard to imagine any possible improvement to this course.",
    "This course has provided a great opportunity to read great works of love in Western literature. The discussions were maneuvered and guided aptly by Professor Bloch, who prompts us with excellent questions and furthers discussion with insightful remarks."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! So much fun and Professor Bloch is so intelligent and has a good sense of humour.",
    "Yes! Great books taught by a great professor.",
    "Although I rarely finished all the readings, I feel like I still got a lot out of the course. I'd certainly recommend it to someone who enjoys the humanities, or even needs a Hu. requirement, precisely because this course does not seem to be geared towards the academic showmanship that usually accompanies literature courses at Yale. Additionally, this is a great course for anyone seeking to exposure to literature in the Western cannon and an understanding, even at the most basic levels, of different conceptions of love across time.",
    "yes, I would recommend this course though their might be other literature courses that are more engaging.",
    "Absolutely. The topic is really interesting and Prof. Bloch has a lot of good things to say. As is usual in a discussion-based class with a good professor, the best parts of the class are when the professor is monologuing. There's a good amount of that, and there are also student presentations so usually somebody knows what they're talking about. Assignments are two papers, one around five pages and one around ten. Roughly equal workload to most other humanities classes. I enjoyed learning about love  the best parts of the class were definitely the start and the end, because the Middle Ages can get a bit boring.",
    "Absolutely - Professor Bloch is a great professor for students that are new or experienced in the humanities. The books we read are insightful, and sometimes quite controversial (for example, gender roles in ancient Rome). Bloch does a good job handling this subject matter and encouraging students to reflect on it thoughtfully.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have a interest in the subject or if you really need to get a requirement out of the way. I was taking this class to satisfy a requirement for my major, so I wasn't particularly thrilled when I signed up, but it ended up being a lot less painful than I anticipated. In general, the conversation was interesting, The class is a good size for a seminar so usually there were people willing to talk. The workload is pretty solid you read one book a week and right one midterm paper that's around 8 pages and one final paper that's around 10 pages. Seriously no big deal. If you're a English or Literature person you've probably already read many of the books anyway. Either way, it was an alright course if you're forced to do it, which is saying a lot I think.",
    "Professor Bloch is one of the nicest teachers I've had. The material is super interesting (who doesn't like talking about love?) If you enjoy reading and writing this is a great seminar to take. One of my favorite classes at Yale. \r\n\r\nShop for classmates as well, seminar is only as fun\/enjoyable as the people in it. \r\n\r\nProf. Bloch is also very quirky so be prepared for that.",
    "It was OK. I don't have much experience with literature courses at Yale, so I was really excited to try it out when I first started - but I was disappointed by my choice by the end of the third week into class. It felt like it fulfilled all the stereotypes of DS.",
    "Professor Bloch is a wonderful scholar and a very nice human being, but he is not an amazing teacher. Each class period is divided between student presentations (which, without any kind of guidance from the professor, are often not very relevant or well thought out), Professor Bloch's lecturing (which I found to be full of historical insight but scant on literary insight), and \"discussion\" (which mostly involves students talking past each-other and rarely referencing one-another's comments.) This was not a super efficient way to organize the class, which really got in the way of the mostly wonderful books we read.",
    "This course is a great for anyone interested in the tradition of writings on (mostly romantic) love in the West throughout history. Interesting themes on love and how they have played out over time and still play out in people's lives today. The course offers a literary approach to thinking about love but themes are interesting to apply to life. As Prof. Bloch says, the course can be serve as a little bit of \"self-help\" at times",
    "Absolutely-- the course clearly establishes its expectations and topic. (Love proves an important focus for most of us). Professor Bloch offers brilliant literary insight in a traditional seminar style through close observations of the various texts. A well-curated selection, the reading can be beautiful and captivating, especially in the second half and especially if you like the fabric of language. The workload is utterly reasonable, so take the lessened amount of writing to do all the reading (and thus benefit from Professor Bloch's insights).\r\nOne way to regard the course is an engaging survey of French literature (broadly defined) which takes love its guiding principle. A note about \"the Western World\" part of the title: Professor Bloch recognizes other world traditions of love, and so has confined this course to his expertise. Within the Western canon, Professor Bloch makes a diverse selection (more diverse than Directed Studies, for instance), but this does remain just one of many love traditions.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. However, it is natural that some would like it more than others. A keen interest in reading literature on love and romantic relationships helps."
