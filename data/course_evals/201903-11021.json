    "I was able to learn more about Haiti and the history of how the country came to be. The course also taught me to be more skeptical of the information I am given and ask \"why?' to all the answers I heard. Additionally, I became a better writer and learned how to cite properly and write a research paper.",
    "I was able to learn and gain understanding of others by studying the country of Haiti in this course.",
    "History of Haiti",
    "I learned about writing and researching.",
    "Digging into and researching one subject in depth was a good experience.",
    "Leading how to write a college paper and knowledge about Haiti and the people there",
    "I learned about a new country and about a new culture.",
    "I learned a great deal about Haiti and a great deal about sustainability and developed an understanding of how much the two are related.",
    "Writing skills.",
    "I learned in this course how to improve my writing by expanding deeper in to topics while learning about the nation of Haiti. Along with this I improved my teamwork skills and during our presentations I improved my public speaking skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths: easy to navigate into whatever field you are interested in, research on your own to learn more of what you want too, lots of independence.",
    "I believe that the greatest strength of the course was the amount of topics covered and the depth that we were able to explore in our own research. However, as this was a writing credit, I do not believe that my writing skills improved at all. For future courses, I believe there should be a greater emphasis on writing skills and feedback should this continue to be a writing credit at all.",
    "Strengths: fabulous choice of readings--you learn a lot about Haitian history, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: feedback on writing is rarely helpful; class discussions are sometimes inconsequential",
    "Strengths are learning about Haiti when I might not get an opportunity to. Weaknesses is I dont think its amazing for students to lead the majority of the classes.",
    "More kids need to come to class.",
    "More structure needed",
    "The course is truly what each student makes of it. If a student wants to fully delve into the topic, the course allows them to learn an enormous amount. If a student is not fully interested in a topic, the course covers enough topics for there not to be an issue.",
    "Strengths include encouragement and freedom to find a subject of interest.\r\nWeaknesses may be the informality that can influence a very loose atmosphere, leading students to think that it is appropriate to skip class and\/or lack in-class participation.",
    "This was a great course that I would recommend to all first year students at Yale. One of the strengths I would say is it is challenging yet engaging. The topics that were researched in my opinion were very engaging and forced me to work hard in order to reach my goal."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, because this is a great class to have to start your first year at college. The class allows you to be individualistic but also makes you grow close to your classmates from group activities.",
    "If you are interested in learning about Haitian history, then this course will give you that knowledge. If you are looking for a really strong writing course, then you might be a bit disappointed. Feedback on written assignments is a bit confusing and misdirected. Nonetheless, Gordon is a caring professor who really wanted to help us learn.",
    "It was an easy-ish writing credit so I would recommend it to stem students who need a writing credit.\r\nI liked Gordon as a teacher, too. It was a low stress environment.",
    "Yes, very good class to take first semester",
    "Yes. I learned a lot but was not overwhelmed by the material. It was a good course",
    "This was a great first-year seminar. You get a chance to interact with a professor on a personal basis and you develop your writing skills.",
    "Yes. The instructor of this class wants you to excel and enjoy the class at the same time. You are given the freedom to experiment with a wide range of topics that interest you; all while learning and expanding your knowledge of the Haitian culture and history."
