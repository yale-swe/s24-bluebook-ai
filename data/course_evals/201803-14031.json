    "I think learning about a topic that is not often taught is incredibly enlightening. Coming in with minimal knowledge about the slave trade and with the only knowledge coming from the American perspective, this was a very great class. I learned about the diversity of cultures in Africa and was able to look at slavery in a completely new way.",

   "comments": [
    "Sadly, Professor Harms is a nice guy but let's a lot slip. He should enforce a no laptop policy and make students get a printed reading packet. Although much of the class was interesting, it was crazy to see people in a 6-person seminar on their laptops the entire time on Facebook. Eventually, I too became discouraged and joined them. I hope Professor Harms puts some kind of limit on technology in the future to inspire more interaction.",
    "It's a great 5th credit, amazing writing credit for non-history majors, pretty interesting readings if you wanna engage with them.",
    "The course does a good job of building a survey narrative that takes you through the different levels of detail of the slave trade in Africa. Some of the class discussions could be more engaging (such as having debates)."

    "I would recommend it only if you will engage with the readings and are genuinely interested. It was very clear one or two students were there for the content and the rest were there for the chill class. Not worth it to take a class at Yale only because it is chill.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a chill and interesting writing\/humanities credit. Professor Harms gives students freedom to write on any topic they like and is a nice grader.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone looking for a chill\/low stress seminar or writing credit."
