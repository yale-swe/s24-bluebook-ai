We learned all the most complex aspects of morphology, a huge quantity of vocabulary, and the rudiments of syntax, all in a very short span. Having taken this course simultaneously with another introductory language and an L3 course, I can confidently say that while the workload in Greek 110 is considerably higher than probably any other intro language course, the competency gains are proportional.",

            "comments": [
                "Since the pace is so astonishingly fast, no time was allowed either for deliberate completion of exercises or for review and consolidation days. To have slowed down and studied any one aspect more intently would have resulted in missing the next day's material, and so forth. Asynchronous days were in my view a weakness as well: in the the first half of the semester, I tolerated them because they were rigorously structured and made an effort to introduce new material; but in the latter half, that prior organization disappeared, and they became an excuse for not accomplishing anything at all one day a week. More--and crucially more varied--exercises could have been assigned: the asynchronous periods might have been used as an opportunity to solidify morphological material, as well as a time practice reading.\r\nI would also note in passing that standards of grading on quizzes were extremely erratic. Occasionally I was marked off fractions of points for accent errors, and sometimes the same error cost me whole answers.",
                "Overall I thought the course was strong. One improvement I would make is to make sure that everything in the textbook is actually spoken about in class. Sometimes it wasn't clear what knowledge from the book we were responsible for and what we weren't. This made studying for midterms and the final more stressful than it needed to be. Also, it was a little jarring having alternate classes taught by Max and Dr. Patterson.",
                "I found the structure of the classes being split up 50% TA, 50% professor to be confusing (as each had their own teaching and assessment style). This was exacerbated by the fact that the TA often would make mistakes during class (i.e telling us the wrong form) or explain things in a convoluted, confusing way, which was a bit stressful because learning a new language is extremely difficult to begin with",
                "Sometimes I felt that we were seeing a lot of content per week, but I also understand that to learn to read Greek in two semesters the pace of learning must be fast. I don't know if it exists, but I would like to have had an additional book with readings to practice more."

Prof. Patterson's historical linguistic approach workls very well, and even if it doesn't always seem the most deliberately paced or meticulous of courses, it does--as Prof. Patterson frequently promises--equip students with the tools necessary to confront much more complicated material in all classical dialects.",
