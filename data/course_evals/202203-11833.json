                "I've learned so much about finding different ways to interpret text. Looking at texts from the lens of genre and subjects as forms of media have really changed the way I approach reading and analyzing texts. I've also learned to read much faster than I did before and how to bring my own thoughts to the reading in a way that can synthesize something of substance for discussion.",
                "This course provides a collection of American literature samples, without trying to be a typical \"survey\" course, sacrificing all depth for breadth. Professor Peters' papers also give lots of opportunity to develop academic writing skills, while also leaving room for creativity without risking greatly imperiling your grade. A great environment for both deep reading and explorative thought.",
                "I practiced reading and writing! Difficult and important skills. I got to have generative conversations about great books with intelligent and excited peers.",
                "This course gave me an introduction to the American literary tradition. From the transcendentalists to Moby-Dick to the Harlem Renaissance to more contemporary American works, this class was almost a road trip across the many different kinds of American literature. By no means comprehensive, this class was a great way to start thinking about what American literature is and how the American identity and dream is reflected in literary works. This class gave me a strong foundation to continue my exploration of American literature and to be better understand the traditions on which contemporary American authors are building today.",
                "I learned how to not only write creatively but also read creatively. I also learned really valuable skills in discussion and analysis.",
                "I came into the course having read none of the texts, with the exception of a handful of Dickinson poems. My goal in taking this course was to learn more of the American cannon, if one can even say that. I can confidently say that I have achieved that goal---my only problem with the course is that there is so much more I need to read! I think I became a better reader, writer, and classmate in this class.",
                "Helped improve my writing, critical thinking, and speaking skills, broadened my cultural awareness, my ability to think critically in everyday life, my creativity, preparing for round-table discussions, and built strong relations with peers."

                "This course is extremely interesting, and Professor Peters is great. He gives good feedback on the essays and the seminars are very engaging. Sometimes the reading load can get tough, but that's just the nature of the English 127 classes.",
                "The biggest strength by far is Professor Peters. He is a kind and open man who leads fantastic class discussions. He also has a genuine interest in getting to know students, which is rare and wonderful. Another strength of the course was a field trip we took to Mystic, CT to see the world's oldest whaling ship. This field trip will be one of my favorite Yale memories.",
                "I really liked the syllabus for this course. Even Moby-Dick wasn't an awful moment during the semester. I would've loved if we had a bit longer to read not only Moby-Dick but all of the texts. I feel like we never got to spend adequate time with any one text which was unfortunate.",
                "Strengths-Selections of the readings, classroom community, essay feedback\r\nWeaknesses- Our class was not exactly the most diverse group of people.",
                "Strengths: Great reads! Every one of the books we read was worthwhile, even in the busy-ness of the school year. Prof. Peters' intellectual enthusiasm really helped energize the class. \r\nWeaknesses: I'm not exactly sure how to accomplish this, but I think we could've been a little more focused and grounded in the text during our discussions. I'm a fan of tangents but sometimes it felt like people were holding their point in mind and waiting for their turn instead of responding to things people said before them. It was mostly fine because people had good points to make, but it would've been nice to structure our discussions to work through one thing at a time. Otherwise, I think this class is extremely well-structured.",
                "One part of the class that was both a strength and a weakness was the somewhat freeform structure of our seminar discussions. Professor Peters definitely came to the class with ideas about elements of the texts that he wanted us to discuss, but the majority of the seminar was guided by the students and passages that we brought to class. In general, this free flowing format was generative of really fascinating conversation. On the other hand, discussions sometimes got off track, fell into a bit of a lull, and we sometimes drifted a bit far from the text or were all over the place. However, this was pretty rare. All in all, Professor Peters always shaped the classes in a meaningful way without being overbearing and telling us what to think which allowed for engaging and fun classes.",
                "I really loved the structure of class. We engaged in really natural, organic discussions. I also loved the selection of literature. I would have liked to spend more time on each book, however.",
                "The classroom environment was so wonderful and welcoming, and I loved my section of Engl 127. In general, having heard from friends in other sections, I do think there is some extreme disparity in quality of the class based on section.",
                "Many strengths -- great readings, discussions were organised, well-led, and let us come up with our own direction of conversation, fun writing assignments, good workload. \r\nWeaknesses -- Though I was really engaged in the curriculum, and loved all the texts we read, I would really like to read some more classic novels we only read Moby Dick. I get that there's just not that much time in one semester, but I would almost have preferred to not cover as much from each text in order to get more exposure. Moreover, I understand in this era, there is a push to read more diverse texts, and I don't want to detract from that. Rather, I would like to put the texts in conversation with each other. As someone experiencing American Literature for the first time, I would like to Twain or Hemmingway as well."

                "Yes! If you want to dive into some of the most important works of American Literature, take this class. The authors are great, and you cover so much on the syllabus without it seeming overwhelming.",
                "Take American lit with Professor Peters! This is a great class for both English majors and non-majors, and Professor Peters is very forgiving with deadlines. There's a lot of reading but it's extremely manageable if you plan ahead.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in reading more from the canon of American literature. It does a great job of exposing you to a variety of different texts and authors and ways of thinking. The reading could be a lot for some folks (myself included) so I would definitely keep that in mind when going in, but the abundance of poetry in this specific syllabus made that reading load as a whole much more manageable.",
                "This is both a fantastic writing and literature class for anyone on their way to be humanities or English major, or anyone with an interest in books and writing. A wonderful exploration into American, and human questions. Highly recommend.",
                "Take this class if you're ready to read! It is a decent amount of pages to get through, but all of the readings are definitely worthwhile, and JDP is so good at bringing the texts to life , not to mention that he is a brilliant mind and a very kind man. The class is a great way to digest some classic and important American texts, whether or not you've read them before. Great for a writing credit or for the AMST lit survey requirement.",
                "If you are an English major looking to complete the 127 requirement, I certainly recommend taking the class with Professor Peters. He gives you the space to experiment and push yourself in your writing without much pressure on grades and leads really fascinating and funny seminar discussions that build off the class' collective interests. He also makes great selections on the syllabus, so you will get the opportunity to read literature that is formative to the American tradition while also being a bit off the beaten path texts that aren't necessarily the most obvious choice but are vitally important nonetheless. We even did a week on American music because that was something we were all interested in.\r\n\r\nFor anyone at all interested in this class, I think you will find class with Professor Peters to be something to look forward to. Even at our 9am meeting time, he was able to foster a great class community, and I feel like I came out of the class with new friends. He creates an inviting seminar space for all, English major or no, as long as you are willing to engage with and be confused by the texts we read. He genuinely cares about his students and the work that is done in 127.",
                "Yes! This is a fantastic introduction to American literature and to the Yale english department more generally. I absolutely loved this class. JDP is a wonderful and supportive professor.",
                "I would highly recommend this course or any course taught by Professor Peters to another student. In this class, we read some great texts, but even when I didn't find them to my liking, I still felt like there was a purpose in my reading them. Peters was so thoughtful about the texts he chose; the only problem I can find is that we so often didn't have enough time to fully discuss them. Of course, this was not to his fault, especially since our readings were more than reasonable for each class. I think one other work could probably have been squeezed on to the syllabus. Or maybe another trip, like one to the YUAG, perhaps.",
                "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course, particularly with JDP. It's a great syllabus and well organized I like the three essays, the approximate new author covered every one or two weeks, the format of discussions."
