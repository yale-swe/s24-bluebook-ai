On the field trip, I learned to identify rocks and geologic features using a variety of field methods and infer how they were formed.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Great teaching staff who cared about the students a lot.  Alan brought a lot of energy (and too much coffee haha) to our 9 am classes and Lexie was just amazing--designing the whole course and teaching over half of the lectures and giving extensive feedback to us while doing her PhD.  I learned a lot and we covered all the major topics in geology, so I feel prepared as I go into upper-div courses.  For our final project, we got a lot of support along the way.  And of course the FIELD TRIP was one of the highlights of my time at Yale--it was so much fun and the class got so close.  TA's Sam, Gryphen, and Brian who joined were also great.  The Grand Canyon is beautiful and awe-inspiring and we're so lucky that the trip was fully funded by the EPS department (down to our airport meals).\r\nWeaknesses: The first half of the course felt like it moved really, really fast.  Granted, I did not take the recommended pre-req for this class and if I had, I probably wouldn't have felt this way.",
                "I thought the course was fun, interesting, and accessible. Both professor Rooney and Lexie did a great job of making lectures engaging and interactive. I think the course struggled a bit towards the beginning of the semester since the students were all coming from different places in terms of prior Earth Science knowledge, meaning the first few weeks of the semester were an easy review for some while simultaneously being confusing for others.\r\n\r\nI also thought the class had a few too many random, weekly homework assignments that felt unnecessary, at least to me. I think I would've liked to have seen fewer, larger assignments than been bogged down by a greater number of random, smaller ones.",
                "Strengths: There was clear communication of expectations and assignments throughout the semester. The class was well facilitated and questions were always encouraged. The field trip was incredible and really served to solidify what we had learned in class with real world examples. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload of the course was pretty backloaded with the biggest assignments due within the last couple weeks of class. The final project would have been less stressful if it was the culmination of a semester long project as opposed to it being done in a few weeks.",
                "EPS 210 did a great job of giving an overview of geology in an interesting and entertaining manner. Most classes were in a lecture form, but there were also fun and interesting activities sprinkled throughout. Something that would help is providing a little more supplemental material at the beginning of basic geology, as it would help students less experienced in geology catch up at the beginning. It would also be great if the class isn't as early in the day in the future.",
                "The course was very flexible and willing to adapt to the mixed backgrounds of the students. I found this to be a huge help as someone who had little experience with the subject. I think the course could have benefited from a more regular and clear assignment structure. We seemed to somewhat randomly do Psets and projects throughout the term.",
                "This class was a wonderful way to learn more about geologic processes and gain a better understanding of the natural landscapes around me. \r\n\r\nI felt like this class was heavy on busy-work. I know that this was the first time this class was taught, but it was kind of disorienting that the assignments changed a lot throughout the semester, deviating from what the syllabus had said originally. Some things just really felt like too much, like having to put together two separate group presentations during the last week of class. \r\n\r\nI appreciated getting to dig into the story of one national park through the final project. However, I felt like the assignment was so heavily structured (with specific word counts for like 6 specific sections, each with specific requirements, some of which didn't really seem to apply to certain parks) that I felt micromanaged. I would have preferred if it was more like a guideline for what to include and how to format it, with more free reign to dive into the topics related to your park that were most interesting to you (and relevant to the specific park).",
                "The course was a lot of work, with inconsistent due dates. For example, the syllabus said we would have weekly homework. While some weeks we had none, other weeks we would have 2 or 3 assignments, due on different days. This made due dates hard to keep track of. The 10 pm due dates were also difficult.\r\n\r\nThere was so much volume in the course, which was good! I appreciated being able to learn as much as I did. I do wish we had spent more time practicing the skills in the homework in class. although the background we learned in class was also very useful. Maybe an optional discussion section would be nice? Office hours are great but I would have benefitted from an additional structured lesson.",
                "Strength - the field trip was instrumental in developing my practical application of what we learned in class, and it helped build community with other students in the class. The small class size and TFs made it so that everyone could participate.\r\n\r\nWeakness - there was very little discussion about the history of the national parks themselves, the science that is currently happening in parks, and how they engage with people in the present day. I would have liked to spend more time talking about national parks."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to any student with interest in geology and a willingness to learn. The class gives an understanding of how the geography of the entire United States formed. Every region was covered in detail, and it touched on just about every state. I feel I have gained so much from learning this. You'll also learn basic geology if you don't know it already, which I also feel I have gained a lot from learning.",
                "Yes! i would recommend this course to anyone who is genuinely and truly interested int eh science of the earth. This is not a simple social studies class, it is truly a science credit and requires attentions span and memory. The class is more about geology than it is about national parks, be prepared for that.",
                "Yes! Alan and Lexie both gave very engaging lectures and assigned meaningful work that allowed us to fully synthesize class material. They also did an incredible job managing the logistics of the Grand Canyon field trip, which was a highlight not only for the class, but also for the entirety of my time at Yale. Please take this class if you're interested in earth science, natural parks, conservation, and the environment.",
                "Yes, I really enjoyed this course. I took the course without much prior knowledge (I'd taken History of Life, but not anything about geologic processes), and I found it to be pretty accessible. I would also note that I did not go on the field trip but was still able to enjoy the class.",
                "Yes, it was not only informative but very fun.",
                "YES!! This is one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. The community of the class, the material, the opportunities outside of class, and the engaging professor all make it so worth it. Take Dynamic Earth first."
