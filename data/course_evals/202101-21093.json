Pak Indriyo is truly a great language teacher; he's incredibly patient and so willingly to share with students about how to improve their language skills. Plus, there are few courses on Southeast Asia at Yale and taking Indonesian is one of the few consistent ways to learn more about the region. I only wish I had started taken the language sooner. There are many fun activities Pak Indriyo has for the students and overall this class is a language-learning blast!",
