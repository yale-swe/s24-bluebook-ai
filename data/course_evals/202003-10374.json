His seminars are never boring - he really knows how to keep the pace going and he tells jokes and gives very fun historical anecdotes.",
                "The class material was really interesting. The readings are a bit much, but they are manageable if you focus on the more important readings and skimming the rest. Prof G provided a lot of supplementary information that was really interesting and put the class in context.",
                "Prof G kep the class very engaging. The readings were a bit boring, but I'm not a history major so that might be why. The prof went over all the important facts during class anyways.",
                "Strengths: Professor Gitlin's style and enthusiasm, covering content that is not covered in many classes, learning how to write",
                "Strengths- Prof. Jay Gitlin is amazing, the format is engaging, readings are very interesting, and discussions always lively.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- with so few assignments, it may be hard to know where your grade stands in the course, but a discussion with Prof. G will let you know where you are at",
                "I loved this course, but I think the one area that can be improved is with the zoom seminars. It would have been better if it were in-person, but I understand given the circumstances."
