The profs did an excellent job integrating grammar and culture and expertly balanced teaching the written language and practicing with us the spoken language.",

                "This summer course greatly improved my level of Italian and deepened my knowledge of grammar and vocabulary in the language specifically. While living in Italy, the course helped supplement the cultural immersion experience by teaching technicalities of grammar and vocabulary which host families and various other experiences could not. 3 hours a day of full immersion in Italian really propels you to fluency.",
                "Review of most grammatical concepts from L1 and L2 in higher levels of detail. Additional understanding of dialects, cultural notes, and other aspects of Italian life. A good amount of practice with the language.",
                "From this course, I improved my Italian skills immensely, especially listening comprehension and writing. All grammar skills from the previous levels were deepened.",

            "comments": [
                "This course is great but it is incredibly exhausting. We have a lot of work and the heat of the summer is too much. It would be ideal to move class to an air conditioned building because of how difficult it is to focus in the heat.",
                "Strengths: the obvious core strength of the summer ITAL 130/140 is the fact that you are in Siena.  The boundary between \"class\" and \"outside\" learning is ambiguous.  In Siena there is not much English, so on a daily basis you will be using the grammar and vocabulary taught in class.  It is an unforgettable experience and if you are serious about learning Italian you will love it.  Our class was extremely tight-knit, and the professors are so good at teaching and inspiring excitement that we the students even spoke to each other at times in Italian!  The grammar was very well explained and most of the \"cultural\" portions of the lecture (usually watching interviews, reading articles, listening to italian songs) were very relevant to our understanding of the language.  Deborah and Giacomo are both fantastic profs and very funny.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  hard to really think of any.  I do think it is unnecessary to have a final exam weighted a lot more than the other exams when it isn't cumulative.  The final word in our understanding of Italian should not be mastery of the esoteric chapter 10 vocabulary and \"periodo ipotetico\", especially when the topics on the first 4 exams are more useful in day to day speech.  Language learning is a cumulative endeavor, so the final should be cumulative anyway.  While the host families are selected to be welcoming, friendly environments, do not expect the same treatment from a lot of the other people in Siena.  They are particular about their way of life and generally have mixed opinions on Americans.",
                "The class is great! It encourages conversation la daily and allows students to learn the grammar quickly and efficiently.",
                "good",
                "Deborah taught the content really well and there was lots of time to just talk about current issues which made the language applicable.",
                "Everything was great",
                "The strengths are plentiful; the instructors really care about your input and help shape the course accordingly. Moreover, the fact that everything is conducted in Italian really makes a difference in terms of reaching fluency. Feedback received is very clear and although the textbook is expensive, it is thoroughly used throughout. The workload is very manageable and fair within the context of the summer experience. The grading is the right amount of harsh overall to push you to succeed. At times, however, there would be an exam and a composition around the same time after having had a required weekend trip. Furthermore, due to the intensive nature of the course, you must be prepared to get taught a complex facet of grammar the day before an exam or look over it in advance. I believe this is part of deal when you do a summer course like this, but sometimes the syllabus can put complex content close to the exam. Nevertheless, if you ask the professors they are more than welcome to make accommodations. Overall, this course is very intense and one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths: content is presented in an absolutely digestible fashion, students do feel significantly improved by the end of the semester, constant interaction with/in Italian makes learning the language significantly easier.\r\nWeaknesses: the three hour in-class time can significantly start to drag, especially by the final hour, the material being mostly review and practice can make excitement for the lesson lower than usual.",
                "The grammar is explained well and the professors answer all questions thoroughly. I appreciate how strict the professors are with keeping the only Italian-speaking classroom environment, as it leads to quick improvement. I think that the culture sections of the language class sometimes analyzed videos that were too complex for our level. Occasionally I believed that the grading for exams was harsh.",
                "I believe that the strengths of the course included the kindness and willingness of the instructors to explain material that was not super clear. I think it also helped that the syllabus and instructors recommended that students read the material to be discussed in the following class the night before. It allowed for any confusions to be cleared up easier. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, there was not much. I do feel as if not enough time was spent some days on the more challenging grammar sections before switching over to the culture portion of the class."

                "Regardless of your motives, from needing a language credit to pursuing the Italian major, this course is incredible. If you're not a seasoned student of languages you may find it challenging, but not unmanageable. The detail of language study delved into gives you an amazing understanding of Italian.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, simply because the program it is contained within is one of the most well-organized Yale summer session programs. The four total credits of Italian are lovely, allowing for significantly more freedom in courses going forward.",

                "Yes. I truly believe that this class helped improve my Italian. While some of it was a slight recap of what was taught in ITAL 110/120, the brief relearning of the material helped solidify the basic foundations of the language before we began the more complex structuring of the language.",

I'm very interested in Italian literature such as Boccaccio and Dante. His class really helped me converse in Italian to discuss these interests and read the texts in their original forms.",

Learning any language is valuable, and I think my understanding of Italian provides a good foundation for learning other romance languages as well. I also think an important component of this course is that it takes place in Italy, which has introduced me to a new culture, and I am very grateful to have had the experience."
