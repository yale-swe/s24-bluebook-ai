                "I greatly improved my writing skills, and gained significant knowledge of the death penalty, the Supreme Court, and the legal system in general. Professor Caplan is amazing and really brings the best out of you with tough but constructive feedback.",
                "Massive amounts of information on the American death penalty, worked on paper structure and argumentation, historical analysis and synthesis",
                "I learned how to read complex readings such as court opinions, and how to write in more coherent and reader-friendly ways.",
                "I learned how to read and analyze U.S. Supreme Court opinions and how to write thoughtful research papers. My writing and critical reading skills improved vastly.",
                "I left the course with a broad and deep understanding of capital punishment in America---its origins, history, and existence in the present. I also gained experience reading difficult legal texts and Supreme Court opinions.",
                "How to form political opinions and defend them well, not with more opinions but with carefully crafted arguments founded on facts.",
                "This class taught me about a whole host of topics revolving around the death penalty specifically but America's criminal justice system and approach towards punishment more generally. The death penalty intersects with so many other issues: racism, sexism, sexual violence, politics, \"law and order\" as a political tool, prosecutorial discretion, discrimination, poverty, and so, so much more that is important in America today. The course gives you insight into all these things. It also gives you immersive, extensive knowledge on the many facets of the death penalty (a year ago I never would have expected to care about or even know anything about different drugs used in lethal injections but our class discussing that topic was one of my favorites of the semester). I think that captures what is so important about this class and so valuable: understanding how important these small topics and issues are, and broadening them out to understand their greater significance. My writing also improved significantly; this class is not a writing credit but it really hones your writing."

            "comments": [
                "The readings were extremely captivating, the feedback on our essays was quite helpful, the class discussions were lively, and Professor Caplan's insights were fascinating. This has been my favorite course at Yale by far, and I think there is little room for improvement.",
                "The course had a high workload which at time became unmanageable. There were times when I couldn't do all of the readings and was unsure which were most important. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated the proposal, draft, revision structure of the written assignments for the course. It helped me stay on track and develop my ideas without getting overwhelmed by deadlines.",
                "Strengths of the course are how it helps you understand an extremely complicated topic in a way that makes it challenging yet digestible. Also the course builds a good environment in class for good conversations about readings. No real weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Professor Caplan is a wonderful professor who is dedicated to his students and the quality of the content of the course. Some of the readings were very recent and they were all fascinating. Professor Caplan also assigns \"lead readers\" who know that they *have* to do all the reading to lead the discussion making the heavy reading load easier to manage. Professor Caplan is also so knowledgeable about the death penalty and the Supreme Court in general that he could answer almost every question someone asked in class.\r\nWeaknesses: The students in the class were so much fun and had great personalities, which shone through when we had to work in teams for a class debate that happened during the last class. However, before that we never got a chance to talk. Even though this was a seminar, we stuck strictly to the questions Professor Caplan asked so the class did not facilitate a way for us to get to know each other.",
                "Classes could be more engaging as Professor Caplan speaks for an average of 75% of the time. Everything he shares is worth listening to, but there were certain classes where I felt like the seminar style was transitioning to more a lecture."

                "If you are interested in capital punishment\/criminal justice, and willing to do a lot of reading then yes.",
                "Yes- the readings can be dense and the essays require a lot of thought, but the workload is totally worth it as this course is so interesting. I came into this course with a passion for constitutional law, and totally think that I could base my career off of the death penalty after taking this course. It was that profound. Must, must take, even if you aren't too interested in law.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, but would warn them that certain fundamentals of law go largely unexplained. You have to either already understand these concepts or teach them to yourself. I had background knowledge of the law which was a massive advantage in this course and made it extremely enjoyable and fruitful for me.",
                "Yes. This course is a phenomenal way to learn about the death penalty but also broader workings of the legal system. The professor is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to facilitating discussions.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in the law, the Supreme Court, or any aspect of the death penalty, this class is for you.",
                "If and only if you are interested in learning about the death penalty, take this seminar. The level of engagement and interest you enter the course with will largely dictate your experience. Personally, I was deeply interested in the content of the course to start, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning and growing with the material. However, my interest did not deepen as a result of taking this seminar, if that makes sense. In summary, you get out what you put in. I've never felt that more deeply than with this course.",
                "I would definitely, 100% recommend this course to another student. I learned so much, and loved every class discussion-- Professor Caplan is such a brilliant instructor to learn from, and has so much expertise on this topic (and the criminal\/legal\/political systems of America more broadly). He leads great discussions with super interesting questions, and the discussions are elevated by the appointment of some key\/lead readers for every class to guide the discussion and analyze the readings; Professor Caplan truly pushes students to fully understand every aspect of a problem but allows us the space to make up our own minds on such a complicated topic, which I also appreciated. The readings are super interesting, and a good mix of different types of sources\/texts: journalism\/profiles published in newspapers, legal texts\/court decisions, scientific articles, philosophical musings, autobiographies by inmates or public defendants, and even more. The diversity of readings made the class even more enjoyable. Also, I loved the opportunity to zoom in and study my home state for all 3 papers (which definitely were improved by the requirement to submit a draft first-- writing a draft might feel tedious at times but will make your final so much better). Learning about one state specifically while analyzing the death penalty on a national level in the class discussions alerted me to some interesting and important parallels. This class is great; Professor Caplan is so smart and kind and a great leader, and the discussions are really rewarding. I highly recommend."
