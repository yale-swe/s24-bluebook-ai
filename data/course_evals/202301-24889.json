                "I learned how the history of the Korean peninsula impacts the way the two nations stand today, from Japanese occupation to the Cold War. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the wide range that learning history encapsulates as our readings varied from traditional history papers to papers about art/film/media.",
                "This course was an engaging and comprehensive view of modern Korean history. Analyzing narratives from multiple academic perspectives, this course taught me to look at historical events from multiple different angles and to broaden my understanding of historical thinking.",
                "I learned more about how an exhibit is created. I also learned a lot more about the history of Korea and how it fits in with that of the World. I also learned more about the resources of the Beinecke.",
                "I felt like a gained a much deeper understanding of Korean History. It was a really nice mix of grand strategy but also intellectual and cultural history.",
                "I learned how to write and analyze historical texts and primary sources. Discussions with the class helped me better contextualize and understand a vast history of colonialism and its effects on Korea.",
                "Knowledge and analysis of Korean history both in North and South Korea, and how Korea developed its identity after colonization and during the Cold War",
                "I went from zero to 99 on virtually all things Korea. I learned so much about the relationships between the Koreas and their evolution over the 20th century.",

                "This course was designed extremely well, with each week covering consecutive moments in Korean history and covering interesting topics. I also liked how some of the classes took place in the YUAG or in the Beinecke. Before taking this course, I had never been to either of those, so I appreciated the chance to do so through this course and see Korean history before my own eyes.",
                "This course had awesome readings that each offered unique insights into the topic we were covering. I thought that the class discussions were structured appropriately to have a good mixture of lecture-style presentations and seminar discussions, and I felt like I came out of the course with new perspectives from both the readings and my peers.",
                "This course was great. I think that it could be improved in the timing of assignments because there is a lot of work to do near the end of the course.",
                "The course was really well organized and strong. The content was engaging and interesting.",
                "This is probably the best class I have taken at Yale. Strengths are Prof. Perez, who cares about each of us deeply and worked to foster a class environment that was open to discuss, and the diversity of learning opportunities (YUAG visit, Beinecke visit, etc) employed in the course. The only weakness I can think of is that it took a while to get feedback on the response papers.",
                "Strengths: Discussions were well developed and I learned a lot both in and out of class.",
                "The readings were too long to do without a more significant incentive like reading quizzes.",
                "I love the emphasis on culture in the course, it really makes it unique.  The hands-on experiences at the Beinecke and YUAG were also pluses.  Sometimes discussion was a little too professor led, but most of the time the lecture class was enjoyable and informative.",

                "Absolutely. I took this course because I'm Korean and have always wanted to learn more about my family's history, and this course exceeded my expectations. Every seminar was a well-structured, productive, and civil discussion, and the readings were all extremely interesting and purposeful to the overarching lessons of the course.",
                "Yes! This is an awesome course for anyone interested in Asian-Pacific history, Korean studies, or is generally interested in taking a good history seminar. This class had a good mixture of students majoring in History and other disciplines, and I think that that contributed to the good class dynamic.",
                "Yes, if you have any interest in Korea take this course.",
                "Absolutely recommend! Please please take this class if you're interested at all in Korean history or in just learning about a new country.",
                "Yes, there was a lot to learn about Korea beyond the history that is taught conventionally; the class opens discussions for how a country develops its identity and how culture is defined in a country that attempts to decolonize.",
                "Yes. I am now confidently knowledgeable about an important subject of which I knew nothing 4 months ago,",
                "If you are interested in Korean history, especially from a more casual or cultural perspective, this course is for you.  This course does not necessarily go into all of the nuts and bolts of the timeline, so if you want the most out of the course, having some background knowledge about Korea would be very useful, but is by no means required.",
                "Absolutely! This class opened up different avenues of research in Korean history as well as its modernity. The course was fun and the discussions were interesting, especially when Professor Perez showed different art media (videos, maps, images, etc.) related to the weekly readings.",
