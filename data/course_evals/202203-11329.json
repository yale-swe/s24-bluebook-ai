The concept of a Group, mappings between and classifications of groups, direct and semidirect products, applications and interesting connections with problems in number theory and cryptography, and at the end of the semester a short introduction to Rings and Ring Theory. The content is essentially the first five chapters of Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra textbook, and then some of the 7th chapter.",

There was so much content that I had to be much more organized than in the past. This was also the first MATH class I depended on the textbook.",

                "Miki is a very good lecturer, and she is super involved with every student to show how much she cares for everyone's progress. Only thing I can think of that might improve the course is if lecture notes were posted, since the classes were not recorded this semester.",
                "The biggest strength was definitely Miki. She's a fantastic lecturer and cares so much about her students. There were also plenty of ULA and office hours, making it easy to learn if you put in the time and work. The textbook was also really good (despite being quite dense) and I liked how closely it was followed throughout the course. \r\nThe two biggest weaknesses were the workload and the lack of lecture notes/recordings. The content builds on itself quickly, so it was easy to fall behind. Even missing just a few lectures could catch up to you very quickly; it would've been nice to have access to some kind of notes or recordings. The same was true for the workload; if there was even a single week when I had a lot of work from my other classes, it felt nearly impossible to catch back up again.",
                "Strengths: forces you to learn as you go, forces you to actually understand what you're doing to do well\r\nWeaknesses: more time could be spent on either groups or rings--rings feel kind of rushed at the end",
                "Strengths - the teaching is truly fantastic. Miki does an amazing job. The only weakness is the workload. Perhaps it's just a function of teaching the material well, but this is easily the course I've spent the most time on by far.",
                "Miki is really cool",
                "Strengths: Miki is one of the best and most caring professors Ive had at Yale. Seriously, shes amazing, and she does so much for students. Shes also amazing about accessibility. Also, the course content is so fascinating and rewarding to learn. On the other hand, I often ended up having too much work for the week. This class is a serious time commitment! I honestly cant think of other weaknesses besides that, though.",
                "The greatest strength of this course is Miki. She is a fantastic teacher. It's backed also by a robust text, Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra, but this is also in some ways a weakness, as it is terribly dense. The workload is perhaps too high, demanding many, many hours of intense study and collaboration every week, or the risk of falling behind. Offering TA sessions that are specifically designed for solving problems, walking students through problem-solving techniques, and offering general tips and structured tutorials on how to approach these kinds of proofs - that would be a great improvement. Assigning few problems on the homework, that would also be an improvement. I'm aware that this semester had a reduced homework load in comparison with prior semester, but I would argue that even so it is simply too much.",
                "Miki's lectures were amazing. Probably one of the best lecturers of all STEM classes at Yale. Problem sets were very challenging, but also very conducive to learning. Miki uses the pre-lecture components to introduce concepts, which allows us to review and learn new more complex things in class. I think it's an amazing strategy. Miki is also a really quick responder, and gives really good feedback on work. Not too much to improve.",
                "The course is extremely well designed to facilitate student learning. Ample office hours/ULAs during the week and material is well explained during lecture. Homeworks were very long but worth it most of the time. One thing that would be helpful is more access to examples/computational practice problems. The exams consisted almost entirely of these kinds of questions but we didnt have many avenues to practice them.",
                "Strength: Miki. She is an incredible lecturer and the reason the course is manageable at all. The way she sets up the lectures and PSETS and everything in between is very concise and conducive to learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Heavy workload. Expect to spend a lot of time on not only PSETS, but also understanding the material.",
                "Extremely good course. Miki really shows what teaching is like. However do expect it to be hard.",
                "I liked the structure of the course; it felt very organized and I had a clear sense of what was happening. \r\n\r\nI think the Psets were too hard. I put a ton of time into working on them and going to office hours, but it often felt like it was impossible for me to figure them out on my own, and when I did it often took me 5ish hours to work through a single problem by myself. With less/easier problems/problems covering less materials I would have been able to work through more of them by myself instead of feeling pressure to get the answers from office hours. I also would have been able to focus on writing style in the proofs, which was hard to do when the actual writing process felt very rushed to me.",
                "This class is pretty much all strengths... It's hard to find a prof that a) is a true expert in their field and b) cares to practice and improve upon their pedagogy. The class is obviously a grind (I spend 8-12 hours a week on hw and there are pre-classes) and I lost motivation after not doing great in the first two midterms but never have I ever regretted taking this class. I think I have learned so much and matured as a mathematician.",
                "Miki's lectures are well structured, and you definitely learn a lot, but she also requires you to do preclass quizzes and go to OHs to earn study points, which could be a bit annoying at times.",
                "This course covers a huge amount of materials and covers them deeply as well. I feel that I have gained a solid understanding of all the topics we've studied, and moreover that I won't forget them anytime soon due to the rigor and depth with which we explored each concept. I would say the only weakness of this class is that it's very difficult. I easily spent 10-15 hours a week on psets and pre-class quizzes, which is quite a lot for one class.",
                "I loved how Miki gave us quizes, tests, p-sets, in class groups, etc. There was such a variety. It was a lot (A LOT) of work, but there is so much content it all felt necessary to our understanding and none of it felt like 'busy work'! ULAs were incredible. Miki's teaching style was great in all ways -- clear, nice handwriting, asking questions, groupwork, etc. (only improvement was that it was a little fast through each proof step! But i think that can't be helped given the amount of content)",
                "The course is very well organized and the expectations are clear. The course was recently edited to include less material, but with greater depth. I found this to be a welcome change; the pacing of the course, while fast, did not seem too unreasonable. The workload of the course is quite intense, and I did sometimes feel that less homework would not have had a negative impact on my understanding.",
                "This class was strong across the board. Lectures are exceptional and designed interactively to ensure students are understanding the material. Problem sets are difficult but are very good practice and never tedious. Problem sets very effectively prepare you for the exams, and expectations for both are always very clear. The class is a lot of work, but all of it is helpful and it will never feel unnecessary or dull."

                "Yes, but only if you have a lot of time to dedicate to the class. The content is beautiful and super interesting, but it is a serious commitment to do well in the class. I wish I had more time this semester to spend fully engaging with the content. Do not underestimate the workload; it'll catch up to you quickly and it's unfortunately easy to fall behind as everything builds on itself.",
                "YES. Sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's frustrating, and it's almost always a lot of work, but it's a great way to dive more deeply into proof-based math. I always felt like I was learning something.",
                "Do it, but just know that it is a commitment. Even if you think you're good at math, this class will surely make you struggle at some points. Grading is quite lenient, but doing the homework well is not necessarily easy",
                "Yes as long as the student is really committed to math. This course was very challenging to me but I found it rewarding - not so much because I discovered some sort of love/passion for algebra but more because the class really pushed me and I think I came out of it smarter and a more capable problem solver",
                "If you're a pure math major, then you should definitely take abstract algebra as it is a fundamental course that opens doors to more advanced math classes.",
                "Yes, and very enthusiastically so, but only if theyre taking at most 4.5 credits and no other extremely work-intensive classes. This class is a lot of work, but its all worth it. The material is super interesting and rewarding to learn. Moreover, you should take any course Miki teaches. Shes phenomenal and cares so much about students and accessibility.",
                "If Miki is teaching this course, that is sufficient for me to recommend it. Just so that a student can see what a truly excellent math lecture can look like. If you're a math major, definitely. If you're prepared to really go to office hours, go to TA hours, start early, read the textbook, all of that, then definitely. But know that it will be hard, it will take a lot of time, and you will only have a satisfying experience if you put in the work and start the assignments early and work on them each day. Otherwise it will be stressful and not so fun (except for the lectures - those will still be fun).",
                "Yes, 100%. I could not recommend this course any more to a prospective math major. The math is very beautiful, but be ready to put in the work (and definitely do go to office hours!).",
                "Must take for any math major and would highly recommend to CS/Physics majors with an interest in theory.",
                "If you are a math or math adjacent major willing to put in the work, then absolutely. You will learn a LOT and really develop mathematical skills and Miki is a great professor to have. Just make sure the rest of your schedule is manageable.",
                "Absolutely yes, especially with Miki",
                "Yes, especially if Miki is teaching it.",
                "I would recommend this course; but don't take it in a semester where you have a lot of other commitments or difficult classes.",
                "Yes, absolutely. If you're looking to learn group theory, you WILL learn group theory. It's that simple. This course is pretty time intensive and forces you to develop good habits. Even with extensive help from other students, I often spent all my free time from Tuesday noon till Wednesday midnight finishing this PSET. \r\n\r\nIf you're planning on doing this class, take good notes. Group theory has many small tidbits of information that can be easy to forget, so write things down whenever a trick is used in class. You'll know when you should. E.g a very simple one is that phi(n) = n - 1 for n prime. Take this fact, underline it, and circle it in your notes. Later on when you're making exam cheat sheets, it'll come in handy.",
                "If Miki is teaching it, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who liked linear/analysis and who are willing to do some abstract (but cool) math!",
                "Yes, definitely if you are a math major, and probably very helpful for physics and stuff.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you are a math major (or math related major) and are willing to spend a lot of time and effort on homework, and if you have taken several proof-based classes already and feel comfortable with that. It is a challenging course, so probably a good idea to take it during an easier semester if possible.",
                "The teaching, as well as the subject matter itself, make this course amazing for anyone thinking they might be interested in the topic. Both Miki and the TFs make themselves very available and are very helpful with questions anyone has, and the content itself is explained beautifully in class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in math. Having the opportunity to take this class with Miki was amazing and I would call it a must take class if she is teaching it again.",
                "YES! It was really next-level, and extremely fun and challenging. It's tough but I would recommend it if you're even curious about advanced math.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if Miki is teaching it. The course material, while being quite difficult, is ultimately really fun and interesting to work with. For the most part, the proofs in the homework and in class felt relevant and interesting, requiring creative applications of the course material.",
                "If Miki is teaching, absolutely. If you are sufficiently interested in math to be considering this course, probably. It is the most interesting and exciting math class I have ever taken, and it was exceptionally taught despite also being the most difficult."
