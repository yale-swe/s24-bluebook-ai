                "Developed basic artistic techniques (mainly w/ charcoal and graphite) such as figure drawing, shading, proportion, creating texture, lighting, etc. Learned how to think critically when developing my own art pieces as well as viewing other's work. Was encouraged to be creative and experiment with my art to reflect ideas and concepts.",
                "- This class helped me build upon my foundational drawing skills\r\n- Taught basic fundamental drawing stuff like the importance of line, shape, value, etc. \r\n- There's an emphasize on drawing from life for much of the first half of the class, we drew from still lives and eventually live models. Through that, we experimented with different things like reductive drawing, blind contour, etc. \r\n- Eventually we gradually did different mini \"units\" building upon our drawing skills, in our section, we learned drypoint printmaking, and did a charcoal transfer for a unit on photorealism. \r\n- My favorite aspect of the class was the fact that we did a lot of work in class that was focused on technical skills, but for our projects and assignments we were encouraged to think conceptually and use the technical skills we learned along with experimentation to translate our conceptual ideas into physical work. Going in, I was afraid that the class might be too heavily based on training technical skills, but the fact that we were encouraged to explore conceptual idea in our projects I think really enriched the experience and made the class more interesting. I think we were less taught specific techniques of how to translate conceptual ideas to artworks, and instead we sort of learned through doing and we were given a space where we were encouraged to do that and throw ideas around. We had each other as well as Meleko and our Teaching Fellow Natia to get input from and pass ideas through. And I think once we started having crits, we also got a lot of inspiration from seeing our peers' works.\r\n- As my first time experience art crits in a college setting, I found the crit sessions quite valuable. We were taught how to analyze artworks, and were encouraged to focus more on deriving conceptual ideas from the artworks and analyzing technical aspects and not on wether or not we liked a work or wether or not the work was \"good\" which I appreciated. And I think through that I really learned how to develop my artworks and make them stronger. And I think as part of the crit experience and sharing my ideas for the final, I also learned more about how to present my artworks verbally as well as learning to consider the actual physical presentation of my artwork.\r\n- My other favorite thing that we did was that during one class, our section did a studio tour of MFA students at the School of Art, and that was extremely inspiring getting to see working artists and seeing how they made their work and how they manifested their ideas into artworks. \r\n- Meleko and Natia were always insightful, and you can tell that they're both experienced artists, so it was always nice to have their insight and knowledge.",
                "I learned how to draw from llife, basic artistic principles when drawing such as lights, shadows and overall composition, and I learned how to form abstract ideas through a variety of art styles ranging from realism to surrealism to hyperrealism.",

Despite it being a large class, Meleko and Tia gave each student attention and feedback and I almost always felt like I was getting enough feedback. The class was also great at introducing specialized language for how to talk about art/critique art and then had us use that language in class and in writing. I felt a good balance of challenge and comfort in the class.",
                "I really enjoyed how this course was structured. A strength was how closely the professor and TA worked with us and the small size of the class. I would suggest the way to improve it would be to post our grades throughout the semester for us to know where we stand.",
                "engaging classes but a lot of work.",
                "great hands on learning",
                "More teaching of different drawing styles",
                "This version of the course taught by Professor Mokgosi was mainly based on practice in class and large projects outside that you had a lot of creative freedom with. Thus, it might not be as structed as some might like or as focused on individual components of the basic of drawing. On the other hand, the creative freedom you're given allows for you to really explore what you enjoy with art and be experimental.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Taught foundational drawing skills\r\n- Meleko and Natia (our TF) were very knowledgeable. They are both working artists and you can definitely tell, their insight and experience were quite valuable. They had clear knowledge of the subject matter being taught, they gave good feedback, and I like the assignments and units that we did. And I think having a teaching fellow like Natia, who was an MFA student, was really great and gave insight into the mfa program. \r\n- In my class, we had a good balance between learning technical skills during studio time and applying those skills into assignments that were more conceptual\r\n- A good balance of lessons/studio time practicing skills, and then when we had assignments we had more free form classes where we had time to work on the assignments in class and get feedback\r\n- Group critiques were rewarding and interesting \r\n- Seeing everyone's artwork grow over the semester was rewarding \r\n- I think we succeeded in having a non-judgemental space for art, where I think people of all different skill levels were welcomed and included\r\n- Seeing other people work and how they applied their skills was inspiring, we also had a studio tour of MFA students during one of the classes and that was also quite inspiring.\r\n\r\nBoth Strength/Weakness:\r\n- Relatively low workload for the bulk of the class as we did most of our work in studio and during class time. However, the major projects/assignments/the final project can be quite time consuming (possibly 5-10+ hours depending on the amount of effort you put in, and for reference theres only really 2-3 of these major projects) and the bulk of these projects are done outside of class (though class time is provided for some of them) and as such they can be quite overwhelming and lead to cramming if you don't plan out your time accordingly. But deadlines are outlined in the syllabus ahead of time and I think as long as you can plan your schedule and expectations out ahead of time, and start working on them early, they will be very manageable and low stress (considering how there's really no other homework in this class). But if you leave to just one night/less than a few days you will be grinding, and losing sleep. \r\n- I didn't really know my grade during the semester, and I do think the class is low stress enough that I never really worried about my grade, but I did not have a clear sense of what grade I got from my assignments (though we do get good feedback especially during crits), since we don't really get told the exact percentage/letter grade unless you ask, which you can definitely ask, though I personally never asked, and so as such, unlike other classes where you can clearly see what grade you got on a test/quiz/assignment, in this class we mostly received verbal feedback. Which I think on some level I do like and it takes the stress out of worrying about a grade, but it does mean that I don't quite have a clear idea of what I got as a final grade. However, I do imagine/get the vibe that grading is fairly lenient in this class and as a basic drawing class they take into account your starting point. If they would like to provided more concrete grading, I think getting back a rubric or written feedback would be nice.\r\n- I think on some level, if you have taken a lot of art classes in high school or have taken AP Art some of the foundational content of this class could be a retread, however, speaking as someone who did take art classes in high school, I still found the class invigorating and interesting, and I think there is still something to be gained by taking a class like this in a college context.",

The class is also what you make it, so try hard and you will get a lot out of it.",

They werer wonderful sources of guidance and it felt like they both really cared about our growth and learning. This course is BY NO MEANS A GUT, art is hard! The projects were a large time commitment, but the class and the process were super rewarding. I would especially recommend this class if you love art but feel like college has taken away your time for it, this class gave me a great excuse to get back into drawing :)",
                "Yes, I think anyone interested in visual art could gain something from this class. I think it's relatively low stress, and is a good way for anyone to learn important foundational drawing skills that are applicable in other fields of art. I do think if you have received similar foundational training that some of the content could be a retread but I think even for those people the class is engaging and valuable to take if they haven't taken a college art class.",
                "I absoutely would. This course will have you creating artworks that you are truly proud of, and I can genuinely say that it was so gratifying to see how much my peers and I have grown thanks to this course. If you would like to get better at art, this is the best way to start!",
