                "This course is a great, detailed view at the colonial history of Latin America. Learning about the history of the region beyond of what is taught in grade school was extremely interesting.",
                "From this class, I learned about the history of colonial Latin America, from pre-colonial Indigenous and Iberian societies to the Independence movements in the 1800s. The course included material on a wide range of themes, such as the experiences of Indigenous groups, African slavery, the economy, race in colonial societies, gender roles, religion, and culture\/art. This course provided a strong foundation for my understanding of Latin America during the colonial period, which will be extremely helpful for the rest of my courses on Latin America."

                "This course was very interesting but the lectures could sometimes be a little unorganized and hard to follow.",
                "The course won't take up too much time but will still feel fulfilling. The material is very interesting and the readings are directly tied to the lectures, so it doesn't feel like busy work. I would say structuring the timeline of the course could be an improvement. Often we would jump around from region to region or time period to time period and it was hard to organize my notes in a cohesive manner.",
                "This course provided an excellent overview of the history of Colonial Latin America. The professor was a fantastic lecturer and I learned a lot in the class. All of the readings for class were very interesting, but some of them were not that directly related to the materials that we were discussing in lecture, so it would be helpful to mark those readings as optional or encouraged to decrease the reading load. The course could have slightly better organization (for example our midterm was switched from in-person to a take home then back to an in-person exam) but I believe that this was due to the fact that this is the last time it is planning to be taught."

                "Definitely! Professor Schwartz is renowned in this field and it was an honor to learn from him. If you want an interesting, engaging, and stress-free course this is the perfect fit.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The lectures were all really engaging and the professor knows so much about colonial Latin America, especially in Brazil. The professor is also clearly passionate about teaching and helped us find primary sources for our research papers if we were struggling to find good sources."
