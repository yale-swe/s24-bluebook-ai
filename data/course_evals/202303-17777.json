                "A fundamental ontology of lifewhat it means to be alive and a living organism, ranging from the most primitive forms of life to the rational human, proceeding from Aristotle's theories of the organism in De Anima in conversation with a range of other philosophical works (Thompson, Kant, Epicurus, and neo-Aristotelians including Nussbaum, Williams, Korsgaard). What this ontology of life says about the value of our time and the importance of our rational freedom. An important aspect of this inquiry is death and our relation to it as living beings, and how mortality is not something we should seek to deny, but is actually intrinsic to the intelligibility and significance of our lives.",
                "To name a few of the concepts explored in this course: hylomorphism, metaphysical classifications of matter, definitions of life and their meaning (e.g. autopoietic and teleological systems), hierarchy of life (vegetative, animal, and rational beings) and ontological statuses, environmental ethics, self-consciousness, necessary and sufficient perceptual distinctions, existential identity, virtue and wisdom, formidability of death, and immortality as a misfortune.",
                "This course pushed me to think very deeply about the difference between the living and the lifeless, and that way of thinking ended up being really helpful when I was exploring other philosophical questions outside of class, since I could see them in a completely different light."

                "Strengths: Extremely interesting and engaging ideas and concepts. Appropriate amount of reading each week which felt pertinent to the class discussion. Prof. Hagglund is an excellent lecturer, very passionate, and engages enthusiastically with any student question. Very willing to meet outside of class to discuss as well. The class format was more professor-led, which I think is a strength in philosophy seminars  when the professor has a plethora of interesting ideas to share for the class to engage with. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are no assignments other than weekly reading and the final paper. The only change I can think to make to the course would be to have students submit a couple questions about the reading prior to each week's class to help them stay accountable.",
                "Strengths: Martin Hgglund, small class size, insightful and felicitous texts Weaknesses: None",
                "The main strength of the course is Hgglund's teaching: he really is an incredibly articulate speaker, and his passion for the ideas is so clear. Asking him questions during or after class is always very rewarding because it's *his* philosophy, so he understands it inside and out. (I remember one funny moment when he lost his place in the lecture notes in class and just said \"Ah well I know it in my heart, so it should be fine.) He encouraged people to speak up when they were confused or had objections, and he always put a lot of thought into his responses to help us really get what he was teaching.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think this really should be seen as more of a lecture course than a seminar--people could participate sometimes by asking questions, but we rarely talked between ourselves. I would've loved if this class could have had a discussion section in addition to the lectures, because I think a big part of philosophy for me is discussing and testing out the ideas in conversation with other people. Luckily, Hgglund is very happy to schedule office hours with students to talk more after class--I really appreciated those calls and they were a great alternative to class discussion to engage with the ideas."

                "Absolutely. Especially if you are a philosophy major, and even if you are not. The concepts are relatively accessible to a range of backgrounds and will inspire reflection about all sorts of aspects of your life. You get the opportunity to engage with a range of philosophical thinkers and come to understand how their ideas are intimately connected. And Prof. Hagglund is a great professor who loves what he does and puts effort into making sure each student has a positive and engaging experience.",
                "Certainly. How can you begin to understand yourself and uphold your life's meaning without questioning what makes your life meaningful? Even if you are a religious person, the question of why something gives your life meaning must certainly be backed by some sort of philosophical inquiry, and this class offers a great starting point for it. This course approaches perhaps the most important metaphysical questions that philosophers have considered for millennia, namely those that define what it means to live and what it means for a life to be purposeful. Overall, this is an amazing class if you truly take the time to engage with the material. However, the workload is going to equate to your level of engagement with the class as there aren't any assignments that check if you've carefully gone through the readings (other than the final essay, which makes up the entire grade I believe). While there are no explicit prerequisites, I think some exposure to philosophical texts would be of great benefit for one to maturely and efficiently work through the readings. The class itself is everything that a philosophy class should be. Class time consists of going over the conceptual outline of the readings as well as active discussion\/debate regarding the validity of assertions made in the readings. Hgglund is extremely knowledgable and articulate in his responses. He is happy to engage in philosophical debate, and you can tell he's passionate about the argument that he wants to convey throughout the course. Where I think a lot of philosophy classes can go wrong is in assuming that philosophical arguments are meant to be dissected by professors and redirected towards students. In this course, you'll find that this is not the case. Hgglund delivers his interpretation of the arguments to his students as he uses them to support a comprehensive construction of the soul and its mortality, but he also invites his students to challenge his claims and to ensure that they have their own understanding of the arguments being presented. By the end of the course, Hgglund has presented a cogent synthesis of contributions made to the discussion of mortality and used this synthesis to make an overarching argument, which I will not spoil or attempt to summarize here. There are far too many reasons as to why you should take this class, so if you are someone that is genuinely interested in the philosophical consideration of mortalityboth in a historical and argumentative mannerthen definitely take this class, especially if Hgglund is teaching it."
