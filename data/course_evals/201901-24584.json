    "I learned a new way of thinking about California, through the lenses of economics and migration, as well as an in-depth study of many personal microhistories.",
    "Topics in the economic history of California, such as the Spanish missions, Gold Rush, agriculture, defense, religion, and Silicon Valley; different perspectives used to analyze history; research and writing historiographical papers",
    "Historical synthesis and analysis",
    "History and historiographical analysis of California and its relationship with capitalism",
    "I gained a general overview of California history with a specific focus on capitalism",
    "This course helped develop my historical analysis skills. It taught me to think critically given primary and secondary sources.",
    "I learned about everything I wasnt taught in my 4th grade California history class. The course is very thorough up until the 1940s and the class is very SF-area focused, but I think that the way the class is framed justifies these tendencies."

   "comments": [
    "California Capitalism was a really fun class, a piece of light relief in the middle of the Yale stress. The course could maybe benefit from a more concrete syllabus, but I personally enjoyed its fluidity. The amount of reading was perfect: enough to absorb and analyze but not an overwhelming amount. This meant that our section was fast paced and everyone was engaged.",
    "This course could be improved by devoting a little less time to pre-20th century. Though much of the material was interesting, it did feel repetitive at times.",
    "Strengths: interesting content, professor and TA are very nice\r\nWeaknesses: lectures could be less tangential",
    "Strength:\r\nInteresting readings\r\nGreat Professor",
    "I think this course is very strong. The required texts all complimented the lectures very nicely and were manageable so that most students completed the readings, creating better discussion. The material was very interesting and each lecture was entertaining and informative. The only change I would suggest is adding slightly more structure to the second half of the course. The first half had a very straight forward progression that made it easier to pinpoint similarities, whereas the second half of the course, provided equally valuable information but jumped around slightly more making it sometimes harder to follow the parallels of each lecture and to link to the greater understanding of the course and California.",
    "Great reasonable reading load and good section discussion w Hannah the TF. Focused too much on the 1800s and sometimes felt too much like a TED talk than a class",
    "The course should spend more time on contemporary California history. For example, the absence of a discussion of Hollywood was a significant oversight. The course as a whole was very strong!",
    "The course was great! I think it could have focused less on the early CA history and more on contemporary issues. Otherwise, wonderful!",
    "The classs lectures are straightforward, very interesting, and novel material. I think the drawback is that sometimes the books assigned to the course get left out of the lecture a bit much.",
    "The focus of this course throughout the semester did not align with the course description. As a history course, the emphasis resided mostly within the 19th century and unfortunately we raced through the entire 20th century in the last 2 weeks of class. I would have liked to see a more a balanced focus that encompassed more of California's history."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! If you're looking for a fun history elective and are interested in the West, take this class. Professor Ross' teaching style is a little kooky and wanders back and forth over California's history, but you'll learn fun facts and a new way of seeing the state.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, you'll have a fun time.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would. The class is very interesting, especially if you're from California!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It provides a solid history of California and the west while framing it with an interesting lens. Moreover, while often history touts itself as important for being able to learn from the past, this is one of the few classes that actually acts on that statement, drawing conclusions about present-day California from the state's history and the mindsets of the people who inhabited it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is either from California or has an interest in the states history.",
    "I would recommend this! The lectures are engaging and easy to comprehend. The topic is very relevant to anyone, even those who arent from CA.",
    "I would very much recommend this class to anyone who has ever lived or plans to live in California. Additionally, take this class for professor Ross; hes quite a good lecturer and has a good sense of humor."
