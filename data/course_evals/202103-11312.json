Learning about 2020 helped me gain a better understanding of the entire history of systemic racism, political corruption and tension, and the militarization of the police. This course really brought light to the issues in America and helped explain a lot of questions I had coming out of 2020.",

                "I learned the history that led up to 2020 and factors within the systems of government, law, and healthcare that contributed to it",
                "This was an incredible seminar that challenged me to think about myself as a subject of history in a really interesting and puzzling historical moment. I absolutely loved it and looked forward to class each week. This is so worth taking if it is offered again."

                "Strengths - It was truly unlike any class I've ever had. The seminar fostered very rich conversations that I don't believe you can have in other classes. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The readings were often overwhelming. There were so many weekly readings that it was difficult to really dive deep into them and be able to analyze each reading. This isn't necessarily a weakness, it might've been the nature of who was in the course, but seminar discussion was skewed very heavily towards left-leaning ideas. I think if a right-leaning person were to take the class, they would've felt uncomfortable participating in the seminar discussion.",
                "Strengths: great readings, amazing professor, great guests (add more please!), great discussion questions from professor\r\nWeaknesses: discussions weren't as good as they could have been (not the professor's fault; only half the class ever spoke), readings were a bit long (but the professor lowered them when we brought this up), also it was a 9:25 :(",
                "Strength: Interesting discussions that are extremely relevant!\r\nWeakness: Wish there was more direction for the papers assigned",
                "This course was very engaging because it was small and discussions based. There was a lot of relevant material to cover which made it hard to fit everything into the semester,",
                "Strengths - discussions\r\nWeaknesses - readings sometimes too long",
                "The course material was fascinating but often we had far too much reading. It was hard to fully engage with the course material as a result.",
                "The readings were great but I think we focused a lot on the 60s/70s and it would be useful to think deeply about the 80's and 90's as well as 9/11 and how that impacted the present moment. I also loved our discussions. Professor Brenes was really open to letting the class guide the discussion based on what we felt drawn to in the readings I really appreciated this. I also thought the writing assignments were really valuable and well thought out."

                "Yes! Exploring the historical background to the events of 2020 was an oddly cathartic experience and I learned a lot of valuable recent American history, especially about the militarization of police. I also really enjoyed the writing assignments  the personal history was an opportunity to reflect about my own year and view myself as a subject of history.",
                "Yes! It's the kind of class that you put a lot of work into, but you really do get a lot out of it. I think out of all of my classes at Yale, this seminar gave me the best understanding of our country and how we got to where we are today. The books and readings were extremely interesting, and classes discussion was very raw and eye-opening.",
                "YES most definitely!! The readings were really informative, and I learned so much about American history that I had never learned about in a traditional history class. Everything from the commercialization of Latin American immigrants in exchange for produce to previous government responses to pandemics and disease was fascinating, and it made sure to connect history to current day phenomena. My favorite part of history is how it applies to current and future strategy, so it was really interesting hearing about how we can make change and more informed decisions today.",
                "I would!",
                "Absolutely. As a non history major I found this course to be highly informative and deeply engaging.",
                "Yes absolutely. Take this course. It is really valuable to understanding our present moment and your role in history. This was a fantastic seminar."
