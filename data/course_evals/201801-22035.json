    "How to better approach a scene, rehearse with a fellow actor, bring a character to life.",
    "How to discover in the moment, take my time, establish my circumstances - all which helped my acting.",
    "This class taught me a lot about working with a scene partner, the process of developing a scene, and staying on my voice. In particular, I learned to move through a scene slowly and purposefully, and to always prioritize having a connection with a partner.",

   "comments": [
    "A strength is you end up getting a lot of scene work done through the semester and can grow. Things felt a little too focused on just the scenes at hand and I would have loved to have a more general structure.",
    "Really allows you to focus on acting in a non-stressful academic environment.",
    "It is an honor to work under Joan's watchful eye and tutelage. I only wish  the class was longer (especially given Joan's unfortunate sickness). I do think some classes felt more productive than others, which may have been because students entered the class at different levels of experience. Perhaps if there were two classes taught in the future there could be different levels depending on the student's background with acting. All in all, I really enjoyed getting to spend the entire time working rigorously on scene work and not having to be encumbered by papers\/ overly academic work. I truly loved coming to class every day and working in such a supportive environment.",
    "This course needs a TF to help with rehearsals that happen outside of class, like to how Bundy's class is structured!"

    "YES- Joan is a great acting teacher!"
