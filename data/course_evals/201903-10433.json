   "comments": [
    "This course changed the way I think about design, teaching me how to analyze my own work and others' through a more thoughtful lens. I feel like my own work developed a lot throughout the semester and I feel more confident in my ability to make a variety of printed materials.",
    "I gained additional skills in graphic design, mostly focusing on the process of creating a set of books\/objects related to one topic. This class was extremely helpful to me in the sense that I was able to discover which parts of the design process I like, and which outside interests I can incorporate into my practice (in my case, I found a place for my love of illustration in this class). \r\nThe projects, readings, and discussions also allowed me to gain a more critical lens when analyzing why a design project is successful or not. Learning about famous designers through presentations and guest speakers also helped me align my goals as a designer with what I now know is possible in the industry.",
    "This course develops many aspects of graphic designor perhaps, more broadly, designpractice. Specifics include developing design systems, evaluating the role of the designer critically, and design research.",
    "I learned how to work on graphic design projects long term, focusing on a few major projects over the semester and utilizing feedback from my instructors and peers to strengthen my design systems. I also learned a great deal about the history of graphic design through readings about design theory and the works of famous designers, as well as getting to listen to the stories of designers currently working in the field. The class helped me shape my own methodology when it comes to planning, drafting, editing, and finalizing my work.",
    "I learned more about developing a thoughtful process in approaching design. I also further developed my skills of designing with type and image."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was a wonderful environment, and the small class size made discussions and critiques feel friendly and engaging. It was a well-structured course, and I appreciated how much content we were able to cover in each class. The only weakness was the high cost of materials. Printing multiple books, especially the final synthesis project, became a financial burden for many of us.",
    "Strengths: very focused, in-depth curriculum and agenda for each class as well as for the whole semester. Due to the students picking one subject to focus on for four months, this class was incredibly cohesive and felt like there was a clear journey and end-point for everyone. I very much appreciated this course's ability to create a path for each student, leading them in a direction according to their interests and personal design philosophy. \r\nWeaknesses: It's very hard to think of any for this course. It could perhaps be improved by further considering (and bearing in mind) the resources each student has in the class, because printing and material costs can add up quickly.",
    "This course has no weaknesses. The workload was manageable (of course, studio classes will always feel like more work in comparison to courses taken outside of the School of Art), the content was extremely relevant and engaging, and the instruction was fantastic.",
    "The small class size allowed for each student to receive feedback on their work, and focusing on a few large projects rather than several smaller ones allowed for ample time to work on editing between critique periods. Dividing the long (four-hour) class block between critiques, readings, and presentations kept things interesting and engaging. I really enjoyed choosing a major topic at the beginning of the semester and working to create my projects around that topic, as it encouraged me to look at the same theme from multiple angles and decide how to shape my designs accordingly.",
    "The class is small enough that you get great feedback from Jessica and your peers. It was a very helpful and respectful environment."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It will change the way you approach and view design. The class environment was great as well.",
    "Absolutely! This course is a fantastic next step after Typography I, and based on my conversations with other students and my own thoughts, it really helps cement in students' minds what they like about design and how they wish to pursue it.",
    "Absolutely. It would be a mistake to go throughout the Graphic Design progression of the Art major and not take this classplus, you have to! Even if you are not an Art major but have taken other design courses, this course allows you to develop a more nuanced appreciation of design as a practice.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in graphic design this course is well shaped to help you learn more about the craft and your own methods, especially following Intro to Graphic Design and Typography I.",
    "I would! Being organized about your book topic from the beginning will only make your life easier in the end. The more research the better informed your design decisions will be."
