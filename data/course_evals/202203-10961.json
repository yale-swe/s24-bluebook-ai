                "I learned a lot about diseases and vaccine development, climate change, and plants. While plants were interesting and enjoyable, they didn't necessarily feel as relevant to study. However, the social issues surrounding diseases and climate change are obviously pressing issues, and while we didn't dive super deep into the science, it was interesting to study for sure.",

I also developed a new to learn and study for exams. This is the first course I have had that was lecture style, and the exams covered so much material. In the beginning, I was very unsure how to study and take full advantage of the class; however, throughout the semester, I picked up precious habits such as how to optimize what was being taught in lectures, how to take away key concepts, and how to study for exams covering lots of material. Some fun things I can think of off the top of my head that I enjoyed learning about throughout the course was the derivatives of different medicines from plants, the bamboo masting that leads to a surge of black rats (nutcracker style), what a tsetse fly even is, and el nio and la nia and their reaction to climate change, to name a few.",

I also gained skills in how to write a paper about an issue in which I explained the science behind that issue and then talked about the social solutions behind that issue. Additionally, being in the experience science discussion I was able to further explore science.",

                "I'm not the biggest fan of memorization exams but with a few hours of studying I found them to be fine.",
                "Too much focus on technical information",
                "Strengths: the TFs are awesome\r\n\r\nWeakness: review for exams earlier than day before and more review materials to know how to study",
                "Class is definitely not a gut. You need to study for the exam and there is a lot of material. Strength is that the TFs are willing to help, Weakness is there is a lot of material covered.",
                "Strengths: Class was short and concise and all slides were posted",
                "It provided a pretty good general overview of a lot of major biology concepts and I think that there was a good amount of freedom to explore what you're interested in with the final paper. There was not much guidance about what to study for the midterm exams. We got practice questions for the first midterm which were pretty useful but not for any of the other exams. Also, The TFs didn't know what was on the exam and made that pretty clear, so the review sessions were confusing because there was no guarantee we were reviewing the things we needed to know.",
                "I absolutely loved the format of the exams. It made me study for them in a way that fostered my learning. I definitely always looked forward to discussion section and lectures. The only weakness was the lack of lecture recordings. There were times when I needed to revisit a concept because the lecture slides didnt really help me grasp it but I was kind of stuck because the lectures are not recorded.",
                "Interesting lectures and a fun class; experience science section was absolutely phenomenal.",
                "Dr. Carlson was a HUGE strength!! I loved him and thought he started off the semester so well. The TFs were also incredible, and I learned a lot in section. I didn't find the other lecturers as compelling, though I did appreciate that everyone tried very hard to be accessible and explain things step-by-step.",
                "Strengths: Lectures were very clearly organized, with learning objectives set very explicitly at the start of each class. Profs, especially Carlson and Gendron, were super fun and interesting. Sections were engaging. Readings were interesting, but also with essentially no stakes other than enjoyment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The tests were deceptively hard. Asked very specific questions on topics that weren't necessarily highlighted in lecture, nor did they seem particularly important.",
                "Strengths: Interesting sections, topics were relevant and presented in a way that made it easy for a non-STEM major to understand, I emerged from the course feeling better equipped to talk about current topics in biology and their implications. Weaknesses: Exams did not test very much critical thinking and instead asked students to memorize different bits of random information. The material in section was interesting (ethical questions about new technologies, thinking about different policies to cut carbon emissions, etc.) but was not included on the test, leading to a bit of a disconnect.",
                "better review / giving students a better sense of what will be on the exam\r\nstop forcing students to memorize very specific topics (like disease names or certain pneumonics) and test on general understanding",
                "Class goes FAST, 3 exams is a lot but better than having a final in my opinion.",
                "Hosting review sessions prior to the next before the exam to allow for more time to work on topics from the review sessions.",
                "I liked how the course is laid out as it provides students with a very holistic understanding of most biological concepts emphasizing their societal roles today as well.",
                "strengths: class is engaging, profs are funny, and material is easy enough to understand \r\nweakness: exams are hard and it's hard to study for them",
                "Strengths: course was well-organized, moderate workload, and engaging. The discovery discussion section provided an opportunity to hear from esteemed guest-speakers and visit different facilities that Yale has to offer. Overall, the course is a wonderful way to take a humanistic approach to the science disciplines. \r\nWeaknesses: there is a lot of course-weighting on exams, as your grade is determined on 3 exam scores, a final paper, and participation in discussion section.",
                "I felt like the exams were more specific than necessary. I really enjoyed the class though, especially that we were learning about current world-relevant events",
                "I would say one of the strengths of this class is instructor engagement. Each professor in this class made learning about biology, especially for those of us inclined to science, a fun, and exciting experience. I felt like I absorbed so much new information because of the atmosphere the professors set. A weakness I would point out is the use of slides and discussion sections. It would've been nice to see more conceptual information besides the images for the slides reviewed in the lecture. If there had been more information, studying would have been a little easier, especially if you missed jotting down some information in your notes. In the discussion sections, I enjoyed the more social science information than biological; however, I wish we had set aside some time for studying and preparing for exams. Although it was an excellent opportunity to discuss new concepts applicable to the lectures, reviewing and refreshing lecture concepts would also be of value during those sections. Also, I feel like the specificity of the exams and format were not very clearly outlined before we took them, and that would've been appreciative to know to make taking the exam less frightful and hard to get through.",
                "The lectures were very entertaining and the tests were just the right amount of challenge. Sections were great too. Overall a very positive experience. I think the grading on tests was kind of nit-picky but not the end of the world",
                "the experiencing science section is great very fun and you get to go on cool field trips\r\n\r\nthe review sessions before exams could be improved",
                "The professors are amazing!! The exams though didnt test us on information that I felt would be the biggest takeaways from the course.  The TFs felt very ill-informed about the exams: any questions we had even about material from lectures they didnt seem to know.",
                "I loved all three professors, and I liked how we had three so the class always felt fresh. The class was engaging (the professors knew their audience). I also really enjoyed my section.\r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses.",
                "I thought that the discussions in section and the class lectures were very engaging. The material was interesting without feeling too complicated. I also thought that the choice of biology topics were very good: ie. infectious diseases, plant biology, and climate change. I also liked how the topics flowed into one another.",
                "The strengths are the lack of homework and the discussion sections which are interesting. The main weaknesses are the nitpicking grading style and the inability to keep politics out of any lecture.",
                "Very well-run; can't think of any weaknesses",
                "The section on climate change was unorganized and unclear. I could only decipher what was going because I had taken EPS 101: Climate Change before. The TFs seemed as equally as confused.",
                "The way the course was formatted was great, the lectures and slides were informative and helpful. I think the first midterm caught me and others off guard by how specific some of the questions on the exam were, and this seemed to be a theme for all the midterms.",
                "I enjoyed lectures but even though there were semi-guidelines before each lecture I still didnt know what to study! Also the TAs didnt know wha we should study either.",
                "The strengths in this course are on how it is modeled. Students understand that there will be an array of topics covered. The weaknesses are that there are very little chances to raise your grades. Much of your grade relies on three tests, so there are no weekly assignments that take up a part of your grade.",
                "too much memorization just for words not understanding ideas",
                "This course was taught in a perfect way. The sections and the lectures were absolutely amazing. However, as an individual who has test anxiety and English is their second language having no homework whatsoever has been my grade in the class suffer. I wish the instructors would provide the students with homework that will prepare them for the test, and in addition -- be specific about the type of answers they are looking forward in the test questions. As non STEM majors we often don't understand in what way instructors would like us to answer.",
                "This course is a very interesting concept and it is well taught.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the exams are too cumbersome and harshly graded.",
                "My strengths are my basic knowledge of biology that helped me understand the concepts, my weakness was applying it to the real world and worrying less about the details and more about the whole process holistically.",
                "The professors and TFs were really nice. However, I dont think this class was a science gut.",
                "It was a very engaging lecture however it was sometimes hard to get a full grasp on the material.",
                "I think a strength is how engaging the lecturers and material is. I also think the review sessions were great, specifically with the slides they created synthesizing all the information. I think what could be improved is the discussion section material and it would be helpful to have study guides for tests.",
                "More assignments in order to help understand ideas",
                "The subject matter is very interesting. Another strength of the course is the changing of professors giving lectures throughout the course, as it provides a refreshing change. A weakness of the course is that the readings were not on the exam, so one wonders why do them at all? Additionally, the lecture slides and information given in lecture were not always presented in a well-organized manner. It made studying for exams difficult.",
                "The course is pretty comprehensive and you learn a lot in an accessible way. The sections are fun, though the experience one can be a time commitment with getting to the different locations. The tests are graded too harshly, and the study sessions are not super helpful because they are led by TFs who don't know what will be on the exams.",

                "I really enjoyed the lecturers, they were fun and engaging, but I disliked how the course was so heavily focused on memorization for the exams.",
                "I like the structure of the class and I like the content that was covered. It feels very topical and relevant and I think the class is a great concept for a science gut.\r\n\r\nIn terms of something to improve, the review sessions often were not helpful because the TAs were just regurgitating information that we already had been presented. They also often did not seem to understand the material very well and had trouble answering questions. Or, they would go in detail about information that was not actually important. \r\n\r\nFor the class itself, I wish the slides were a bit more clear as to what terms we needed to memorize. Sometimes the slides would be lacking bullet points or would be unclear as to what the main ideas were. This is mostly referring to Prof. Marlon's slides. The other two lecturers did not really have this problem.",
                "discussion sections more relevant to the test materials",
                "I appreciate the different instructors and the attempt to make the course material both engaging and accessible to the students. I think that the material was very manageable, but some of the exam questions didn't feel like they focused on material that was focused on as much during the lectures.",
                "Have more frequent review sessions",
                "The papers and discussion allowed room for creativity. After learning a wide breadth of information during lectures, we were prompted to independently pursue deeper knowledge in the areas that interest us most. In terms of improvement, I think the workload should be standardized between different discussion sections (i.e. certain sections had a significantly higher number of assignments and readings than others).",
                "Record the lectures please",
                "One strength is how clear the different sections of the class are, that the lectures are entertaining and informative, that the workload is very manageable, and the exams are flexible/clear. One weakness is that the discussion section feels unnecessary.",
                "Strengths - very diverse array of knowledge, really fun professors generally\r\nNo real weaknesses as far as I'm concerned",
                "Lecturers were pretty great. Surprised by how much I enjoyed the course content. The climate change section was great to include but could have been more sharply focused. Review sessions run by the TAs pretty disorganized.",
                "I found my TF to be extremely helpful and informative, and benefited from our weekly section. \r\n\r\nIt was a little tricky to get comfortable with a lecture style  since the course was taught by 3 different professors. It would have also been very helpful if the lectures were recorded. \r\nAnother weakness was that the review sessions often occurred too close to the exam.",
                "Strength of the course is simplicity of lectures and presentation of the various topics. Weaknesses were a lack of communication to the TF's what was expected to be on the exam, who were then unable to assist our studying behavior beyond telling us just to review the lectures. Questioning on the exams was also often vague, and I was left confused as to what answer was expected of me. An example of this is having to provide a description of a control group in a question asking about obese mice and microbiomes. Another example was asking for names of the receptor and protein for the COVID-19 virus. And while the receptor's name was ACE-2, the protein was just called spike protein, a description of its shape. And while I knew the shape of that protein and knew to call it that, on the exam I was trying to think of its scientific name to mirror my previous answer for the receptor. And because the questions were worded exactly the same, I ended up describing the protein as spike shaped and got it wrong. I think some editing of the questions could help students accurately demonstrate their knowledge and progress in this course. A final weakness is having the final assignment be a paper. I did not mind writing it; however, it seemed unconventional to have our final evaluation be a writing assignment when no other writing was assigned until that point. The paper did not feel like an accurate assessment of our experience in the class, as it was a new format of evaluation.",
                "The lectures for this course, though in general containing great information, were confused, unorganized, and generally not made in a way that built up sequentially. This problem was only present with the last two lecturers, not the first. In addition, the TAs were amazing assets and did their job incredibly well, but the help they gave, though superb, was hindered horribly by the fact that the professors did not give the TAs access to the exams prior to the tests and they neglected to communicate effectively with the TAs what information was part of the required work for the course. This add to the comment about the disorganized nature of the lectures since they included fun facts and random information that ended up not pertaining at all to the course material covered in exams.",
                "I really liked that this course was split into three chunks and that exams weren't cumulative.",
                "strengths: lecturers were amazing\r\nweaknesses: low level of engagement during sections",
                "Loved it!",
                "The class does a very good job offering an introduction to a lot of topics, which can seriously increase the STEM comprehension of a non-science person like myself. Sometimes, though, more complicated topics like climate change and weather patterns would speed by and I would struggle to catch all the information. The tests were a little opaque in terms of content, and the seemingly random content cutoffs for each test didn't help. The course handles cycling the three professors very well, and I never felt like that caused any particular disruptions.",
                "I wish that section was more closely related to the course material. I know it was more supplemental by design but still",
                "The lecture are engaging, but rather fast paced. A bit slower pace and more filled in slides when posted on canvas would be helpful.",
                "The discussion sections could be more catered to what will be on exams."

                "Absolutely! Bio, the World and Us is a great choice for a chill science credit. The material is actually super relevant and interesting, I feel like I learned a lot about things I did not know about before but wanted to get educated on. The workload is super chill, if you go to lecture and section and then study a but for the exams you are totally fine (no other hw aside from a final 5 page paper on a topic of interest from the course).",
                "Yes. It is no homework, and very interesting material",
                "I think it is a great science class however I found studying for exams to be very difficult and there was not as much support as I would have liked",
                "Not a large workload but the exams are hefty and you need to study. Definitely not an easy \"A\" by any means",
                "Yes",
                "Yes, I think it's a pretty decent overview for someone who wants to learn basics.",
                "I definitely would. If youre not hardcore STEM and interested in learning about a bit of bio this course is perfect. I definitely learned a lot of science compared to what I knew prior to the course but it was done in an applicable way that has allowed me to connect it to many parts of my personal life.",
                "This is a great science course for non-science majors (as advertised). The professors do an excellent job of teaching material that is interesting and accessible to students who do not (and will never have) a super in-depth knowledge of science. Also -- do the experience science section! Most weeks are field trip-esque visits to different science facilities throughout Yale. Very interesting and lots of fun.",
                "Yes! It's a great science gut-- I felt like I enjoyed going to lectures and actually learned something, but it wasn't so hard that I was intimidated / felt I couldn't do well in the course.",
                "Absolutely. You're probably only looking for a GUT, and this class was super fun and felt like I was learning interesting things. I will say, though, that my average on assessments in this class was ~17 points lower than my average on assessments in other courses. It is not an automatic A.",
                "Definitely! This course is great for anyone who has not taken a biology class at Yale and is looking to get a science credit out of the way and learn a little bit about cool topics in biology along the way.",
                "Yes!! Fun, useful, engaging  best science credit you could hope for!",
                "yes if you are looking to learn some decently interesting science and get a science credit --- you do have to study for the tests the night or two before for a lot of hours and put work into doing well on the tests- but other than the tests and showing up to section every week it is low commitment-- definitely take the experience section if u get the chance",
                "Would recommend if youre interested in big problems like climate change, public health, and the future of humanity. Its a lot of work though (3 exams non cumulative).",
                "Yes. The lecturers are phenomenal and so are the TAs.",
                "yes",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who wants an introduction to the humanistic side of science and its applications in global health. This course provided a great opportunity to learn about the interdisciplinary relationship of the environment, disease, and social health determinants.",
                "I would recommend it.",
                "I would, especially for those not well-versed in biological concepts or literature. I believe it is a challenging class; however, it offers one of the most fundamental and introductory teachings into life on Earth and how that affects the social, governmental, and economic relations that we have.",
                "Yes. Like an interesting podcast twice a week. Tests force you to review what youve learned.",
                "If you need a science credit and are not confident in science it is great. Moreover, the enthusiasm from the three professors makes you interested in the topics which are very relevant. It does require studying before the exams but if you do that then you can do well in the course.",
                "yes. great class for non science people",
                "Yes it is a good science class for people who arent in STEM/dont have an extensive background in biology.",

                "Its a gut but not easy to get an A. No homework but 3 exams a paper and mandatory discussion sections. Youll have seen 95% of the content before. The way they grade exams is theyll take points off for phrasing things incorrectly even if you obviously understand the right answer. The questions are so easy that most people get them right, so they need to lower grades by taking off for word choice errors. Also the teaching staff make pretty obvious their political viewpoints and weave them into their lectures whenever they can, although thats increasingly standard at Yale.",
                "Yes, especially in the fall",
                "Yes. I really enjoyed this course. I feel like it was a science class that is applicable to life and it was very interesting. The workload was very manageable and lecture was engaging.",

                "not really",
                "Yes but you must understand that this course is not as easy as it appears. You have to study for many hours for the only 3 tests available and your final grade depends on them with an addition to the final essay. If you are not a good test taker like me, I would think about it twice. If you are a good test taker and are not looking to having much homework-- this is the course for you.",
                "If a non-science student wanted to take a science credit and be able to reliably get an A if they work hard, I would recommend a different course because I believe students can work hard but still walk away with a poor grade. This is still a nice course idea.",
                "yes, the class is engaging and topics are interesting. all of the professors and TA's were exceptional",

                "I would recommend if you want to put in the work, but if you are looking for a science gut, you might want to look at other classes instead.",
                "Yes, It was very engaging and i found the material interesting.",
                "If you want a science gut and you're good at memorization, this isn't a bad course to take.",

                "YESSS",
                "I'm not sure, as while the subject matter is interesting the notes and lectures are not well-organized for exams.",
                "yes! super interesting and a great course to learn bio fundamentals",
                "If you are willing to study for 3 big exams, have forgotten most of your biology but remain somewhat interested, and need a science credit, sure.",
                "Yes, especially if they're a humanities student looking for courses in science.",
                "I probably would, but also I know the spring semester version of the class tends to be a bit different, so I wouldn't necessarily be giving them the most accurate information.",
                "yeah sure",
                "Yes, this course was a great way to get a science credit without being thrown into a super STEM-heavy environment. I think that having more focused course material might have made it easier to study for the class, but overall it was a good experience.",
                "yes, for the science credit",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! It provides a great baseline for those interested in studying politics, human rights, environmental justice, or internal affairs further.",
                "Absolutely!!! Anyone looking for a fun science credit should take this course. It is easy to follow, and while you do need to keep up with lectures and study for the midterms, it is definitely manageable.",
                "Yes, very straightforward science gut. The essay is the hardest thing you'll do in the class and even that's not that bad.",
                "Would recommend but you do have to go to the lectures!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. There is so much valuable knowledge to be learned in this course. I feel like I understand our ecosystem and my role in it so much better. I believe others will benefit just as much from this information and can apply it to their lives as well. The point of this class is to spread awareness and knowledge of these topics so that we can all support the environment. I can do my part by spreading the word about this class.",
                "I would recommend this course to any non-science major student. I felt it was a great introduction to some practical biology and scientific phenomenon in a course that was manageable enough to be attractive for students in need of a science credit without overloading their schedule or over-committing to a subject that is not their intended major.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they want to learn a lot of disjointed, random facts about different fields of science very quickly, but I would temper my recommendation with the understanding that the way the course is structured leads to some confusion and ignorance about exactly how the course will be tested.",
                "If you're looking for a science class as a non-STEM major, this is a good course! I wouldn't necessarily call it a gut, but it doesn't have a lot of weekly work.",
                "yes, especially for students not majoring in STEM because the TFs and professors make learning about science fun",
                "If you're looking for a gut, yes.",
                "Although this course teaches issues that are important to everyday life --diseases, genetics, climate change, etc--, I would recommend it to someone who actually enjoys learning about such issues and has an interest in biology because the course requires a lot of memorization of such material. I would not describe it as a gut.",
                "Yes, great Profs. enjoyable class.",
                "I would caution a student that this class might pose a problem if you struggle with tests or memorization. Someone interested solely in the societal effects of biology would find this course a little more focused on the actual science for them. Someone interested solely in the science would likewise find the science aspect shallow. If you can handle some fairly difficult tests, and have an interest in both aspects of the course, I would recommend it.",
                "Yes, good for kids like me who can't do stem but want an interesting science credit",
                "Yes. I genuinely believe that the course material is not only engaging but interesting.",
                "Yes! The material is interesting and relevant!"
