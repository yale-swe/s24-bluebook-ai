                "I would like to preface this by saying this semester's class was unusual due to Frances's passing. The depth of her passion for her students was clear until her final days. She was a true expert in her field, and we all learned so much from her. I know how difficult it was to teach a class given the circumstances, and none of the following should be taken as representative of future versions of the course or of the ability of the instructors themselves.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there were many more fundamental issues with the course. Primarily, it felt as though our instructors did not prepare much for class, which was reflected in the chaotic, confusing, and ungrounded nature of the conversations. This was also an externality of the size of the class, which should have never been as large as it was. To the final week, there were students that had to stand/sit in the back or side of the classroom because there weren't enough seats at the already packed table. With a class this big (or any class for that matter) it is not enough to start a conversation by asking \"What did you think about the readings\". Finally, the readings on the syllabus did not seem carefully chosen, and were often not brought up at all during class. \r\n\r\nIn future iterations of the course, I recommend that: 1) the size be limited to ~15 (instead of >30) students, 2) discussion questions be prepared (or better yet, distributed) before class, and 3) readings be better chosen (and limited) for the topics under discussion. \r\n\r\nThere were also clear strengths of the course. Our TA, Colin Moreshead, was fantastic and delivered clear and regular feedback on writing. The structure of the reading responses lended itself well to digesting the material before class. Finally, the topics, when they carefully addressed, were certainly fascinating.",
                "Nice breadth of topics, but could give more opportunities (aside from final paper) for students to engage in depth on that which interests them.",
                "The readings were carefully selected and interesting, and we had good materials to look at in class. Students were just not always that engaged so working to make sure everyone is participating in discussion.",
                "strengths: Colin is awesome, pretty easy, interesting and relevant subject matter\r\nweaknesses: not super well organized, class discussion advantaged students who are well versed in Japan and Asia more broadly",
                "Seminar was slightly disorganized in terms of participation. I wish there would have been a lecture component to the course in order to better conceptualize the material",
                "Due to Professor Rosenbluth's passing, this course operated very differently than expected. I believe that the organization of the class was below average and was due to the fact that it was run by three different people. The discussions were often stagnant and the class didn't have much direction. Again, in the midst of tragedy, it is difficult to criticize the course.",
                "Strengths: Weekly response papers for completion.\r\nWeakness: Your entire grade was based on the final paper so it was a bit hard to tell how you were doing in the class.",
                "Seemed like we did not discuss readings most of the time, felt lost in some discussions that involved outside knowledge",
                "The course was discussion heavy with a lot of questions being thrown to the class. I would have appreciated more moments of traditional lecturing to give a foundation.",
                "The course was very quantitatively focused, which was unexpected. I am new to political sciences, so I dont know if this is just what the field is like, but I would have liked to engage more with qualitative materials.",
                "Strengths: up-to-date contemporary Japanese politics that would affect current international relations; comprehensive readings on the reasons for the formation of contemporary Japanese politics; concrete quantitative data that would reflect the fact without or with only limited biases. \r\nWeakness: would be better if the teachers lecture more about the reading materials and give less time for student discussions (just my personal opinion) since I believe many students were new to the topic and it would be better for teachers to offer more information in class. (But I overall enjoyed this class!)"

                "Other evaluations that state this course is great for people with no background in Japanese studies/East Asian studies/political science are likely saying that because it is an easy course to do well in. That doesn't mean you'll actually gain a lot if you don't already have some background in these fields. I expect that this course will change tremendously in following years, so my recommendation is to simply go and see for yourself.",
