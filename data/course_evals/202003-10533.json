                "I love Raffaella and Sirry.\r\nMaybe section could go over more interesting examples\/problems because I often felt like the questions we did in section weren't very exciting.",
                "No weaknesses -- keep doing what you're doing.",
                "The course was as good as it could be over Zoom- lectures were very engaging and consisted mostly of live examples of things from the readings.",
                "Strengths: Raffaella and Sirry are both easily accessible, the grading is fair and the feedback is precise, the workload is well regulated, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the in class discussion could be a bit confusing. There were a few points where the professor and the class textbook didn't quite line up because of the differences in their approaches to the field. \r\n\r\nI think one small thing that could improve the course is having the written assignments due on Fridays or Thursday night instead of Thursdays before class. There were a few times when I learned something in class that would have changed how I wrote my assignments if I had learned them before the deadline.",
                "STRENGTHS: Where to begin! The professor and TF (special thanks to Sirry!) were incredibly kind, patient, and understanding. They created a comfortable learning environment and explained abstract concepts clearly, and their personal investment in our learning and development as linguists was evident at every meeting. The workload was very manageable, with readings aligning with lecture material and problem sets providing both an appropriate level of intellectual challenge and an accurate picture of what to expect on exams. I also appreciated the encouragement of collaboration on psets; brainstorming with classmates often helped me gain new perspectives and appreciation of the topics. The Baker readings connected the more specific details of our curriculum to the broader study of linguistics, providing a clear picture of the significance of the topics we studied. Also, at least to me personally, the material was just incredibly interesting.\r\nWEAKNESSES: My only complaint (and a minor one at that) is that I personally was not a huge fan of the group assignments, especially in weeks when both a group assignment and a problem set were due.",
                "I wish the assignments and readings were assigned on a more consistent schedule",
                "The instructor and TF of this course are both excellent, showing a lot of passion and care for the students. The only weakness is sometimes the structure of the lecture. We mostly introduced new topics in our readings, then spent class doing practice sentences, but it could be hard to know what was important to write down and what was a side topic we were passing over. It might be helpful to work through three or four problems fully, instead of leaving some half-finished.",
                "The course was a very good one. Prof. Zanuttini did a fantastic job of motivating the various rules of Syntax in such a way that the results felt natural and important.",
                "Strengths: Professor Zanuttini and Sirry! Professor Zanuttini's lectures were interesting and engaging (even despite the virtual format) and Sirry's section was always super helpful. Both of them were also always available to answer questions, and I found office hours very helpful. Weaknesses: It sometimes felt like I got feedback on my written work too late. I would sometimes make the same mistake on multiple problem sets because I hadn't gotten feedback on the one where I made the original mistake yet. I also sometimes I felt that the pacing of the lectures was off (ie I felt that we didn't spend enough time on a topic or spent too much on others), but I was always able to go over topics I felt we went over too fast during office hours or section.",
                "Student introductions are pointless and waste time. The pace of the first half of the course was too slow and that of the latter half was too fast.",
                "The lectures were always behind the p-sets, so a lot of the p-sets had to be done with minimal support. Thus, I always understood what was happening in the p-sets in the lecture that came after the due date for submissions.",
                "Syntax I was amazing in terms of how we developed syntactic theory along historical lines, building up from the basics layer by layer, and yet focusing on specific, interesting phenomena. I can think of no weakness to this course as it was all extremely well-planned and well-paced. Expectations were clear, assignments were fair, and everything we did was fascinating.",
                "The material of the course is interesting, and Professor Zanuttini is a good instructor who can make complicated topics clear. However, the class did seem to move fairly slowly, with certain topics and concepts being reviewed many times. Though this may have been perfect for others, it was more than necessary to me and left me wishing for the class to move more quickly."

                "The virtual lectures worked nicely for this course. I especially appreciated that Raffaella took the time to help us get to know each other even though the course was almost entirely virtual.",
                "SUCCESSES: The in-person option for those living on campus helped increase my engagement with the course material and develop a closer connection with my professor and classmates. Posting recorded lectures was also helpful for reviewing particular moments of class when I needed to.\r\nNEEDS IMPROVEMENT: N\/A; I thought this course was well adapted to the virtual setting.",
                "Raffaella really tried to keep students engaged and I appreciated how she secured a classroom to Zoom from on campus (to use a real whiteboard) with a camera and even invited 5 students at a time to join her for the lecture.",
                "Because this class relies on looking at syntax trees, it was a little hard to see the whiteboard clearly, especially when students need to split the screen between Zoom and a note-taking document. It could be helpful to use the whiteboard function of Zoom, like we did effectively in section.",
                "There were some technological difficulties during the semester, including a few difficulties with using a physical whiteboard in a virtual zoom room, but these were not too difficult to overcome and didn't pose a significant barrier for learning.",
                "There was a strong effort to build community through introductions, group projects, and breakout rooms.",
                "I thought the jamboards during section and the chat feature during lecture worked well. Working in smaller groups on the jamboard allowed me to get to know other people in the class. While there was consistent participation in the lectures, I found that people who didn't talk as much (or at all) would use the chat if prompted in class. I thought the group assignments were a mixed bag. While I liked being able to work with other people, it didn't feel like that much of an added experience because we were allowed to collaborate on written assignments. Group assignments also ended up taking a lot of time between coordinating and checking each other's work, which was a lot on top of a written assignment.",
                "Discussion boards were not always the best way for engagement. I think that Section was great: our TF was very helpful. Group projects were fun as well. It would have been wonderful if we had had more office hours!",
                "I really appreciated that Raffaella assigned us a couple of group projects so that we got to meet new people from the class. I always felt very engaged with the online lectures because Raffaella asked us good questions to lead us through the content. She also kept me engaged with side-notes on interesting grammatical phenomena that are also explained by our theory or that challenged it (along with possible solutions).",
                "The lectures worked as well as possible -- Professor Zanuttini's whiteboard was legible on screen, which was very nice and not something I'd seen in a virtual class before. I think the breakout rooms tended to last longer than necessary, and I would have appreciated staying with the chosen groups for the whole semester (this applies to the group assignments as well), though I can understand the necessity of changing them up if some students felt the desire to meet new people."

This was my first linguistics class ever, and it was very doable and interesting. The first week or two are spent on more general ideas in linguistics, and I found the pace of the course material to be very manageable. If you're interested in the structure of language, how different languages are similar or different, or even just need a social science credit, this course is perfect. The professor and TF (thank you to Sirry!) are both incredible  friendly, understanding, and provide clear explanations  and the workload is manageable. This course made me really excited about linguistics, and I would recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in the subject.",

                "No. Unless you're a linguistics major and are required to take the course, don't. Professor Zanuttini spent several minutes nearly every day of instruction on \"introductions\" where students literally just introduced themselves to everyone. I understand the need to build community, especially during COVID and for incoming first-years, but really? It honestly felt a little demeaning to know that upwards of two hours of course instruction time were spent on \"here's student x and their interests include y.\" This is not what I came to Yale for. If I wanted to know about the various backgrounds of members of a group, I'd go to AA meetings.\r\n\r\nThe pace of the course was slow, especially at the beginning. A lot of time was spent reviewing topics; oftentimes it felt like the majority of time in a given class was just review. This course was among the least rigorous and challenging I've taken at Yale. Professor Zanuttini generally didn't provide meaningful answers to students' questions. Perhaps a pet peeve, but the homeworks were always formatted as Canvas quizzes, which I found didn't really jive with me; it would have made more sense just submit assignments as pdfs, especially since we had to usually upload pdfs of tree diagrams anyways.",
                "Yes, especially because it is a requirement for the Linguistics major. Otherwise, this might be a bit challenging.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. I got a really good view of how to analyze syntax in English as well as in other languages of the world.",
                "Probably -- the material is very interesting, especially if you like linguistics. The teaching is clear, so it is very manageable to grasp the concepts even if you don't have a background in linguistics. However, don't expect a class that moves very quickly."
