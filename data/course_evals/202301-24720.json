                "The biggest strength of this class was Professor Hobbs. He made the class interesting for everyone from student journalists to people new to writing. He was always available to meet and always followed up with detailed, nuanced emails that contained further thoughts and musings after our conversations. No improvements necessaryit was seriously perfect!!",
                "Strengths: Professor Hobbs was one of the nicest and welcoming professors I ever had. He was extremely communicative and frequently checked in on my progress while also being very understanding about setbacks and busy schedules.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The writing/workload was quite backheavy and perhaps more work could have been added earlier.",

Professor Hobbs' class made me fall in love with writing again (I seriously can't imagine a better reason to take a class). I really hope he teaches it again so that other students can experience his passion, support, and talent.",
                "Yes! I took this course with limited experience in a proper English/writing class at Yale and found this to be a wonderful experience learning from both peers and students who were more experienced in the field. I think working on a proper months-long project is an amazing opportunity that this course facilitates and Prof. Hobbs is an excellent guide along the way.",
