                "It's a pretty standard progression of learning Spanish. I feel like I advanced as a speaker, listener, writer, and I learned how to use Spanish to analyze literature and film.",
                "This class was most helpful in developing my speaking skills as we were expected to speak a lot with our classmates in partners and in small groups.",
                "Review and practice of spanish grammar focusing on culture and modern day stories or topics. Analysis of videos and stories in spanish.",
                "I primarily learned new grammar structures and the reading & analysis of difficult media (books, movies, audio, etc.). Additionally, there were elements of cultural exploration of various Spanish-speaking countries.",
                "I became more advanced in Spanish. Developed reading, writing, listening, and speaking abilities. Gained more experience with tenses like subjunctive, imperfect, future, and developed more complex sentence structures. Became more comfortable talking in spanish.",
                "Through this course I learned a wide variety of new grammatical structures, conversational skills, and creative writing skills that greatly improved my Spanish and will definitely prepare me well for SPAN 140. Grammatically, we covered the differences between ser y estar and how to use them in sentences, preterite and imperfect, subjunctive in nominal and adverbial clauses, the differences between por y para, negative and affirmative clauses, commands, demonstratives and possessives, the uses of gustar, prepositions, and more. Nearly all of our projects had a presentation component, where we would memorize the key points of our projects and present them without aids in front of the class. This helped me further develop my speaking skill  and gain a deeper understanding of the material. I enjoyed creative writing assignments, like the scene from Relato de un nufrago por Gabriel Garca Mrquez, that enabled me to represent my interpretation of the text and hone my creative writing skills in spanish. I also enjoyed the Libera al futuro project, which introduced me to the practice of historical and scientific research in Spanish and the process of creating an argumentative essay based on this research. I definitely plan on exploring this aspect of Spanish learning through my future Spanish courses.",
                "I gained skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening to Spanish. I also gained skills in creating presentations, scripts, and research. I gained insight on many interesting topics, such as deforestation, neocolonialism, art, and health."

                "I feel like I didn't realize how much I was learning until the end. That's definitely a strength. I think the standardization of the course across sections is a weakness. It felt like sometimes my professor wasn't quite in tune with the lesson plan--because another professor made it. It may have been a better course had she been allowed to make one.",
                "I enjoyed that the class was based a lot on creating your own presentations.",
                "Everyday practice makes sure you engage with the material. Some classes varry in assignments. There is a lot of in-class speaking but mostly with a partner which means sometimes the mistakes you make aren't caught or corrected. Group projects can be some what annoying.",
                "The asynchronous day is perfect; it provides a day in the middle of the week to have a break because this class can feel overwhelming. And it would feel even more so overwhelming if this day were not available. The course could be structured a bit better. Though there was a central syllabus, there seemed to be some disconnect between my professor and the director for L3. This led to a lot of confusion from everyone, additional unnecessary busy work, misunderstandings, and overall made class less enjoyable.",
                "Strengths: Speaking with fellow classmates was a wonderful way to practice using the vocabulary, tenses, and sentence structures which we learned outside of class. Supersite assignments were annoying and tedious to complete but generally helped nail down the usage of new techniques. Professor Santos was very lively, entertaining, enthusiastic, and really worked with the students.  The class is designed in a way so that the more you put in to it the more you get out of it. The more you participate in class and the more you speak with your classmates  the better you become and the more you grow.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course was honestly not organized well. My main criticism is that the Spanish department imposes the same standardized structure onto every single section, limiting each teacher's individual ability to teach how they want to. The result is a strong disconnect between how the instructors teach and the assignments that we're required to complete. \r\nAdditionally, class periods were usually extremely disorienting and confusing. We transitioned from one activity to the next so fast no one could keep track of what we were doing. The assignments were unclear and often seemed arbitrary. The canvas page was confusing and labyrinthian--it was unclear what assignments were due when.",
                "This course covered a broad range of topics and concepts in detail. It introduced grammatical tools in a comprehensive manner that allowed us to effectively use them in our projects and assignments. The projects were always engaging and interesting, and they definitely helped hone the Spanish language skills we had learned in class. Assignment descriptions were sometimes confusing. It was at times unclear how we should structure  and what we should include in  any given assignment. Having a clear rubric for each assignment would help students understand what they should include and how they should structure each assignment, which would improve their overall understanding of the course material.",
                "This course had many strengths. Assignments were very creative. I enjoyed the projects and ways of participation (groups, partners, to the class directly, etc.). One improvement could be on workload. If vhl, resumenes (summaries), and projects were better spaced out, the class could've been an easier adjustment."

                "Not really; my particular professor was pretty microaggressive and it ultimately took the enjoyment out of the class and learning Spanish. I would not want another student to go through what I wen through because it wasn't worth. If I didn't need the credit and had alternative options, I would have left my section immediately.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless you're really passionate about learning Spanish. My Spanish speaking and comprehension surely improved, but taking this class was honestly not the best experience.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class. The course material was fascinating, and the projects and assignments were engaging. They helped further my understanding of the material and enhance my conversational, creative writing, and critical thinking skills in the language. The workload was manageable, and the asynchronous work days were helpful to get caught up on assignments and to take some of the pressure off from the rest of the week. Overall I think this course is a great introduction into a wide variety of advanced topics in Spanish that prepares you well for further study of the language.",
                "Yes, especially someone that wants to continue learning Spanish. The course helped me improvement my Spanish skills."
