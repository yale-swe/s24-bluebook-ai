I was given the opportunity to learn from my mistakes through feedback and it allowed me to improve over the semester. \r\n\r\nThere are no weaknesses I can think of as I truly enjoyed this course.",
                "Strengths: Engaging, professor really cares about his students, lots of fun games, lots of time dedicated to review\r\nWeaknesses: It's hard to review vocabulary while not in class because the slides usually just show pictures, not words (and not the signs that go with them)",
                "Every class is so much fun and engaging. At the l3 level, I feel pretty comfortable having conversations in ASL so the group work and the turn and talking we do is so much fun. I think the journals are somewhat meaningless and don't help with learning ASL much. However, the textbook is very helpful and is really helpful in learning how to interpret finger spelling and different people's unique style of signing."

                "Yes. ASL is a great language to take at Yale, and it's especially great with Andrew. The program is relatively new, so the professors are still learning and trying new things with the program, but you can tell they're really passionate about it and building a community.",
                "Yes, I will always recommend to other students that they take ASL. It has by far been my favorite class at Yale, and I will continue taking ASL until I run out of classes to take.",
                "Yes absolutely. ASL is the best! It's gratifying and fun to learn and a skill that will be helpful when you least expect it. Also, the deaf world is so vibrant and wonderful to be a part of. Deaf humor is so sarcastic and witty. It's always fascinating to learn how to be funny in a new language and ASL is no different.",
                "Of course! ASL has been one of the most rewarding, challenging, and fun aspects of my experience here at Yale. The professors are amazing and undoubtedly one of the best parts of the program. The curriculum not only teaches you about a language, but about Deaf culture and community. I recommend ASL to every person I can."
