    "In this class, I learned about different concepts within social network analysis and how these can be indicators for different social ties and relations within larger networks.",
    "The course provided me with fundamental social network analysis theory with a lot of practical applications and observations in real life. There are some workshops on R as well.",
    "Learned lots, I knew basically nothing about sociology or R, so this was very enlightening for me",
    "Learned a lot of sociology concepts related to social networks: centrality, brokerage, social capital.",
    "I developed basic knowledge of social networks and how to conduct analysis on them.",
    "I learned a lot about social networks that I would have never learned otherwise. We read many cool readings which analyzed different aspects of society which I think is really cool. I learned how to work with R which is actually a great skill to have and pretty fun!",
    "Social Network analysis skills\r\nComputer network analysis skills",
    "Some foundational theory of social networks (papers) and very basic social network measures on R (centralization, etc.). Note: this is not a serious network data analysis class.",
    "theory behind social network analysis. how it applies to real social situations. some basic R."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this class is that it was a small class size so students were able to engage in deep discussions. Also, when we discussed the new concepts the professor made sure to convey them in such a way so that students were able to fully understand them and he facilitated this learning by including many analogies and real life examples.",
    "Only way it could be improved would be to make class time during the day. I found it harder to focus during a night class",
    "The strengths of the course was the professor and TA. Very supportive and always available to meet. I wish we were taught analysis techniques a bit more. It would have made the final paper less stressful.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I liked the assignments, the readings, and the essays. The class in itself was enjoyable too, we were able to have some laughs and cover all of the material.",
    "The professor made the material about the fundamentals of the theory behind social networks very accessible and was open to explain any areas of confusion. However, the class could've dug deeper into the course readings in class discussion.",
    "A lot of readings each week, but it's also a once-a-week class so what are you gonna do. Usually you only had to do the first 1-2 because we were all so engaged that we didn't get through all of them. We had 4 assignments that required R, but we were given really good instructions and our TF was really helpful in answering any questions. I think the seminar could use some more discussion between students regarding readings, but overall I really loved the class because Mattias is great and made it really fun.",
    "Strengths were that it was a very engaging course and the professor made it really easy for students with no prior experience in sociology to learn the course material and feel confidently about network analysis.",
    "Perhaps it was the class composition, but students were quick to sidetrack the professor and move the discussion away from class material. I would have liked more application of the theory as translated in data analysis assignments.",
    "didn't require any previous knowledge of sociology or social network analysis. it was pretty broad. It was so enjoyable to attend class, everyone laughed a lot, and we had a great time.\r\n\r\nthe technical assignments were sometimes poorly explained, and going into the final paper, I didn't really feel prepared to do the social network analysis that would be necessary."

   "comments": [
    "Even if you are not a sociology major, I recommend this class simply because it is so interesting! Social networks are so relevant to so many aspects in our lives and it was helpful to look at it in a more interactive setting.",
    "Yes, this class was really fun to be in. I highly recommend this class and this professor",
    "Yes. I enjoyed the class",
    "Yes. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Yes! It was easy and fun, and only meets once a week. Definitely a hidden gem and a really good 5th class because you'll actually look forward to going to class. 4 short homework assignments (given a week to do, they were all in RStudio) and one 10-12 page final paper doing a social network experiment of your own.",
    "Yes! It is a perfect course that left me feeling very fulfilled after class.",
    "If youre looking for a social network data analysis class, keep looking because this is a theory class. Low workload with really only one 10-page paper at the end of the term. I dont feel like I learned much, but maybe this was because other students sidetracked class discussions often.",
    "I would recommend this course. Mostly because professor smangs is a great professor, and there is useful things to be learned in this course, and it was really fun."
