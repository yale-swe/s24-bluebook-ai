                "The class allowed us to read and think about many different pieces of literature in new ways. However, there was a lack of consistency in depth across all the texts.",
                "Strengths - Prof does a good job of opening the students eyes to deeper meanings in the text, by pulling a part a single passage and showing us all the different ways we can interpret it.\r\nWeakness- he didn't ask the most insightful questions to prompt our discussion. Additionally, I wish he had cold called us at the beginning so that we could have learned the importance of participating in class much earlier on. \r\nFinally, there was no feedback on my writing, meaning literally no growth in my writing skills.",
                "The choice of literary works we examined in the class was very strong, which helped give us an idea of the progression of American literature over the course of history. In-class discussions were engaging and interesting, and contributed greatly to our understanding of the literature."
