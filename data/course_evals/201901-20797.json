   "comments": [
    "English 127 allowed me to deeply engage with texts that I never would have approached on my own. I learned to read generously and make unconventional connections between texts. Both Prof. Peters and my classmates introduced me to social, theological, and emotional readings that changed my experience of the texts.",
    "how to engage with literary texts in an extremely close manner, to question everything about a piece of writing (e.g. why written in that specific way, how does the literary device function in the work); also how to address and connect the different themes of literature (e.g. Emersonian ideas about nature)",
    "In this course we read the great classics of American literature. It is not comprehensive in this regard, but Professor Peters strikes a good balance between depth and breadth. Class discussions are some of the best I have ever had in a seminar at Yale. We read some more modern books that I had never heard of, such as Gilead by Marilynne Robinson and Thomas and Beulah by Rita Dove, which were excellent. This course will also make you a better writer. One of the most important things I learned in the course was that we can all become better writes by adopting the style and tone of great American writers we admire in our own writings.",
    "So many! I became a better reader and a better writer.",
    "Great introduction to American literature (duh) with attention to the ways that works deal with repeated themes like communication, meaning, place, beauty, etc. I think this class is really meant to teach you to become a more attentive reader of life as much as of literature. There is perhaps less focus on explicitly teaching writing skills than other WR credits, but that's because the focus is on taking inspiration from other mazing writers! I learned to love literature and even poetry, which I had never felt was very accessible to me before.",
    "I became a better writer and reader too. American literature is very interesting and profound and deserves to be examined.",
    "I would say that, overall, I learned how to be a better reader and by that, I mean being a reader with more patience, concern, and open-mindedness towards different texts and the themes, styles, and poetry they embody.",
    "This course developed my ability to use critical analysis of text to create both a cohesive and interesting paper of literary analysis. We also read some amazing novels and poems.",
    "I became a much better reader and writer because of this course, and I feel so ready to apply my analytical skills learned in this class to future courses both in the English major and in other courses.",
    "I learned about American literary tradition and close reading skills",
    "We read 7 books that spanned American literature and talked about what we read in class. Highlights include a deep dive into Whitman's Leaves of Grass and a very deep dive into Moby Dick. I think this class built in us a foundation of some of these essential works of American Literature.",
    "Great opportunity to explore my voice in my writing, instead of writing normal\/boring academic papers.",
    "This course provided me a jumping-off-point for studying American Literature throughout the rest of my Yale career and beyond. This class made me a better writer, reader, thinker and (I hope) person. Throughout the semester I was exposed to what have become some of my favorite books, and I was constantly challenged, excited, and amazed by the in-class discussions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: excellent texts, nuanced discussion, wide flexibility in essay topics and insightful talks in class and in office hours\r\nWeaknesses: The reading load is sometimes unevenly distributed -- toward the end of the semester, over a hundred pages of reading can obscure the in-depth conversations we try to have as we attempt to cover half a novel a day. This isn't much of an inhibitor, but it can make some texts harder to digest than others.",
    "strengths: in-class discussion was always at a very high and deep level; in-depth and engaging\r\nweaknesses: wish the class had more, less heavily weighted assignments than fewer, more heavily weighted assignments (so writing could be improved more)",
    "Strengths:\r\n- Professor Peters is an excellent seminar leader and cares about his students. He is brilliant and highly knowledgable about the books we read. He is one of my favorite professors at Yale and it was a great privilege to be able to take his course.\r\n- The readings (see above) are excellent. The workload is manageable. \r\n- Office hours with Professor Peters are amazing. He is a fascinating person and wants to get to know his students. We would often talk about topics that were not related to the course and I would greatly enjoy hearing his opinions. \r\n- Class field trip to Mystic Seaport was one of my favorite memories at Yale this year. We had a great time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish Professor Peters had more office hours, but I understand that he is busy as an accomplished faculty member. \r\n- I would have appreciated more feedback and comments on my essays to help me improve as a writer.",
    "The course is fabulous. Professor Peters chooses his books well, and makes sure they cohere well. He gives you great feedback, and is always kind.",
    "StrengthsProfessor Peters runs this seminar so well. His comments are fascinating but he cares so much about what every person in the room has to say. Class discussion was fantastic and it really felt like people were speaking from a place of caring about what we were reading. The assigned readings are also generally amazing. The assignments are very reasonable and it was nice to be provided with past essays that Professor Peters liked. Also, just getting to know Professor Peters inside and outside of class was a huge strength, he is so lovely! \r\nWeaknessesSometimes class discussion couldn't live up to the beauty and complexity of what we were reading, but that's only natural. Also, class at 9AM can be rough. I would have wanted to do a writing workshop more than once and also would have preferred for feedback on papers to be a bit more specific. The only other weakness was not getting to have class more often!",
    "Only strengths. This course was extremely enjoyable and Peters is fantastic.",
    "The strength of the course is its syllabus. Rather than reading a large survey of American texts, we get to focus on few texts. With this smaller reading load, I think we have more opportunity to close read, which seems to be an invaluable skill in all Yale courses.",
    "The strength of the course is that you do a lot with a little time, I felt that the books and material selected definitely were appropriate. A weakness of this course is that discussion goals could be closer. Sometimes it felt like we were discussing to discuss which was awesome, but maybe a targeted question or goal for each lecture could be helpful.",
    "The subject matter was great, discussions were interesting, the professor was brilliant and kind and approachable, and the readings were interesting. It was a perfect class. I will say sometimes I wish I got more substantive feedback on writing, but in the end I learned what I needed to learn.",
    "Strengths- engaging discussion; no significant weaknesses",
    "Strengths were the books -- all of them were interesting--, Professor Peters's kindness, it was always fun to go to his office hours, and the class -- we had a really nice, thoughtful group. Also our field trip to Mystic to see a whale ship was so fun! Weaknesses were the early hour (9am), there is a lot of reading and sometimes I wouldn't finish it, which would make for a difficult day in class. The essays are nice because you can write about virtually whatever you want, but there isn't a ton of feedback on them\/our writing in general.",
    "I loved the structure.",
    "Strengths: I loved almost every work that we read, but at the same time reading Moby-Dick was exhausting and crammed into a short period. I'm glad to have read it, but it definitely could use another week or two to fully appreciate.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't really name any glaring ones",
    "This course does a great job of providing its students with the texts and tools to examine American Literature, without claiming to give anything close to a comprehensive survey of the genre."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you aren't inclined to reading or writing, this course will offer you texts and discussions that are relatable, insightful, and will make you respect -- if not love -- literature. If you enjoy literature already, this course is a treat, offering discussions of anything and everything to do with the text.",
    "take this class! it is challenging to wonder at the reasoning and purpose behind texts like Moby Dick and poetry like Whitman's; Professor Peters is really good at opening discussions with a question\/query\/passage, but then allowing students to take the discussion where they'd like. even if you are not an English major, this class is a valuable one, as it teaches you how to truly and deeply engage with certain literary texts and just enjoy the beauty of them.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially with Peters. He is brilliant (shockingly, humbly brilliant) and the kindest, sweetest person. He goes out of his way to challenge and confront the texts and tease out what's interesting, all while letting his students take the lead and facilitating learning. The course itself is interesting and really important for anyone who wants to have a basis in American lit, and the way Peters does the syllabus is a really unique perspective that's hard to find elsewhere.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course with Professor Peters. Talking with students in the other ENGL 127 course, I think Professor Peters is the better teacher for this course.",
    "Yes! Professor Peters is an absolute sweetheart. He is so knowledgeable, kind, and considerate. Don't forget to go to his office hours. He took us all on a trip to see a whaling ship after we'd read Moby-Dick, and we had such a great time. He puts a lot of emphasis on class bonding, and he teaches both reading and writing very well. This is a must-take for anyone--not just English majors.",
    "Yes yes yes! It is hard not to love this class. I found it to be so well taught and run by Professor Peters. He doesn't just want you to understand literature, but really cares about where it meets you in your life. You become a better reader and get a greater appreciation for the complexities of America and of life through reading great books.",
    "To be a better human it is important to read literature, discuss it with peers, and analyze it. American literature is a great course that ultimately does that extremely well.",
    "I would recommend this course to almost any student. Whether he or she is an English major or STEM student, he or she can gain wisdom and writing skills from this course that will, undoubtedly, be useful in life.",
    "Yes, of course. If you care about American literature or literature you should take this class. If you want to learn how to write a better paper you should be taking this class. If you want to grapple with some intellectual questions about what makes a text American and what makes a novel a classic, you should be taking this class.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this course. Professor Peters is great and I learned so much from him. This course is incredibly valuable.",
    "Yes, definitely, it's a great way to explore these works of American literature",
    "Yes, because it's a pretty chill, low stakes English class, I think. If you're not a fan of Whitman-esque philosophizing, maybe don't take the class because you might find it a bit boring (everything seems to come back to Whitman\/Emerson!). But I think English and non-English majors could feel comfortable in this class of any grade.",
    "Yes it was AMAZING!!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student, regardless of their background with English\/literature."
