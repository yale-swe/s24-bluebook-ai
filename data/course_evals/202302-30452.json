Trying out embodied practices and writing ethnographies taught me how to awaken my senses and how incorporate them into my learning experience. The course brought me a new perspective of looking at the world, and inspired me to envision everything not from a human-centered perspective but a plant-centered one. (Also learned some nice recipes about bread making and cookie making!)",

I don't think this course has any weaknesses (other than the unfortunate fact that it is only available as a summer class). The only thing I didn't like was that papers were due at 5PM on Sunday instead of midnight. If you are working at a job or internship throughout the week and are primarily writing the paper over the weekend it is a big time crunch.",

It provided a dynamic and engaging experience through embodied practice, and the written assignments were both enjoyable and thought-provoking. I genuinely enjoyed this interdisciplinary class and believe it would greatly benefit any student who might be interested the combination of rye, writing, and women's studies.",
