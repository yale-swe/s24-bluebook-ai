I enjoyed meeting with my advisor each week to discuss my work, consider changes/improvements to my methods, and determine next steps. Also, the task of explaining my research to individuals who are not familiar with the field was more challenging than I expected.",

There's not much support from the S&DS department, so don't expect to be guided through the project. Also, start early (perhaps even the semester before). Dealing with messy data, if that is relevant to your project, can really cut into time spent working on it. Could be improved with more detailed expectations from the S&DS department. If you don't have friends in the major, it would probably be very isolating to do this class.",

The research itself was very intellectually challenging yet rewarding, and the final poster presentation was a great way to see the interesting work that other students produced. That being said, there is almost no structure to the course, and so each student is responsible for their progress throughout the semester. I would not call this a weakness of the course but rather a reflection of the real world. If you take this course, be sure you dedicate the requisite time necessary to be successful.",

You have the opportunity to work one-on-one with a leading researcher in the field of statistics (when else in your life would you be able to do this) on a topic in which you are interested. You will get close to your advisor throughout the semester, so the course also serves as a great mentorship opportunity.",
                "Yes, do a project instead of taking 425/625. It is good for you. I did both and I thought while 425/625 was super rewarding, 492 should definitely be hyped up more. It is so satisfying to work towards something big during the entire semester and be able to call it your own and submit it!",
