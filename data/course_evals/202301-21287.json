                "This was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale -- I would NOT recommend it. I did not enjoy the course (largely because of its disorganization) and I often had issues with the professor.\r\n\r\nI never knew exactly what I was supposed to be learning/doing, despite engaging with the class -- Professor MMP never seemed to give holistic feedback. For example, in the class, we had a project that ran through the course of the semester. There were issues with the first version of the project I submitted that she failed to comment on until I met with her the day before the project was due, which was extremely frustrating and unnecessarily stressful. Furthermore, though she emphasized \"approaching things slowly and enjoying the process,\" ironically, during every conversation I've had with her, it seems like she wants me out of her office as quickly as possible: she interrupts me excessively, often before she even understands what I am even asking, and comes up with hasty feedback which sometimes seems like it is formulated just for the sake of coming up with feedback and, again, getting me out of her office. She is also terrible at grading/giving written feedback -- I received written feedback only on one of three or four MAJOR assignments during the entire semester, and, though routine assignments are graded for completion, I randomly received an 80 on one of them with no comments. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I felt that what the professor wanted was for us simply to regurgitate what she had already been saying. Whenever a criticism was brought up, she never took the time to actually understand it, and often gaslit students into believing that she had addressed their question, even when it had not been fully addressed. (I have also talked to peers about this, some of whom feel similarly.)",
