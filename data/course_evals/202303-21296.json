                "This course taught me loads: I learned about the theories and histories of cartography, figured out how to do primary source research on cartography, and improved my ability to synthesize, evaluate, and compare historical methods and arguments. I also enjoyed how many topics and historical contexts we got to explore on the syllabus.",
                "This course developed my critical thinking and reading skills immensely. The high reading load and complex concepts were challenging at first, but forced me to adjust my learning style to meet the demands of the course. I gained an incredible amount of knowledge about the field of cartography and the way that maps are deployed as instruments of power. The seminar format lends itself well to this course as the dense amount of reading leaves students with a number of different takeaways each week and plenty to discuss. I valued each class and feel that I grew in my ability to read complex texts and extract authors arguments. This course also expected a significant amount of research to complete assignments, which challenged me in my writing and composition.",
                "I learned how to think about maps as textual sources, and improved my analytical writing abilities tremendously.",
                "This course taught me to see and analyze maps as texts. I also learned about the sheer variety of maps and the complex history of different mapping traditions.",
                "Maps and how to look at them through various different lens. Different historians who specialized in cartography and what they had to say about the status quo of maps. Different concepts around what territory is and how it was represented and reinforced through mapping. And how that creates identity."

            "comments": [
                "This course has really interesting content, and it seemed to be pretty much new to everyonewhich also meant that the class attracted people with diverse academic backgrounds and interests. The assignments in the first half of the semester (map analysis and map redesign) were challenging but also refreshing compared to other history class assignments that tend to require extensive (rather than narrow and in-depth) research. The in-class presentations we did for each assignment also were low-stress and generated helpful feedback. The final paper, though daunting, was also a cool opportunity for research. Overall, I think Prof. Rankin often had unreasonable expectations for the amount of research or work we could dedicate on assignments; for instance, he was adamant that I dig up everything I could on all the mapmakers whose work I wanted to include in my final paper.",
                "I wish that there was more opportunity for collaboration in this course. Students in the seminar format each focus on a different topic for the projects and gain mastery over a topic. It would have been interesting and informative to have more opportunity to share and learn from each other throughout the course.",
                "Strengths: This class involves a really different kind of historical scholarship than other courses, which I found very interesting. class discussions, interesting readings, cool assignments, lots of feedback form professor.\r\nWeaknesses: none really, I wished we had spent more time in the course on the readings.",
                "This course is excellent. The system of splitting class time between discussions and student presentations worked very well  I really enjoyed seeing what my peers were doing for their projects. Perhaps because of the high workload, the course managed to assemble one of the smartest and most engaged groups I have seen; I was truly amazed by the abilities of my classmates.",
                "My favorite part of the course was not necessarily the structured aspects but rather learning about other student's assignments and project ideas. I learned more about what the definition of a map can mean as well as understand different contexts of maps through them. It was also a great way to learn about people's backgrounds as this was a very diverse class in terms of demographics and what aspects of the map people wanted to specialize in and study further with the class assignments. I enjoyed doing the class assignments and felt they developed my skills of analyzing maps as visual messaging.\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think there are too many readings in my opinion for the discussions to be fruitful. There were often times we neglected some readings in the interest of time. I also think that the class could've been structured better in terms of timing. On average, about a third to half of the class (towards the end) is dedicated to hearing student presentations on the various assignments. We would always go over time and not everyone would finish within the time frame. Then again, this means that we usually only had 45 mins - 1 hr of discussion time. I didn't think reading 300+ pages a week for less than an hour of discussion time was fruitful and beneficial. We would just briefly coast through them and sometimes discussions would be general stuff about what people found interesting -- without going in a particular direction or talking about a particular concept. While we had discussion questions, those seemed more to be on the grounds of making sure everyone \"did\" the readings than to actually discuss them in class and attempt to answer them. Ultimately, I feel like it's a lot of work that doesn't really amount to much in the end. Reducing the readings or making the discussions more specialized would be beneficial. You might want to discuss a particular line or paragraph in a 300+ page book, but no one else in the class would remember that, thus making any discussion contribution very limited and superficial. And I don't think students are to blame as its nearly impossible for everyone to remember and discuss the material extensively."

                "Yes! Be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to this class, particularly the non-reading assignments. Prof. Rankin will not hold your hand through this course, and he has high expectations. But the material is really cool, and probably different than anything else you've done before. I feel like I've learned a lot and look at historical evidence differently than I did before this semester.",
                "Yes, if the student is prepared for intellectual engagement that it takes to participate meaningfully in discussion. Readings are heavy and can take many hours to digest. This is not the type of course that allows for a skimming of the readings the night before. Getting through this course was a challenge, as readings build on each other, though I feel there was an incredible amount of freedom in the individual projects to dive into concepts that are interesting to a student. This was one of the most challenging and rewarding courses I have taken at Yale.",
                "yes! awesome subject material and readings, class discussions are wonderful as the students taking the course are usually super self-motivated. lots of room for feedback from professor. be prepared for long readings -- we read around 1 book and 1-2 articles each week. the assignments are difficult and will take you a lot of time, but are super interesting.",
                "Yes it's a high work, high reward class. Discussions were productive and readings were interesting. And who doesn't love maps???",
                "Depends, if you are willing to do all of the readings thoroughly and have an interest in them, then this class is right for you. However, if you just want to look at various maps for the sake of curiosity this class might leave something to be desired. This class contains a lot of historiography and textual elements in addition to just maps where such is used to learn more about said maps. This is NOT a survey course about cartography. Don't forget the territory and identity concepts which are, if not, more integral and profound in the course than just looking at maps by themselves.",
                "Yes, this class is a lot of work and reading, but if you have the time to dedicate to this course it can be rewarding. Really fun to spend a whole semester thinking\/ reading about and researching maps!"
