            "comments": [
                "The strength: MIRA!!!! But also, the sections and TA's were very helpful. The psets were quite long and challenging but were really helpful to think through the concepts covered in class and was also really good practice for exams. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses. This class challenges you to think outside the box so please be sure you know what you are getting yourself into.",
                "Strengths include organized material, although the material is challenging.",
                "Not really any strengths or weaknesses in my opinion. Very average course overall. Not very hard but not easy either.",
                "Strengths: interesting final third of the course on insurance and risk, collaboration between students was helpful for problem sets, sections were surprisingly helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unnecessarily challenging psets; two different lecturers made no sense to me; both of them were too smart to teach the class, as they couldn't understand that someone didn't understand something",
                "Strengths- the course was divided into three modules with two different professors. This worked out SO WELL. It made a lot more sense and it was easier to understand the material. Both Professor Frick and Professor Reiche were INCREDIBLE. The organization of the course was very good as well. We had a quiz after every module as well as psets throughout and one final exam at the end. The professors allowed us to drop one quiz (the lowest one) and a pset (the lowest one), which I think was super fair and made the course less stressful--I hope they keep this aspect for future students.\r\n\r\nWeakness- Module II (Professor Reiche) was a bit disorganized and sometimes she went over the time. Module II's quiz was also quite unfair compared to the first and second.",
                "I wasn't a big fan of having two professors, especially if they have pretty different teaching styles. I loved Professor Mira so much and while Professor Soenje isn't a bad professor, I had major learning shock because she just moved at a faster pace that I was not used to before.",
                "Strength: a lot of office hours, recorded sections, review sessions,  partial credit on the written parts of exams \r\n\r\nWeakness: the ALL multiple choice first midterm was brutal. For midterm exam 2, we never learned how to solve the problem. Needed more mathematical examples that were more similar to midterm problem.",
                "An amazing course. I definitely learned a lot. The professor Mira Frick is amazing. Sometimes though, the lectures went overtime. Maybe in the future, lectures should be made longer so that we don't have to rush through the material.",
                "The problem sets could stand to use more numbers. As much as I love the Greek alphabet, there comes a point at which there are simply too many symbols to make any sense out of. Using more numbers would have been tremendously helpful.",
                "Strengths: PSETs were great to digest the info from the class, classes were structured well (powerpoints uploaded before class, topics were very clear), overall class was structured well (3 modules covering various topics), very generous with grading policy (switched from 6 PSETs to 5, lowest PSET dropped, lowest exam dropped)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: would've appreciated more guidance for exams (e.g. using section to give an outline of what we should know)",
                "I thought that the lecture slides were well designed and clear. I also think that the problem sets, while long, actually introduced some fascinating conceptual learnings that I wish we could have discussed more in lecture or discussion sections. I wonder whether the discussion sections could have been a little bit more interactive; at least in my experience, they essentially just consisted of watching teaching fellows solve problems, which while educational, could probably have been made more engaging.",
                "Strengths: Mira is a great professor and she pauses in lectures to make sure that every student knows what's going on. The support provided from profs and TAs are great and grading is pretty lenient too.\r\nWeaknesses: The sections could be run more efficiently since towards the end of the semester no one goes to live sections any more (at least in our section).",
                "This course was pretty bad, and I'm an economics major. It's not even that the content is that difficult, although it isn't a cakewalk, but the professors were not at all ideal. The lectures were longer than time allotted for because they couldn't get through the slides fast enough, and they also would get sidetracked in meaningless explanations on topics that aren't within the scope of the class when students would ask obscure questions mid-lecture. The slides were fine, and are the only reason that the class had any semblance of structure.",
                "Strengths: Very adaptable professors, always willing to provide help (at any hour), and reasonable amount\/difficulty of work\r\nWeaknesses: Two professors caused it to be a bit hard to adjust in transition periods.",
                "Mira and Soenje are amazing. They were extremely kind and helpful, and the lectures were very organized and easy to follow.",
                "the course was divided into three modules taught by 2 different professors. While it was aimed (I think) at providing more clarity and perspective it seemed disorganized and the psets varied widely in difficulty",
                "The course was organised excellently and the content was taught in an interesting, applicative manner.",
                "The course was well-organized. There were 3 modules, each dealing with a major general topic in microeconomics. The slides were very easy to follow, and the lecturing was clear. There were many practice problems available to be solved in preparation for the quizzes. It's difficult to think of a weakness, honestly; there wasn't really anything that could be improved. I suppose that sometimes, the problem sets felt very tedious and time-consuming, but they were critical for understanding the concepts, so it was okay.",
                "Strengths: Both professors were really good at explaining concepts during lectures. It was also nice to have one problem set every two weeks rather than once per week.\r\nWeaknesses: The first exam was tough and poorly organized (15 multiple choice questions, no partial credit), but the last two exams were definitely fair.",
                "Each lectured flowed right into the next and I think the professors did a great job organizing the course. I do wish we went over more examples in lecture to really drill in some of the techniques and concepts.",
                "Strengths: The TA's for this course were very dedicated to bettering the general learning environment. While very few people turned up to sections, they were helpful in summarizing the lecture material and applying the concepts with the guidance of the TA.\r\nWeaknesses: For a curved course, this class could have better designed exams.",
                "This course was great overall. The lectures were clear and relatively engaging, and the TAs were really helpful. I think in the future it would be good if the topics covered in section were a bit more similar to the types of questions that we would see on exams; sometimes these questions were just extensions of the material that did not help with exam preparation.",
                "The course did a good job of building off material from earlier in the semester. The structure was good at reinforcing previous lessons. The one class that I struggled to understand was the Robinson Crusoe market.",
                "Great course, only weakness is it's becoming a bit too much easier than the course in previous years, thanks to professors' generosity, I would like to see more in-depth discussions of a lot of topics though I felt I've only learnt very surface-level derivations",
                "Good course",
                "Strengths: The professors Mira and Soenje did their best to make the material interesting. Weaknesses: sometimes I felt like the problem sets and quizzes were a lot more challenging than what was taught in class. Also, a lot of what we learn is very theory driven, and it's difficult to imagine applying what we learn in real word scenarios.",
                "The strengths of this course were the professors! Mira Frick and Soenje Reiche explained all the course material thoroughly in class, gave psets that were relevant to the course material and exams, and provided many practice exams and review sessions for the exams. They were also very accomodating with online learning by allowing us to drop our worst exam score.",
                "Professors were phenomenal- clear that they both really cared about students. They allowed us to drop 1 of 3 quizzes and did a good job using our feedback to improve the quizzes and make them more like the psets so we could get partial credit on questions instead of all-or-nothing multiple choice. They also shortened the psets a bit throughout the semester. In class, the professors did a good job explaining concepts and taking questions.\r\n\r\nTA's: They were kind of hit or miss. Alvaro saved my life multiple times on psets and other TA's didn't do a great job of providing help. That's true for any class though.",
                "I liked the content of the course, but I think the math was described in a very overcomplicated way. It often felt like we were told to formulaically plug for certain scenarios, and the Edgeworth box was one prime example of just following the steps.",
                "The difficulty of problem sets varied across the two professors.",
                "This course was incredibly well-run and generous to the students. The instructors were not only great lecturers, but were extremely understanding of the students. They were the perfect balance between reasonable and lenient. The instructors and TAs also were super accessible if anyone needed help, which was great for this large lecture class. Honestly, I can barely think of something to improve upon, because this course was both so interesting\/informative and well-run.",
                "Strengths - \r\nThe professors. They were very accommodating considering the individual COVID-19 situations, constantly adapting the course and responding to feedback as well as making lectures and content as engaging as possible. Also offered a lot of office hours, review sessions and additional help for PSets and Exams\r\nWeaknesses - \r\nFormat of section was not ideal",
                "Strengths: we were able to receive individual attention and help through office hours, piazza posts, and section in this very big class. Professors were accommodating and adjusted assignment style as we proceeded throughout the course. Office hour times were very accommodating for people in distant time zones so I really appreciate that.",
                "The in-class lecture was not difficult to follow. I found that if I was confused, simply reviewing lecture slides and the recorded classes were helpful in gaining understand. \r\n\r\nP-sets were also appropriate challenging, and were great preparation for exams. I found that after doing P-sets, I understood the information better.",
                "-",
                "Very well taught, and it was interesting how the professors divided the course with teaching.",
                "Considering the virtual format, I like how rather than a midterm, we had 3 quizzes worth 45% of our grade and the lowest one was dropped. This allows great exposure to the types of problem asked on the final and didn't hedge our entire grade on one exam.",
                "The manner the class was taught was very well done and the material was made very easy to understand on an intuitive level.",
                "Strengths - Mira and Soenje",
                "TAs are great and very helpful. The content felt obscure and I saw no way to apply the knowledge I learned to the real world (except for the last module of the course about expected preferences and lotteries, which I actually found very interesting).",
                "While modules 1 and 3 were structured fairly well, I felt that module 2 was severely lacking. This might be due to the material, teaching, or some combination of the two. This was evident in the difficulty of the respective psets, quizzes, and final exam questions.",
                "I absolutely adored this course. The content is incredibly interesting in my opinion and very fun. I loved taking this more math-heavy economics. The class is also very well organized, and I felt like I got a much greater understanding of the course. The biggest strength of this class was the teaching, as both Soenje and Mira are perhaps my new favorite professors at Yale. They were both incredibly good explaining topics and allowing time for questions and uncertainty, very passionate and knowledgeable about this field of study, helpful, and amazingly kind and understanding. They recognized the weirdness of this scenario and constantly adjusted to make it less stressful and more enjoyable for us while simultaneously maintaining a very high learning standard. I was so incredibly appreciative of their kindness and knowledge.",
                "The professors were great at teaching and there was always a way to get your questions answered. One large problem set over the course of two weeks was a lot better than having one smaller problem set a week and made the workload manageable.",
                "I really loved the professors and the format of the course (I enjoyed how it was split up into 3 units, with the professors alternative the instruction). I also enjoyed the online section check ins, which provided additional time for practice with more practical aspects of the course.",
                "The structure of the course is really weird. Switching professors in the middle of the semester threw off my learning a lot. Prof. Frick, who taught Units 1 and 3, was very effective and her lectures were easy to understand. However, Prof. Reiche's lectures were not designed well and were difficult to use later to study from. I don't think Prof. Reiche is right for teaching this course.",
                "The lectures varied in quality. Not a lot of practice with the material outside of PSETS.",
                "Strengths: Professors Frick and Reiche are absolutely incredible -- good teachers who explain the material extremely clearly and good people who care about your progress and your well-being; course's strong ability\/willingness to adapt to improve organization and teaching in response to student feedback; solid overview of tough microeconomics concepts; third unit on uncertainty and information was especially interesting; great, clear lecture slides that are easy to digest and review. Weaknesses: Tough problem sets that I always wished I started earlier on, but maybe that's just par for the course; Whenever the math\/derivatives are unnecessarily challenging such that you get so bogged down in the math that you don't actually practice the economics concept and just get lost. I thought this happened too much on the first two problem sets, but then was not as much of an issue later on in the course.",
                "Quizzes did not really resemble the lecture material",
                "Solid intro to microeconomics. Good structure.",
                "Professor Frick and Professor Reiche were very understanding of the current circumstances with COVID. They were offering many office hours, provided lots of opportunities for group engagement, etc. The lectures were also very well-organized, which was very helpful considering the material got a bit complex. The first 2 months the workload was a lot, but the last month was very relaxed. They were both very nice and seemed very eager to teach.",
                "I was genuinely interested in the course concepts, and I felt like the professors went at a great pace.",
                "Both professors made the class",
                "Strengths: MIRA'S TEACHING\r\nWeaknesses: During the beginning of the semester the content we saw in class was poorly reflected on the PSET, just wish we had more guidance when tackling those problems. It got better at the end of the semester though.",
                "The course is designed to be a catch-all for mathematical microeconomics.  There are a lot of calculations and problem sets are very involved, but that is to be expected.  The course is organized the way it is, but I don't think there's anything to change about it per se.",
                "Strengths: The class was well-organized and clear. The psets were not completely insane (but still time-consuming). Both of the profs were really nice and their lectures had a good structure and clear notes. I would definitely say that this is the best Intermediate Micro class and especially Mira is literally awesome. Weaknesses: I thought that Module 2 (the lectures by Soenje) were harder and a bit confusing (with not enough examples) at times. Especially the Robinson Crusoe model was tough to understand.",
                "Strengths: The professors (Mira and Soenje) and their receptiveness to student feedback. After feedback from students on our first quiz (which was entirely multiple choice), they decided to entirely switch the formatting of the quizzes and allowed us to drop our lowest score. They were also always so quick to answer questions on Piazza, which I greatly appreciated, especially in the days before a problem set or exam was due. If Mira and Soenje teach this together in the future, definitely save taking this class for the semester they do so! I was EXTREMELY worried about taking this class, and honestly only took it because it was a major requirement, but they made sure students like myself felt comfortable with the material and had chances to improve their grades (letting us drop our lowest quiz and problem set, as well as making the final exam a take-home in teams). They were very clear in their explanations during lectures, and always uploaded everything in a timely manner. Considering I was dreading taking this class, it was surprisingly enjoyable in hindsight.",
                "Strengths: engaging professors, variety of office hours options every week, reasonable problem sets, assessments that matched coursework, and live lectures + recorded\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TA-led sections. I didn't feel like they contributed much value to my learning experience and understanding of the course. Very few students attended, especially as the semester progressed.",
                "The course is great, lecture slides are very organized and both professors are wonderful. Problems sets are very long and tedious, especially because they are biweekly.",
                "perhaps module 2 could be better taught",
                "Strengths: a very solid course with manageable and fair psets. The exams were straightforward and the pre-exam exercises give an accurate sense of what to expect. The professors are engaging and obviously try really hard to make the content interesting. All the course materials (slides, exercises, section practice, etc.) were well-organized and easy to find.\r\nNo particular weaknesses.",
                "Strengths: Mira is such an awesome professor. Also, everyone who ran the course was very accommodating during COVID. Student suggestions were implemented, which seems to be a rarity for econ classes. The class was also very well organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wasn't a fan of the two-professor format of the course. I don't have anything against Soenje, but Mira was such a great professor that there's no reason for her not to teach this course alone.",
                "There should be more examples in the lecture slides, often they left out a lot of work in the key examples to understanding the concept. This was sometimes frustrating. Other than that course was great",
                "This course was extremely difficult. Enough said. Unpleasant experience unless you are very good at math.",
                "The course was good in the sense that it emphasized conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization. One weakness would be that problem sets were long and tedious.",
                "The course was organized very well, as each unit built off of the previous unit and generally segued well.",
                "nothing in particular needs changing!",
                "Strengths- professors were clear in lecture; professors also communicated course logistics in a timely and organized fashion to students; there were lots of TA office hours to support student learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- problem sets and exams were not directly related to lecture slides, the latter of which were more theoretical; problem sets and exams were very difficult; the math in the lecture slides were sometimes not annotated properly (especially in the second module) as many steps were skipped and this made reviewing the material difficult.",
                "This course was extremely well structured and taught with plenty of help resources and flexibility",
                "Teachers are great and the three separate modules was an great structure.",
                "The course was very well taught given the circumstances; the lectures were entertaining, engaging and certainly the strong point of the class. As for the weakness, I would say the virtual seminars were less than excitingit was hard for the TAs to do anything but just work through the problem they were given. i would recommend having the TA sections require people be present, with cameras on, which might help the flow.",
                "The professors were incredibly generous and helpful. But the online semester was terrible. Mira and Soenje are excellent but the material was terrible to consume online. I learned a fraction of what I would have in person",
                "This class has many strengths which outweight the weaknesses. Mira and Soenje are two great professors who were very understanding and willing to give us many chances to really digest the Econ knowledge. The only weakness is that some quizzes were a lot harder than others, and in particular unit 2 was quite difficult, but that was negated by the fact that the lowest quiz score was dropped.",
                "This course definitely has some difficult concepts but I thought they were pretty well explained.",
                "I really enjoyed it as is to be completely honest.",
                "Strengths: the regiment of class. I like the 3 short classes instead of 2 long \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the switching of teachers",
                "This was largely because of the online format, but I found the first assessment that we had to be extremely hard to take. However, the instructors responded to the feedback from the students and accommodated by not making it all multiple choice and giving us more time, which I really appreciated. Overall, I thought that this course was very well done. The lectures were crisp and well-organized with clear slides, and there were plenty of office hours with the professors along with amazing TAs and peer tutors who were very helpful. I found the material to also be very interesting and thought that the course tied together nicely.",
                "I think some questions should have been taken offline, as many times the instructor did finish prepared slides due too a lot of the lecture being spent answering questions",
                "strength: Prof. Mira is super considerate and explains things VERY clearly. Prof. Soenje and Mira tries to make the course less stressful and as accessible as possible for us. \r\nweakness: psets are a little time-consuming and sometimes the section material does not match the content taught in lecture, especially in Module II.",
                "Strengths: The instructors were very willing to listen to student feedback, and the class was well-taught. There were also lots of resources for extra help. The exam questions were very doable.\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets were fairly long. Even though we were given two weeks to complete them, we did not go over concepts that were relevant to about half of each p set until a few days before they were due. I would recommend planning the lectures differently to accommodate. During the second unit, we consistently went well over the allotted class time. Class ran 10+ minutes over for most of this unit.",
                "Strengths: a good TA and Mira is great\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough practice example, Psets were a huge jump from material taught in class and extremely time consuming, and the first two quizzes were not given in the best way.",
                "Strengths: the professors! I have never in my LIFE come across instructors as understanding and flexible as them! Everything about this course was great - quizzes and PSETs were reasonable, lecture slides were clear and well-organized, SO many office hours per week, an active Piazza page, the professors were understanding of international students' needs\r\nWeaknesses: I personally don't know how I feel about group finals. It is very easy for someone to contribute absolutely nothing and get carried by the team. This is unfortunate in case another team worked hard, made a small mistake, and ended up scoring lower than the teammate who contributed nothing.",
                "Strengths: clear knowledge structure as the course is split into three modules; many examples shown in class that illustrate the concepts well; real life applications that can be related to abstract economic principles",
                "The teachers were amazing, the contents is a bit boring in my opinion.",
                "Strengths - Structured Lecture, Great lecture slides, many resources to help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Very long problem sets.",
                "I felt as if there were no weaknesses of this class. The professors were great, the material was taught perfectly, and they made class enjoyable. I loved this course.",
                "It is really helpful that there are frequent office hours. I think sections moved very quickly, and it was difficult to be engaged in them over Zoom. I think it would be helpful to be able to have a more personal relationship with TAs\/TFs and the professors, but to be fair, that was difficult because of remote learning, which was out of our control this semester.",
                "Strength was all the resources that were available outside of the lecture. I could access slides and recordings whenever I needed to.",
                "Strengths: Both professors were extremely engaging lecturers and were great teachers. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes Psets and exams lacked difficulty.",
                "Strengths: great instructor and TA support\r\nWeaknesses: lectures went a bit fast during Module II",
                "Strengths: ULA office hours are helpful, and office hours were offered frequently and flexibly. Questions in Piazza were quickly answered. Professors were friendly, considerate, and generous in their grading schemes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the TFs weren't very helpful. They would explain things really vaguely so as not to \"give the answer away.\"",
                "Pretty good lecture course and the professors were great, I don't think there were many improvements to be mae",
                "This course was very well organized and lecture slides were easy to follow with and without the verbal lecture. Graphical illustrations were common and helpful, and instructors were quick to change class model to accommodate to student feedback.",
                "This course is very, very educational, but also highly demanding and competitive. The course curve is incredibly unforgiving and thus makes collaboration both necessary yet penalized. If you can keep up with the really fast pace, particularly when covering markets, you'll come away with a wealth of knowledge.",
                "NA",
                "The strength of this course is that you learn the logic behind concepts in microeconomics. That said, some of those concepts were not well explained. The TF office hour that I went to was not really helpful (they tried hard not to give the answer away, but sometimes that blocked explaining the concept itself). However, the professors were very understanding of the circumstances this semester. I could see that they had tried to improve the course based on mid-semester feedback. Besides some parts in the first few lectures, the slides that they provided were also generally clear and helpful.",
                "The strengths were the very well put-together lecture materials and the excellent course structuring (both with Canvas\/Piazza and the communication between student, professor, and TFs. We were given many resources to help with our learning, and utilizing office hours was a necessity, but an enjoyable one. One of the weaknesses of the course comes from how intermediat micro is very math-drive. We learned equations for all of the concepts we went over and were always tasked with analyzin these equations in psets in questions that often times were more rigorous than the examples in the actual lectures. However, the professors were always super fast to reply on Piazza to any questions which would help a lot, and they would also sometimes make Canvas announcements with hints. Still though, especially in the beginning, the psets felt more like a test of our algebra\/calculus ability rather than our ability to use and build off-of what we did in class. With practice, though, the math generally became easier (there are only so many ways to maximize an equation lol)",
                "Weaknesses: I think the grading was a little lax, honestly we probably shouldn't have allowed dropping quizzes... also I would say quiz 3 was a little easy, and the final format was a little bit too vulnerable to dishonesty",
                "Multiple choice quizzes didn't really work",
                "Strengths: accessible course material, lectures were well paced and easy to follow",
                "This course was very efficiently run. Problem sets were fun, relevant, and graded very quickly, and lectures were well-organized, interesting, and easy to follow (even over zoom). I think that one weakness of the course was how simple the examples we saw were. Especially once the professors allowed us to drop a quiz grade, the class became a little too easy. The fact that 50% of people ended up with over a 95% in the class means that we could have handled more challenging material.",
                "The professors were knowledgable and went over the material well, and the TAs were pretty easy to reach with a lot of office hour slots. The largest problem was probably the lack of engagement that I sometimes felt in lecture, although I don't think there's much that could've been done to address that considering the large class size and COVID."

                "Both professors were really understanding, and due to the nature of intermediate microeconomics, the material was hard to learn ONLINE. TA's couldn't see my math work and often said \"it's just an algebra error\" which is the most useless advice ever. There was no collaboration in office hours. One TA single handedly carried the entire class during pset 2 and 4. I would give them a shoutout but I don't want them to get in trouble.\r\nOn another note, it was nice that Professor Frick had review sessions and prepared a \"Quiz 3: How to Prepare\" file.",

I wonder whether it would have been better to have two lectures a week instead of three, as I think that would have reduced the number of lectures I had to miss (and thus watch online). I appreciated the willingness of the instructors to listen to feedback and adjust assessments\/grading. While sometimes I thought they were a little too receptive, it did not really matter to me and I know that other students certainly felt more assured.",

They provided ample opportunity for virtual engagement during class, often implementing breakout rooms, calling on people who \"raised hand\" during lecture, and so on. In addition, they were always receptive to student concerns and adjusted accordingly to ensure that we weren't going crazy as a result of the workload.

Everyone learns at their own pace, and sometimes we aren't ready to solve an example problem right away. Oftentimes, when this happened, we didn't go over how the answers were found, which made solving problem sets much more difficult. Piazza was very effective for help on the problem sets, though. Additionally, the format of the first quiz compared with the second and third was a bit confusing. The first quiz was entirely multiple-choice, whereas the second was only 5% multiple-choice. I think this change reflects poorly on my understanding of Unit 1. The latter format allowed me to show my knowledge much better.",

In previous Econ classes, I would always struggle to rush notes down, but being able to rewind lectures as I was watching or slow down a concept packed with information was very beneficial to my comprehension. The slides are so well organized that they're good to follow regardless. The class had so many virtual Zoom office hours too (25+ live a week I think) at all different times that was nice to have even though I wish I had time to attend more. Biggest plus of the course and our two professors was their decision to alter the quiz format after Quiz 1 to allow students to demonstrate comprehension with long questions as opposed to all-or-nothing multiple choice questions.",

I also thought that it was less distracting to work on the psets at home.",

For instance, the numerous test and pset drops, as well as the hints during the final exam, served to boost everyone's grade into the upper echelons of the curve, which doesn't seem beneficial for the standard econ grade distribution.",
                "The breakout rooms could be improved as even after I joined it was difficult to interact, but the lectures themselves were fine.",

In this semester, a full 49% of the class received an A, while an additional 26% received an A-. While this lightened grading scheme made taking the class easier, it did not do much for increasing student engagement or learning.",

Sections were also designed for practice and allow students to engage virtually, and office hours were easy to attend and offered frequently.",

                "Strengths: asynchronous enrolment allowed; real-time interaction with students during lectures; two exam timeslots catering students in different time zones\r\n\r\nImprovement: there can be more breakout rooms during live sessions that allow for discussion among peers",
                "The teachers were very flexible and understanding and that was good for the learning process.",

                "The professors did an outstanding job teaching this course with all of the restrictions with online learning. The one aspect of this class that I liked the most was the option to watch a recorded lecture.",
                "This was an extremely difficult semester, and thankfully, the instructors seemed fully aware of that fact. Our workload and evaluations reflected the different circumstances of the semester, and helped diminish my stress without seeming to affect the quality of content we learned too much. \r\n\r\nHowever, it was clear from the performance distribution in this class and my other lecture courses that attempting a \"normal\" graded semester worked to the benefit of many students whose capabilities to continue learning were unheeded by online remote school, while leaving a smaller cohort of underserved and disproportionately disadvantaged students behind. I can only hope that Yale and the economics department in particular will begin the next remote semester with a more thoughtful approach to tackle this disturbing trend. The normal methods of advising, teaching, and checking in with students are not sufficient.",
                "It was really helpful that lecture slides were posted very consistently and usually before the lecture itself happened. It was difficult to be engaged with lectures over Zoom in such a large class, and difficult to meet other students in the course to feel more supported.",
                "This course did not get heavily affected  by covid, typical econ lectures would be held the same way in person.",

                "Having a lot office hours was pretty helpful, since the person-to-person engagement with professors and TAs was difficult to get due to COVID. Having the lectures being recorded was useful as well in case I missed a class."

The psets can be a bit long so please beware (and it isn't too bad because they are due every two weeks and you can drop the lowest grade).",
                "This is a challenging course required for the Economics major.",
                "Yes. It is an essential class to understanding the core of how the world works through economic terms. It is surely worth taking. I'd even venture to suggest it to non econ majors.",
                "No, unless you need it for the Econ major. There's no reason to take it otherwise.",
                "Yes: only if Professor Frick or Reiche are teaching it, it is divided into three modules, and the same rules (drop lowest pset, lowest quiz) still apply",
                "Only if they have to. Intermediate micro is an Econ\/?? other majors weeder course. It's intentionally made to make you NOT want to continue in a certain major.",
                "If you like and are good at math, yes. If not, no. If you have to take it for econ, it's not great but Mira Frick is a good professor so take it with her if you can. Soenje is good too, but Mira has slightly better energy if that makes sense.",
                "Despite this being a somewhat time-consuming course, I would recommend it. The material is engaging and applicable, and the professors do a good job presenting the material in such a way so as to facilitate student understanding. The problem sets are the longest of any class I have taken thus far, but they are graded fairly and (in general) are worth spending the time on to really learn the material.",
                "Take it if you need it for your major. Mira is a fantastic professor and teaches most of the class.",
                "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course. It provides a solid, foundational understanding of microeconomics. Although calculus is often used, the mathematical concepts discussed are not particularly challenging or deep; however, they can be difficult in the sense of being tedious and inviting the possibility of mathematical errors. This class, however, is not the easiest and often it is necessary to review the lecture slides after lecture to ensure that the material is grasped.",
                "I would recommend it if you want to learn mathematical models since that will be the bulk of what the course covers. Although this seems very theoretical and boring, both Mira and Soenje make sure that they cover the underlying assumptions and practical applications of the models, which I really appreciated and found fascinating.",
                "Only take this course if you are an economics major. If you're on the fence about the major, I highly recommend you put it off until your junior year, as you can take other courses that aren't so frustrating before taking this course. That way, if you decide you don't want to be a major, you won't have had to suffer through this course.",
                "Yes definitely. This was my first course in economics, and I thoroughly enjoyed it and now have a broad sense of what studying economics is like.",
                "for economics majors, definately. the course is interesting, no doubt, especially the third module about market failure.",
                "If you are an Econ major obviously but if you aren't super interested in microeconomic theory.....probably not. Just for the volume. If you don't care about work and want sweetheart professors, absolutely take it.",

                "If you're doing the Economics major, then you have to take this course. But, even if you're not necessarily considering Economics as a major, I think that the concepts covered in this class are interesting enough to where you could be justified in taking it as a QR. It's not as math-intensive as some of the other QRs out there, but it does involve a lot of maximization problems, so if you don't like calculus, then this class may not be for you.",
                "Yes, if you're an economics major. It's a pretty interesting class, although it's a major requirement.",
                "The course was well-taught and organized. It is quite focused so if you're not an economics major, I don't think it would be for you.",
                "This class is a requirement for the economics major and a prerequisite for other, higher level courses in the economics department (e.g. general equilibrium). However, this is not a course one takes \"just for fun\".",
                "I would imagine that most people take this course because it is a requirement, but if you can take the course with Mira, it is very enjoyable. Mira is incredible at teaching overall and makes lectures very engaging. The topics studied were interesting, and this course was significantly better than introductory micro since you come out of it with a genuine understanding of the math behind how markets work. Be prepared for extremely long and time-consuming p-sets, but the exams were generally very fair (though I'm not sure that the exams this semester were representative of the difficulty of exams in other semesters because the professors were unusually accommodating because of covid).",
                "Yes, I believe the course is structured well and flexible enough to be a good choice. It is necessary for Economics major, but even for a non-econ major I believe this class could be a good choice.",
                "Yes, must take with Mira and Soenje because they are good at teaching and very generous, make materials easy and accessible",

The mathematical foundation in the first few lectures is HIGHLY essential to your success in modules 1 (consumer - medium difficulty), 2 (firm and markets - high difficulty), and 3 (market failures - low difficulty) -- so be sure to take the time to know the Langrangian. The workload for each problem set varies, but be prepared to start them well in advance. I also think the grading for the three quizzes were very fair. If you take the time to form a problem set group with a few friends, attend your TA's office hours, and be attentive in lectures, you'll do well.",

                "Yes, even if you don't have to take it. These specific instructors are absolutely amazing lecturers and very sweet and understanding people. They were both reasonable and lenient, and understood the difficulty of learning during a pandemic. All instructors were super available all the time. The course material is actually really interesting, and the workload is super manageable if you do the PSET questions right after the lecture that the material was taught in.",

                "Yes - professors are great, not too difficult if you're familiar with multivariable calculus",
                "Not if it's not required. It's not as applicable to the real world as I thought it would be, and it turned me away from majoring in economics.",
                "Only if it is required for their major.",
                "I don't think it lived up to the tales of terror shared around Yale; if you put in some work and have taken 120 before, you'll be fine. If you're like me, you have to take it for major requirements anyway so not much choice there; but if you have to, don't sweat it. In general, the teachers were incredibly understanding in terms of the notorious econ curve.",
                "Absolutely, especially if you can take it with Mira and Soenje. This class is really fascinating, fun, and engaging, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The psets were fair and felt like a fun challenge.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in a degree that requires quantitative reasoning courses.",
                "Yes, however, only if its useful for their major or career path. Otherwise, the information seems like it would be rarely applicable in other areas",
                "If the course is taught by Prof. Frick and Prof. Frick alone (as it was Spring 2020), then absolutely. She worked with students well and was a great lecturer. However, if Prof. Reiche is a part of the course, or generally if the course is taught by more than one professor, I wouldn't recommend taking it. It's hard to get a general idea of the course when more than one perspective is centralized.",
                "Its a pre-req. Wouldn't take it if I didn't have to.",
                "Yes. I was not looking forward to the class going in because I had heard it was poorly taught, time-intensive, and difficult. Instead, I found it was extremely well taught, the material and theory interested me, and the course was very well-organized. ECON 121 ended up being one of the most rewarding classes I've taken here. You definitely need to stay engaged each week throughout the semester and it does require work (a manageable amount though), but by the final exam, I surprised myself with how I was able to string together concepts we had gone over into one final assessment. I've found that sense of growth and accomplishment at the end of a course rarer than I would have expected heading into Yale, but ECON 121 really facilitated it.",
                "If an Econ major yes",
                "Yes, although it was very tough",
                "If you are an econ student, you need this intro.",
                "Yes! It's actually pretty interesting.",
                "Yes, but only if taught by either Professor Frick or Soenje. They make the class",
                "Since you are probably required to take this course then yes. I think the middle of the course may the most confusing, but it's really nice seeing how all the skills learned in the first 2\/3 of the class are tied together at the end when applying it to real-life situations.",
                "If you must take the course, take the course.  But I would not suggest going out of your way for it.  It's technical, and unless a knowledge of econ is required for your field, the work isn't worth the reward.",
                "Thought the class was overall pretty good! I already tried to take Intermediate Micro with Eva once and did absolutely awful in the first midterm and had to drop it. I was so stressed about trying the class again, but Mira and Soenje were honestly really good at lecturing and giving us clear problem sets, slides, midterms, etc. I even found myself enjoying the course (which is rare in econ for me) and can definitely recommend it to you - especially if youre not naturally good at econ like me.",
                "Yes - if Mira and\/or Soenje teach it!",
                "Yes! Highly recommend having Professor Frick and Professor Reiche for the course. Also, this is a requirement for the Economics major so...",
                "Yes, even if the student is not math saavy. Both professors encouraged mathematical shortcuts and nothing very difficult was covered in the class.",
                "a requirement for econ major",
                "Yes. This isn't a particularly interesting econ course and many students are taking it for their major. But ultimately it does offer a deeper understanding of microeconomics, especially through a mathematical lens. And many of the theoretical concepts can be connected with the real world.",
                "ONLY TAKE IT WITH MIRA!!!! she might very well be the best econ professor at yale",
                "For this semester, yes, since the grading was beyond generous. Though I expect this would change on later, more normal years.",
                "Required. Unpleasant.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. The course introduced interesting applications of microeconomics in the real world.",
                "Yes. I feel that this course is generally interesting for all majors.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if it were required for their major.",
                "Definitely. Interesting, insightful, and well taught.",
                "Yes Mira and Soenje were excellent and easy to talk to - very knowledgeable and enjoyed their class",
                "Yes, especially if they want to be an econ major..., the models were interesting and I think the course establishes some fundamental ideas within the field.",
                "Yes sure",
                "Yes, Mira is a great professor and the Econ knowledge is pretty useful. The grades are also pretty lenient and they are willing to give you a lot of opportunities to improve your scores.",
                "Yes if it is for a major requirement.",
                "Only take it if you have to as part of the Economics major.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. For Econ requirements I usually recommend the course only for those whom it is required for but I really think this can be a useful course for any and everybody. It teaches a lot about behavior, includes some math elements, and the instructors are great. All of the material is highly applicable to the real world so thats a plus.",
                "Lol if thats what you want to do",
                "I would recommend to this course if they need it for their major but also if they are looking to gain a deeper understanding of economics. They should be prepared to put in a decent amount of work and should note that they would definitely be better prepared with some background in multivariable calculus. I think that this course is very valuable as long as a student is willing to put the work and practice into learning the material, as it can be demanding at times.",
                "yes. take it with Prof. Mira",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it really helped me understand economic concepts from a mathematical perspective. I like math a lot and definitely understand things better when there is a mathematical explanation for them, so this course was really great.",
                "Don't take it unless it's required.",
                "Yes! Especially if the same professors are teaching it.",
                "Yes. This class offers a very solid understanding of microeconomics and uses mathematics as a tool to approach economic problems. The instructors explain each concept well in details and are ready to answer any questions. Besides, the class does not require a lot of prior knowledge in math\/econ, so it is friendly to anyone who wants to take a try in economics.",
                "If needed for your major yes!",
                "Yes.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in majoring or simply learning about economics. This class was challenging in a good way and pushed me to become a better student.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in economics, as it is an important building block to studying economics further.",
                "Although this was a difficult course, this class was crucial in developing economic skills.",
                "Yes, especially if they want a solid foundation in economics.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, if you are an economics major or would like to learn about microeconomics in depth.",
                "It's a difficult course, so take it only if you have to for your major.",
                "Yes; great intermediate class with reasonable workload, pset about every two to three weeks.",
                "Only if you're ready to spend more time than you'd expect and will attend office hours.",
                "only if mandatory",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. While it took me some time to get used to the course since I took it after placing out of introductory economics, I enjoyed what I was learning. It really explained the math behind each concept and seeing that for myself was helpful. This course itself involves a lot of math, so if you don't like math, you might not find this course as interesting. As a side note, knowledge from multivariable calculus (MATH 120) does help.",
                "Professors were very accommodating given the strange circumstances.",
                "Yes, I think this course helps understand a lot what's going on in the world, economically. Plus, it's organized very well!",
                "Yes, the instructors were very good",
                "If you are interested in econ, but this isn't the easiest class I'd say.",
                "If you want to major in econ it is required. I would recommend it if you want to major in econ.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially to a student interested in Econ or math.",
                "Yes. The class is necessary for any Econ or Econ adjacent major and the material was interesting but not difficult."
