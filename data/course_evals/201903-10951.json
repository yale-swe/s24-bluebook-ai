   "comments": [
    "I gained a better understanding of the politics underpinning the Victorian period and an elevated understanding of what Professor Markovits calls the \"technologies of the novel,\" both of which greatly enhanced my close reading abilities.",
    "I gained a better theoretical framework with which to think about novels of that time period and more generally. Whereas I used to feel daunted by thinking structurally, I now, with Prof. Markovits help, enjoy looking at the big picture of how a novel is put together and how it responds to the conditions of its time.",
    "History of Victorian literature, with a specific focus on the literary interpretation of political events relevant at the time.",
    "Apart from learning about Victorian literature, I learned about how different writers interact with history and the time\/place they write in. Also continued to learn how to effectively develop arguments in speaking and writing.",
    "I learned how to think critically about political Victorian novels. In particular, I learned how to analyze novels through their courtship\/political plot lines and use of body, space, and time. I also improved my essay-writing skills.",
    "Improved my ability to analyze literature in discussion and writing form. Learned a lot about life from the books.",
    "Critical analysis and close reading of complex texts, reading lit. about texts"

   "comments": [
    "The books are, of course, incredible. However, the sheer amount of reading per seminar (often 200 pages + secondary sources for a Wednesday class!) often made it feel tough to meaningfully engage and make connections across passages. I felt like my mind was constantly swirling with ideas that I couldn't pin down, having often rushed to complete the entire reading. I know it would be hard to choose which book to cut -- and I'm not even sure which one I would recommend leaving out -- but I think the course would ultimately benefit by lingering a bit more over 5 novels instead of powering through a full 6.",
    "This course is really strong. I would suggest somehow splitting up the middlemarch reading, which is nearly impossible to complete in the time allotted. I would have enjoyed perhaps reading a few more popular works by the authors, since we often read less-well-known works. But the course is fabulous if you love that kind of literature and I do! Besides, the course asks some really important questions about the interaction of the political and the personal.",
    "Lively and informative discussions; wonderful readings. I wish there had been a way to space out the Middlemarch readings; it is a book that has to be read over time, in my opinion. It was unfortunate to rush through.",
    "Incredible strength is the professor - Markovits is absolutely brilliant and allows you to hand in full drafts of essays a week before the due date so she can provide edits. No weaknesses.",
    "I thought the course as a whole was great--my only concern was the fact that we read Middlemarch so quickly! I understand that Professor Markovits enjoys teaching the book and wants to expose people to it, but there was so much we didn't get to talk about, and I know many people were unable to actually complete the reading within the short timeframe. So I would suggest either switching Middlemarch out for something else, or spending less time on another book.",
    "Strengths: Professor Markovits always had thoughtful and insightful commentary, really elevated class discussions\r\nWeaknesses: way too much reading, inhibited us from reaching full potential of class material"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you aren't intimidated by the amount of reading you'll have to tackle, this is a wonderful class with a wonderful professor.",
    "Certainly. Anyone interested in the political novel and an introduction to Victorian era literature and society will be very well satisfied. A joy to read these books as homework; in fact, not homework at all. Simply a joy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It has been one of my favorites of my time at Yale. The syllabus is wonderful; I feel lucky to have read so many good texts. Professor Markovits knows them intimately and animates them for us. I learned so much.",
    "Yes, if they have time to engage with the reading! I think they will enjoy the class if they're interested in literature, history, and politics, regardless of whether or not they have previously been interested in Victorian literature. The readings and discussions are useful for studies of any type of literature. It's a particularly useful class for people interested in the intersection of literature and history.",
    "Yes - though some of the novels you will be reading are lesser-known, Markovits is amazing and her seminars are always intellectually stimulating. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and take full advantage of her willingness to read full drafts.",
    "Yes! This is a great course--there's a lot of reading, but if you would enjoy spending your Saturdays reading a Victorian novel, then you'll enjoy this class.",
    "Absolutely. This class provides you a unique opportunity to read great books and discuss how they relate to interesting political questions. Professor Markovits is also the best.",
    "Yes, but only if you are FULLY capable of doing (almost) all the reading. If not, classes won't be as fulfilling and you won't be able to participate as much as you'd probably like."
