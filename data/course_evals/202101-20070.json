It's hard to gauge when I don't have a frame of reference. I do think that the weekly sessions were very helpful in understanding the homework/equations more deeply.",
                "Strengths: well-taught, a good class to see if you want to major in astronomy, but also a manageable class to take for credit, especially if you've had previous experience in astronomy, concepts are fairly straightforward too \r\nWeaknesses: there is a lot of information to take in per lecture, it's not necessarily hard but there is quite a bit",

                "It's a fun course, and this is from the perspective of someone who didn't even get to the whole telescope viewing part due to the online format. Give it a go! The math is accessible enough that anyone should be able to do the psets. Despite being an intro course it never felt like what we were doing was boring; on the contrary some of the topics were quite complex (ie. relativity, cosmic microwave background, cosmological redshift etc.). Psets are usually pretty easy, but since is a astronomy course, numbers are often huge or tiny (stuff like 1.26E-34 m instead of simpler numbers) so I'd recommend checking stuff over with a friend even if you're confident. Lectures are pretty cookie cutter, you just sit and listen, but the content is pretty interesting (or when its not, it's easy enough that you only have to half listen) so it's fine. I think the course introduces a lot of large topics that recur alot, so you'll retain a of info! If you want to know more about the stars and space take it! I've literally no complaints about this course... except that the final was a tad long.",

If you've taken astronomy courses in the past though, the class is really a breeze. And if you have never learned anything about astronomy, the concepts introduced aren't really hard at all, but there's a lot of concepts to go through.",
