If we were ahead of the bench marker, he would not make us go back and do work that would not be helpful just to check a box; I really appreciated that! I also appreciated that our thesis was due long before the end of the semester, meaning I had a two-week break before the end of term and exam week. That was solid timing too. He was also understanding if there was a course-overlap, which gave additional flexibility and enabled me to take a course that was important for me pre-professionally while still staying well on track for his course and the writing of the thesis."

                "In a virtual format it was significantly more difficult to access library resources. They just took more time to mail and mail back than it would take to walk to a library and check out a book. Research just took longer than it does during a normal semester. I think it was also more difficult to connect with the rest of Yale, especially Professors who were not great at using zoom or regularly keeping up with their emails. People whose office hours you could normally just walk into were much more difficult to reach.",
