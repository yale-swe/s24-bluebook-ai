    "I learned about the history and culture of Southeastern Europe, both through lectures and through cultural experiences.",
    "I learned about the comprehensive history of Southeastern Europe from prehistory to the present. We covered a lot of different groups and certain ideologies through different time periods. Since Professor Besirevic is extremely knowledgeable and had first hand experience with the situations unfolding in this area, we could much better understand what was occurring before, during, and after the Yugoslav Wars. We also got to experience the culture firsthand while living in Dubrovnik and on the excursions.",
    "I gained knowledge about the history of southeastern Europe and the culture of people in the Balkan region through lectures and excursions.",
    "Professor Besirevic is a very engaging speaker and I appreciate her insights not only on regional dynamics but also on how the world works. I am glad that she talks about the most recent conflicts with a feminist lens and she introduced us to many wonderful people",
    "I learned how to write a coherent research paper. I also learned a ton about the culture and history of the Balkans.",
    "I was able to get a far better understanding of the cultural aspects that define the Balkan region and how they have been established over the years.",
    "I learnt a huge amount about south Eastern Europe and its history from the Romans to the early 1990s. I even learnt some Croatian language!",
    "Cant be described i got to feel culturally immersed thats all the knowledge you can have when studying abroad",
    "I learned so much about Bosnia and Southeastern Europe as a whole that I didn't know previously."

   "comments": [
    "I felt that this course's strengths were in its excursions and professors - I think the professors were excellent at presenting material in a way that is understandable, and I thought that the excursion provided the class with valuable cultural experiences. I felt that one weakness was that the class readings sometimes echoed exactly the content taught in class.",
    "I can really only list strengths: this course was absolutely amazing and probably one of the most enriching experiences of my life. Professor Banac and Dean B were extremely knowledgeable and could answer any question we could think to ask in class. Students got firsthand experience living in and learning about culture and the history we learned about was all around us. The workload was perfect in that we still learned a great deal while having enough time to experience all the city had to offer.",
    "The strengths of this course are the professors. Both professors are incredibly knowledgable and Dean B especially takes amazing care of the group and really just wants everyone to be low stress and enjoy themselves.",
    "I think that if professor Besirevic taught more about modern Croatia, in addition to Bosnia, I would feel like I gained a better understanding of place.",
    "The course and excursions were amazing! I cant think of anything to improve.",
    "This course allowed me to learn a vast amount about different cultures and lifestyles that I previously almost had no idea about.",
    "Strengths are the passion of the professors and their knowledge of the material as well as the location",
    "None it was great",
    "It was overall a great class that opened my eyes to many tragedies that occurred."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course - it is a way to learn about a region of the world that isn't commonly studied through intense cultural immersion.",
    "Taking this course was the single best decision of my Yale career.",
    "Yes yes yes!! This summer session class is hands down the best one. It is extremely low workload, just a weekly response to anything pertaining to class or the excursion or anything you want to research that relates to the topics covered that week. Class is an hour and a half each day and then you have tons of free time for the beach, gym, hanging out, walking around the old city. Every weekend is a group excursion that are super fun and usually just involve a lot of great food and fun times.",
    "Absolutely, worth every penny",
    "Yes, this course was well taught and presented the material in an incredibly engaging manner. Additionally, the excursions allowed students to relate the course material to their lives and experiences.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This class is fantastic if youre considering it please take it.",
    "Definitely! I was an amazing course! So glad I took it and met the people on the trip. So stress free and educational!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of this class and I think others should have a similar experience that I did.",
    "Yes, this is an incredible course in a beautiful location with passionate professors and interesting course material",
    "Yes. Great use of study abroad especially for people who cant travel during the school year",
    "Yes, do not miss the opportunity to have Dean B as your professor."
