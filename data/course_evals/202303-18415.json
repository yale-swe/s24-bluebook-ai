            "comments": [
                "The biggest strength was the flexibility that this course offered, as well as the accessibility. Flexibility came from the once-per-week meetings as well as the relatively lower amount of time investment needed to complete the work in the course. Accessibility comes from the ability to take the course and have a good experience even without prior biology or chemistry knowledge. For those who do have the right experience, this course will still be good because you can simply delve deeper into the iceberg of molecular anthropology. The greatest weakness is probably the essays in the class as well as constant presentations. The midterm, in my opinion, was just right but the final essay was too long. It should be about 10-15 pages, not 15 minimum. Also, the constant presentations every week made it pretty boring, but it does lead to a lower workload overall.",
                "The strengths of this course were the interesting material and ability to work with a group throughout the semester. However, this course was very poorly taught. The teaching staff held overly high expectations for student work, but were never prepared when it came to their turn to teach the course. I did not learn anything meaningful in this course, and I was extremely disappointed in the quality of this class. The teaching staff were not equitable in grading  across students and there was no clear rubric or expectations set in the course, with an example being some groups being asked 10+ questions regarding their presentations and others receiving 2. Additionally, the expectations and grading continuously changed throughout this course, there were additional weekly assignments added half way through the semester, and deadlines were never clear to students. Overall, I felt strongly that the staff were not prepared to properly teach this course.",
                "Audrey the TA was extraordinary",
                "Very interesting material, though could stand to be more instructor-led; was mostly conducted through student presentations which, while valuable, were easy to get lost in.",
                "Strengths: Pretty low workload, very nice grading.\r\nWeaknesses: Too many to count...1) We didn't actually learn anything. Prof Tucci taught material during the first like 2 lectures, and then the rest of the semester was literally just sitting through student presentations (20 presentations in total) and presentations from other researchers. 2) The class material was SO repetitive and boring. We would read a book chapter, and then sit through a group presentation basically summarizing the chapter. Then, during the final presentations, many groups presented on similar topics. 3) The final paper was SO long, we were expected to write 15 pages, even though we didn't actually learn anything during the course. 5) There was no feedback provided on any of the assignments, just a grade. 4) This course did not assume any science or biology prerequisites, so most students had a really hard time actually digesting the scientific papers we read.\r\nOverall, I think this course would be better suited as a seminar-style course capped at 15-20 students, so that we students actually DISCUSS the readings, and so that they only need to sit through like 3-4 presentations.",
                "Less student presentations, more actual teaching.",
                "I really liked the guest lecturers and having the chance to learn from experts in molecular anthropology field. The weekly homework was not too demanding and really got me to dig deeper into the material covered.   I really liked that we were put into groups as it gave me the chance to meet and work with new people.  Also, different people brought different levels of knowledge and were very willing to help each other out.  \r\n\r\nI wish there were two sections of the course just because I think the large enrollment of people didn't allow for more engagement in class.  However, this class became really full very quickly during add/drop so I understand that they probably did not have the ability to accommodate so many people on such short notice.  I also wish we had student-led discussions on what we read in class rather than just presentations on them because it would have allowed for more engagement and would make the readings feel more relevant.",
                "Strengths: the book we read in class was a very entertaining book. I really enjoyed the midterm commentary assignment. The first group presentation was very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were way too many people in the class for it to be a seminar. The guest lectures became redundant after a point. The second presentation was wholly unnecessary since we ended up writing an entire final paper as well. There wasnt enough time to prepare for either of those assignments.",
                "I was glad to have a science credit with no problem sets and no tests. However, this course has several weaknesses. First, the material is not always geared towards non-science majors despite the course being advertised as such, and so I found myself struggling to understand the guest lecturers and the peer-reviewed papers we had to read for homework and for our papers and presentations. Second, we spent 7 of the 14 class weeks listening to group presentations. The professor did little to no teaching during this course and I left feeling like I still didn't have a grasp on basic concepts.",
                "This class was easy for most of the semester, the final paper was hard but everything else was very breezy and easy to get through. Really nice and easy science credit",
                "Strengths are the great student lectures, engaged TA and professor, and our reading was very interesting.  I see no weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Interesting content, great speakers\r\nWeaknesses: Low engagement from professor, workload repetitive",
                "Strengths: the perfect science course for a humanities-centric student\r\nWeaknesses: Dr. Tucci gave one lecture the entire semester. She offloaded the teaching to guest lectures, student presentations and the wonderful TA who did her best. Eventually, Dr. Tucci stopped coming to class (and did not notify the students at all) and then only watched the class via Zoom, while the students taught each other on random topics that were tangentially-related to the class. The course could be improved by having the professor teach the course, instead of the students.",
                "I thought that the subject matter was interesting and the guest lectures were highlights. I struggled with the involvement from the professor and at times the class didn't feel very connected. I think more engagement from the professor would be helpful in the future."

You can also cater your coursework towards topics in genetics and regions in the world you are interested in.  I also liked having a group to work with all semester as you have people you can go to for questions easily and it relieves some of the burden of the coursework.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they are ok with writing a 15 page final paper that they arent going to receive much guidance on. Also, there was no real feedback on the final presentation which was disappointing as well.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student. If you are looking for a science gut, this class has two major presentations, a midterm paper, a FIFTEEN PAGE FINAL PAPER, and weekly \"questions and resources\" submissions. If you are looking for an interesting science course for beginners, you will find yourself confused and you will not learn much at all from this class. Overall, if you can deal with the workload and the frustrating nature of the class, it's nice to have a pset-/test-free science class and you don't really have to pay attention in class, but if you want to take a fulfilling class don't take this.",

                "Yes!  If they have an interest in molecular anthropology and learning more about human history, this course is for them.",
                "Yes, because it is a good introductory course, but be prepared for the papers and class presentations. The feedback is nonexistent, and the first presentation felt unnecessary to me. We recited back information on a book assigned or a guest speaker lecture.",
                "I would recommend this course for students who are confident in their presentation and essay-writing skills, because that is the dominant aspect of the class.",
                "I wouldn't because I felt that the work outweighed the benefits of what I learned. That being said, it is a good option for a science credit for humanities majors and subject is incredibly interesting."
