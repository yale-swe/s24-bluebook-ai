            "comments": [
                "This course would have been a lot better in person. The pre-recorded lectures were harder to understand because Prof. Keil was not shown in it and he talked very fast and with a hoarse voice. It felt like the live sessions were not super related to the course material unless we specifically asked which most people didn't. However I really enjoyed having Prof. Keil because he has a lot of interesting insights and the lectures would've probably been great in person. The final paper was horrible and I felt like there was very little concrete guidance on it, and it was just something I had to do but wasn't as relevant to the course. I liked that we got the final questions in advance but the sheer number of them made it stressful.",
                "While the exams were well-designed, the final paper instructions were very vague and difficult to navigate. It seemed like the TFs were just as confused as we were.",
                "Strengths: the information was very very interesting and the professor did a great job of covering so many subjects in such a short amount of time. I really enjoyed the book readings and felt that they were an extremely helpful addition to the recorded lectures. The TFs were very helpful and broke assignments down into more manageable bits. \r\nWeaknesses:  this class was a lot of work between the readings, recorded lectured, weekly sections, weekly response questions, and weekly discussion meetings. I felt like I was doing the work for 1 1\/2 classes.",
                "The recorded lectures were relatively useless. They were difficult to hear and understand, and lacked organization. All information could be found more easily in the textbook. Appreciated having the lists of exam questions in advance, but there were far too many questions, and a significant amount that were not nearly adequately covered in the lecture.",
                "The content of the course is extremely interesting and well-taught. I the final project could be split up into smaller portions so that its better organized and maybe a rubric or some more structured instructions could be provided. Prof. Keil is also very nice and knowledgeable in his field.",
                "Strengths: really fascinating content! I loved not only watching the lectures but also reading the textbook that was written by the Professor himself. (I think this is the first textbook I have fully enjoyed reading!) I also loved how fair the grading\/tests were. He gives you a list of about ~30 questions and he picks 5 you have to answer for the exam in class. I loved this style of testing because I felt I actually learned the material but with way less stress. You can basically be certain you get all the points on the exam because you prepare your answers before hand. But, since the questions are more of an argument than regurgitating facts, you actively engage with the material. I wish more classes used this model of testing.",
                "I think that a strength of this course was the high engagement of the TAs. I felt like they really motivated us to be engaged and to stay on top of our work.",
                "The prerecorded lectures allowed for flexibility, but I wish they were a little more polished. I did not find the live q&a sessions to be as helpful as they could have been, but section was enjoyable and helpful.",
                "This course is fascinating, and the content is fun to learn and exciting. It's applicable and interesting information! \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was the design of the class in terms of building towards the final paper; the final paper ended up being a lot to put together, and while the sections provided crash courses in designing experiments, statistics, etc, it would still be a very difficult assignment to pull off without more experience in taking other PSYC courses (e.g. Research Methods, Statistics, etc). \r\nSimilarly, the design for the exams also seemed inefficient \/ not as well-done as it could have been. The final was a random 5 questions pulled from a list of 20+ (on the midterm, 40 questions) that were given to students ahead of time. While it's an efficient way to make students review and study all the course content, it ended up being overwhelming and ultimately disappointing.",
                "I liked the material, but the lectures were sometimes dry, and not totally necessary for the exam\/paper. The textbook was also extremely dense, so I mostly skimmed or skipped it altogether. The live discussions were a good idea, but they were hard to participate in and in the end were kind of useless, despite Professor Keil's efforts to get us talking. The exams were also REALLY hard, and I most just ended up memorizing things from the textbook that I found while preparing. The final paper was really interesting but we didn't get enough guidelines\/ instruction.",
                "Strengths: Professor Keil is very knowledgeable on the topic and the material is very interesting. Additionally, the text is very clear and pairs well with lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is very demanding for no good reason. This semester your grade consisted of two exams and a large project. Each exam consisted of 5 essay questions that had multiple specific parts that required knowledge of specific studies to support your answers. A week before each exam, a list of 25-35 possible essay questions were handed out. This is insane. It takes a very long time to work through the study guide and the exam is not open note. The list should be shortened significantly or handed out way earlier. Needing to memorize that amount of information in one week is unreasonable. Additionally, the final project and final exam were within a few days of each other. The final project was meant to be worked on throughout the semester and the sections were meant to help with this. However, the sections did not do this effectively. They were essentially mini-lectures on research methods. It was very difficult to navigate such a huge project without consistent direction. I also believe the project was beyond the scope of the course since it required so much extra learning and resources during section. This is a 100 course that required a 5000 word research paper and teaching yourself how to use R. Super stressful.",
                "The course material itself was super interesting, but I wish it was a bit more structured. As a result, a lot of work is condensed during exams and at the end.",
                "Professor Keil is clearly incredibly well-versed in the field of developmental psychology. The course was interesting overall. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the flipped classroom structure. It requires a lot of self-motivation - all the learning of content comes from the student, and the live virtual sessions are just for discussing other topics or answering questions. I would have preferred a bit more live lecture, not just video recordings and reading the textbook. This format might work better for some students than for others, though. I also thought we needed more guidelines on the final research project - we didn't get enough guidance on how to \"make up\" data.",
                "weaknesses: the syllabus could be structured better; sometimes we had to read two or three new chapters + watch multiple lecture videos during the same week as we had an exam that tested us on that very material, so the material was a bit crammed in for some weeks",
                "Strengths: lectures were recorded and could be watched on own time, all the potential questions are given in advance so preparing for these is low stress, sections were informative\r\nweakness: lectures and book overlapped a lot- better to just read the book to answer the questions, the in-person component was not very well organized and was dependent on students to lead the lecture which was hard because it was virtual,  I thought the final paper was an interesting idea to introduce students to research but it felt like a waste of time because making up a dataset to analyze it just seemed unnecessary in a course that wasn't about statistics. Maybe something like a research methods paper where a student submits a proposal of a novel experimental idea would have served better. I remember finding it very uncecessary.",
                "The asynchronous style of this course was to its detriment. Students were not given the support they needed to complete course materials.",
                "I really liked the pre recorded lectures. I think the textbook was a good resource but it did take a long time to complete each reading",
                "Lecture slides could have had a bit more detail.",
                "I think the professor and TFs (mine was Tristan, she was great) were obviously very knowledgeable, responsive, and seemed genuinely kind.  A big weakness was the research paper assignment  I had really no idea what to do, even after discussing.  Again, I liked my TF a lot as a person, but the way the discussion sections were set up didn't really help me at all on the research paper.  I felt like I did most of my research myself.  Also, I think it would have been very hard without some background in statistics.  Additionally, I felt that the lecture videos and in-class time was interesting, but for the exams, the book was much more relevant  not good or bad, just something I wanted to note.",
                "It didnt have much consistent enforced work, just weekly readings and it was more difficult to keep on track with the virtual format and never actually having an in person class.",
                "The readings were really dense but the course material itself was really interesting.",
                "Seems like Professor Keil is a good professor in-person, but this class was not engaging this semester. The lectures were very slow and his engagement in the videos seemed pretty low. I understand that its tough to transition online so I dont want to speak lowly about the class. \r\n\r\nThe material was very difficult to find purposeful applications. Some of the questions seemed to have no significance and it was tough to persevere through that. Some of the topics were interesting (e.g. critical periods and social deprivation), but I would recommend taking this class unless you really want to pursue child development later on in your life.",
                "live discussions were very unstructured",
                "It was very difficult to stay engaged with the prerecorded lectures especially because the slides had very little content. This would normally work in a live lecture because you can focus on the professor but it did not adapt well at all to virtual learning. I was honestly very disengaged with this course which was disappointing because I was genuinely interested in the topic. You end up teaching yourself most of the content as you study for the exams because most of the material on the exams was not covered in class or if it was it was covered very briefly and only at a surface level whereas the questions went much more in depth. The discussion sections were somewhat of a strength- I didn't learn much from them since they essentially only focused on skills needed for the final paper but it was nice to have something synchronous. Synchronous lectures would have been a major improvement in my opinion and if that weren't possible then more content on the slides would have been helpful so that we could follow along a little better with the lines of reasoning.",
                "The strength was that the material was very interesting and the TAs and Professor were great. The weaknesses I believe can be mainly attributed to Zoom. The engagement was low because the class was so large and there were barely any cameras on.It was also very difficult to prioritize this class in terms of work. I think that we should have been encouraged to work on our research papers earlier on in the semester and have an official halfway point with something due. Most people seemed to start really working on it only a couple weeks before it was due. With the final 3 days before the paper was due, this time crunch was way too much.",
                "I think a strength was working on the research paper starting at an early point. It gave me enough time to prepare and think about my project before it was due. One thing the course could work on is finding new ways to make the lecture more engaging. Because we would read the textbook and also watch the pre-lectures, it kind of seemed like the lectures themselves were repeats of those things. Maybe we could talk about different things in lecture that still relate but maybe include different aspects which would make it seem more novel.",
                "The TAs were helpful and willing to provide feedback for the final project throughout the semester. However, this course's format had many weaknesses. For one, the weekly recorded lectures hardly went into enough detail. Some weeks the lectures would just amount to 30 minutes worth of content. I feel like this would not have been the case if we were in person, so I don't know why lecture lengths were cut down by so much. The weekly discussion format also does not work for a class that's supposed to be 60 people. Also, the syllabus stated that there would be weekly responses that would contribute to our grade but in the end, only our midterms and final project amounted to our final grade. It would have been nice to have more check ins that could contribute to our grade, like the syllabus suggested. The midterm dates also did not match what was stated in the syllabus and clarification for that was only given a week beforehand. Besides this disorganization, the lectures were often hard to follow with slides that were not helpful as well. The content was interesting but it was hard to engage with the course with so many flaws.",
                "Prof Keil did a great job with lecture and really asking questions that at first might not seem important but actually reveal a lot about children. Overall, the course was very well done, but I think for me it would have been helpful if we started the projects a little earlier into the semester.",
                "Class content is super interesting and engaging but felt disorganized. This class is supposed to be amazing but didnt translate efficiently to online. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very little guidance in terms of what students are expected to know for exams. There was no guidance on what to prioritize during the very short  lecture videos or in the readings  because everything was fair game. \r\n\r\nVery few opportunities for grades, only two exams and final projectSection didnt even count for a grade so few people showed Up. We also didnt have graded benchmarks for the final project so MANY ppl left everything for the week of the project.\r\n\r\nStrengths: final project was very fun. We received a list of possible exam questions a week before exams. Teaching team is very knowledgeable and very kind and helpful. Frank Keil is a legend in the field of developmental psychology, great personality too!"

                "I wish the course was more interactive. The basic ideas of virtual teaching were good like having sections to make it more personal with the weekly seminars. However I felt like the paper\/research component was not useful because the sections were kind of vague and outside of that we weren't given much guidance. I wish the sections were to review material from the class because it was hard to learn purely from an asynchronous way.",
                "I think the recorded lectures were successful, I tended to watch them on double speed but was still able to take notes and pick up the information successfully.",
                "I think this course could be reworked pretty significantly. The prerecorded lectures were really not helpful, and were pretty difficult to get through because of the lack of clear organization and difficulty hearing the narration.  There was a live q+a every week, but think that the questions discussed in these sections might have been a better fit for having an interesting conversation during discussion sections, where the group size is limited making participation more feasible.",
                "I don't particularly enjoy pre-recorded lectures because it's easy to get behind on watching the lectures and there is less interaction between students and professors.",
                "I liked the recorded lectures that we could watch whenever. It game me flexibility when I needed it and made studying for the exam a lot easier.",
                "I am a fan of video lectures because I like to take notes and pause the video and rewind when needed, so I appreciate those. I think the surveys were nice, but because they weren't required, I honestly would forget and not respond. I think by either making them required as a part of the participation grade where someone gets credit just from doing them would raise course engagement because more people would know what those questions were asking.",
                "I like the use of prerecorded lectures, but I felt a little disconnected from the course. Perhaps some short assignments throughout the semester would help.",
                "The prerecorded lectures were helpful and interesting, but it was easy to get behind on them. It was nice that each week offered an open discussion time for everyone in the class, but it was unclear what purpose it served.",
                "The recorded lectures were not good--the professor acknowledged this. It is also difficult to keep up with them. Live lectures would have been more engaging and would allow for questions.",
                "It worked as well as it could've",
                "Again, I wasn't a huge fan of the flipped classroom style, but otherwise, the virtual components of this class were perfectly fine.",
                "recording lectures was useful, maybe weekly response questions would have been better to maintain engagement because i didn't tend to watch lectures until before the final",
                "I liked the pre recorded videos. They were helpful and provided more productive interactions with the professor",
                "Again, I found it really hard to stay engaged in the discussion sections.  I wish we had talked more about the course material, or if it had to be about the paper, more specific things.",
                "The polls maybe shouldve been required for more engagement and more involvement in the weekly meeting with Professor Keil.",
                "I think if Professor Keil did live lectures, I would have been much more engaged with the lectures. The recorded lectures were hard to follow but during the live sessions, I was very engaged.",
                "Having live lectures would make the class a lot more engaging. The pre-recorded lectures were tough to engage with.",
                "I was not a fan of the pre recorded lectures. It was difficult to properly hear everything the professor was saying which made it even harder to understand what was going on. That being said I appreciate the effort to attempt to convert the course onto an online format. I also didn't find the discussion sections super helpful. Again, I appreciate the attempt to have some synchronous portion but it generally felt like a waste of time. I mainly enjoyed it because the TAs are super sweet and it was nice to see some friends once a week.",
                "I think this class would have benefited from being smaller while over Zoom because staying attentive during the class period was very difficult since so few people were engaged. It can be very intimidating to speak in a large class when most people have their cameras off. I wish more people had been required to have cameras on and make comments during discussions because it would have been beneficial to everyone.",
                "The pre-lectures were definitely helpful as they allowed me to get a good understanding of the material before even reading the textbook. Once I read the textbook, I then had an even greater understanding of the material. The combination of both sources was really helpful. Also, as I mentioned before, the discussion sections were also really helpful.",
                "Most of what I stated for strengths and weaknesses applies here. One suggestion for improvement is to combine the virtual discussion section and the lectures to all be live and recorded. The discussion section part could just be a breakout room segment.",
                "The recorded lectures felt almost pointless because the textbook had the same information but more in depth. They could be longer and more organized. There was also an issue with volume in the recorded lectures, very hard to hear Prof Keil.\r\n\r\nExams not administered fairly; There was no real way to prevent cheating Im  certain people cheated. We had zoom proctors yes but we had to to type answers on our computers, so how could the proctor tell if a student is looking up the answers or referencing notes? If theres a way to use lockdown browser Id recommend that instead.\r\n\r\nAlso why were the second exam and the final project due date less than a week apart? It was unfair because we had to study over thanksgiving breaks and then the week we got back we work on both the exam and the paper. The paper should have been due before reading period even started.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be more opportunities for grades because students didnt feel invective to go to section or the weekly large class discussion. I didnt even go to the large class discussion and did well in the course, although I didnt engage with the material deeply (thats on me). Ive heard from friends that The weekly large class discussions were intimidating at times and that it felt more like large office hours than actual class discussion. Much of this could be improved with attaching a grade to section and the final project benchmarks."

                "I would recommend it either in person or if some changes were made to the online one, like clearer videos, and to make a more realistic final paper (that isn't the entirety of a research project).",
                "If you're interested in developmental psychology, this course provides a pretty good overview. Otherwise, though, I do not recommend it. It provided a lot of information given in other introductory psych classes.",
                "I would recommend this course to any psychology major who wants to gain an understanding of a broad range of topics in child development. I would also recommend this class to any person looking to go into education.",
                "In a virtual format, I would not recommend this course to another student. I cannot assess the course when taught in person, but the adaptation to virtual learning was difficult to engage with and pretty uninspiring.",
                "Yes! This course teaches a lot of interesting content about human development and the current knowledge in the field.",
                "YES! I would recommend this course to another student. I think the content of the course speaks for itself- it is just fascinating to study development. The class is pretty straightforward and fair in terms of grading. I feel like there is nothing more you could ask for in a course. It is also very welcoming to first-years and non-psych majors.",
                "Yes, I think this was a fun and informative course.",
                "I would recommend this course only for psychology majors, specifically because the content is narrow and the final paper is a lot of work.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student interested in developmental psychology and learning more about how children come to see the world. The content was fascinating, and well-taught in the lectures; Dr. Keil offers meaningful takeaways that you'll be sure to take into your life as an adult, whether you have kids or not.",
                "I probably would, but I would prepare them for the difficult exams. You also have to be really interesting in psychology to be invested. I didn't watch a lot of the lectures after a while because they were dense and hard to keep up with. But generally, I liked the class and the final paper was fun, but difficult.",
                "No.",
                "I think I would recommend this to another motivated Psychology major; it is a rigorous overview and theoretically challenging but enjoyable.",
                "I would recommend this course to a psychology major or someone who is really interested in how children develop. I'd also recommend this to students who are very self-motivated and can learn well on their own!",
                "yes, the material is interesting enough and because you only have to prepare for a certain set of questions, the exams are very low stress. If you have been involved in research\/written papers before, the final paper is not a huge deal but for someone doing this for the first time (possible because this is a 100 level course), it can be pretty stressful and there is a lot of extra stuff to learn on top of everything such as making your own dataset, using a coding language to analyze it, make figures, etc.",
                "I would not in its current form. Perhaps this class engaged students more intimately in its traditional setting. The class did not adhere to a virtual format well",
                "Yes. It can be a challenging course but you get a lot out of it and the professor is very good. He really cares about his students as did the TAs",
                "Yes, the professor was very knowledgeable, and the TAs were extremely helpful",
                "Yes  Professor Keil is amazing and at least this year, so were the TFs.  The material itself is very interesting.  The online format did make things challenging, but honestly everything about virtual stuff is a learning curve.",
                "Its a good, relatively easy psych course. Youll also learn a lot about the research process.",
                "Yes! The course material is very interesting.",
                "Professor Keil seems like a really sweet and intelligent professor. I've heard that this class is pretty good in person so if you're in person go for it. It's a solid class to meet major requirements and also fairly little work if you want a social science credit. However, if it is online again I do not recommend it.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student but keep in mind you get out what you put in. If you watch all the prerecorded lectures, read the textbook, participate in the large discussions, and pay attention in section, you will learn so much. But, it is easy to get by without doing all of this until you near the exams. The material itself is very interesting and the TAs and Professor are great.",
                "Yes if you're interested in this aspect of psychology, but I'd only recommend if changes are made to the format of the course",
                "Definitely!! The two midterms and final research paper\/proposal might seem a little intimidating, but this class is so worth it! I was actually debating between this class and another psych class that was a bit more general, but I am very glad that I chose this one instead. I think Prof Keil is such a great lecturer and you can tell he is really dedicated and passionate about his work. If you are a psych major and are interested in development, then definitely give this a try. You really do learn a lot about children and will likely change your whole perspective about them. I suggest studying for the midterms a little early but other than that this class is not too much work and has very interesting topics.",
