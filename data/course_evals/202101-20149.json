                "Strengths of the course were the texts and the professor. Based on these two things, us students were able to engage in conversation really well and create an environment where we were all building off of one another's ideas. Professor was also really understanding with extensions regarding outside circumstances. Overall, I really enjoyed this course. No true weaknesses to this class except for occasional zoom fatigue.",
                "I really enjoyed this class overall. The discussions were interesting and engaged, the course content was well-chosen, and the professor was always incredibly supportive. He found a balance between pushing us to become better students while also giving us the guidance we needed to succeed. We discussed this in class, but the only thing Id say is that Coldness and Cruelty was very difficult to get through."

You will learn a lot, get to read a lot of interesting and provocative literature, and learn how to sit in the discomfort of certain topics while still maintaining a dialogue\/conversation about them. A lovely class taught by a lovely professor, and an amazing reading list.",
                "Yes! This was my probably favorite class I've taken at Yale so far. Michael was great and I really enjoyed the discussions we had in class. I also enjoyed looking at a wide range of literature and art including novels, poetry, plays, film, photography, collage, etc. The reading list for this course is also great!",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Abraham is very nice and facilitates a nice discussion.",
