I also think that the instructor feedback on essays was really comprehensive and genuinely helped me improve as a writer. It was also nice to be able to choose one essay not to write.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A few of the readings were not that engaging. Also,",

I think the course could have been improved just through different classroom dynamics; often, the conversation felt very imbalanced.",

                "Yes, I think it really improves your personal essay writing and lets you 'borrow' techniques that great essay writers have used. Also, you receive really great feedback on each essay! Having been said, it is more work than ENGL 114 because essays are graded more on writing technique than content, so you will have to revise your final drafts a lot. I would still recommend it as a writing credit though, especially if you are planning on applying to grad school and have to write personal essays in the future. I would definitely take ENGL 120 with Craig if you can because he's a great teacher/person!",
                "Yes! But there might be a better WR credit if you want to improve academic writing. Mine certainly improved as a result of ENGL 120 lessons, and the essays are a lot of fun to write (especially humor/satire!), but it's not academic writing.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was so much fun to attend every day. The reading was not too much, and it also felt helpful and relevant to the writing assignments given. I loved coming to class and could count on always walking out of ENGL 120 in a better mood than when I entered it.",
                "Yes, I would. It was a great writing class where you learned a lot over the course of the semester and for the most part the writing always felt fun because you had complete freedom."
