                "I learned a lot in this course, both in the content and the methods. I strengthened my problem solving skills, my ability to write proofs and to understand hard concepts. We had to work in teams in order to solve the problems, as they were too challenging to solve by oneself. Thus, I learned to explain my reasoning to other students and complete my reasoning with theirs.",
                "I learned the theoretical basis of statistical inference. We started off primarily learning about different finite sample estimation techniques (Rao-Blackwellization, Bayes, minimax, James-Stein, shrinkage) and related concepts (sufficiency, conjugate priors, exponential families). After that, we introduced hypothesis testing, which formed a strong basis for the last half of the course in which we talked about the asymptotic behavior of tests and estimators, Fisher information, MLE, and techniques related to these things (CLT, Slutsky's lemma, CMT, etc.).",

The latter half of the course covered more asymptotic and used results like the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers to show limit results. It was a super fast-paced course but really introduced these topics at a deep level.",

I know about different classes of estimators in low and high-dimensional settings and have an understanding of how to analyze them and what types of optimality or \"good-behavior\" they may afford.  I understand the process of analysis with Taylor expansions much better now.  I can finally understand the reasoning behind the 'trinity' of asymptotic tests and can also establish asymptotic confidence intervals.  Techniques to analyze the risk of estimators and the idea of thinking 'locally' asymptotically are the big 2 things I think I took away from this course."

                "The homework is really really difficult!",
                "Too hard. For every class the lecturer pours too much knowledge to us. I am a stupid person. I could barely catch the progress of Dr. Fan during class so I have to spend a lot of time reading my notes after classes. maybe could be divided into two semesters.",
                "Great course! The workload is a bit overwhelming, but you can definitely learn a lot in this course.",
                "This course is really comprehensive and I really like they way zhou taught. And I hope in the future, there will be the clear online videos in Canvas so that students can review the knowledge after class",
                "I think it would be better if we can talk a little bit more about the concept of convergence in distribution in the second unit of our course. Because  when it comes to Le Cams Lemma later in the course, sometimes its bit unclear. Overall I really enjoy the course! Its definitely challenging but fun!",
                "Provide an overall viewpoint of statistical inference.\r\nMaybe a little hard.",
                "I really enjoy this course!! The instructor organizes the knowledge very well.",
                "Prof. Fan is extremely knowledgeable and approachable. The course is very well designed and he is great at communicating its content. I would only recommend that the quality of the lecture recordings be improved since only about 1/3rd of the board is visible on camera. However, Prof. Fan's lecture notes are very detailed and helpful.",
                "I wish the course was broken up into 2 or 3 semesters. The material moved so fast it was pretty much impossible to build a first principles understanding of anything.",
                "Strengths: We covered a lot of important concepts and Prof. Fan is a great lecturer and great person as well. Assignments weren't too bad--as long as you started early--and both the professor's and TAs' office hours were helpful. Weaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths: the professor explained the material very well, and the problem sets reinforced our knowledge of the material. This was especially helpful in such a difficult, theoretical class where we covered a lot of material. Weaknesses: the lecture notes could be more clear as they were difficult to read at times.",
                "This course covers a very large number of very high level concepts. The assignments, midterm and final were very challenging, and thus help understand and retain the material very well. Having weekly assignments helped keep up with the fast pace of the course. However, the pace of the course was sometimes too fast and the material could have been taught more in depth, maybe with less chapters.",
                "Strengths: The professor and the TAs were both very involved. Problem sets were very engaging and time-consuming, but by doing the problems thoroughly and taking your time with them, you learned a lot and gained a very solid understanding. The material is fast, but not fast enough that you cannot keep up (provided that you show up to lectures, review material, etc.). Feedback on problem sets and exams was thorough enough that you could learn from your mistakes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I had taken Math 320/520 and S&DS 330/600 before taking this course, and I do not know if I would have survived without the maturity and some of the knowledge gained from these courses, so perhaps the prerequisites could be better emphasized.",
                "strengths: very all-encompassing knowledge of statistics\r\nweaknesses: too hard",
                "I liked the structure of the course and appreciated the alternate weighting schemes for calculating my final grade. It was also very useful to have the notes posted online after lecture since we tended to move more quickly towards the end of a lecture. \r\n\r\nMany of the exercises relied on computational skill, so there were times I felt I was understanding the course but would struggle with the homework because of a trick that was needed for solving or simplification. This may have just been because my background is not in statistics.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly smart and well-prepared lecturer, great office hours, useful problem sets for understanding the course material. Overall difficult class but the content and skill with which is it taught makes it worth it. Weaknesses: Lectures are very very fast paced and it was often hard for me to keep up with the proofs shown in class. This is compensated for by notes posted online and helpful office hours, but if the lectures could just be slowed down like 10% I think the class would be near flawless.",
                "I felt that this course was really hard and I felt that I didn't have a lot of support. One of the TF's was really helpful, but the other often got confused in office hours and couldn't answer our questions. The instructor's office hours were at a time that I had a different seminar so I couldn't go. More tutoring or help for this course could have helped alot.",
                "This course is great, Professor Fan is amazing and easily one of the best professors at Yale. He posts his lecture notes which are invaluable to the course. The only real weakness is that this course moves extremely fast during lectures. However it has to be this way to cover all of the material we were able to.",
                "I thought the solutions released for the homework were very hard to follow - more step by step  detailed solutions would have been helpful",
                "The strength of the course was the choice of material covered and rigor in which it was presented.  However, a few of the proofs were very long in the second half of the course, and I think a little bit of that time might be better spent affording some extra intuitions, reminding us of the \"big picture\" of all the apparatus we're building up, doing some extra examples, or perhaps touching on new topics such as semiparametric inference."

                "This course is a beast. Im not sure its required knowledge unless you want to be a quant or PhD. Covers a ton.",
                "Yes, if you want to have a solid background in statistical inference. The material in this class was definitely more concrete than that in previous algebra and analysis classes, so the whole experience was a bit refreshing. Still, be prepared for a lot of technical proofs presented in class. Prof. Fan does do a great job of helping you understand the material through his explanations and homework questions.",
                "Yes, this is a very nice first course for statistics students to see mindsets and techniques in statistics",
                "If you are interested in statistics and have the mathematical background, I would recommend taking this course. The course is a lot of work, but you come out of it with a deep understanding of theoretical statistics.",
                "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to any student who wants to have a very good understanding of the high-level theory behind statistics. I am very happy I took this class, solving the challenging problems requires a lot of efforts but it is very rewarding once we find the solution.",
                "Yes, but only if you have time and are interested in delving deeper into statistics at a more theoretical level. I would not recommend taking this course if you have any more than one other high-workload course, and it also might be overkill if you just need to learn enough stats for applications.",
                "Yes\r\nIt is useful and intrinsic",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I would advise them though to enroll with a friend or make a friend in the class. I was not a part of the programs that require this course, and it would have been useful to work on the problem sets with somebody, as they were probably intended to be solved that way.",
                "Yes, as long as you are prepared to work hard and take your learning into your own hands to fill in any gaps outside of lecture (since the lectures are so fast paced it can be difficult to absorb everything just by sitting in class).",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless they had a very high level of math theory and stat theory background. I'm a PhD student with a master's in statistics and an undergraduate degree in math theory, and I still struggled with this class.",
                "Yes!",
                "If you have a strong background in probability and calculus I'd 100% recommend this course. Personally, I took this course without taking 241 first and I wish that I had waited so I could have gotten more out of it. However, that being said it is possible to succeed in this course without taking 241 first if you are up for some self-study.",
                "This is one of the best courses I have ever taken in my life.  Incredibly illuminating.  But I'd only recommend it if a student really has the interest to learn why our statistical procedures are truly justified rather than just having proficiency in intuition/methodology.  Furthermore, they need to be much more mathematically mature than the Theory of Stats class and be willing to put an incredible amount of work in for the sake of having an acceptable grade."
