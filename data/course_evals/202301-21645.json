                "Amazing course, lower workload but tangible, small steps each week. There are 2-3 online quizzes each week where you can learn new material in an interactive way, and it doesn't feel mentally draining at all, however it is very fascinating if you are mildly interested in music. The knowledge and skills you acquire makes you feel understand music much easier. My main goal was to have a sense of music for the future, and I totally got this from the course. I will almost definitely continue with other music courses at Yale, especially 218 and 207, although I am not even close to being a music major.",

                "I believe that the \"robo-quizzes\" were very helpful in getting familiar with musical notation. The one thing I would hope for in the future is more of an emphasis on reading staff notation later in the course.",

                "I thought the course was great overall.",
                "Great course. Light workload, engaging teacher.",
                "I think 1 on 1 tutoring or smaller group sessions would improve this class since when we all sing as a group it's harder to tell if someone's off pitch.",
                "I really enjoyed the format of the course. The robo-quizzes helped supplement Professor Quinn's exceptional teaching extremely well.",
                "This course does not cover the basics of music theory as described. The material is extremely interesting and should definitely continue being taught, but in coordination with a more structured foundational teaching.",
                "Awesome class",
                "The strengths of the class are how the assignments help us understand the lessons we are learning and how we sing in class to help us know the pitch and tones. There were no weaknesses in this course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Quinn is very encouraging! He meets you where you are and creates a welcoming space for confusion. Weaknesses: The class lasts 75 minutes, which can feel long.",
                "Not much engagement",
                "I appreciated all the participatory exercises we did in class. I sing acapella and found myself applying the different concepts we learned in class when learning new arrangements for my group. I found myself forgetting the official names of some of the things we were learning sometimes it mightve helpful to have a compiled notes document of some sort on top of the robo quiz instructions.",
                "Everyone (from day one) knew that this course was being workshopped and developed as it was being taught, and so the feeling of having a bunch of disjointed components that only tenuously fit together was fairly pervasive (and acknowledged by Prof. Quinn as well.) Even so, the course was fantastic. Prof. Quinn is the consummate theory teacher. He cares so much about both music and his students, devotes so much effort to creating beautiful graphics and visuals to aid memorization and analysis, and overall is just a wonderful pedagogue who made every class an event to look forward to. As someone who dabbled in theory beforehand and never really \"got it\", Prof. Quinn's usage of the line of fifths (and insistence on focusing on chroma, sharpness [ti] and flatness [fa] in the scale itself) was truly unique and an incredibly effective way to learn theory. One strong suggestion I would have is to split the course into two tracks, sort of what exists in the Physics department (and what DSAC is trying to implement in the Computer Science dep't), namely - just because students come into the track with no background at all doesn't mean that some of them (e.g. myself) don't want to cover a ton of ground and get a lot of practice, far more than is generally associated with MUSI 110 (known as a \"gut\"). Making an intensive introduction to music theory track in parallel would be something I'd love to see and that I would have loved to have taken myself. In terms of the actual course materials themselves, I think Prof. Quinn is quite aware of what could be better, what needs to be scrapped, etc. (but just in case / some other thoughts: we never did anything with the melakartas after the two days we spent on them; I would have liked to see more discussion of functional analysis and a bit more roman numeral analysis, since it was mentioned altogether; it would be cool to introduce some maqamat [albeit very complicated with the course as is]; homework was nonexistent for the second half of the course and was sorely missed; the musical capabilities of the group were such that we probably could have used Sibelius/Noteflight/Musescore for the last assignment, which would have given us experience with an important set of tools for writing music; a lecture/section model would make good use of the TAs and would have been very helpful for me)"

This class gives you a solid foundation in scales, intervals, key signatures, rudiments of chords and harmony, Carnatic music, time signatures and beat, and in general is super important for anyone looking to be musically literate."
