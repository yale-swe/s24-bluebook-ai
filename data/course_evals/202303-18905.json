In addition to the basics, the course touches on more advanced concepts relating to biology. We spent a good chunk of time on probability, and built on these concepts to model biological processes (genetic drift, spread of a virus, diffusion of a drug through the bloodstream, flow rate\/velocity profile of blood in a capillary, and more).

                "The grade distribution was nice and I felt it was evenly distributed amongst exams, PSETs, and quizzes! However, the PSETs often covered things that were out of the scope of the class.",
                "massive overreliance on the textbook. the material is interesting, but for many of the psets (particularly those between the 2nd midterm and the final) the questions form the book are outside of any practical scope. i guess my main complaint is that for a course whose focus is practical life science applications, it seemed rather impractical.",
                "Strengths of this course are definitely the professor and how chill the course is (in terms of being a pre-med requirement). Professor Demers is one of the best intro-stem course professors I have ever had. She goes at a very reasonable pace and explains things very well. Also there are so many office hours with TAs (although I did not really go, but a lot of people did). Weaknesses is that the PSET every week is just annoying and sometimes hard questions, but the exams are super reasonable and often much easier than the PSETS.",
                "Strengths: great professor, helpful TAs, great incorporation of life sciences\r\nWeaknesses: textbook is hard to understand, psets consisted of going to study hall once or twice and copying solutions from the board, as in a lot of the problems were so beyond the scope that it was impossible to engage productively with the basics of the material and what we would be expected to know for assessments",
                "The biggest strength of this course was office hours and Professor Demers' excitement and love for the content. Her excitement and willingness to understand more of the biological concepts behind physics was incredible to see. I learned a lot from her explanations and her various analogies. I think the biggest weakness in the beginning of the course was that we didn't do a lot of practice problems, but towards the end of the course she really hammered down on examples from the textbook which was very helpful! The literal only problem I have with this course is the textbook. Unfortunately, I think its a very poorly designed textbook and quite confusing. The problem set questions are super broad and usually I'm not sure what the question is asking unless I am in office hours and the TAs explain it to us.",
                "Strengths: Professor was very nice and accommodating. Not too stressful usually.\r\nWeaknesses: Psets were not very reflective of class material. Very stressful.",
                "Improvements: More engagements with PSET material in class! Especially to go over past PSET problems that were difficult for students\r\nStrengths: weekly feedback from quizzes was truly taken into consideration. We appreciate it!",
                "Strengths - clear instruction, fair exams, passionate professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - some of the material felt semi-tangental and not useful for the overall study of physics. Some of the models were cumbersome and overly complicated. The PSETs were tremendously more difficult than the classes and exams.",
                "Interesting examples to help facilitate learning. Sometimes was hard to see how the concepts were introductory as complex math was involved in some concepts",
                "strengths - absolutely prof demers. the best lecturer. go to her office hours. i did not and wish i did. the quizzes are also a strength because they force you to be on top of the material (but are easy if you are). the tfs - like 1\/3 of the psets would not have been solvable w\/o their office hours. runze and veronica were especially helpful\r\nweaknesses - the problem sets are unreasonably hard sometimes. like, unreasonably. but otherwise the class was really great! exams are fair and align with the lectures and review problems.",
                "Strength: Prof Demers is a great professor! The lectures were engaging. I appreciated that she emphasized learning the material by allowing us to do test corrections, and not having us receive anything lower than an 85 for quizzes. Also, the study halls and office hours were very helpful!!!!\r\nWeakness: feedback on exams could be a little clearer and more detailed. It was hard to know where you went wrong in a problem when doing corrections so that would be helpful.",
                "Strengths: Professor Demers is great, lectures are generally well-structured, exams were fair and allowed corrections, expectations were relatively clear\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the psets were so far beyond the scope of what was covered in class that they took hours to complete and often required TAs to just walk us through every problem since we were entirely unequipped to do them ourselves, which felt like a waste of time and not conducive to any real learning",
                "amazing prof.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Demers is certainly a strength of the course. She is caring and considerate and sets clear expectations for exams. Her review sessions were helpful and she balanced covering material with review well in class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TAs for the course were often not particularly helpful on the PSets. Many of them had never looked at the questions before the session and simply did not know how to solve the questions. It would be very helpful for TAs to have a worked answer key to explain how to solve the problems to students.",
                "Strengths: Professor Demers truly does care about how we are doing and what topics need to be reviewed. The exams actually covered content we learned in class\/in psets, which can be rare in stem classes for some reason. Weaknesses: Occasionally a bit disorganized and lecturers were hard to follow, problem set questions were sometimes convoluted\/unclear.",
                "Collaborative learning environments outside of the classroom were always available",
                "Strengths: Prof. Demers really cares about the students and their learning, and about making the class accessible to all and a good learning experience. The P-sets were good learning opportunities as well. Unfortunately, study halls were not as great and often the TAs needed topics to be explained to them before they could explain the math to us -- the teaching team makes or breaks the course and some TAs were not great. I think making sure the TAs understand the problems\/have an answer key would be ideal.",
                "The teaching style was great, however the problem sets were very difficult and time consuming to solve.",
                "Sarah was a HUGE strength of this course. I personally fell out of interest with the course content after it began leaning more toward probability and statistics, but she kept me engaged the entire time.",
                "Strengths: exams are very fair\r\nWeaknesses: psets are absolutely horrible. Truly the worst part of my week every week. I felt so bad for the peer tutors and TAs because they would have to teach us so much material not covered in class but needed to solve the psets",
                "Strengths: SARAH DEMERS! Absolutely a gem. Sarah is sooo great with making physics fun. I've always viewed physics as an intimidating subject, but she makes office hours so fun, she really tries to make it a relaxed, productive, and comfortable environment for all students learning physics for the first time. After every quiz, she also always asks if you have any concerns about the class (you write down anonymously), and she incorporates student feedback on the course week to week, which I've literally never found any Yale professor do throughout my time here. Prof. Demers is DEFINITELY the biggest strength of this course. I'm so happy she's DUS of physics, I'm a senior but been having thoughts of .... maybe I should just... switch my major? <3\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes, the PSETS are incredibly long, and not the most helpful or accurate of what we would need to know for the exams, but I think Sarah does this to make it so people go to office hours and grapple with the problems. It's def. not hard if you go to OH, but just know that it takes time.",
                "Strengths: Professor Demers!\r\nWeaknesses: The topics did not exactly build on each and felt a bit random \/ more like math than physics",
                "Quizzes and exams are incredibly gracious and fair, easy required class. Psets go beyond scope of the class and can be intimidating and stressful. Prof Demers provides a lot of support resources and is willing to change in class discussions to help reinforce ideas. Lecture is not at the level of the psets and that makes it slow and stressful at times.",
                "I think that the PSETS were asking a bit too much as I did not benefit nor learn more doing them -- just forced me to go to office hours to have a TF explain the answer for two hours which I still did not understand after",
                "Strengths: Professor Demers is really engaged and enthusiastic about her work. I think the class was very straightforward, and not meant to stump students \r\n\r\nWeakness: The class had many students and sometimes felt slightly disorganized, it would've been helpful to have section with a designated TF",
                "Strengths: weekly quizzes were fair and used to ensure students are staying on top of the material, exams were fair and resembled practice exams, Professor Demers was incredibly passionate about the subject matter, PSETs were challenging but TFs were accessible at office hours for answering questions regarding the PSETS. Weaknesses: none; this course is very fair and nicely facilitated",
                "Strengths included the organization of the class.",
                "This class was very easy but I am not complaining",
                "Professor Demers' teaching approach boasts several commendable strengths. Her lectures exhibit a high degree of organization, ensuring a structured and comprehensible learning experience. The consistent solicitation of feedback through quizzes is a positive engagement strategy, aiding in the retention of course material. Her sense of humor, kindness, and understanding contribute to an engaging classroom atmosphere. The fairness of both exams and quizzes, coupled with the effectiveness of the review sessions, enhances the overall learning process. Professor Demers stands out as a favorite STEM teacher, demonstrating a rare commitment to student success and fostering a positive and enjoyable learning environment. This is particularly noteworthy in a lecture course, where personal connections can be challenging to establish. Her dedication to creating a fair, manageable, and enjoyable class is a refreshing departure from past STEM experiences.\r\n\r\nAreas for Improvement:\r\nTo further enhance the learning experience, there is room for improvement in certain areas. Ensuring that Teaching Assistants possess a thorough understanding of PSET questions and are adept at providing clear answers would address a current weakness in the course. Aligning the difficulty level of PSET questions with that of exam questions could contribute to a more cohesive learning experience. Additionally, incorporating more practice problems into lectures, which tend to be conceptual, could offer students valuable hands-on experience and reinforcement of key concepts.",
                "I love the structure of the course and do not think that anything should be changed.",
                "A major strength is the amount of office hours and other support offered for completing psets. The pace of the class was also very good and I felt like I was constantly learning and the concepts built off of each other nicely.",
                "Strengths: Sarah Demers is extremely kind, helpful, and responsive to students. Her lectures were generally very easy to follow and exams felt fair. Also loved the weekly quizzes to keep my on track of the material.\r\nWeaknesses: The PSETS are both too long and too hard. They felt like a stretch compared to the level of material taught in class.",
                "strengths: the TAs (especially Runze) were extremely helpful with the difficult p-sets, Sarah Demers is an incredible instructor weaknesses: felt like the psets were representative of what we were expected to know on the exam, but that was okay since the exam review psets were!",
                "Strengths: Prof Demers clearly cares deeply for her students and for the course. Good structure. Very kind grading. Practice exams accurately represented actual exams.\r\nWeaknesses: The PSETs were not very useful for my learning. PSET questions of a difficulty more appropriate for our level of physics knowledge, particularly the questions in the practice exams, would have been much more useful.",
                "Strengths: Sarah! She is incredibly brilliant and engaging. One of the best professors I've had at Yale. Truly incredible human being. Love that it isn't curved either. The students who took it were also wonderful, for the most part. I love how Sarah lectures. Class material wasn't too challenging either! Did not have any existential crises about this class, which is a win.\r\nWeaknesses: No Saturday office hours :( also the study halls got really packed and it was hard to get a TF's attention sometimes. The study hall structure could be improved. I would not recommend that a TF just does the problem out on the board, but sometimes they can't help it. It is helpful to have someone walk you through the problem instead of having them do it for you, everyone frantically copying what they do, and then going back to see how they got that answer. Could also be helpful to have more tables for PHYS 170, since the room sometimes got too packed and overwhelming and you couldn't get a TF's attention.",
                "The study halls and Professor Demers were easily the best part of this course! The teaching team is really there to make you feel supported, even if this is your first time taking physics. The p-sets, though difficult, are doable with study hall and office hours -- and in my opinion, were worth wrestling through in order to get the gist of the concepts. One thing was that sometimes the psets would not line up with lecture, which was a little hard to deal with.",
                "The P-Sets and exam material for this course are quite different, which made connecting ideas challenging. The textbook used in this course wasn't the best at describing new concepts, and the problems were often confusing and hard to grasp with the information given during lecture. It was almost impossible to complete a P-Set successfully without going to extra help sessions, which was challenging for those who had extracurricular\/employment committments in the afternoons.",
                "The biggest weakness of the course was the difficulty of the psets compared to class and exam material. The psets were purposefully more difficult to encourage working together, but no one knew how to solve the questions. So going to study hall ended up being practically a requirement. Sarah was amazing though. She loves the material and it translates when shes teaching.",
                "strengths: good teaching, really enjoyed prof. Demers' lectures, incredibly helpful TA office hours\/study halls\r\nweaknesses: it felt like biological applications were way more advanced than what we actually were expected to know (linear algebra and eigenvalues, for instance), so it was frustrating that we learned concepts broadly without really understanding them. homework was also unreasonably difficult and way harder than exam content",
                "Strength: there is a lot of support. Many TAs, office hours and study halls held every week mean that there are plenty of opportunities to get help. Professor Demers is also a really great instructor, and her lectures always provided a lot of meaningful information in a clear manner. Besides a few problem sets, most of the graded materials were all fair based on the taught materials. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the coursework seems excessive at times and deliberately out of scope for the course? One week's problem set assigned a question assigned with eigenvectors and eigenvalues which is material from linear algebra when only single variable calculus is required for the course. It was very frustrating to work on a question set when I did not have adequate prerequisite knowledge. \r\n\r\nI would suggest modifying certain problems or providing clarification for the level of knowledge that we were supposed to have before assigning a problem in a problem set.",
                "Prof. Demers is amazing and incredibly kind! She is very understanding of students and goes above and beyond to make sure they succeed.",
                "I really liked the structure of the class. The weekly quizzes were fair and helped me make sure I was on track with the content being taught and it was nice to be able to provide feedback every week. The psets were definitely very challenging but it was a good way to see how physics was used outside of the academic atmosphere. The exams were also fair and the review material and sessions were very helpful in preparing for them. The test corrections were also very appreciated and made me understand what I was doing wrong and allowed me to notice patterns in the mistakes I was making.",
                "Professor is incredibly kind and engaging. She covered material at a good pace (sometimes a little fast) and always made lecture feel fun. Her strong suit is conceptual teaching, while she can occasionally struggle with teaching the more mathematical\/formulaic side of physics. Also, the exams she writes are some of the most fair and accessible Ive taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nThe huge weakness of this course that seriously lets it down and could easily be rectified is its reliance on a pretty terrible textbook. The only reason they still use it is because the author used to teach the course or something. Get rid of it right awayit is invalidating a lot of the work Demers puts into the class to make it engaging; everything Demers makes is great - the lecture content and exams are extremely reasonable, interesting, and well structured for learning. But then, PSET time comes around and the bump up in difficulty is so unbelievably dramatic that you feel like you are taking two completely different courses. So, like every other student, you attend a peer tutor session or two, get stuck on ridiculously difficult questions that are irrelevant to anything you have ever done in the course, listen to the TAs give you the explanation of the answer, and finish your homework in the space of two hours or so. Theres absolutely no incentive to learn or engage with the topics at hand. You just go, receive answers, write them on a piece of paper, and tick a box. The textbook, which contains the PSET questions, is unbelievably cryptic, boring, and full of typos. Once in a while the questions are helpful, but usually they are far too convoluted. Demers is really good at writing PSET questions that test the topic at hand well while pushing us to consolidate our learning - why not just let her write the PSETs?",
                "Strengths: easy exams, recorded lectures & low demand during lecture, study halls were very helpful\r\nWeaknesses: psets were very difficult and didn't relate to course content & materials on exams",
                "Prof Demers made learning physics a wonderful experience. I loved being her student and am grateful for her kindness and support throughout the entire semester.",
                "Professor is really wonderful and engaging at lecturing\r\nWeakness: some of the course material felt less physics and more statistics oriented",
                "Strengths: professor demers is awesome and a joy. She clearly cares about the students and will do everything in her power to make sure you have an excellent time learning physics.\r\nNeutral: Study Hall and TAs\/TFs. If you go to the study hall you will get the answers to the psets, which is great, except I feel as the psets got more complicated answers were generally just handed out. I think this in part comes from the fact students didn't want to take the time to understand the problems AND there was a big intellectual jump in that we went from numbers with kinematic to theoreticals with diffusion equations. I think if students were encouraged more to read the chapters\/in class the jump from number to theoretical was slowed down students would not simply attend study hall for handouts.",
                "Strengths: The instructor was incredibly receptive to student feedback and engaging! Professor Demers is a gem!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too many students, not enough TFs for study hall. Some of the TFs who were present during those help sessions were extremely disengaged and unhelpful.",
                "Strengths: The course is beginner-friendly and there are many resources available. When I had any difficulties, I was able to use study halls or office hours to get help. The class feels much more relaxed than other STEM courses which helped me feel less stressed out and able to truly engage with the curriculum.",
                "Honestly overall a very strong course! The P-sets were intentionally tough, which had its strengths and weaknesses but really I didn't mind because it was a great way to keep up with the course. I enjoyed the different resources available with study halls and OHs, and professor Demers is a great lecturer! The exams were always at an appropriate difficulty.",
                "Strengths: Sarah Demers is a phenomenal professor who is passionate about physics and cares for her students. She teaches the material in a manner to make it readily comprehensible regardless of your previous experience in physics.\r\nWeakness: Attending study hall and office hours often wasn't very fruitful to aid my understanding of the content.",
                "Sarah is a great professor and the applications for the models we used were super interesting. The lectures toward the end of the semester became a bit repetitive and the problem sets sometime included content or math that we had never learned.",
                "I think we could have benefitted greatly from additional resources from lectures such as improved recordings in which we could see the work on the board, transcripts, and\/or a copy of what was written on the board",
                "Strengths are the weekly TA hours, Ed Discussion, and Dr. Demers' kindness and enthusiasm for teaching physics. The ability to submit corrections for exams was also a great help for refining knowledge of the course material. The PSETs seemed to not really relate to the content that is tested but it's a good intellectual challenge to work through.",
                "The strengths of this course are innumerable. Lectures provided a great introduction to content and they were recorded, which helped revise for the final. Problem sets were definitely harder than the exams, but going to study hall and office hours were beneficial.",
                "There are soooo many strengths. Sarah is an absolute legend. I love her and the way she formats the class, making it easy for everything to stay on track whether or not they come in with a physics background. Students are given the opportunity to do test corrections and regain 40% of any lost points, which is amazing for that GPA. I absolutely loved this class.",
                "The strengths were the study halls. The course could be improved if more practice problems were done in class.",
                "Great prof and teaching style. Exams were fair and not hard to do well in if you studied properly. But PSets were an issue -- they were often much harder and sometimes plain irrelevant to what we were actually learning in the class. Similarly, PSet grading was all over the place where people with the same answers would be very different grades for no concrete reason. Minus the PSets, I think this is a good class.",
                "The weekly quizzes were so important for making sure we kept up with the information. That is an amazing system that made the whole learning process so much more enjoyable. The problem sets were sometimes a stretch from what we learned in class and took too much time out of the week.",
                "Amazing professor! Psets are tough but many TAs available to help.",
                "I thought this course was great! Definitely one of the best science classes I've taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths: This course is well suited for students of different levels in physics: foundational concepts are well broken-down during lecture, making these topics approachable for less experienced students and are expanded upon to a depth that challenges more advanced students. Exams test foundational knowledge, while applications are highlighted in problem sets, thus giving students the opportunity to engage more deeply with the material without the pressure of being tested on it (for me, this made learning and applying the material much more enjoyable). When working to understand more difficult concepts on problem sets, students are supported by TFs and the instructor, and can work with their peers. Answer keys were provided for all problem sets within a timely manner, making past problem sets helpful review tools. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problems for problem sets (taken from the course textbook), and were, at times, unclear or unspecific. At times, clarification was needed, and responses were mixed from TFs.",
                "Strengths: \r\nLectures \r\nStudy Halls\r\nNumerous TFs\r\nWeekly Feedback\r\nWeekly Quizzes \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nN\/A",
                "I really like how the assignments are organized for this course that gave me a chance to test myself and learn concepts both in a group and on my own multiple times for low and high stakes.",
                "I really enjoyed the teaching style of this course and actually felt like the biological applications were incorporated well and made sense in the context of the course compared to other courses I've taken with a supposed \"biological applications\" focus. The weekly study halls were amazing, and I would not have passed the course without them so I greatly appreciate them and hope to see them again in PHYS 171. I also really appreciated that the exams were reasonable - there were no tricks, Professor Demers was not trying to make it especially hard for us, and everything on each of the exams was something that we could have reasonably figured out and done with our knowledge from the course. For a person with very little physics background, I liked the style a lot and found it very conducive to learning. \r\n\r\nI wish the psets were more applicable to the content happening in class. Oftentimes the psets were considerably more difficult than the content being covered in lecture and because of that required you to go to study hall to complete. I could almost never do any of the pset questions on my own. I wish they were more similar to the exams to give us more practice and a better sense of the level to which we need to understand the material.",
                "The mismatch between psets and in class content was a bit frustrating, but in general the class is great. If you go to study hall, you can get your work done and the exams and quizzes are very fair.",
                "The pacing isn't always perfect, but overall the course is excellent.  I learned a lot and it never felt overwhelming.",
                "Strengths: material is taught fairly well and there are many opportunities to practice what is learned (e.g., p-sets)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this isn't necessarily a weakness of the course but I just feel like I learned more about statistics and population modeling than I did about (the traditional) physics topics. For instance, we didn't really talk about torque.",
                "Strengths: The weekly quizzes helped me stay on track, so I liked them. Plentiful study halls were a huge plus. The course is very well-organized and communication is thorough.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: difficulty of the problem sets and sometimes lack of relevance to exam. Limited weekly office hours for Professor made it difficult to attend",
                "One weakness of the course was the difficulty of some of the psets. One week, we had to do linear algebra, which isn't a requirement for the course and I did not have experience with. In the second half of the course, I had to attend office hours and study halls in order to complete the pset since I would not have been able to do it on my own. Besides that, the course is great!"

                "Absolutely! Originally, I would not have taken the class if it wasn't a requirement for pre-med, but I actually enjoyed the concepts -- which I cannot say is the case for most of my pre-med classes.",
                "If you are pre-med, then yes! If interested in physics but not biology\/medicine, maybe take a different introductory physics course.",
                "I would recommend this course to any Pre-Med student needing to complete the physics requirement. It is fair, not too much work, and Professor Demers is great.",
                "i would actually just to meet professor demers! she's lovely",
                "I am just genuinely not a \"physics\" person, so I did not find the class very engaging but that was due to my own struggle to connect with the topics themselves. Professor Demers, however, was really great and receptive to student questions and feedback and also clearly cared a lot about our success in the course, which I appreciated. So if you need to take physics as a requirement and don't have a lot of experience, this is definitely the course to take.",
                "yes - much better than 180 and easier to get better grade.",
                "For a pre-med student looking to take physics, PHYS 170 is 100% the way to go.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who has to take a version of physics. Professor Demers puts in a lot of effort and certainly cares about how people are doing in the class. The topics and problem sets are more or less manageable. There is definitely a breadth of topics including statistics that does not always feel the most physicsy, so if youre really into physics this probably is not for you. I would also recommend people who have taken calc 2 already to take this course (might be pretty difficult otherwise).",
                "Yes! Though p-sets were difficult, they encouraged me to go to office hours and study halls which were places where I felt like I gained the most out of the class.",
                "Yes",
                "I feel like if you are not confident in your physics ability, this course is for you.",
                "Only if you have to take it.",
                "I would recommend this course only because of Sarah. She definitely made it worth taking this course.",
                "You dont really have a choice if you want to go to med school. If youre deciding between 170 and 180, I would take 170 because there is less math. Ultimately, you should just take whichever class your friends are taking.",
                "Yes! great way to fulfill physics for premed requirements.",
                "Yes if you are a biology-related major",
                "If you have to (premed\/prebiological science)",

                "Yes, if you need to take physics, I highly recommend take it with Prof Demers! The class is highly rewarding",
                "Yes, it serves as a great foundational introduction to physics.",

                "Yes! I actually think you dont need any prior knowledge except for basic calculus. Its a very fun and interesting class and it would be very useful to take for anyone interested in the world and concepts!",
                "If you're premed, you should definitely take this over PHYS 180.",
                "Yes, it is such a kind introduction to physics for people like me who have had no high school physics experience. I loved Sarah so so much and felt like the entire class was really accommodating to learning (ed discussions popped off, ample office hours, recorded lectures and review sessions, good grading system, no curve = collaborative classroom). I loved the biophysics focus because it connected physics to biological systems.",
                "Yes! If you need to take physics for pre-med, this course is wonderful. And it's also a nice breather compared to the other pre-med courses. You cannot take this course for the physics major, though.",
                "Yes!",
                "Yes! Definitely if Prof Demers is teaching, this class is worth it! You definitely learn a lot and in a supportive environment.",
                "If youre looking for a more relaxed intro physics course, Id recommend it.",
                "if you are pre-med and looking to actually understand physics, I would 100% recommend 180 over this. The grading for 170 is probably easier but it's honestly frustrating that you don't actually learn the concepts rigorously; instead you kind of just memorize a couple equations without understanding their derivations or anything. also the homework is so much harder than what is covered in-class",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. Overall, the structure, grading, and material in the course was fair. The course is taught with a biological focus from a non-standard physics textbook, so taking the next physics level up may be a better option for individuals looking for more standard physics lessons or if you have no interest in the biological applications many of the physics problems are adjusted for, but regardless, this course was great too.",
                "Yes!! If you have to take a physics class, I recommend this one.",
                "Yes! If you need to take physics or are interested in taking it, I would definitely recommend this course to others. The professor is great, the support is great, there are an abundant amount of resources at your disposal if you want to take advantage of them.",
                "Only if you must.",
                "Yes if you're taking physics as a requirement. But I wouldn't recommend it if you actually want to learn physics principles.",
                "Yes, if you need to take this class as a prerequisite for premed, take it while Prof Demers is teaching. She is wonderful!",
                "Yes if you are taking physics for a bio\/premed focus.",
                "Yes, if you need to take physics as a biology-related major this is the best there is. As someone who previously took AP physics, just know there is a departure from all of that after the first exam or so. Prof Demers is awesome.",
                "It's a lot of work. We have to complete weekly psets that were extremely challenging to complete unless you attended office hours. However! If you put in the work before exams (i.e. completing the review psets, re-doing the pset problems, etc.) you will succeed...and this is coming from a non-physics major whose only B in high school was in physics.",
                "Yes! Especially if you haven't taken physics before. This class felt very beginner-friendly and there are many helpful resources.",
                "I would! If you're pre-med, this is super helpful to learn physics from a more relevant perspective. Honestly, coming into the course having a distaste for physics, I left with actual interest in the things that we were learning.",
                "If you are pre-med and looking to complete your physics requirement, I would recommend this over 180\/181.",
                "It's probably required, but not bad at all! Don't worry",
                "yes i would. it was a really interesting class and i enjoyed it",
                "Absolutely! If you are premed and need the physics course this is a fantastic introduction to physics and Dr. Demers tries to tie it in with the MCAT.",
                "YES! If you are pre-med and looking for an introductory physics course, this class is for you. Professor Demers is wonderful and a great lecturer. Exams are fair, and she helps you on problem sets.",
                "Yes!!!",
                "Yes. It was a very manageable physics class and I enjoyed the teaching.",
                "Yes, good for premed physics",
                "Yes, absolutely, with Professor Demers.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student!! Professor Demers is a great lecturer, and the teaching fellows are wonderful. Make sure to the study halls for help on the psets - they are incredibly helpful!",
                "yes, it was perfect for pre-med physics requirement. relevant to what I want to study and also went over everything for MCAT.",
                "If you need to take a physics course for medical school or are interested in biological modeling, this course might be a good fit! Sarah Demers is a really engaging lecturer and does a good job of presenting concepts in a digestible way (especially foundational physics concepts  if you havent had physics prior to college, this class is a good starting point). I really enjoyed the applications that this course touched on, and I actually looked forward to attending this class. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets for this course are more advanced than the material that is covered in class, which can be frustrating at times. However, there are several opportunities to work on the p-sets with other students and to discuss questions with TFs. Just know going in that you will probably need to devote around two hours a week to office hours and one or two hours outside of office hours to complete the homework  if you take this time, the problems are doable (sometimes you will need a bit of guidance from TFs or the professor). That said, the exams for this course are completely reasonable  they test foundational, conceptual understanding and are at a lower level than the p-sets (if you are able to keep up with lecture, and have a grasp on foundational concepts, youll be good to go). Sarah provides practice problem sets for exams to help students get a feel for the types of questions that are asked on exams. I would not recommend this course to someone interested in majoring in physics or engineering (Sarah herself will tell you this course does not provide the necessary foundation for those fields of study)  I believe PHYS 180\/181 would be recommended.",
                "Absolutely. The professor was incredible, the format of the course was consistent. Overall experience was phenomenal.",
                "Yes! If you are pre-med and need to take physics, this class is great. It is not too daunting if you do not know physics, but also not too easy if you do. It also has super interesting applications, and Professor Demers is so enthusiastic.",
                "If you need to take physics for your major, sure. If you like biology, sure. I think almost everyone in this course is only here because we have to be, and I don't think you should take this course if that's not the case for you. If you're looking for a physics course simply out of interest for physics, there are many other, better courses for that. But, if you need to take physics, this is a great option.",
                "I would definitely recommend PHYS 170 to any student who needs to take physics for premed or a bio major. The course is very manageable and the content is much more relevant to biomedical applications than general physics.",
                "If you have to take physics, this is the one to take!!!",
                "Yes, I just would really stress that this course is statistics heavy in a sense.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any pre-med or anyone else who might need to take this course.",
                "If you need to take physics, I highly recommend doing PHYS 170 over 180! Professor Demers is wonderful, lectures and psets were comprehensive, and there were many office hours\/study halls throughout the week. I also appreciated how she would listen and respond to our feedback and comments on the weekly quizzes!",
                "One of the best courses I have ever taken here. The content taught in the class matched up with the questions asked on the tests."
