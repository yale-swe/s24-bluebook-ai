Lots of readings from within the Marxist\/leftist intellectual tradition.",
                "Learned so much about modern intellectual activity in Europe, and their relationship to political and social action. An incredible selection of readings with some, like Gramsci and Benjamin, that I haven't seen covered in another course at Yale. Really liked the political balance of the course as well, a good range of Marxist analysis and some more conservative critiques.",
                "It was really interesting to study intellectuals themselves -- rather than to look at intellectuals just for reference into a particular time or idea.",
                "I understood the development of various European intellectual traditions, as well as how intellectuals have viewed themselves. The class has given me clarity into how I should pursue my own future academic development."

The course really lent itself to the discussion, and I enjoyed how we addressed both historical and contemporary moments.",
                "There are many strengths to this course. Principally, the syllabus is excellent and covers a lot of interesting, seminal texts. Additionally, Professor Renaud is  very knowledgeable, accessible, and supportive, and the class discussions were consistently filled with astute comments from other students.",
                "Prof. Renaud leads a really good discussion and really good insights are developed by everyone. Perhaps some weeks the reading was a bit too much, and we weren't able to get to it all, but all in all, I think the course was handled really well.",
                "Strengths: Professor Renaud is really wonderful. He leads a discussion very well, he is really knowledgeable, and he really cares for his students. Professor Renaud was also really helpful at guiding and advising the final paper, giving students a lot of leeway to explore their own interests. The assigned readings were always interesting, and our long seminar never felt boring or lacking -- it often felt like we could have kept talking for another hour. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None specific to this course -- zoom learning is often a bit difficult, but there's nothing that Professor Renaud could have done about that.",
                "Strengths: High-quality discussions, interesting readings\r\n\r\nImprovements: There could be a selection of both liberal and conservative religious intellectuals on the syllabus"

When you had to report, it forced you to really follow what was happening and if you missed what someone had said, you could always read the class reports. It would have been nice to have had the reports posted more quickly than they were but other than that, it was a very good system. Having people present in class also helped change the pace and keep things moving on zoom. It created some variation in the structure to each class.",

If you're looking for a fun engaging class that won't stress you out too much, this is a good choice.",
