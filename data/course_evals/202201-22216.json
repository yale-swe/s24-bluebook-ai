                "I loved this course. Professor Hsiang was very flexible, and was kind and caring when it came to the assignments and ensuring that each student was doing the best exploration of their site that they could. She gave us a lot of creative space to explore our interests and to show off our own analytical and methodical interests through each assignment, and along with the TAs, created an environment in which all students and the teaching team were able to bond. The only weakness was that the two-hour section on Wednesdays was ill-defined at first, but once we became a tight-knit team, it became a great collaborative working space."

The course was challenging, to say the least, but Professor Hsiang and the TAs were extremely clear with their feedback and were committed to seeing you improve within and between each assignment. I'd never felt so supported in a creative exploration, especially considering this was an exploration of a site unknown, and the camaraderie in this class has been unmatched by any other course. The class trip was a huge highlight, and made it clear how the analysis we were doing in the lab connected to real-life problems."
