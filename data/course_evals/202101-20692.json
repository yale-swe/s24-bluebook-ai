                "I learned about the many ways in which state, local, and federal US policy attempt to tackle environmental and energy problems. The syllabus of the course is very accurate and Professor Klee also pushed us to think critically about the ways in which policy can interact effectively with people, corporations, and the environment.",
                "This was a really good survey course of many different topics in this field. Often it felt more like an interactive lecture than a seminar, but this was helpful given the amount of expertise that Klee has and the breadth of information. The course is great if you've taken a few EVST classes and have a good understanding of the main topics/focuses in the field but want to dive deeper and also learn the policy applications. You get experience writing policy memos which is a great skillset and also gives you potential writing samples to add to your portfolio.",
                "I developed a greater awareness of the environmental policy transformations required to mitigate environmental and human health harm in the 21st century. The course examined several broad buckets of environmental problems, and discussed policy options to rectify the damage.",

                "The small class size and interactive nature of Professor Klee's lecture style kept me engaged throughout the class. The class doesn't need much improvement, although I would recommend including more recent readings to the reading list, since so much has happened even in the last half-decade with regard to many of the topics discussed.",
                "It didn't really function as a seminar, just a lecture where student discussion questions were incorporated and there were brief moments of commentary from students. I personally think this worked well for the material of the course, however it did discourage doing the readings.",
                "This course was designed to facilitate student learning through weekly reading responses and a discussion-based class format. It was really enjoyable to hear the perspectives of all of the students in the class on these environmental dilemmas.",
                "This course was amazing! You learn about very niche things that fit into these very large environmental problems, and think about their solutions. Great and timely readings, also assignments keep you engaged in the course!",
                "I really don't see any weaknesses to the course. I thought the work load was very fair. I really enjoyed learning how to write policy memos and the readings each were super interesting so it it wasn't bad to complete them.",
                "rob is actually the goat, he is so well versed in the topics, so caring for his students, offers so much of his time to help with brainstorming, gives thorough feedback on assignments, and does a great job of engaging each student on an individual basis. he is also down to earth and a real human unlike some professors.",
                "The course was a great mix of lecture and discussion so we learned but also expressed our individual insights. The only weakness was that, on some topics (such as the electric grid), I felt like a baseline knowledge was assumed that I didn't have so it was kind of hard to follow at points.",
                "The diversity of topics is helpful in giving us many things to think about and to pursue further. I like how conversations flow organically as well, with students sharing their points of view freely and responding to one another."
