    "Professor Alipui is super knowledgeable and a really great person. Unfortunately, he is not a great teacher. Most days were spent reading from slides or having us present group projects - an interesting time where we would receive feedback that seemed unrelated to the original guidelines he had provided. Class could be improved by making into an actual seminar or providing guidelines that would promote learnings. Readings are related, but re-capped in class.",
