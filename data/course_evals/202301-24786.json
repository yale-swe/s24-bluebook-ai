                "This course was basically a weekly master class in singing in addition to weekly voice lessons outside of class with the lovely Sarah Kohane. If you wish to improve your technique in singing music in the classical repertoire and learn a bit about the art song tradition, this class is for you.",
                "How to sight read music, engage in art song I usually wouldn't explore, and how to take and give constructive criticism.",
                "I learned a lot about the technique of singing art songs, like how to breathe, how to modify vowels and consonants to make high notes easier and keep my resonance consistent, and the importance of conveying a story while singing. I also learned a lot about the differences between choral and solo singing.",
                "Learned how to sing with better technique, and added about 8 songs to my repertoire.",
                "lots of new repertoire, skills related to singing for an audience",
                "I continue to learn so much about singing, performance, and the development of my own voice under Professor Lalli and Sara Kohane's guidance!",
                "How to sing better! And a lot of British and American art song repertoire (which is suuuuch beautiful music!!)",
                "I definitly learned a lot about classical composition and voice in Lalli's class. This was new territory for my voice and I really enjoyed it.",
                "I gained a broad understanding of British and American Art Song while developing my solo performance skills."

                "This course is the perfect class for classical singers. Professor Lalli and Sarah are the best and give you great feedback to improve your singing. The level of singing for people in the class is generally high, so you also get to learn from your classmates. I love this class and really have nothing bad to say about it.",
                "I think a strength is the opportunity to have voice lessons on the weekend outside of the class. I really benefited from this in order to better understand and perform my songs.",
                "This class is all-around fantastic. So cool to explore the plethora of art songs out there, get to know this style of music, and then learn the songs. It's also a really cool experience to perform for your classmates and have them perform for you. It helped me work on my stage fright, and I learned a lot just by seeing each of my classmates put in the same position that I would have to be in. I have no criticisms!",
                "Professor Lalli is the absolute heart of this course. He makes it the impactful experience it is.",
                "I love Prof. Lalli's classes  and especially the singing\/masterclass-type feel of most of our sections. Coachings with Sara Kohane are immensely valuable  Sara is a literal musical genius who offers helpful advice on singing and style and interpretation.\r\n\r\nProf. Lalli's PowerPoints, however, can often be very repetitive from week to week, and quite dry  I think a lot of people take this class to sing, and to learn how to sing and perform better, and sometimes the amount of time spent in class (that could be relegated to outside-of-class readings, which were almost always optional, but always incredibly interesting and valuable) on information and music history was just a lot. I also wish there was more of an opportunity in the masterclass setting to engage students who aren't actively performing though Prof. Lalli does a good job at this already.",
                "The strength of the course is the overall structure of having the coachings and then the masterclass once a week. The only weakness I see is the organization of scheduling the coachings but I don't know how to make that better. I also wish the coaching sessions were a bit longer."

                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class, especially to people who have classical voice training, have taken voice lessons, or sing in a choir at Yale. To get to sing and learn amazing music for a class is just the best.",
                "Yes! For anyone that enjoys signing and wants to challenge themselves, take it!",

                "To those that have a strong foundation in vocal performance, absolutely. It's a super fun class that exposes students to knew composers and styles of music.",
                "Yes, I'd recommend this course to students who have experience with sight-singing and performing classical music. It was highly enjoyable, exposed me to a great number of pieces that I had never heard before, and led to a massive improvement in my voice and confidence. Singing alone was something I was not very comfortable with before taking this course that has now become far less daunting."
