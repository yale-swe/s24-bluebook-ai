                "The course's readings are pretty interesting, and both the TAs and Dr. Lewis showed a genuine interest in the course material. Additionally, the writing assignments were geared toward helping students reflect on what they learned. I most loved the final 5 page paper because I got to reflec t on my first semester at Yale and include texts I had read in the class. \r\n\r\nThe class could be improved if the TA sections were better prepared for discussion and if the class content was revised just a little. I think most students take the class because they hoped to read influential writers and were much less interested in the purpose of college education.",
                "Everything in this course worked very well for me.",
                "The strength of this class is a geographically and temporarily diverse selection of texts. The weakness of the class might be that lectures rarely offered new material and mostly reiterated what we have already read for the class.",
                "Strengths: Its pass\/fail and theres hardly any work assigned (three one-page papers through the semester and a final five-page reflection), making for the perfect fifth\/sixth course.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures can get a little dull in their content, especially for some of the texts that you dont vibe with. Also, the discussion sections do get somewhat awkward when no one contributes.",
                "The strengths of this course would have the ability to attend either an in-person or virtual lecture. Along with this, there was a ton of flexibility for each student in terms of discussion sections and writing essays. When writing the essays assigned to us during the course, it was fun since the questions asked and topics brought about like cancel culture were relatable. Those essays, especially the last essay, were nice for reflection and helped make a person feel better, especially during the 1st semester of Yale. I wouldn't change anything other than having everything in-person.",
                "Strengths - low workload, interesting reading materials and discussions and pertinent questions + a global outlook. \r\nWeaknesses - discussion session",
                "Every lecture is very well structured and entertaining. We received all material and instructions to complete assignments and be prepared for lectures.",

                "The content is very interesting, and the level of work assigned is appropriate. I do hope that it could be more provocative and combative! The class wasn't at all navel-gazing as is a lot of talk about education within educational institutions, and the most interesting parts of the class was when professor Lewis was teasing at some challenge to widely-held beliefs and convictions of Yale students. Unfortunately, we never really got to fight it out!",
                "This was a good course to learn about a variety of different writings and readings. It was especially nice since this course was offered for the fall semester.",
                "I thought the discussion sections were where I was most engaged. I enjoyed them and they allowed me to flesh out my understanding better. The course material was solid. Perhaps encouraging others to engage more during discussion sections would be the most useful improvement.",
                "The inperson lecture was very interesting and well done. I think there were too many readings assigned of too long  a length to really read through properly before a lecture. The discussion section was too disorganized to be really interesting.",
                "It's a good course, that covers some interesting topics.",

                "Book selection very good. Discussions were often held back by all the kids who did not read.",
                "I thought this was a great course! As it was a half credit class, I felt some of the readings were quite long and confusing. I enjoyed the lecture and the professor was engaging. The discussion sections were also beneficial as we could learn from other students.",
                "In my opinion, the primary sources we got to read were quite interesting. Also, I liked how Professor Lewis tried to engage students in live lectures. One weakness, in my opinion, was that perhaps many students did not feel motivated enough to engage during the discussion sections for one reason or the other.",
                "This was a great class! The readings were really rewarding and not particularly long. Professor Lewis is a great lecturer and made the course interactive with in-class discussions. It was honestly the highlight of my week since the class was in person. The assignments were really easy and fun to write.",
                "Overall, the course was fantastic! The content was very interesting and the discussions were engaging. Professor Lewis is an incredible professor who is passionate, eloquent and evidently highly-knowledgeable about the course content. The mixed structure of the class was effective in maximizing learning, and the workload was good. What could be improved is the fact that the course is only 0.5 credits, and is Pass\/Fail; I wish the course could have been at least 1 credit and could have provided some grade or fulfilled a distributional requirement, such as for the Humanities.",

                "I would recommend this course if one wants to get an introduction to how to do readings and how to discuss them as well as if they are interested in the approach to education in different eras\/ views.",
                "If you're interested in a light introduction to various philosophical perspectives on the purposes of education, yes, you may find this class interesting. If you don't have a special interest in this area or have had studied philosophy before, I would not recommend taking this class",
                "In this semester, most enrolled students were internationals trying to satisfying their visa requirements. However, if youre interested in exploring some interesting and thought-provoking texts in a low stress environment, this course might be for you.",
                "if you need an easy f-1 in-person class to subvert visa requirements - YES\r\nIf you have a niche interest in the value of college education (as a college student) - SURE\r\nif you want to be challenged or constantly engaged - NO",
                "I would recommend this course as the content was very enlightening. Even though we looked at works of authors long deceased, the purpose was still relevant and it gave me a new perspective on college education.",
                "Absolutely - it was well structured and a great complement to a diverse courseload",
                "Yes - us international first years needed an in-person course for our visas. For non-internationals, it's a free 1\/2 credit with practically no work.",
                "Yes! You've made it to Yale. You probably have a lot of ideas about what you'll do later in your life, what you want to learn, what type of person you are, what type of place Yale is, which is exactly why you should take this class to consider the opposite of all those beliefs.",
                "Yes, if you're interested in a survey philosophy course.",
                "I would as it was rather interesting and introduced me to people I wouldn't have read otherwise.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes, if you need 0.5 pass\/fail credit",
                "Yes, the discussions are fun.",
                "Yes. Amount we learned per unit time was very high. Not stressful at all but very interesting and instructive.",
                "Yes, it allows you to think about how college education is applied in day-to-day living.",
                "Yes, I enjoyed the class.",
                "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in the concept of education and how it evolved over time. Since the workload is quite light, I believe that this course is perfect for someone who is looking to engage with the given material freely. I also find Professor Lewis's lectures to be quite interesting.",
                "Yes! It's a fun and easy class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. The course allowed me to internally explore my own motivations and goals in my college education. It was helpful to take this course as a first year student, as I believe it will help me make the most of my college experience.",
                "I personally would not take this course if it wasn't a visa requirement. I think that Prof. Lewis is amazing and super smart and has amazing stories to tell, but most of the course is just boring. We learnt about people who set the stage of how society functions today which is super important, but was just not engaging at all. I liked that I had the chance to meet a lot of other international students, but I could not keep my attending during the class even if I tried super hard."
