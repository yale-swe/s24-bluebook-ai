   "comments": [
    "I definitely feel that I have a stronger grasp on the process of development of urban (and especially suburban) spaces. Furthermore, throughout the semester, my ability to make connections across multiple readings and time periods improved.",
    "I learned so much from this course! We traced urban histories starting with tenements and the City Beautiful movements up to the 2000s.",
    "This was the first urban studies course I had taken in a long time that actually taught me something new (my major\/concentration is urban studies). Nichole is extremely knowledgeable and she chose very intriguing readings that covered a broad range historically and thematically. I learned so much, for example about the fair housing movement and about examples I had never heard of. It was also the first time in a course that I could really see scholars in conversation with one another; Nichole made a point of it for us to think about who each scholar was trained under and who they were responding to.",
    "I learned a lot about the creation of the modern American city, and how the social, economic and racial factors of each time affected American cities' development across the country. In addition, I learned how to appropriately evaluate historical accounts of urbanization in America, essentially the study of historiography.",
    "This class was a very good overview of some of the dominant scholarship on American cities in the 20th century, with a specific focus on African-Americans. The research paper assignment on redlining felt somewhat limited but was a good means to gain a sense of the history of some particular neighborhood, with the pivotal part of the paper being the Home Owners' Loan Corporation map.",
    "This course does a great job of analyzing historical sources and critically evaluating why events in history may have happened the way they did."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength is definitely the small class size (8 people) and the care that Nichole shows towards every student. A big weakness was having most assignments due Wednesday nights (the same day as the class) since one would have to do all the readings for the seminar for the afternoon, then would have another assignment in the class due a few hours later.",
    "Strengths - great readings, great instructor\r\nNo weaknesses, but the class was definitely benefitted by the students in it so could be harder to get everything out of it with a different group of students.",
    "I've had a lot of trouble participating in seminars in the past but the way this course was set up made it much easier to talk. It was SO HELPFUL to receive a list of questions to focus on as we went through the readings, and the weekly video responses started to help me formulate my own thoughts about the readings so that I felt more comfortable talking during class. I also loved that the main project for the semester, the final paper, was set up so that it took the whole semester, and we turned the first draft in around midterm. It helped me think about how to restructure my essay and become a better writer that just wouldn't be possible if there wasn't a second draft of the paper. I did wish we could have had a bit more freedom in the final paper; the prompt was to use the HOLC redlining maps as a basis, but ultimately I wished I didn't have to focus as much on them and could have used other primary sources instead (I found a lot of planning commission documents and other maps that I just didn't have space to include).",
    "This course had an awesome syllabus, full of readings that were very informative. I felt that the first hour of class discussion was very productive, but that, things began to slow down in the second hour. I very much enjoyed the final paper, and thought that the learning process in the build-up to the final paper helped me build skills as a historical researcher.",
    "I thought the strength of this course was in the syllabus, which was carefully prepared by Prof. Nelson and included a lot of really interesting scholarship on a range of issues in American cities. The class discussions left something to be desired, as there were fewer than ten of us in the class and we frequently ran out of things to say. To this end, I think it would be helpful if Prof. Nelson provided some context for each day's readings (and the corresponding era in American urban history) in a mini-lecture at the start of the seminar discussion. She did this a few times in the second half of the semester and it was quite effective.",
    "The course did a great job of presenting engaging and fascinating material. I believe it could be improved by having more of a 5-10 minute \"lecture\" in the beginning to help give the students a sort of roadmap, or guide, for what the Professor may be looking for in that specific day's discussion."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Nichole always directed the class in a productive manner, prodding students for more when needed, and always keen on adding more context to readings.",
    "Yes! Learned a lot, enjoyed section.",
    "YES! As above, it was the first urban studies course in a while that actually taught me something new. Basically every week the readings were fascinating and thought-provoking. It was super well structured to help me feel comfortable participating in class and to even out the workload in terms of the final paper.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who has ever wondered why cities are built the way they are. There is a rich urban history all around us, and it is important for yalies, who will mostly be living in cities after graduating to take this into account.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you're interested in urban history! The reading list is excellent and Prof. Nelson cares deeply about the students. The class discussions were a bit dry, but I think this definitely could improve with the right student group (and just with it being not the first time it's taught).",
    "I would recommend this course; it covers very important material that links well with the current ongoings in America."
