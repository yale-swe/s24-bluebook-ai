This class delved into the mechanisms and transition states of many reactions to provide a better theoretical understanding of common synthetic methods. I also learned about reaction conditions and the synthesis of special reagents necessary for commonly used reactions. This class was very informative and even though I am not a synthetic organic chemist I feel like I have a better understanding of what they do.",

                "Gained insight on many named reactions. Lots of metal catalyze CH activation and CC coupling reactions.",

                "Like the quarter before, this class is very well organized with neat and thorough notes and examples that add context. The psets align very well with the course material and reinforce the concepts and are an appropriate level of difficulty. Prof. Ellman is incredibly knowledgeable and has done a great job structuring the large amount of material in this class in a way that makes sense.",
                "thoroughly enjoyed this course",
                "The best strength of this course is that it is extraordinarily clear in its expectations.  I especially am a fan of the open-note exams, but also appreciate how the instructor went about designing the syllabus.  My main criticism of the course is its emphasis on reactions instead of on the chemistry that underlies them - while certain transition states were emphasized, the reasons for many regioselective and chiral outcomes were either not mentioned, or weren't necessary for performing well in the course.",
                "Lectures were clearly presented and taught effectively! Class participation was limited, but was made up for by engaging content.",
                "Strength: learned lots of different reactions I have never seen before. Weakness: sometimes I wish I could see how these reactions were actually developed, what insight their inventors had that allowed them to realize the reaction was possible.",
                "This course was taught in a very organized way. Notes were clear and problem sets and tests drew from them. It sets you up to succeed and learn as long as you take good notes and review them well! Psets were worth 50% and the exam was worth 50%. You also get to drop a pset. Overall very well taught and very fair grading system.",
                "It is very well organized",
                "The course is well-organized and relevant, and the problem sets and exams accurately reflect the course content. No weaknesses of note."

                "If you work in a synthetic organic chemistry lab, this is the best class you could possibly take to understand the reactions that you are likely carrying out. If you don't, this is still a great class just because of how well it is structured. The lectures are clear and interesting. The same is true of the psets, which are well-designed and help reinforce lecture concepts and prepare you for exams. The exam is open-note, which is very helpful in alleviating stress and allowing you to focus on concepts instead of memorization. I would recommend forming a study group to get the most out of the psets - the conversations about when to use what reagent can be quite interesting. Compared to last quarter, the class mostly stays the same but with more of an emphasis on transition metal mechanisms.",
                "Yes, Ellman does a wonderful job teaching the class, and knowledge of the common organic reactions are helpful for chemists",
                "yes if youre interested in synthesis",
                "Yes. Great introduction to advanced organic chemistry.",
                "Yes, I love synthetic organic chemistry and this was by far my favorite course I have taken.",
                "YES THIS COURSE IS AMAZING! If you like organic chemistry in any capacity you'll love this course. I mainly study inorganic but even still I felt like I learned so much and there are so many resources available to learn from. It's super well organized and the grading is very fair. (50% pset, 50% exam, you can drop 1 pset, psets and exams are not easy but definitely not impossible)",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who took 432. It is a natural expansion of the knowledge you gained in that class and it teaches very relevant chemistry.",
                "It is definitely an important course for any student with an interest in organic chemistry as it covers a broad range of important transformations",
                "I would recommend without reservations. Certainly one of my favorite courses during my time at Yale so far."
