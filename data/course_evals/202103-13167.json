                "AMAZING course. Please take this is if you are an art history major, you will not regret it! Anne and Irma are both wonderful teachers and bring such an amazing background to the course, it is truly an amazing opportunity to learn under them. Highlights from the course include working with physical objects from the collection every class, the guest speakers from the museum, the trips to west campus and NYC, and the final itself.",
