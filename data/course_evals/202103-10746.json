                "Great review and discussion of contemporary topics, methods, and findings in social neuroscience. Learned a lot about different types of neuroscientific techniques and methodologies that are currently being developed and used. Also learned a lot about how scientists use animal models to represent and study basical, universal social behaviors and interactions.",
                "Current literature on the social brain, from brain-to-brain synchrony to role of hormones to brain regions responsible for social activity. A lot of animal literature, and some human research. Discussion-based - great opportunity to improve science communication skills.",
                "I learned a lot of social neuroscience methods for understanding mechanistic neuroscience (rather than neuroimaging stuff, which we touched on, but less often)",
                "I got much better at understanding methods and data in studies.",
                "I grew significantly in my ability to read studies, understand them, and take away the key points. I also learned how to push myself further in my thinking when reading studies, as Professor Chang had us suggest a future direction for the study. In general, I learned about the neuroscience that underlies several components of social interaction.",
                "I have learned how to read academic papers in the field of neuroscience. The skill is incredibly transferable and builds my confidence in doing independent research. But still, there are an array of statistical methods and research techniques that I am not familiar with, which in turn points to the direction I still need to work on. Many topics of the course are intriguing, and I was particularly amazed by the concept of EI balance and brain-brain synchrony. Besides, I also learned the whole picture of the social brain and the function of regions. Also, the discussion by students was quite impressive as well, such as biochemical techniques explained and some relevant examples from their daily life.",
                "I learned how to properly read an academic paper, along with a whole host of brain imaging and optogenetic tools.",

                "It was quite dense in terms of scientific jargon used in the papers. It might have been a bit helpful if we had used the first week of classes to simply go over methodologies and techniques before diving right into content.",
                "Highly engaging discussion-style course. Would recommend taking if you're prepared to participate.",
                "I really liked the seminar nature of this course and I really wish more neuroscience courses were like this to be honest! I enjoyed class discussions but wish more people would participate/come prepared to class to discuss.",
                "I didn't like that it was so dependent on student participation",
                "Strengths are the discussions during class, Professor Chang, and the fact that we had to provide a future direction for the studies. Discussions during class were interesting, thought-provoking, and enjoyable. Professor Chang is great!! He really makes you want to engage with the material. Providing future directions when we did our responses gave me confidence in my own grasp of the knowledge, as well as stretched me to think about what I had just learned on a deeper level.",
                "I was not quite sure how to grasp the idea of a paper quickly so I feel like I spent a fairly long time reading yet was not quite as prepared to share my ideas.  Also, if there would be a regular segment in class where students take turns to point out something they find most interesting, that might promote the idea exchange and a more relaxed atmosphere to voice up.",
                "I think the papers we discussed were interesting and prof Chang is great. However, the class format felt a little receptive as wed do the same thing every day.",
                "strengths - loved the seminar style of discussion. weaknesses - only assignment throughout the semester was reading papers, more variety would be appreciated",
                "The content of the course was always very interesting, but I often found it difficult to participate in class because I struggled to understand the studies thoroughly enough to feel like I could accurately cover the figures in class.",
                "Strengths:\r\nI thought that the course organization was very simple but accomplished its purpose. We would read 2ish papers before every class and then spend the day discussing those papers. There was always something to be discussedwhether it be unpacking graphs or learning about an unfamiliar technique. Professor Chang is also incredibly understanding and patient!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIt would have been nice to have the last class devoted to synthesizing everything we had learned. While many of our classes covered a single topic (e.g., \"oxytocin and social/maternal behavior\" or \"fear systems and dominance behaviors\"), I wished there was a way to tie everything we had learned together. A cohesive understanding or recap would be nice for future classes. Even a sneak peek into the various brain mechanisms at the beginning of the semester would be a nice way to introduce the \"social brain.\"",
                "The course was structured to build off of foundational neuroscience courses, which was very interesting and engaging, but also intimidating if you dont necessarily remember all of the basics. If the first week/initial classes were to review/solidify prior knowledge of neuroscience, it might allow for better comprehension, especially with the brain and anatomical structures.",
                "We spent every seminar discussing one or two papers in depth with little synthesis. By the end I definitely improved my ability to break down NSCI papers, but I don't know how much concrete knowledge I walked away with"

                "Yeah, I definitely would if you are interested in learning about molecular-->behavioral neuroscience. However, you should note that the final assignment (20 page paper) is pretty time consuming/tough for the people it does not count as a thesis for. Therefore I recommend finding a topic you really are passionate about and starting the paper really early (start writing it before thanksgiving) break since the week to week reading assignments do not take so much time.",
                "Absolutely. I learned so much about social interaction",
                "Yes. Professor Chang is great and the material is really interesting and can be applied to everyday knowledge since it relates to social interaction. The discussions in class are enjoyable too!",
                "Yes, but only to students in similar fields. I feel like I have dived deep into some ideas that I only previously heard of or caught eye of in books and articles. It is a nice feeling to connect things up and appreciate the rationales. It is also fairly useful for future studies. The teaching style was fun and insightful as well. I would recommend to those who have already taken interest in social science/neuroscience and aspire to be researchers.",
                "Yes, great neuroscience course",
                "This was a great course to understand more concepts in social neuroscience. I would definitely recommend it to students looking for an advanced neuroscience seminar.",

                "If they are already predisposed to and interested in neuroscience, then yes, absolutely. If not, it will be tough.",
                "I would! If you are not a neuro major, the academic language will be daunting at first. However, give yourself time to acclimate to reading neuroscience papers and you'll be shocked at how fast you adapt.",
                "Yes, the course was very straightforward and allowed you to develop your own personal scientific interests!",
                "Absolutely. The pace is pretty slow and I don't know how much I learned on paper but the material was fun and I was able to really improve my ability to understand and take apart neuroscience papers."
