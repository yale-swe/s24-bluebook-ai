I feel as though I'm able to now discuss the olympics and things such as athletes' political actions, the olympics opening ceremony, etc. by drawing on the numerous sources we read during class such as Coubertin, Miller, Pindar, and others.",
                "By taking this course I learned about the history of the Olympic Games (from its ancient origins and the origins of the modern Games in 1896). Additionally, we explored myths from antiquity and various socioeconomically topics and issues related to the Olympics such as the role of Nationalism, feminism, racial topics and doping.",

                "Strengths of the course include that the student presentations were really interesting and helpful because we were able to learn about connections between our class readings and things that weren't touched on. The presentations also sparked discussion which added to the overall discussion. The overall discussion of the class was also a strength because it really allowed us to explore what we thought of the readings and it gave us freedom to talk about that which we thought was important. The discussion posts were also a strength because we got to see what each other member of the class was thinking which was interesting and then we could ask questions during the class discussion period. In my opinion, there were no weaknesses of the class.",

It was also very interesting to explore the history of the modern olympics and how it related to things such as civil rights and nazi-dominance, as examples. It was very interesting at all times and if you enjoy learning about sports or competition and want to be able to discuss them through a political and social lense, I recommend you take the class.",
