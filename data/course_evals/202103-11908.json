In this course, there were also times where I had to figure things out by myself, and this helped me become more independent as a student.",

It seemed to me as if being in one section over another could've had a big impact on learning and exam performance. To clarify, the course was taught in sections so I never actually learned from John Hall (the professor \"teaching\" the course) except in his videos.",

I did not watch the videos and was completely fine.  That being said, they were probably a good resource for some people."

This class is not an easy class, and the concepts that are taught are taught very quickly, so a lot of preparation as well as review is needed after each class. I think that if a student is good at picturing shapes in 3D and can bear tedious calculations, the student should take this class. If the student did not like math in high school, this may be challenging. However, I believe that any student can succeed in this class as long as they put in the work.",
