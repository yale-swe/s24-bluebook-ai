There's never any expectation that you will have completely understood the readings\/viewings ahead of time, because through the discussions, you are able to learn more and share perspectives that lead to further takeaways.",

Professor Robinson is very good at leading discussion, providing extra information while also giving students alot of room. Syllabus is great and always changing."

                "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in learning about new work in theater. Theater is often perceived as musicals and Shakespeare, and this class allows you to get to know so much more than that. As a class, you get to work together to understand intriguing, and sometimes difficult, pieces of theater, and the takeaways from the class discussions will stick with you as you continue to take an analytical eye on art, storytelling, and theater in the future.",

                "1000% recommend. Fun if you are interested in pursuing theater or if you just think you are going to be watching plays in your life... I think any class with Marc Robinson is something that should be taken, but this one is especially fun and contemporary and was the only class I took this semester that felt worth taking during Covid. I feel like I came out of this class better able to appreciate creative work of all kind, inspired about the work people are doing, excited to watch and learn more. Take!"
