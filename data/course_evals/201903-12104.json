   "comments": [
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights that I developed through this course are unparalleled to any other course that I have taken. Professor Camacho's commitment to a well rounded course with exceptional breadth was incredible and I have felt myself grow in thought throughout this semester. The readings are challenging, engaging, and allowed me to learn about movements and events through a transnational framework.",
    "This class provided me with an overview of the ER&M major, and allowed me to engage with a large number of sources and ideas. I also improved my writing and synthesis skills through the midterm and the RITM paper.",
    "I learned about the impact of colonialism",
    "how to think about our world today from a completely different perspective, how to discuss difficult issues and truly be open and listen to one another.",
    "The main thing I developed was the vocabulary to talk about global issues\/topics such as capitalism, imperialism, whiteness, and colonialism. I definitely learned to view things in a different perspective. Also, more practice speaking in section always helps with public speaking skills.",
    "Basics in the study of ER&M",
    "General survey of ER&M and American cultural studies.",
    "This course taught me to see the structural and historical nature of a lot of ills - like racism, xenophobia, etc - that we see as purely social and individual today. It also taught me about new ways to think about problems.",
    "I gained a broad introduction to the field of Ethnicity, Race, & Migration studies. I learned of the historical foundations of race, ethnicity, and empire, and how to begin to approach traditional historical narratives and modern conceptions critically.",
    "I learned an incredible amount of information about the histories of ethnicity, race, migration, and the peoples that have been shaped by it. A lot of this class focuses on telling the history of people who are often left out of the normal educational processes. I also learned a lot about the themes of colonization, human rights, etc. We learned both historical narratives and time periods as well as contemporary issues and current events that are happening in relation to certain themes. Finally, we learned how to write and discuss about these important issues.",
    "I learned how to think about the world in different ways. This course was an amazing survey of many different topics within ER&M as well as a wonderful mixture of history and current affairs. I was able to think about indigenous history, racial formation, racism, colonialism, intersectionality, migration, and so much more in  ways that I had not thought of before and I am so grateful to have taken this class.",
    "I learned to read faster. I learned to write papers quickly. I gained knowledge about the constructs, systems, and institutions of oppression that have been created. I learned to think critically.",
    "Gained foundational knowledge on the history of the United States and other countries and systems related to the topic of ER&M.",
    "I gained an understanding of a broad review of literature pertaining to the subjects taught within ER&M, which helped me decide to major in that department's program.",
    "I learned how to discuss race and ethnicity within an academic context, understand the workings of colonialism and neo colonialism, and examine features of racial discourse and the organization of space that have dictated the relationship between the Global South and Global North.",
    "a foundational understanding of texts in postcolonial and migration studies, familiarization with the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration faculty and department, a deeper understanding of race and ethnicity in an academic context",
    "I relearned American history, which was desperately necessary and incredibly eyeopening.  It was a little traumatic at times, but Professor Camacho and the teaching staff were incredibly understanding and provided every opportunity to help ease the shock and create spaces to talk further about what we were discussing.",
    "I learned a lot about social issues and different opposing narratives to race and ethnicity.",
    "I learned how the process of racialization has formed our modern social hierarchy and how neocolonialism is still heavily present throughout the world. I better understood the plight of racialized and poor groups of people and nations and our roles in deconstructing the narrative of white supremacy. I also learned how to write a bit better.",
    "This course provided an excellent introduction to key concepts and historical occurrences relevant to race, ethnicity and migration, and wove in insightful connections to modern day events and examples.",
    "a lot about ethnicity, race, and migration!",
    "ER&M 200 gave me a really unique and different framework with which to view the world. It brought a lot of new information that made me reevaluate many of the structures that I take for granted, and the course was very refreshing in giving those new perspectives.",
    "How to critically evaluate history, think about histories intersectionally, and use more advanced language to describe racial formation and marginalization.",
    "Learned a lot of history that I wouldnt have known otherwise, and it really helped me think more critically and always question what you read",
    "This class truly let me engage with histories and narratives that have intentionally been excluded from mainstream dialogue. I was able to think so much more critically about culture and social spaces, places, and positions that form discussions around race.",
    "I developed my ability to think critically about race and class in ways I had not yet been taught.",
    "This class is a good introductory survey course which would be helpful to anyone who is not familiar with the themes of the ER&M major but would like to get a general feel for what types of content one would encounter in ER&M courses.",
    "I gained a broad knowledge of topics not normally covered in academic or even in history classes",
    "I learnt a significant amount about race theory, queer theory, and the erasure of indigenous history from the United States of America's creation history. The class was also very helpful in learning how to read and write critically about textual sources both of a literary and academic nature. It also had a great selection of texts from authors from the Global South.",
    "Learned to read the world through structures of colonialism, gained important insights about the present world through exploring often untold histories",
    "I was able to study historical patterns of racism and familiarize myself with the methods and frameworks used in the field of ER&M to evaluate them.",
    "This class helped me with the analysis of different texts and exposed me to a lot of history and narratives that I never knew about. This class also really helped me see the different perspectives of people and introduced me to what ER&M really is about.",
    "I developed the ability to think about historical accounts in a more critical way and understand the legacies of colonialism and racism that continue to plague our society.",
    "This course will teach you so much about the worst institutions of racism - settler colonialism and genocide, enslavement and the trade of human beings, carceral labor - and about how writers, thinkers, and activists throughout history have worked to dismantle those systems. The course is broad and conceptual (a good introduction), but it still allows you to hone in on case studies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: well-rounded, broad selection of materials, intellectually stimulating and challenging, excellent readings, great guest lecturers and assignments that are thought provoking and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: unable to delve into topics in detail due to time constraints.",
    "It was a good class, but I'm a junior ER&M major, so it was quite surface level and survey-y. I think this is an EXTREMELY important class for underclass folk, but it was just kind of an inconvenience for me. I liked that Camacho brought in many scholars as guest lecturers.",
    "Strengths: the class goes over a lot of interesting topics and Prof. Camacho and the TF's are really passionate about the subject matter. Weaknesses: I thought the course tried to go over too many things and it was pretty hard to know what we should take notes on. Also, there was a lot of reading, which largely was justified, but at times felt unnecessary.",
    "Great course for learning a cursory overview of a variety of issues pertaining to race.",
    "This course gives a strong overview and has lots of reading, which can make connecting the dots difficult. I would suggest presenting a list of 4-5 themes at the beginning of the course and encouraging students to think about the ways that units and readings are connected.",
    "guest lectures were hit and miss, but professor camacho and the TF's were absolutely incredible, and all the readings were super interesting.",
    "The strength of this course is the ability to introduce relevant vocabulary and topics in a different way. I am able to see the effects of various issues such as colonialism and capitalism in society today. Another strength would be the guest lecturers. They, except for a few, were pretty engaging. A weakness would be the way lecture is structured. It is often not engaging because Professor Camacho reads from a piece of paper instead of trying to relate what she's saying to the slides she puts up.",
    "The lectures were a bit confusing to follow at times but overall i feel being in the class was rewarding and effective at introducing critical concepts and areas in ER&M. Certain texts and lecturers were not at an intro level i feel due to the amount of jargon and gigantic words that were never defined or taught",
    "Strengths: Solid introductory course, \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the course was a bit more engaging and focused. This is both on the micro and macro level to me; Professor Camacho is wonderful but a bit of a dry speaker, and not a very interactive teacher. It was hard to stay engaged in class or understand broadly what each lecture had to say. Much information, not much connection across this different information to produce a narrative. And then on the macro level, the syllabus was a bit disorganized. In the effort to accommodate the guest lecturer's schedules, I am sure, we often jumped around topics within a single week and the subject matter did not clearly relate to each other. \r\n\r\nI feel the above and other components of the course's structure gives it a fairly unfocused lens, which is expected given its broad scope. I would love to see this addressed through perhaps an in-depth discussion of the course's methods and a clear delineation of how the subject matter covered relates to the broader goals of the class. I would love to see a few theses driven throughout the class, sort of how Third World Studies is oriented to deconstruct imperial logic by examining its flaws in seemingly disparate fields. This kind of unifying logic would help the course greatly.",
    "Strengths: inclusivity of all students; very accessible to those outside of the field like me who otherwise might be intimidated by not knowing enough.\r\nWeaknesses: absolutely none. This course was extremely well-taught and an amazing experience.",
    "A big weakness of this course is structure. I did not feel like sections were helpful - we often had to crunch in 2-3 readings in 50 minutes with a class size of ~15-20, so our discussions never went beyond surface-level summaries. Also, I thought that for a course that is so lecture-based, having such long readings assigned was not always productive. There was (unfortunately) little to no engagement with Professor Camacho. \r\nThe strengths of this course were Professor Camacho and the content, but what severely hinders this course is the structure.",
    "The readings were truly amazing, and section discussions were always enjoyable and educational. The lectures, however, tended to be quite dull: they lacked cohesiveness and I often walked away from them feeling as if I had learned nothing. An important side note is that the several guest lectures we had were FANTASTIC and very thought-provoking. I can't pinpoint what exactly made the lectures so uninspiringI think it was a mixture of disorganization and the desire to cover too much in too little time (resulting in covering nothing at all). I loved section so much (it was the part of class where I learned the most) and wonder if the time spent in section (which is short) could be lengthened and the time spent in lecture (which is quite long compared to other lecture courses) could be shortened.",
    "This course is very much geared towards student understanding, so the priority is not on grading or assignments. However, sometimes the amount of reading can range from an article to half a book for class so unless you're in less reading intensive courses, the reading load can be overwhelming.",
    "The strengths of the course are the wonderful material, structure, and modes of engagement for the course. However, the biggest strength is undoubtedly Professor Camacho. She is an inspiring person to get to listen to once or twice a week, and it felt like an honor to take her class. The TAs were also phenomenal. The only weakness of the course that I can think of is that some of the later guest lectures felt either out-of-place or a little irrelevant to the class, albeit interesting still. The Hazel Carby lecture on the last day of class was obviously a mess, but that was clearly not intended and not due to Professor Camacho.",
    "Strengths: The Global Playlist (I've never done anything like it before and it was both fun and insightful, and it also brought our discussion section together, which isn't common at Yale), being able to bond with my discussion section, Professor Schmidt Camacho's lectures, the guest lectures, the video and documentary supplements, the varied topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though I love Professor Schmidt Camacho's insights during class, I do wish that there were breaks the middle of long lectures where we watch videos, listen to music, or discuss certain questions with each other. I don't mean to, but I sometimes daydream or get distracted during the long lectures because focusing on Professor Schmidt Camacho's voice for an hour and fifteen minutes is a bit hard. \r\nI also wish that there were more discussions about Middle Eastern and Asian experiences within ER&M, because it seemed like we only really spoke about that for one week. \r\nI loved the course overall, but I also thought that it favored certain points of views and people who thought differently wouldn't want to speak up otherwise they'd be villainized. For example, we never really talk about conservative views. Though we don't often agree with conservative views, I still think that it's important to consider and discuss them.",
    "Due to the nature of the course as an intro course, the class will cover a wide range of topics that could each be explored for entire semesters. The fast pace of the class may be frustrating, but the broad exposure of content allows the student to discover new fields of inquiry. In addition, the course features guest speakers who are professors associated with the ER&M program or the topics covered.",
    "Strengths: really interesting subject matter reading material, Prof. Camacho is clearly very kind and cares about her students, my TA was very patient and helpful, the guest lectures are great. Weaknesses: the lectures are not always the most engaging, the reading can be overwhelming.",
    "Strengths--variety of topics, areas, social groups covered; great introduction to the professors and themes of the major; reading selections\r\nWeaknesses--readings were too long to be analyzed and digested at a deep level",
    "Loved all of the subject matter and the thoughtful way it was curated and taught. Amazing professor, faculty, and TAs.",
    "Strengths: Professor Camacho is wonderful. Shes clearly passionate about the subject material and makes difficult readings and theories accessible to her student. The course covered a large range of subjects and was very logically organized. The guest lecturers were interactive and fascinating \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The breadth of the course prevented us from focusing on topics deeply",
    "Lectures were very disjointed and hard to follow. It was very difficult to make connections, and overall it was hard to see what we were suppose to take away from the lecture. The course material was at times interesting, but it never seemed to connect in any particular way.",
    "strengths: Professor Camacho is a wonderful lecturer who cares deeply about the material and her students. ER&M 200 gives students a great sampling of guest lectures from the ER&M department. The readings are all engaging and the workload is definitely manageable.\r\nweaknesses: While Professor Camacho's lectures were great, I think it would have helped if her presentations had more slides with text\/key words for students to follow along while taking notes.",
    "As the course covers so much material in such a short period of time, there is no real remedy to the information overload problem.  I found that the type of question presented on the midterm was different from that on the final, that may have just been my interpretation or the fact that the material had changed so significantly.  What was most frustrating is that I did not have the skills or the time to build the skills necessary to do justice to the material or answer the questions well.",
    "Even though it was an intro class, coming from a STEM background, I felt a very big learning curve because of the terminology and also the way the class was conducted. In the end, though I think I got the hang of it.",
    "Very interesting readings, loved my TA. The guest lecturers were always awesome.",
    "The course, as the name suggests, is an introduction, so it provides a comprehensive overview of central principles and events. However, it sometimes feel as if the course does not go into significant depth into any of those principles and events (partially because typically the themes switches every week).",
    "strengths- good material\r\nweaknesses- sometimes difficult to engage with such a large class size",
    "Strengths: course material, sequencing of lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were a little bit difficult to synthesize due to style (not using slides, non-distinct ideas), not all assignments were useful (particularly the playlist assignment)",
    "This course gave a really great survey of several different histories, broadly, and the readings were always interesting. Being an intro, lecture-style class, it naturally had a lot of material to cover in one semester. I feel like due to the length of the readings, it was hard to keep up with each week's new material, and as a result content moved very quickly, and broadly. Sections allowed me to engage with readings in more detailed ways, and I always loved the places our conversations went, but it was a tad overwhelming preparing for the final with so much content to prepare and review. This may be difficult to improve due to the structure of the class, though. One improvement that could be made is the structure of the Global Playlist - presentations didn't really allow us to engage with all the songs our classmates chose. I wish we got to have an actual listening party, rather than going up by section and rushing through analysis.",
    "prof. Camacho is a great lecturer and has a way with words and is really approachable , easy to talk with outside class",
    "The lectures were often a bit difficult to follow and often felt abstract and esoteric, even though the subject matter was extremely critical to know. I wish that ER&M had a more accessible approach to teaching. However, the material I learned was rich and diverse and gave me a lens into so many imperatve global and domestic struggles-- that knowledge is invaluable.",
    "Strengths: Content, Guest Lectures, Readings\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt repetitive",
    "I think that this class does a good job of touching on the histories of different locales and of introducing students to different narratives that can compose the stories of the Global South. In the future, I think that it would be helpful to not maintain such rigid distinctions between the categories of \"Indigenous\" and \"Latinx\". Of course, not all Latin Americans are Indigenous (especially considering that Latin America is composed of settler colonial nation-states, individuals purely of European-descent do live in Latin America), but I think that it would be useful to describe for example, the fact that Indigeneity does not stop at the US-Canada\/US-Mexico borders. I think that lines should be blurred a bit when talking about continental America. For example, in the lecture about Central American migrants, this is the perfect chance to talk about Indigenizing the immigration movement and discussing the fact that individuals are moving to the lands of Indigenous peoples in the US, that many of these Central Americans are Indigenous themselves, that borders are colonial constructs, or that the reasons why many Latin Americans move to the US is due to neo-colonialism\/imperialism of the US that forces their hands. I think this would be helpful to aid individuals in seeing that Indigenous peoples exist throughout continental America, and that the majority of Latin Americans are Indigenous (I consider being mestizx to mean being Indigenous), and I think that adding this conversation can complicate Indigenous\/Latin Studies in a useful way.",
    "Appreciated the considerations to different groups and experiences\r\n\r\n\r\nDidnt love the way it seemed a bit harder to engage without a background in the subject, didnt entirely feel like an intro course with the background knowledge my peers had.",
    "The strengths as aforementioned were definitely the content of the course, and the assigned readings. The course was also well planned in terms of incorporating various narratives, guest lectures, and generally offering a wide-breadth of subjects in race and migration studies. A drawback of the course was the actual lectures which were often given as a long monologue, and thus became dreary and difficult to follow.",
    "This course is excellent at providing students with multiple disciplines, trajectories, and approaches we can take within the Ethnicity, Race, & Migration department at Yale. I am so thankful for it.",
    "Strengths:\r\n- texts provided \r\n- section and how interactive it was \r\n- the actual content \r\n- the majority of visiting lecturers were amazing \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- lecture set up, could be more organized and prepared",
    "This course was very welcoming of students of different academic backgrounds and majors. The outlines handed out at the beginning of class made lectures easy to follow and the staff created a great environment for students to discuss the material. My only gripe with this course is that the guidelines for written assignments were not released earlier in the semester. I found myself rushing to change the RITM Paper last-minute because my TF was not clear about how the assignment would be graded.",
    "Prof. Camacho is INCREDIBLE; don't miss a word of her lectures, because every one is valuable and vital! She also brings in many guest lecturers, each of whom sparked excellent discussion. Because Intro to ER&M can't cover the whole world, by necessity, it is somewhat focused on the United States, especially early in the course. The quality of your discussion section will depend on your classmates and Teaching Fellow; you might end up with a collaborative, enthusiastic, and radically kind community, or you might get a bunch of competitive students trying to out-insight each other and an overworked TF. Readings are very long but fascinating; get through as much as you can over the weekends, then take notes like wildfire during lectures. Overall, it's an excellent introduction to the ER&M major and opportunity to meet people, get in the loop about RITM events, and start to think about your concentration. Non-majors should take it too!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! I would recommend to literally every student at Yale, because it is so incredibly intersectional and important for everyone to know and understand and be exposed to the various systems at work in our daily lives that are intentionally constructed in the ways that they are.",
    "If you are interested in majoring in ethnic studies at Yale I would recommend taking a more specific (although not exceedingly difficult) seminar or lecture course that interests you rather than the introductory course immediately. Similarly, if you are a student interested in ethnic studies, but not as a major, I would recommend taking a more specified course rather than the survey. For majors, you can always take the intro once you're more confident in continuing your studies. For non-majors and majors alike, the survey course is not the best or most thorough introduction.",
    "Yep, especially if interested in history and racial issues.",
    "I believe that all Yale students should take this course or another course like it, and I found that the course was a strong introduction to both the major and many critical issues that impact daily life in the U.S.",
    "yes!! such an important course to take that really changes your perspective on viewing our history and on thinking about our world today and how to talk about difficult issues\/situations.",
    "Yes, I would. If you are a person who is wanting to develop seminar-speaking skills, broaden your vocabulary in these topics, and need humanities credit then I'd say go for it.",
    "Yes I would",
    "Yes !! take it, it outlines a lot of issues in the world and the systems behind them",
    "If you want a general introduction to ER&M-related material, I'd take a class like Third World Studies instead that takes a very opinionated, consciously critical, focused set of studies to about the same breadth (we even had many of the same readings across both courses -- Said's Orientalism, Cesaire's Discourse, Audre Lorde's The Master's Tools, a few others). \r\n\r\nIf you are a potential ER&M major, I would take this within your first or third semesters at Yale. The readings are sort of a \"greatest hits\" of activist\/ethnic studies writing, and taking the course later might just make it old news.",
    "YES. What you learn is so important--everything they gloss over in high school US history. It's crucial information to know simply as someone living in the US: the foundations of US capitalism, the source of racial issues--it allows you to really SEE the US and it's weaknesses. Frankly it should be a required course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but I would caution them before taking it in regard to the class structure, which I felt hindered the course's potential.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are sure they wish to major in Ethnicity, Race, & Migration and are taking it to fulfill the major requirement. I took this class as a way of exploring ER&M as a possible major, but I think I would have been better served by a course with a more specific focus. I really enjoyed this class, but I had to work to enjoy it; other ER&M courses have formats that are immediately conducive to both deep learning and enjoyment. Part of this comes from engaging lectures, but it also comes from more challenging course structures that require students to actually engage with the material. It was far too easy to neglect the readings and spend the lectures (where attendance is taken!) online shopping and still float along well in the class, and this gave it a rather uninspiring feeling. I will say, however, that my section was truly amazing and I looked forward to it weekly, and if you are willing to put in the work to do all the readings, you will take a lot from the class (you could just probably learn more from another class). You get out what you put in!",
    "I would recommend this class for students to become familiar with more culturally appropriate academic terms and to better understand how ethnicity, race, and migration fits into the every day and academia.",
    "Yes, this is without the most phenomenal class I have taken at Yale. I took this class as a senior not used to taking anything like this, and I was worried I would not be as engaged or prepared in terms of writing as many of the underclassmen are. However, there is a ton of support of the class, and it became my favorite class at Yale. Every single person should have to take this class at Yale, as the issues are so critically important and timely. If you are an ethnic minority at Yale, then this class will give you the knowledge and tools to understand the things you have likely already been dealing with your entire life. The material is incredibly engaging and, even though there was a lot of reading, I always was looking forward to it. The exams and other assessments are incredibly fair, and I had a fantastic TA (Anglica) who made the class even better. Had I taken this class as a first or second year, I would have taken many more ER&M courses or other courses like it, and I would have strongly considered majoring in ER&M or a related field. No matter what you are studying, this class will make you a better and more informed human being, but, if you are studying anything in the social sciences or even tangentially related, this class will be invaluable. I know just the act of taking this class and seeing the myriad of scholarship, professors, and topics has made me reconsider what I was planning on doing after college to something more related. I know most of the people taking this course felt the same way. As a senior who has taken many Yale courses, it is rare to find a course that is a unilaterally amazing as this. Absolutely take it, and take it while Professor Camacho is teaching it.",
    "Absolutely, especially students who are not majoring in ER&M. This material is a wonderful survey of many different topics within ER&M and I think everyone should be educated about them. It's also not an overwhelming amount of work - the more you read, the more you learn, but if some weeks are too hectic, it's also okay to skim the readings and still be able to have fruitful conversations. Professor Schmidt Camacho is also one of the best professors I have ever met at Yale.",
    "If you need it for the ER&M major or just want a very broad overview of the department, yes. But if you're not going to major in ER&M and are interested in the subject, you might be better off taking a non-intro course that goes into more depth in particular areas.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in the ER&M major so that they can get an overview of it and the research that takes place in the field.",
    "Yes I definitely would because it teaches students to think about our history and present-day situation in a different light and to challenge what we think we might already know, which is important for any student (regardless of whether or not they will pursue ER&M as a major)",
    "Yes! This was by far one of my favorite classes this semester, and opened my eyes to a whole new world of scholarship. The readings were engaging, and every class, I was excited to learn from Professor Camacho. I cant recommend this course enough.",
    "No. If you are looking to get an intro into ERM take a more specific class. This class is so broad that you leave feeling like you didn't learn much. It is an intro class, but your time would be better spent on another ERM class.",
    "Yes, if you haven't received much exposure to courses in ER&M, then definitely take this course! It will give students from all academic backgrounds a broad understanding of more radical texts and theories not found in other Yale classes. If you have taken similar classes before or are an upperclass student in the ER&M major, this class, while important, will probably feel repetitive\/too much of a survey course to develop niche interests in.",
    "Yes, definitely a great class for any Yale student, regardless of major.",
    "Absolutely.  This course, or another ERM core course should be taken by every single Yale student.  It is very important that we understand our history  and hear from the perspectives that have been quieted for so long.",
    "I think this is a must take but solely for the section and readings (which I did not do all of). Lectures are quite dull, and required.",
    "Yes. Class is very interesting and unlike any other I have taken at Yale.",
    "yes! if you want to learn about non-white history. should probably be a required course for everyone.",
    "Yes, I think ER&M 200 gives a lot of new but essential informations and perspectives. I think every Yale student should take this course or something similar.",
    "Yes, necessary intro to ethnic studies that everyone should take!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student, regardless if they're interested in ER&M or not. It gives you an opportunity to re-learn history, and examine the ways you were exposed to the narratives of different populations. It provides a plethora of voices to better disentangle the mechanics of race and ethnicity, and how these processes move through political borders and spaces.",
    "Yes!! I think everyone should take an ER&M class and prof. Camacho is amazing",
    "I think every Yale student should take an ER&M course in order to have a critical lens of any discipline they choose to pursue. ER&M 200 is a great place to start in this endeavor.",
    "Yes, it is a strong course to start with - especially if you are interested in Ethnicity, Race, and Migration.",
    "As a senior in the ER&M major, I would definitely recommend this course to first or second years or someone early on in their college careers because it is a useful base to start with. It would be helpful knowledge to have in order to understand future more complex courses.",
    "I would. Necessary class for anyone that will impact the world.",
    "Yes, anybody who is graduating from Yale College should be required to take an ER&M class, specifically this one given the nature of the material it handles and the absolutely necessary information it disseminates.",
    "Absolutely. I learned so much about multiple ethnic groups and I was able to learn about the different disciplines within the major.",
    "Yes, I felt that it was an engaging, critical, and eye opening introduction to an area of study that bears much weight in the world.",
    "Would recommend for underclassmen (especially first years) interested in exploring ethnic and critical studies. Upperclassmen who have dabbled in non-ERM fields looking to take this class may also be fulfilled. For the majors who have already taken similar classes, you might not get that much out of it, but it's chill and you have to do it anyway",
    "Yes, definitely. This is the kind of information that is vital to understanding things moving forward (whatever major you are), and that you might not get elsewhere. Take it!",
    "Yes! If you are interested in ER&M and the major, this is a great class that provides a sample of the many things that the major has to offer.",
    "If you are looking for a humanities credit that won't bore you to death, this is absolutely the course for you. As someone coming from a quantitative background, I appreciated how patient the staff were during sections and lectures. It isn't easy engaging with new material on such a deep, intellectual level but the course enabled me to grow in my understanding of the racial and gendered aspects that aren't explored as much in human history."
