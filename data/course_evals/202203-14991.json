                "I learned a lot about examining translated texts, and I",
                "I definitely improved my reading skills in reading ancient Greek and Roman texts. Most, if not all, of the texts we read were in epic poetry format, which was not something I was familiar with except for the brief moment in high school when I read The Odyssey. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and definitely improved my analysis of these texts when reading them as a whole. I was able to draw connections across text and recognized with mild amusement and delight when we reached the point where texts we read referenced other texts we had read (Dante's Inferno). \r\nMy appreciation of classics and this time period has greatly improved. These really are foundational texts that I'm glad I read. The learning curve is very real and very intense (for me, coming from a magnet, STEM-oriented, public high school education) in terms of reading workload and essay writing and preparation, but there's a lot of support. The design of the program overall helped me with time management and reading/writing skills, all of which I am grateful for.",
                "Western literary tradition.",
                "I gained a knowledge and appreciation for classical literary texts through this course; reading such voluminous and impactful works was super exciting, and the ideas we grappled with --- from that of a hero's kleos in Homer to justice in the Oresteia --- were fascinating.\r\n\r\nAs for skills, I think time management and paper writing are at the top. Learning how to churn out a cogent, original, and persuasive piece of writing in a short period of time is not something I had previously done. The structure of DS allowed me to hone this skill, and I am very grateful to have received that preparation for the rest of college.",
                "I learned how to read carefully and to participate effectively in a seminar setting. For example, I learned that the most effective seminar is not just one person speaking, but rather a more collaborative effort that includes everyone. Professor Stoner also taught me how to leave my ego at the door when Im reading and read the texts with a true blank slate without putting my modern biases within the interpretation."

                "Most of the books are fun. But the Aristotle reading is probably unnecessary and Confessions was uninteresting. Also, Matthew should be in H&P.",
                "Strengths: Incredible texts, great lectures (for the most part), and the dedication of professors in seminars was unparalleled.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The workload (and, in particular, the lit readings of DS) are absolutely massive. I understand that, to an extent, this cannot be controlled, but I'm not sure how relevant they all are. For instance, how important is it that we read all of Augustine's Confessions? Texts like these could be cut down, allowing for a more manageable workload. The other key weakness is paper return time --- some professors were incredibly slow at returning papers, and this both hindered our ability to write the next one and bled over into work for other classes.",
                "This course was incredible. I always felt included and appreciated and even when I felt nervous or shy, Professor Stoner was a calming presence. I thought that Professor Stoner carefully thought about the lesson plan before each class, and I appreciate her attention to detail and her focus on us."

I had extremely limited experience with these texts coming it, but I wanted to try it out and overall I would recommend it. It is intense and difficult but really rewarding: you get out of it as much as you put into it, and by design, this course asks you to put a lot into it. It's a beautifully design liberal arts education, and I guaranteed it's hard to regret doing it, even if it feels too difficult at times.",
                "Stoner was great. DS was good.",
                "10. Definitely, but only if someone is interested in ideas. Coming into DS, I had had no previous exposure to the Western Canon, and I was not particularly keen on taking two literature courses. What excited me, however, was the structure of the course. Having completed one semester, I now feel as though it is the content that I found most rewarding. I don't mean to say that the DS content is better than anything I've ever read (and I've certainly read more interesting texts), but the ideas embedded within DS works are beautiful and multilayered and, quite frankly, fascinating. So my recommendation for someone considering DS would be this: take the course if you are interested in grappling with new ideas, and take the class if you want to improve your writing. Only if they meet these two criteria would I recommend DS.",
                "I would recommend this class because I think that we read some fantastic books, but more importantly, Professor Stoner makes everyone feel welcome. She is one of the smartest teachers Ive ever had, and I always knew that I could rely on her as an instructor."
