            "comments": [
                "The strength is that I did learn a lot from this course. The problem is that the professor sometimes went too fast with some of the materials, which made me hard to follow. Generally, it is a great course that let me gain a lot.",
                "Strengths: professor was friendly and answered questions. Weaknesses: psets were veryyyy difficult, very few grades were provided until the very end of the semester (so no idea how you were doing really), class moved quite fast",
                "Strengths: the material is interesting and working on problems is fun & challenging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I am not sure how well organized everything was; we didn't really get our problem sets graded in a timely manner. I don't know how much of this is a function of one of our graders quitting versus the prof.",
                "Strengths: I gained a pretty wide and deep understanding of a variety of topics in Real Analysis for just a single semester course. Got practice writing proofs (and I think this style of very clear and rigorous thinking is good to foster no matter what you end up studying). \r\nWeaknesses: The exams were poorly calibrated, as the first was too easy, the second too hard (though in reflection I actually think the second was the appropriate level and that I, and many of my peers, was just not adequately prepared), and the final maybe slightly on the easy side (though since it had to be changed from in-person to take home this should maybe be given a pass). This poor calibration of the exams meant that reviewing was often difficult. The graders sucked! They only graded 3 psets out of 7 so the professor is having to grade the rest, which isn't really fair to Prof. Smart, but also means that we got very little feedback on our work throughout the semester. This wasn't as big a deal for me as I had some previous proof writing experience, but I imagine this was a struggle for those with less experience. On a related note, this course was meant to be accessible as a first proof based course, but it didn't do a particularly good job in that regard since the first few PSETS were tricky and thus were not the most appropriate things to see as a first exposure to proofs.",
                "Strengths: pretty good intro course to proof writing\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs could be overwhelming at times (particularly in the first couple of weeks), even when going to office hours",
                "Strength: great TF, comprehensive knowledge \r\nWeakness: difficult midterm, hard to understand textbook",
                "The problem sets were engaging and challenging, and I enjoyed working on them a lot. Lectures could be improved, as I did not comprehend the material until I read the textbook. However, this might be due to a lack of grey matter in my noggin",
                "Didnt feel super organized, often felt like much of class focused on speeding through proofs so we didnt get much of an understanding of them",
                "The strength is how small the class is so you can ask the Professor questions when you need to. The weakness was the lack of communication between the Professor and the TAs as well as getting more extra help",
                "I decline to answer this question because if this sort of feedback were taken seriously the course would not have been as bad as it was in the first place.",
                "Super Interesting. Great Lectures. A lot of Work. The problem sets could have been graded a little quicker.",
                "Strength: The part on metric spaces is very nice.\r\nWeaknesses: The textbook and lectures do not cover the content in-depth enough to meet the difficulty of the exercises.",
                "The lectures are disorganized and the course itself is extremely difficult to follow. \r\nProfessor Smart would blow through superficial explanations of theorems and their proofs at a rapid speed without any contextualization of their significance or connections to each other. The course would highly benefit from a professor that can give more specific explanations for how theorems relate to each other, why certain proof strategies for certain topics are useful, etc. \r\nFor the vast majority of the course, I felt like I was just attempting to copy down random proofs that Prof Smart would write on the board but left class with no understanding of how these proofs worked or conceptually what the concepts in the proofs covered. \r\nMost of the course will just be self teaching from textbooks because lectures were confusing at best. \r\nOrganizationally, this course didnt have a clear syllabus of when and what topics were covered each week, which portions of the textbook should be read, etc. students had to constantly remind the professor to upload this information.\r\nAlso, dont expect any psets to be graded on time or at all. Even up to the final, the final 4 psets were left ungraded. This is extremely problematic in a course where students rely on feedback on proofs to correct themselves and learn from it. This was also problematic since the prof would wait until the midterms to post the solutions to the homework. I honestly had no idea how I was doing in the course, if my proof writing was correct, etc.",
                "Overall very good, homework is a little bit hard and we did not get feedback in time.",
                "Strengths: the material was very interesting, the course was very conceptual in nature\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A",
                "This course is marketed as an intro to proofs. However, we immediately started notes by just copying down advanced proofs from the textbooks which were very hard to understand without a proofs background. There were proofs workshops done by the TFs but these were at a very basic level and did not help us engage with the course content or homework, which was exceedingly difficult. I think that time should be specifically dedicated during the first few weeks of classes to learning proofs to a level that the homework and tests will later require.",
                "Overall, the professor was a strength of this course. He was very enthusiastic about the material, and very patient and thorough when responding to students' questions. I also appreciated that there was an intentional structure to the curriculum, and that the professor would note explicitly why certain units/topics were important or useful in relation to one another. \r\n\r\nHowever, many of the professor's strengths were often obscured by an overall lack of logistical organization in the course. Principally, due to a problem with the course graders, students did not receive grades for the majority of their problem sets until the end of the semester.  As a result, students received very little feedback to inform them of their progress in the course, or of any mistakes they were making. This made it difficult to approach the exams. \r\n\r\nThroughout the course, there was also quite a bit of ambiguity surrounding how the grade cutoffs would be determined, and what the tests were expected to cover in relation to the course content. \r\n\r\nSeveral lectures also felt very rushed, and I found myself having to revisit the lecture notes in order to understand the lecture's content. While I understand that this is a consequence of a full/rich curriculum, I was disappointed that I could not keep up with the lecture enough in order to pose questions and engage with the material during class. \r\n\r\nFinally, and more broadly, I think this class might benefit from being split into multiple smaller sections. Particularly because many of the students taking this course may not yet have a strong background in proof writing, a smaller class size could facilitate a more interactive learning environment in which students are learning not only about the concepts of real analysis, but also about how to implement these concepts into their own proofs."

I thought the workload was doable (except for the first 2 psets which for some reason were very hard). In general I would recommend, but only if you think you would find the material interesting. If not it's just intellectual labor for fruit that probably have no practical use in the real world.",
                "I say yes, though I expect this course to somewhat divide opinion. The PSETS and exams were occasionally quite difficult, and lectures were often a constant stream of proofs/theorems for the full 75 minutes. All of this meant that the  course sometimes felt quite demanding and the material quite confusing. Those are reasons not to take the course. On the other hand, I do think that I got a solid understanding of many of the basic results and methods used in Real Analysis and that I am able to fluently apply these, sometimes quite abstract, concepts in proofs. I do not think I would have the same breadth or depth of understanding if the course had not been as challenging or fast-paced. I think the right characterization, then, is that if you are up for a potentially difficult course which will require substantial investments of mental energy then I think this course is really good for you, but if you are looking for an easy math course as an easy introduction to proofs then this will likely be too challenging. Note, though, that this course might not be taught in a similar way in the future since this was the first semester it was offered and the first semester Prof. Smart is at Yale.",

                "Yes. Even if you are not math major, and you still want to know what math major is like, this course is a better introduction than linear algebra.",

                "I would not recommend this course. However, I think this is due to the poor organization and lack of planning that went into it. With a different professor I could see things going very differently."
