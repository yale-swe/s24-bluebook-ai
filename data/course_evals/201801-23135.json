    "I enjoyed the readings and I thought the sequence of essays was a good way to improve especially for someone with a less strong background in writing. I thought that the trips out of the classroom were especially interesting and thought perhaps we could have spent more time visiting libraries and engaging in first-hand research as a class.",
    "Strengths: intimate and very good readings. The discussion was led very well. \r\nWeaknesses: too few students. Workshops were helpful but could be improved if the guidelines (and papers) were sent ahead of time for us to think about and work on. Same goes for the in class writings."

    "Yes! Prof. Ellermann is awesome! The class topic of \"The Politics of Art\" is very eye-opening and valuable to analyze. I liked the class readings a lot-- most of them focus on race and art in America, but in different contexts. I also thought my writing improved a lot, and the pace of the workload was just right."
