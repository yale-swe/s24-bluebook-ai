Respectfully dissecting and examining the cultural nuances of Indonesian culture that guide our worldviews and practices: gender, sex, history of colonialism and mental health.",

Not only does she give us the tools we need to communicate, but also an abundance of history that makes engaging in the course easy. It is also fascinating to learn about how the minds of Western people differ from Eastern and our perspectives of everyday life."
