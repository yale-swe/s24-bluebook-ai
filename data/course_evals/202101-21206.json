This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale since it was engaging and fascinating, and I learned new skills and ways of thinking that are applicable to any future career.",
                "I learned how to become a better writer by taking this course. I learned how to write an appropriate college-level essay with an authoritative tone, a clear thesis, a mapping sentence, and several detailed body paragraphs. I also learned how to cite correctly using MLA and Chicago formatting. This course also expanded my current knowledge of grammar and allowed me to write clearer, more organized papers.",
                "In terms of the subject material, I gained a greater understanding of CAM, something that I had little knowledge of but great interest in.

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: The professor. Larissa Tsukamoto was an amazing person to learn from and she recognized when we needed breaks or extensions and was incredibly generous with them. She made each class period engaging and fascinating even if the material was neither of these things. She also gave us ample opportunities for extra credit which unfortunately is the first time I have had a professor do this in my past two years at Yale. I believe she did this intentionally, so that we could focus on learning the material rather than stress out about grades. Since she was incredibly accommodating and personable, I honestly can't think of any notable weaknesses.",
                "This course was phenomenal. Professor Tsukamoto did an excellent job of creating an environment where everyone could get engaged in interesting discussions. The space was positive and collaborative, and I particularly enjoyed our daily Writing Exercises at the beginning of class. There was also a great balance of readings and videos for homework. I also appreciated the emphasis that Professor Tsukamoto placed on self-care, and how she implemented two optional mental health days to allow students to focus on taking care of themselves. \r\nI honestly cannot think of improvements for this class; it is amazing.",
                "I think this class focused on how everyone could become a better writer, not on determining who the best writer was, which I really appreciated. I think any issues I had with the course were only due to the online nature, because Zoom is not the easiest discussion platform, which is obviously out of anyone's control.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsukamoto is amazing, the course contents are SUPER interesting, and Professor Tsukamoto is really knowledgeable about different CAM modalities. Good balance of different types of readings and had really engaging discussions with other students.\r\nWeaknesses: that it wasn't in person, but that's because of COVID :(",
                "The strengths of this course were the unique material and topic that was covered because I learned something new about alternative medicine every day. I appreciated the complexities of the conversations held in class and the social engagement required. I believe that this course could be improved if we were able to more deeply engage with the types of CAM covered rather than a great overview of a few, but I am unsure how this depth would be achieved.",
                "Strengths:\r\n- Wide diverse set of topics but with a common focus\r\n- Variety of writing styles introduced\r\n- Relaxed learning environment which improves learning effectiveness\r\n- Clear, flexible deadlines\r\n- Discussion is very much encouraged, student-led presentations of readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Wish more interaction with students outside of class (some minor facilitation to potentially match students with each other would be nice, this is not something I would say if we were in non-COVID times, but because of COVID and everything being online, would have been nice, at the same time, I could have done more of this myself)\r\n- Sometimes not as sure what the takeaways from readings were (I know the instructor didn't want to impose her worldview which may have played a role in this, but perhaps a summary of bullets would be nice in a document form after class)",
                "One strength of this course was that the discussions were really driven by students and allowed for lots of learning from eachother. Another strength was that when the teacher did involve herself in the discussion then it really helped to prod more ideas that led to more rich and complete discussions. I think the course could have been improved towards the end because at the end of the course when the discussions mainly involved watching videos, it definitely took away from time that could have gone to having fruitful conversations.",
                "The strengths of this class consisted of allowing extensions for assignments, especially during the online format, encouraging students to take care of their mental health before anything else, allowing students to guide the class discussions and content, teaching grammatical, tonal, and thematic concepts in relation to our individual writing assignments, as well as being open towards any requests or desires of the students throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness was the online format.",
                "pretty chill for an English course",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsukamoto!!! Professor Tsukamoto (genuinely one of the nicest people who cares about the health and wellbeing of every student) was one of the best professors I've had so far at Yale! The readings were also incredibly interesting and so the topics focused on in this course were a huge strength. Weaknesses: This is more so a structural feature of ENGL 114 courses, but I felt that my papers ended up being similar in structure and what they were arguing, and so my writing felt repetitive.",

                "The small virtual seminar was definitely a good way to keep our attention throughout the semester and made us much more comfortable participating in discourse about the material. We also had break-out rooms so that we could edit each other's papers which were incredibly helpful.",
                "The course worked very well in a virtual format; the small class size allowed for full class participation and the facilitation of a close-knit environment. The only thing that could be improved is the time of the class itself: 7:30 pm EST was a bit late for some of us. That being said, if I had to, I would take this class at any hour of the day or night  it was worth it.",
                "I think it is difficult to have discussions online, but I think this is unavoidable. I believe that the class was structured in the best way possible, given the circumstances. I think having every student lead two discussions was particularly effective as everyone got a chance to speak.",
                "I enjoyed the daily writing journals and how students led discussions.",
                "Succeeded:\r\n- Seminar format, lots of engagement with the activities, everyone felt comfortable talking in class\r\n- Breakout rooms used to engage with other students in writing workshops\r\n- Easy to ask questions\r\n- Instructor met one on one with students which fostered more connection and motivation\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n- A bit more facilitation for student-to-student interaction (not necessarily a requirement of a course per-say so perhaps outside of instructor's responsiblities)\r\n- More concrete takeaways given a seminar format and conversations can veer off course pretty easily (not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, I really enjoyed some of the tangent philosophical discussions)",

You learn a lot about various modes of complementary and alternative medicine, and how that fits in with Western medicine. You get a solid amount of writing practice\/feedback on essays, with some key takeaways by the end of the course. All in all, a great course for any student of any major.",

                "Yes! Larissa is an amazing teacher who not only knows what she's talking about but really cares about student mental health and provides tremendous individual feedback. If you want to learn about alternative medicine while improving your writing, take this class!",
                "I would certainly recommend this course to anybody, especially students who are thinking about entering the medical field. This course really expands your world view and gets you thinking about the outside world rather than just having a narrow focus on western modern medicine.",
                "Absolutely. Although I did not enjoy the online format, the content, readings, and assignments for this class were extremely interesting and informative. They helped create a more diverse outlook on medicine, causing the students to question the possible limitations and prejudices that are present in our own medical practices.",
                "Absolutely! This is most certainly one of the best ENGL 114 courses because of Professor Tsukamoto alone, and if you are even remotely interested in medicine, then the topics discussed in this course will be of great interest to you."
