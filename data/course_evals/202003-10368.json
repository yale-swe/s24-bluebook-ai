I learned so much about the history of the world post-WWII, but I also learned about how to evaluate this time period.

                "Strengths include good readings and good professors. However the course can be improved through more structured lectures.",
                "The professors, course materials, and TFs are all major strengths of this course.  I think the workload was just right, and the hot-takes kept me engaged for every lecture, even when I knew I would not be speaking in class.  The only major thing I would change about the class structure is allowing for more interaction between the professors and the students.  I appreciate that they would often both stay on Zoom overtime to discuss class topics with students, but I wish students would have been more encouraged to stay longer or that there were more time in the middle of lecture to answer student questions.",
                "Strengths: each lecture was really well organized and interesting, and the readings were a nice mix of op-eds, academic papers, and documentaries\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I was confused by the historical timeline of the lectures",
                "the lectures are great, the readings were not (except Persepolis)",
                "Lectures were phenomenal and writing assignments were challenging.",
                "I liked how the course required reflections of each lecture to really think about what you just learned. I think some of the paper topics were very challenging to find a way to tie it to the course.",
                "Good course overall, name of the course is terrible and does not reflect what is being taught. Also sometimes, it was a little too social justice warrior preachy for me at least.",
                "The professors were very engaging and discussed super interesting topics",
                "Too little viewpoint diversity, even for Yale.",
                "Section was perhaps overly focused on the readings, I wish it had been more free-form. I also found the essay prompts troublingly vague.",
                "Strengths: The TA's are the greatest asset that this course has to offer. Weekly sections greatly increased my engagement with the course. Andrs Bustamante was an amazing discussion facilitator and always had unique viewpoints to offer based on not only lecture material, but our own interpretations. Professors Magaziner and Moyn were also great lecturers. It was clear during their lectures and Q&A's after class that they are not only well-informed in their respective areas of study but experts at visualizing large trends in history.\r\nWeaknesses: While the lectures in the first half of the course felt unified, this cohesion started to falter somewhat during the second half of the course. I felt that some of the lectures between the two professors were not as interconnected or, at least, that connection was not offered to us as it had been through lecture, sections, and writing prompts for the first half of the course.",
                "Lecture are very fast pace. However, if you pay attention and have the time to do the readings it is a great class.",
                "This course was good for a history class, however I was quite preoccupied by all my MCDB courses.",
                "I really like it",
                "The professors felt like they were reading rather than lecturing, which sometimes made the lectures dry. It also meant that they were speaking very fast, which also made it hard to follow.",
                "The course covers a broad range of topics, which is both a strength and weakness.  If one week's lectures aren't engaging, the course moves on quickly, but I did find it hard to synthesize some of the broader trends discussed into the course into papers with cohesive theses.",
                "The course was very engaging and interesting and the submit was fascinating",
                "Strengths professors cared a lot about the students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses The class was extremely politically one-sided. Some of the claims made and arguments by the professors bordered on being radical-left. If some of the content of this course were to be released to mainstream media, it would shock the public on how \"crazy\" the ivies are becoming with regard to political leanings. The professors openly professed their adamant support for Bernie Sanders, other socialists, and communists (like Che Guevara) from the past. The course would be well served by including more than just one opinion on matters that are very important to history and society (including race relations, foreign diplomacy, economics, gender, and the environment)?",
                "One weakness of this course is that it is very broad and the various lectures don't always connect with one another. I thought the lectures in the first half of the course were very well organized, but the ones in the later half were too disconnected and jumped around too much for me to build any takehome message.",
                "The lectures were always interesting, but a bit disorganized for my taste. The weekly topics jumped quite a bit and were hard to keep track of.",
                "I enjoyed the chronology of the course timeline, from post WWII to the 2000s. Professors Magaziner and Moyn also lectured on thought-provoking, interesting topics. I wish the Powerpoints accompanying lectures incorporated the terms from the handout, so we wouldn't have to cross-reference the sheet to check spelling.",
                "I liked how both Professors Moyn and Magaziner gave one lecture per week, but it often seemed like these lectures weren't related at all. It would be helpful if each week had a theme that both lectures could relate to. Also, sometimes the lectures jumped around in time, so it would be helpful if one of the course documents (or maybe course assignments) would be to put everything on a timeline so that we could more easily draw connections between events in various countries. \r\n\r\nInstead of \"hot takes\" posted on Canvas, I think it would be better to ask each student to create a twitter account and post tweets about each lecture (and perhaps follow relevant academics on twitter), so that way we could engage with our classmates more easily and link to other thinkers\/articles\/etc.",
                "No big weaknesses. Strengths are having 50 min lectures which are digestible to students. Sections are also fun to participate and expand on classroom material.",
                "The course jumps around a lot, but that was fine. I thought some of the weeks were much more interesting than others, and some of the readings or documentaries were just kind of odd. The live lecture was good, though, and my section was great. I also liked that the papers were pretty easy but also required engagement with the course materials and a decent amount of thought.",
                "This course is a single narrative. Needs to be more fair.",
                "The course was well-organized and the lectures were very interesting and engaging. It could be improved with more unity within the blocks of the course; I felt besides the first unit (Cold War), all the other lectures didn't totally relate to each other or to their respective units, which was confusing at times.",
                "No weaknesses I can think of. I could go on and on about how good this course was, but I won't.",
                "strength- lots of great topics discussed, seminar format great, work load great, flexibility in grading, care about improvement\r\nweakness- very clear political views of professors and TAs; seemed like a socialism indoctrination course at times",
                "The strengths were the the lectures were very engaging.",
                "Strengths\r\nProfessors Moyn and Magaziner were knowledgable and great orators \r\nThe subject matter was engaging\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nSometimes the readers were unnecessary\r\nThere was often not enough time for questions",
                "Strengths: reading was interesting and actually felt useful for once! Instructors were the best lecturers I've ever had who truly knew the material and even cracked funny jokes\/quips every once in a while. Discussion sections people were amazing to talk to and we all wanted to participate because the material was so easy to connect to\/have an opinion on. Loved this course. No improvements needed.",
                "some lectures throughout the course seemed random and it was sometimes difficult to connect one lecture to the next",
                "Discussion sections were great, everything else was so so.",
                "It's more of a survey course, which is to be expected given the structure. I wish we had more time to cover topics in detail. However, I loved how inclusive and diverse our course material was.",
                "This course was interesting in that it covered interesting topics - ie: Vietnam War, pertinent contemporary issues... but it is difficult to look past the truth: this course was socialist propaganda."

In section, I'd rather have the course policy be that everyone remain unmuted (unless there's a lot of background noise) so that discussions would seem less awkward (hey x, we can't hear you, you're muted... x 4) and flow better.",
                "Course instructors and section leaders were flexible with office hours and meetings. Allowed for easier learning.",
                "The live synchronous lecture on Zoom worked fairly well. It was easier to stay on track with watching lecture than my classes that had recorded lectures.",
                "great! no complaints here. Well run",
                "I felt that the course succeeded my expectations.",

                "Live lecture was engaging - no complaints!",

                "Nah. Workload looks low but I wouldn't take it again. The lectures are boring and the assignments are really annoying. The TA are also really harsh with grading for no reason. Professors are nice but it looks like even they don't really enjoy teaching the class.",
                "Yes! Gives an excellent, in depth analysis on specific phenomena that occurred during the latter half of the 1900s and the lasting impact these events have had on our world today. I took this class in order to widen my knowledge of global history and it did exactly that.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  It covers a great section of history that is still not fully understood, and therefore offers more room for interpretation and historical analysis.  I think the class has just the right amount of work, and not too much busy work.  The professors and TFs all give great feedback and are extremely approachable.",
                "Yes. Workload is reasonable and (depending on your TA) grading is fair. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the lectures and I feel like have become a better writer.",
                "YES! Definitely take this course. It's a great balance between super interesting lectures from some of Yale's top History professors and a relatively low workload and chill TFs. There is weekly reading but it's short, and then 4 5-page papers which are very doable. The readings and lectures are super interesting and put the events of the last century in context. 100% take this class!",
                "yes, great class",
                "Yes",
                "One of the best history classes I've taken. The course gives a great overview of history after the 1940s with a focus on decolonization and the rise of neoliberalism. The content in the course was very interesting to me and I wish we had time to dive a bit deeper into some of the topics. I will say that some previous knowledge of modern world history would be helpful in understanding some of the topics covered in class.",
                "Getting a good TF definitely matters in this course as they grade papers and participation and I was not so lucky. I think this class would be fun and enjoyable with the right TF but if you don't get one it could become stressful and tedious.",
                "Yes because it is history that normally isn't taught in high school or other courses as most history classes end with the Cold War.",
                "Yeah sure. Pretty easy humanities credit. Assignments were fine depending on TF. Interesting material. Might just be a little too preachy in terms of socialism and left-leaning ideology.",
                "Yes! It helped me adopt a different framework for thinking about decolonization and world politics",
                "Yes, I found the topics generally quite interesting.",
                "I recommend this course to any student with a passing interest in the history of the twentieth century or current events. It does a good job of offering one possible narrative of recent history in connection with the world today. The professors are engaging and knowledgeable and the TA's are amazing. One thing to note, however, is that this course requires more engagement than expected given the syllabus. While there are only four writing prompts, the reflection\/hot-take at the end of each lecture quickly adds up. I was writing an average of 600-800 words per week for this class without accounting for the writing prompts (which are admittedly shorter than for most history classes).",
                "Eh, I'm not a history major so it's not really my area of interest, but it is a good class if you're into that stuff.",
                "Yes!",
                "Probably not because of the way the lectures were delivered.",
                "Yes.",
                "Yes! If you feel (like I felt) that you don't have a great foundation for global politics or recent world history, this course will help you approach any other history or global course.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! The submit is fascinating and the faculty was excellent.",
                "Yes, I believe the course does a good jobs explaining the many faceted and interconnected nature of modern history, from around WWII onward. It especially does a great job focusing on parts of the world more often skimmed over or ignored in high school history classes.",
                "No I wouldn't. I felt it was one of the most poorly delivered courses I've ever taken at Yale. Very disappointed with the delivery of the content and the bias with which it was delivered.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're interested in history.",
                "Yes, absolutely. Very interesting topics (everything from human rights to Bob Marley) and the short essays help you synthesize course material to understand themes better.",
                "Yes, totally, I think a lot of the course content is material that everyone should know.",
                "Yes. This is a good history course to gain deeper understandings of world interactions, especially in ways not traditionally covered.",
                "This class was fine, though not great. The material is different and interesting, and I wanted to take a class with a leftist bent because I hadn't really taken something like that before. Overall, it was pretty easy and I enjoyed it.",
                "Most leftist course offered at Yale. Im not even conservative, but this was a bit whacky.",
                "I recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about world history and world events from the post WWII era to 2000.",
                "Yes!!! In my 4 years at Yale, this was probably one of the top 3 courses I've taken.  It's hard to express how fascinating I found the content and how strongly I would recommend it to literally any other student. Thanks to it, I've developed an immeasurably richer understanding of the world we live in. Professors Moyn and Magaziner are phenomenal lecturers, weaving together an impossibly large amount of history into a series of coherent narratives. (Even better, they do so without assigning a ton of work.) The one thing to be forewarned about is that it's very much a survey course, albeit one with more thematic coherence than APUSH or AP Euro. If that's not your thing, look elsewhere.",
                "Yes. The course content and lectures are engaging",
                "No.",
                "Yes, but understand the course is very broad...i didnt come out with specific knowledge per say, more of a greater perspective",
                "I would, however, it is TF dependent as to how difficult it is.",
                "This is a very interesting course about the recent history of the world.",
                "Yes. It was a great introduction to modern history for any kind of student and challenges your understanding of the world we live in today.",
                "Yes - it will allow you to understand how we got here as a society, understand the great power dynamics between people of this world, globalization, larger trends, everything. This is a must take and you'll see what you learned from this class everywhere you go.",
                "Yes, if they enjoy history or want an introduction into the subject matter.",
                "This course is socialist propaganda. It perpetuates an incredibly skewed narrative - it is entirely liberal nonsense. The issues discussed are interesting, but would only recommend if you are very liberal."
