    "good overview of different areas of BME. I thought it was really interesting, despite not planning on majoring in BME. I enjoyed learning about different research in the field",
    "Information about biomedical engineering research, basics of biomedical engineering principles.",
    "I got a general idea of different academic fields in BME and got to know some upperclassmen.",
    "Learned about research going on in all the different BME labs at Yale",
    "I gained an overview of the field of BME and a true understanding of what research in this field looks like.",
    "We heard from different BME professors in the department about their research, covering a wide range of topics. Some lectures were more interesting than others, but it is definitely a good sweep of academia in BME. Prof KMJ is great and hopefully will be able to get someone from industry next year!",
    "I learned how to read scientific papers and then write\/talk about them.",
    "This class was helpful to meet a lot of different biomedical engineering professors from different subfields and to learn more about their research. This class served as a survey class into the major and allowed me to see what options I have and whether or not I want to continue pursing the major (which I do!). The summary articles also give us a chance to take what we learned and write about the research in a way that outsiders can understand the importance and implications of the research.",
    "This course is a great for students who are interested in BME but want to know more about the different research areas and careers. I was able to learn more about the different biomedical engineering branches (such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, biomedical imaging) allowing me better understand which path is for me.",
    "Learnt about what yale BME profs research are about",
    "An overview of BME professors at Yale.",
    "During this course, which was structured as a series of lectures from different researchers and professors in the biomedical engineering department, I largely learned how to get as much insight as possible from complex presentations for which I had little to no background information. Overall, the course was successful in its goal of exposing students interested in majoring in Biomedical Engineering to different areas and subtopics in the field, as we attended presentations from researchers in many very different labs.",
    "I learned a little more about the biomedical engineering field, and how research is done.",
    "Learned lots about what biomedical advancements are happening right now.",
    "I learned about some specific research in the field conducted by Yale professors. I also learned a bit more about the differences between different BME concentrations.",
    "It was helpful hearing about a variety of the BME tracks and research from the distinguished professors!",
    "I learned about the different ways in which biomedical engineering can be applied to post undergrad careers.",
    "More about biomedical engineering field after graduation.",
    "A brief survey of biomedical engineering research",
    "This was a great preview of the BME major. It gave a good overview of what we could expect.",
    "A survey of biomedical engineering research and disciplines"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was a little disorganized because it was combined with the senior seminar course, but I believe that will work itself out when it is just sophomores next year.",
    "We talked about it in class, but more speakers from industry would be good, as well as moving the summer internship panel to an earlier date. There also weren't a lot of options for the second writing assignment in terms of topics from class and direction regarding the writing assignments was very unclear. With the quizzes, as the semester went on fewer and fewer of the questions could actually be answered based on the assigned readings which was a little frustrating to spend the time doing the readings and then having to go google the topics and questions on top of it in order to figure out answers.",
    "Strengths= design of the course is meant to give students more insight on what BME is all about. Each week provided students with the opportunity to learn about research from a guest lecturer. It's a great idea in theory\r\nWeaknesses= some of the speakers were not engaging, and there was no industry representation in the group of speakers. Hard for someone who doesn't want to do research to stay engaged",
    "I liked hearing the different professors lecture! I wish we all got access to presentation slides afterwards and access to the document with questions. It would be good if we got a few industry reps from interesting companies\/had exposure to biotech startup life. I liked the idea of an alumni panel and having the internship panel be earlier.\r\nI wish there were more guidelines for the papers - we got an incredibly vague statement for the guidelines and I feel like the TA's graded pretty harshly as a result. I liked writing the papers though.",
    "Great overview of research going on, and interesting lectures. Could be cool to add more speakers from medicine and industry",
    "I loved hearing from the range of professors in this class - that was great. I honestly think this class should be offered during freshman spring. The earlier the better.",
    "Very well organized, nice focused quizzes, reasonable workload.",
    "The grading of the quizzes was sometimes unfair. Clear expectations in the questions were not given which caused issues.",
    "The course was helpful to survey the field and the large range of professors represented was good to see what I wanted to do with biomedical engineering, The course could be improved by getting an even larger range of professors and representation, where we could see more industry speakers or medical device manufacturers (professors turned innovators\/entrepreneurs) so we can see what that is like as well.",
    "The strengths are that it provides more information about the biomedical engineering major for students fairly early on in the BME tract to see if BME is the right major for them. The weekly quizzes\/lectures allowed me to gain a general understanding of the different research areas. However, I think the greatest strength of this course was in the two written research paper assignments. These papers allowed me to read into scientific papers and learn in depth about my chosen topics.\r\n\r\nI think this course can benefit more from bringing in presenters outside of the academic field. I would have liked to learn more about ht industry and business sides of BME.",
    "too big a class to be called a seminar",
    "Weaknesses- not a very useful course. Would have been better if we learned about summer opportunities during the time we could still apply to them, and not after.",
    "Strengths: good setup \r\nWeaknesses: didn't cover a broad range of topics",
    "The strengths of this course were definitely in its lecturers and professors, who were clearly very knowledgeable in their subjects. In addition, having sections with sophomores and seniors together was helpful for us sophomores in gaining insights from the students who have already gone through the same path.\r\n\r\nThere were a few weaknesses. First of all, many of the topics discussed were understandable on a surface level, but especially for sophomores who have not taken many actual BME classes yet, the lectures were often overly technical and more of a jargon-deciphering challenge than interesting introductions to new topics. This will likely be solved when the sophomore and senior sections are completely separated in the future. In addition, while it was clear to see how difficult it was to schedule the speakers, it would have been great to have industry speakers or entrepreneurs in the BME field as well, just to add some diversity to the researchers we listened to. I would also have loved to have the discussion about internships and future classes in the major much earlier in the semester.",
    "Most of the lectures seemed very similar to each other, but that might be because the methods used in each were all very similar. I wish we could've covered a broader range of topics besides \"bioimaging\" and \"drug delivery\" because that seems like most of what we did. \r\nMany of the topics weren't very memorable or engrossing.\r\nThe discussion groups we were put in seemed like we were just regurgitating what the lecturer had told us. I don't think we even could have come up with a solution to their research problem on the spot like that. \r\nAs a sophomore who hasn't taken any biomedical engineering classes before, most lectures weren't easy to follow and were kind of jargon-filled. I wish we had the slides that the lecturers used so we could look back at the material afterwards if we wanted to follow up on the material on our own.",
    "I liked how it met once a week and was a combination of seniors and sophomores.",
    "This course could be improved with industry members or even discussing how BME plays into other fields, like neuroscience or mechanical engineering. I think learning now these fields can overlap and interact would be really useful, especially for people looking to go into industry.",
    "It would be helpful to get more insight into industry work!",
    "The course is nice because it provides an effective survey of different biomedical engineering applications. However, I think the mix of seniors and sophomores makes it difficult to tailor the seminar to the level of different class years.",
    "This course has a great goal of trying to introduce students to biomedical engineering in practice. \r\n\r\nThis course fails to be engaging. The quizzes and writing assignments are arbitrarily graded and rather meaningless as far as an assessment of knowledge goes. The presentations are often boring (regrettably so). \r\n\r\nThere needs to be a much more seminar style focus. Looking through papers and the details of them doesn't offer much in terms of future planning.",
    "Good survey of the different fields in the major. Wish there was more advise\/guidance about choosing a dicsipline"

    "yes, it was definitely interesting whether or not you're a BME major. I think it also helped me feel more secure in my decision not to major in BME because reading the textbook and listening to lectures made me realize how much computer\/electrical knowledge and physics-involved math goes into it, which is not my forte",
    "I would recommend this course for someone considering BME. If you're interested in learning about research on campus this is a great place to start.",
    "Yes! It is required for BME and not a huge amount of work.",
    "Yes, really cool course and fun to hear different professors talk about their research",
    "Yes. Especially if you are on the fence about the BME major.",
    "Requirement for BME. But if you are interested in BME research, by all means take it.",
    "If you are interested in Biomedical Engineering, it is a good course to take.",
    "I would recommend all BME majors take this class as it gives a survey into the field and allows you to determine if BME is a right fit for you.",
    "Yes, this course is beneficial for both students set on BME, and students deciding if it's for them!",
    "no, boring",
    "No, the presentations are interesting, but the grading is horribly unfair\/unclear.",
    "I would recommend this course to the students who are or are strongly considering being biomedical engineering majors, mainly because it is a great way to meet the other prospective majors and get exposure to the topics. Also, it is required for the major.",
    "I think if you're interested in biomedical engineering, this course is worth a try. Prof. Miller-Jensen seems like she wants to introduce a greater variety of experts as lecturers (for example, people from industry.) This course is also only half a credit, so it's easier to fit into a schedule. \r\nIt's also valuable to be able to talk to seniors in biomedical engineering, but a lot of them won't say a word to you unless you bring it up first.",
    "Yes absolutely. It is so interesting and if they are even slightly interested in the BME major then they should try it.",
    "Yes! Great for BME majors",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is excited about research and eager to pay attention to and understand various research projects and applications.",
    "No, it ends up being a waste of time.",
    "Yes, it is a good survey"
