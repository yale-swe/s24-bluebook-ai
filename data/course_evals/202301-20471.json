I think I have gained a new level of criticalness from classroom settings to the most personal ones including an understanding that these are not as distinct environs as I would have thought previously. I feel like a better student in that I can read longer texts, make stronger connections, and transfer those skills and types of knowledge to other work that I do.",

                "This class is brilliant because it simultaneously provides such a deep dive into every ethnographic work, but also such a huge scope. Under the huge frame of kinship, we learned about nation building, kinship, labor, religion, the faultiness of 'culture', family-building, and marriage. You'll learn so much from just doing the readings and engaging with ethnography. Professor Pepi is also an absolutely brilliant teacher, and I am taking away so many new perspectives and analytical lenses from her teaching.",

                "Strengths: Amazing professor, super invigorating books, great engaging students\r\nWeaknesses: None",
                "This course was easily my favorite class. Professor Pepi is truly such a talent; rather than just summarizing our readings in class discussion (a book per week), she would always find a way to expand and complement the work. I truly left every single class feeling like I'd shifted my worldview, and that can be largely attributed to Professor Pepi's skill in fostering conversation and her expertise in the realm of ethnography. It was a really lovely intellectual space to be a part of. I don't consider the reading load to be a weakness because I actually found it super helpful to engage with a full text (rather than excerpts), but it is certainly something to consider before taking the class! You reap the most benefits when you do the full reading, but admittedly it can be difficult to keep up. Overall, this course was profoundly formative in my learning and I believe every aspect of it should be considered a strength.",
                "Professor Pepi makes this course incredible. The content we read was fascinating and opened my mind up to so many new ideas. Though I had no background in anthropology or WGSS at all, I was still able to participate fully in the discussions, as Professor Pepi makes the course accessible for all levels. I cannot think of a single weakness of this course except for my own disappointment that I didn't fully get through every book. Even though the class is over, I genuinely want to go back and read some of the chapters and sections that I skipped because it was all so fascinating.",
                "This is probably the most engaging course I've had at Yale. We had weekly check-ins where we shared how we were doing, what was on our minds, and our thoughts on the readings. The class was a comfortable yet invigorating space and I hope to have this dynamic more in future seminars.",
                "I enjoyed very much the syllabus, and our in class discussions. I thought Professor Pepi offered a very clear agenda. Coming from outside of Anthropology, it was a great taste of how this discipline approaches contemporary issues."

                "Yes! Professor Pepi is a fantastic instructor and a gift to Yale University. This was the type of class I imagined I would take when I first applied to Yale. World-shaking insight every week. Demanding work but work that felt rewarded through contributions in class that synthesize together to create a bigger and better understanding of what it means to make a community, have a family, experience love, and more. While the book a week can be off-putting I enjoyed the majority of our readings and would not have encountered them in any other environment. Combined with Professor Pepi's guidance, care, and genuine want from all of us to learn this course was perfect.",
                "Yes I would! Even if they dont have an interest in gender or sexuality studies, I think they would love to learn from Professor Pepi",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Any student of any discipline would benefit from taking this course because it really changes the way you view yourself, your relationships and society overall.",
                "I would HIGHLY recommend this course, or really, any course with Professor Pepi. There has really been no class like this one. The readings are great, the conversation is always generative, and Professor Pepi is simply brilliant. The readings are demanding, and you should be mindful of the workload before committing yourself, but if you are even remotely interested, you must take it. The writing assignments are flexible and the deadlines are up to you (you get to choose which books to respond to), and Professor Pepi is also very generous and compassionate to each student. Leaving each class, I was always eager to talk with my friends after\/before classes (I even talked with my therapist about how the class was reshaping my beliefs about family). The class is personal, intimate, and really intellectually stimulating. If you're on the fence, take it.",
                "Couldn't recommend it more highly!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course. Dr. Pepi's teaching style is engaging and accommodating, and I felt fully supported yet challenged the entire semester.",
