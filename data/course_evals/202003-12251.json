                "This was Dr. Guo's first class, so as expected it started off a little slow but by the end he had an effective system of lecturing and providing additional support. There were plenty of resources available to help review: recorded lectures, summarizing notes, office hours, recitations, and he was always available via email.",
                "I enjoyed the lectures and thought the class was good. I think that the tests were sometimes very hard and didn't always mirror thee problem sets",
                "Strengths: the course was fairly well organized and we moved at a comfortable pace. Weaknesses: maybe it was just how abstract the material is, but lectures were sometimes hard to follow. It was not very clear how the topics related to each other. The problem sets were challenging and sometimes required problem solving strategies that weren't covered in class, but they were manageable with help. The textbook was not particularly helpful.",
                "Considering that this was Professor Guo's first time teaching the course and it was online, the class went really well. Professor Guo made sure to check in with students' comprehension and tried his best to make the material and assignments clear. A weakness of the course was that it was sometimes difficult to follow along with lectures in the online format, but this improved throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: follows the class textbook, notes are posted on Canvas, homework is reasonable, and the lectures were spaced out well to cover the semester without feeling rushed at the end\r\nWeaknesses: more practice problems would have been helpful, especially for the first half of the semester",
                "Teaching of the courses was strong and it was well structured for learning, but I think we skipped over some concepts (particularly open systems) that seemed important for a chemical engineering class.",
                "Strengths of the course included the teaching, recitations for problem sets and opportunities for discussion. Weaknesses are not that many chances to collaborate with other students. This weakness, however, is associated with the online format of the course."
