                "I thought the course was excellent. Compared to the other senior project I completed for my second major, the S&DS senior project was run so much better. From the very beginning, all the pertinent info and deadlines I needed to know were posted on the Canvas page, and the expectations were quite clear. I also always knew where I could go to get help or if I had a question. In contrast, there was so much ambiguity in expectations and deadlines for my senior project in another major. And from talking to my friends in other majors across Yale, I know that S&DS runs one of the very best and most organized senior projects. This is much appreciated!",
