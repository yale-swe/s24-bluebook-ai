                "This course provides a highly intensive, challenging, yet extremely rewarding dive into the Russian language. I learned not only how to express myself in Russian but also valuable insights from the fantastic instructor, Professor Constantine Muravnik, on the nature of Russian culture and the Russian language. While some may fault the course for progressing through material very quickly, the course is aptly titled; it is intensive, and if you cannot afford to spend a significant amount of time each week to studying the language, grammar, and culture, this course may not be for you. However, if you have a keen interest in the East European/Eurasian region and/or have strong language skills and a will to learn Russian quickly, this course is an absolute must!",
                "Strengths: both professors (Muravnik and our TF Matt) by were really great! Professor Muravnik is a truly amazing instructor, and he does an excellent job of making each class interactive, informative, and honestly quite fun. He's a very enthusiastic lecturer, which definitely helped keep me engaged at all times, despite the fact that class started at 9:35 three times a week. And I really appreciated Matt's lectures as wellhe helped us review a lot of new material and gave us the opportunity to ask questions and practice getting the hang of new grammar. Overall, I felt like the professors were really supportive and approachable, and despite the fact that this class is a huge time commitment (8 hours a week!), it still felt pretty manageable. I think the fact that my class was really small helped a lot as wellwith only eight of us, we got pretty close, which made language-learning more enjoyable because I had people I could practice Russian with outside of class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like Professor Muravnik and Matt could have communicated between each other a bit better. Sometimes they assigned us conflicting assignments, which was often a bit confusing. I remember one class when Professor Muravnik assigned us some video summaries, and we came to class the next day and Matt had no idea they had been assigned. I feel like this made the class feel a little bit disjointed at times. But that's really minor. I guess the only other thing is that words often popped up on the vocab quizzes that we'd never learned before, which was a little bit scary (and irksome).",
                "This course was excellent about introducing vocabulary in a way that sticks, and teaching skills for inferences about new words. There were occasional communication problems though, and I sometimes wished that the practice tests were closer to what we saw on the actual tests. But overall there were very few weaknesses!",
                "The structure of the class and the teaching style of the professor made the course very engaging, and I enjoyed participating in activities with classmates to learn the materials. There is not much I would change."

                "This course provides a robust and thorough introduction to the Russian language. While the course progresses through material at a quick pace, if you are driven to learn Russian quickly and have strong language skills, this course is an excellent opportunity.",
                "I could not recommend this course highly enough to any student who wishes to take a really deep dive into the Russian language. I do think that having some prior exposure to the language helpsI took the whole Duolingo course, so I was at least somewhat familiar with most of the concepts we covered this semesterbut it's not necessary. This course is described as being for \"students of superior linguistic ability,\" and I feel like that's pretty true. You have to really want to learn Russian to take this course and be willing to donate a lot of your time to mastery of the grammar. Don't take it if you just want to get your language requirement done quickly; if you don't want to engage with the language, you'll suffer. Only take it if you're really interested enough in learning a language that you'll willingly devote 8 hours a week to class time, 1 hour a night to homework (it's not hard; it can just be a bit tedious. but it's really important if you want to get better at the language), and extra study time for tests and quizzes (there was one test and one quiz every week). This course moves really fast: we covered a unit a week, and by mid-late October we were starting the second textbook. Consider yourself warned! But againif you're actually excited by the possibility of reaching a relatively high level of fluency in Russian by Decembertake this course.",
                "If you really want to learn, absolutely!",
                "I would recommend this course, as though it had a large workload and moved at a quick pace, the professor and the structure of the class made for a great learning experience."
