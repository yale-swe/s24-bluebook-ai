She has a passion for teaching that shines through in every lesson and makes us genuinely excited to learn and come to class every day. She also designed the course content in a way that was very engaging, with a variety of source material (articles, novels, documentaries, and music videos). There are truly no weaknesses of this course. I loved this course and cannot wait to continue with PORT 140 with Thais.",
                "This course made learning Portuguese very enjoyable and with the asynchronous classes I was able to indulge into the Portuguese language at my own pace and in my own personal environment. I am not sure if this is a strength or a weakness, but compared to high school languages you are taught less about grammar and more about culture, but also more applicable discussion topics in real world scenarios - personally, I like this about the structure of the course.",
