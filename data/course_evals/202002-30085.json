    "Basic overview of major topics and problems in lingusitics",
    "I developed a broad range of linguistic knowledge as well as analytic skills.",
    "In terms of the course material, I was introduced to the phonological, morphological, lexical, and semantic aspects of a language. I learned about the smaller, basic units that constitute a language, while also comparing languages across cultures and analyzing them from social perspectives.",
    "I learned various subfields, such as phonetics, phonology, and morphology. I became familiar with various techniques of linguistic analysis through problem-solving experience. I also gained a new perspective on language and a new sense of respect for the species that can manipulate it so easily.",
    "I gained an understanding of the foundations of Linguistics and the different fields within it.",
    "I learned basic information about the field of linguistics as well as basic linguistic analytical skills.",
    "I received a very insightful introduction to what it means to study linguistics and the different possibilities for further study in the field.",
    "I learned about phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and sociolinguistics. We covered so much material, and I feel very familiar with linguistics now!",
    "I didn't have any formal exposure to linguistics prior to this course, but I have researched for fun earlier, and this course was a fun, engaging way to learn more. This was also my first college class ever, so I was happy that I could keep up with the coursework and that the professors were available for questions outside of class and engaging within class. I also developed some time management\/organization skills that worked for me that will definitely serve me as I continue in my college studies -- these skills are somewhat different from the skills I had time to master in high school so I appreciated the summer environment to learn what worked for me and what did not. This course made me more interested in linguistics, and I am looking to take Language and Mind in the fall. I also was acquainted with linguistic literature in the language description problem set and I began developing skills for reading and understanding it.",
    "Analytical skills and a thorough introduction to the field.",
    "I learned what the subfields of linguistics are and gained basic knowledge of each, and learned what a linguist does and studies.",
    "This was a good intro course to linguistics, covering all the important aspects of linguistics in some depth. Would recommend it to anyone interested in linguistics",
    "a better understanding of major subfields in linguistics",
    "I learned the system that we can apply to analyze a language and I have some new insights to learn a new language. The course helps me to build a structure for getting involved in a language. I learned some common ideas for most language.",
    "basic knowledge structure of language"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was great! Maybe comments should have been typed out though...hard to read handwriting of instructors",
    "The breadth and depth of the course was nicely organized, in the sense that the course covered many subfields of linguistics briefly but in detail. The assigned work definitely reinforced what was being taught in class, especially the language description project. A major weakness would be the fact that the readings and lectures overlapped so much that it felt like the slides were taken directly from the textbook and it was basically unnecessary to do the readings.",
    "The strengths of this course were the problem set assignments, which made sure students were understanding the material. Another strength of this course was the language description project, which allowed students to apply linguistic contents covered in class to a real language and analyze it. A weakness of this course was the overall teaching style during lectures, which was most reading off of a Powerpoint. This teaching style wasn't particularly engaging, especially after two hours of learning material. There were not many discussions or group activities in class either, which made engaging with the class even more difficult. One way to improve this could be allowing for times for students to discuss material in breakout groups, or including videos \/ articles \/ alternatives to only reading off of slides.",
    "Everything is wonderful except the fact that the course being converted into online session due to the pandemic. I really wish to go to the campus and take this course.",
    "No weaknesses! This course was very well organized! Lectures were easy to follow and were structured well, assignments were spread out and had clear instructions, and Josh and Martn were able to create a good class environment with lots of participation even over Zoom.",
    "The course was well-paced considering the short timeframe. The exception to this was that the homework was out of sync with the lectures after the first couple weeks, which was confusing.",
    "The course was very good at introducing the different fields of linguistics and explaining what they entail. It would have also been interesting to have spent some more time looking at contemporary linguistic research. I think it would have helped complete the picture a little more.",
    "The strengths were the incredible professors! Always accessible and genuinely interested in the material.\r\n\r\nThe weakness was the remote component which was not their fault!",
    "Strengths -- engaging lectures, language description project was fun, lots of opportunities to hand in work, very interesting material\r\nWeaknesses -- sometimes lectures were a little redundant and too deep while other lectures were glossed over (happened only a few times),\r\n final presentations were supposed to be 5minutes but many people went far over that time limit so some people had to present with only a few people listening -- would have liked everyone to briefly present 5minutes so everyone had a chance to listen to everyone\r\none quiz was too long for one hour but that was remedied on the second quiz and final",
    "Time constraints were sometimes a bit limiting but I understand that they were out of the instructors' control. However, generally speaking, they were accommodated very well.",
    "The course was exceedingly well organized. No criticisms",
    "The instructors Josh and Martin were great and helpful for whenever I had confusion or needed help understanding something. Also the language description project was very interesting and worthwhile.",
    "For me, personally I think it is a little bit hard for me to learn such a lot of knowledge in such a short period. I think my professor is professional and warm. They are open for our questions and they encourage us to ask questions. They have really professional attitude in teaching and they are always patient for answering our question and they are glad to discuss questions with us.",
    "clear structure\r\ntoo much information"

   "comments": [
    "Yep! If you are interested in learning about this super interesting field, it is a good intro!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student as a introductory and comprehensive overview of linguistics. I definitely had misconceptions about linguistics before taking this course and I'm glad that I now have a much better idea as to what linguistics actually is.",
    "In circumstances where this class could be taken in person and not online, I would recommend this course to another student. However, my experience was based on an online class, and I do not think this course was well suited to be taught through a computer. There was little engagement on the part of the students, it was extremely difficult to focus with lectures as the only method of teaching, and the feedback on assignments was unclear at times. At times it felt like the teachers were rushing to get through the material, and wouldn't spend a long time discussing.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to all my friends who are interested in linguistics and want to take introductory classes in this field, for it is such a clear and comprehensive course.",
    "Yes! Even if you aren't a language person, I would definitely recommend this course as it covers lots of different aspects of linguistics and has something for everyone. It is well organized, so it's easy to follow for people who don't have linguistics\/language backgrounds!",
    "Yes I thought this course was what I was looking for out of intro linguistics.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is broadly interested in language but does not really know where to start. I think this course would help them get a \"lay of the land.\" The course is very much a social science, though, and may not have as much appeal to students who aren't interested in this kind of study.",
    "Yes because it allows students to learn as much as possible about Linguistics in a limited time frame.",
    "Yes, I would. This is an excellent introduction to linguistics which introduces students to a great variety of linguistic subfields. The professors were engaging and the assignments interesting.",
    "Yes. I think the material is of use or interest to a broad swath of students, and it was very well taught.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in linguistics, or if it counts as a prerequisite (eg for Cognitive Science).",
    "I will do this. I think this course is well organized by our professors and its content is very good and useful.\r\nThe professors are kind and professional.",
    "yes. It can build the base of language knowledge for you"
