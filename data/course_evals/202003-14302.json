                "Strength was interesting relevant material. Weaknesses was that nordhaus seemed to plan it as he went along, failing to provide an overview of topics or assignments far in advance",
                "Strengths: Interesting and relevant lecture topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a very engaging class, minimal feedback, unstructured schedules.",
                "I thought the course's material was well organized and the topics covered felt relevant and thoroughly examined. I also thought the assignments did a good job of expanding on or applying the course material in a challenging but manageable way. As for weaknesses, I would have liked to cover a wider range of catastrophes (asteroids, AI, etc.) in more depth that were only briefly mentioned at the start of the course. I was already somewhat familiar with a few of the catastrophe categories we thoroughly examined, so getting more detail on those other catastrophes would have been even more fascinating.",
                "All good",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed writing the final paper. I also learned a lot about the economics of climate change that I didn't know already. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lack of clarity in the course. Probably because it is the first time the course is being taught. Our syllabus had little mention of exams and Professor Nordhaus appeared to be making the course as he went along (we would sometimes learn about an exam only a week before). This was difficult because our expectations felt like they were constantly changing and there were 3 instances where we were expected to meet outside of class hours. In the end we had regular readings, problem sets, 2 midterm exams, 1 final exam, and a 20 paged research paper. Professor Nordhaus wasn't very accessible to reach.",
                "The major strength of this course is that you get to take a class with a truly brilliant leader in the field of climate change economics: Professor Nordhaus. He is a great lecturer, teacher, and person. That being said, students only receive a fraction of the benefits that they could from him due to his lack of engagement with or attention to the course. He renders himself almost completely inaccessible to students throughout the semester -- for course-related or non course-related questions or issues. Although the course was technically a seminar, it really functioned more as a lecture (at best) in terms of access to the professor. As a whole, the course was an absolute mess, and the disorganization was its biggest weakness. The content disproportionately oriented around climate change economics and climate-related catastrophes. Most other types of catastrophes seemed as though they were added into the curriculum rather haphazardly and the topics were only covered at a surface level. The actual logistics of the class were in even greater disarray. Tests, assignments, quizzes, and other course elements were poorly managed, with insufficient communication and information -- an issue which was only exacerbated by the TF's lack of knowledge of the course material. These weaknesses hamstrung the class and diminished Professor Nordhaus's ability to have a meaningful impact as a teacher. All of this being said, I think much of this problem could be addressed by having either an assistant or another professor (co-teaching) associated with the course (and a better TF). Professor Nordhaus really is a great teacher and an even better person, but the disorganized and haphazard nature of the course dominated these qualities and made it impossible for them to shine."

                "All lectures were recorded (in theory), which really helped me review material I had missed the first time or re-examine a student presentation that was particularly fascinating. However, several lectures weren't recorded because of technical difficulties, which is an area that could be improved. Additionally, I really enjoyed the take-home format of the first exam, particularly given the virtual format and ongoing pandemic. I would have liked for the second and final exam to also be take-home, as for me it relieves stress without forfeiting any of the critical thinking elements of the exam.",

                "In its current form, no. With a bit of reorganization and a co-professor or assistant, possibly yes. While Professor Nordhaus is a brilliant leader in his field, a great teacher, and a wonderful person, his lack of engagement with and attention to the course and its students stifle these positive qualities. Although the lectures and material are exciting, they are covered in very little depth and do not necessarily provide you with the tools to analyze related problems in a substantive way. A course with a professor as renowned as Professor Nordhaus is difficult to pass up, but the disorganized nature of the course hinders its positive elements so significantly that you may very well leave the class having learned little to nothing."
