                "This class was very helpful in the sense that it helped me get work on my thesis and other projects done more quickly than they might have been if I had less structure around them. On the negative side of things, I often felt stressed by this class because I was being graded on work that is not usually assessed for a letter grade",
                "I thought the main strength of Research Methods was getting us to put in effort toward our senior thesis, and I think this should be the main aim of the course -- getting good work done on the senior thesis. With that in mind, the main way to improve this course is to streamline things. I think the best way to do this would be to start the thesis work from the very beginning. It's nice to have some time to look at other senior theses, and think about how to introduce our subfield, but I feel like everyone taking the course knows that sooner or later they'll have to choose a senior thesis topic and begin research -- which means the sooner there is a deadline in the course to choose this topic and start reading background literature, the sooner everyone will begin work on their thesis, and then afterward everyone will have more time to focus on this topic, meet with an advisor, revise the topic, and research. I think another improvement that could be made is to decrease the amount of presentation done at the beginning of the course, e.g. presenting on the assignment to read prior senior essays and the assignment to introduce our subfield. This time would be better devoted to choosing a research topic earlier and presenting on your progress later in the semester. I think a presentation on your progress should be required later in the semester, but perhaps as a \"everyone should do this at least once, but at any point, and it can be as informal as you wish\" requirement to give everyone the flexibility to choose when they'll be best prepared to present. Another strength was the work we put in on writing fellowship essays, statements of purpose, etc."
