Also, she created a low-stress environment where we could learn through trying and making mistakes.\r\n\r\nOne flaw was the lack of clear grading. I think it would be nice to know where we stand in the class grade-wise so that we can adjust our work and do the best we can.",

                "I don't think this course has any weaknesses, honestly. Ostad was very attentive and worked with each of us to improve our skills.",
                "I wish for more discussions about our homework.",
                "The professor is very kind, encouraging, and focused on in-class participation so students have ample opportunity to practice their skills. \r\n\r\nThe modes of learning and practicing begin to feel repetitive after awhile. I also think the course could move along more quickly, perhaps by introducing more vocabulary\/letters of the alphabet\/basic grammar rules at one time.",
                "This is a fantastic course. I don't think it has any weaknesses. The workload is manageable. You will learn a lot of the language and a lot about Persian culture."

But Ostad was still able to show us the proper way to write letters through Zoom, and we were still able to practice with partners through breakout rooms.

She evaluated our writing by having us hold things up to the camera, and by annotating photos of our submitted assignments. She used breakout rooms to facilitate conversation among students. And she ensured that every student got the chance to read, write, speak aloud, etc. during class. She is great."

I don't think the course is engaging enough to provide a valuable experience for students who don't already have a certain level of self-motivation to learn Persian but it is enjoyable for someone who is genuinely interested.",
