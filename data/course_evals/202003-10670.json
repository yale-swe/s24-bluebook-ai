The course incorporates a lot of knowledge about Russian history and culture, which was very motivating and exciting for me. Overall, the ability to build on previous grammatical and vocabulary knowledge is strong, and I felt like there was a lot of opportunity for group discussion while students focused on their own individual strengths and weaknesses as speakers."

                "It is excellently taught in a way that combines in person homework\/assignments with class meetings that help engage speaking practice",
                "Strengths: still very engaging while virtual; extremely organized; quick but manageable pace",
                "I liked the course content and the assignments very much. It's useful to do both grammar and Russian history as a two-fold path towards learning language. Presentations were also very interesting and helpful. I would like to see more one-on-one dialogues between students in breakout rooms. I think there will be more overall engagement per person that way.",
                "While true online learning platform made practicing much more difficult, the professor was a highlight of the course.",
                "I really enjoyed this course, and would say its definitely one of my best semesters of Russian in terms of growth. The Professor is very engaged and receptive, and really cares about balancing the comfort and rigor of the course. The strengths are definitely the focus on Russian culture and history, including the multiple narrative\/historical essays we read, and the encouragement in the coursework to read Russian materials like books, poetry, news sources, etc. outside of class. I thought that the time in an intensive class in front of a Zoom camera may have warranted a five-minute break halfway through, but the course was really well-done."
