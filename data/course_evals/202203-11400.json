                "This course was not very engaging nor interesting. We made very few projects and the projects we made were uninspired. What this class should be is an introduction to the art school facilities. One week, show us the laser cutters, give us swipe access, and then assign a project based on the laser cutter. This project can be small, but what it does is prepare us for making art in future classes using a variety of methods and tools. The next week, show us the printers and assign a project, etc.",
                "This is a great course! I really enjoyed taking it and  I loved the experimentation. The course gives you space to grow as an artist but does not pressure you to find your perfect style or medium. It's very exciting.",
                "everything was amazing - manageable course load in comparison to other courses",
                "Strength: I love how open-ended the assignments were. This was so great. It allowed students to take them in many directions.\r\nWeaknesses: The course felt disorganized; one day we would come in and randomly be doing an artist studio visit. The next we would have a work session. The next we would spend 1.5 hours watching how to use the laser cutter which was not a good use of time because we still were not able to use it on our own. This was an exercise in letting go of control in my life but I do think we could have benefitted from laying out a plan at the beginning of the semester and getting a heads up about when class was going to be different.\r\nI feel like I got OK feedback, but often after crit I wasn't sure what to change or improve to make my art better. Crit was just people saying things they noticed, but nothing bigger picture.",
                "i think more structure would be nice in terms of establishing certain skills and aiming to achieve certain goals, but I did like how open ended the subject matter could be"

                "I don't think so. As I mentioned above, it felt like so much time was wasted in this class. It would have been great to have more personal feedback as we worked (Bailey the TA was great at this), and to have more of a long-term vision for what we were going to be doing.",
