We also talked a lot about papyrology, archaeology, economic history, and paleoclimate chemistry in this class! We discussed several approaches to the study of history and applied several methodologies to the study of ancient Greco-Roman Egypt, but spent most of the course discussing primary texts (papyri)."

                "This course is really facilitated toward student engagement with the material, and each lecture is its own thing. You get a lot of exposure to different topics in Ptolemaic and Greco-Roman Egypt.",
                "I think the course is okay overall and that the sources are fairly interesting, however the organization could be better. I think it would be nice if the PowerPoints had more information on them and if the themes of the class were more relevant. I do really appreciate that the readings were already organized on the pages and professor manning tried really hard to make sure everything was available online and free.",
                "The twice weekly lectures were often unorganized and rambling. Ultimately, I did not feel that these meetings contributed either to my understanding of the material or for analysis in papers. Most beneficial were the TF-led sections that went more in-depth on the general topics introduced in the lectures despite having much less time. The section labs concerning petitions and magic were helpful for envisioning the processes of engaging in the ancient Egyptian legal system and the symbolic imagery of magic.  \r\n\r\nI honestly think that this course would be better as a seminar or hybrid lecture/seminar as the lecture content did not improve upon my ability to analyze and discuss the papyri and articles assigned each class, and so the time would be better spent as a discussion between students and professor/tfs.\r\n\r\nSince the lectures did little as preparation for the essays, the essays should be better spread out through the semester with the first paper due sometime in the first month and more time provided for the second paper. I would also switch the second and third papers: the third paper felt somewhat limited in the level and quality of analysis, while the second paper more clearly brought together the intended skills for the class.",
                "Strengths  Prof Mannings enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses  Disorganized nature of themes week by week",
                "Strengths were visits to the Beinecke and essay feedback. Improvements could be made regarding lecture (there should be more consistency w/ slides) and essay prompts (they could be a bit overwhelming and/or repetitive). Section was fine in concept but given the small size it was sometimes hard to keep a conversation going.",
                "The course was fascinating, but there was not a strong sense/ordering of chronology.",
                "The class was really interesting! However, it wasn't organized the best, and it felt like we were learning a bunch of trivia facts about Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman Egypt. However, it was really cool how we were able to go into the Beinecke and interact with papyri excavated from Egypt!"
