                "This class was excellent in prepping me on the actual structure of academic writing. I feel all the more prepared for academic papers in future courses. This class also helped me learn to come up with novel ideas, and I feel much more well-versed and competent in the art of argumentation and literary interpretation.",

Hugo is very fantastic with tracing the line of reasoning you offer and then giving the right comments\/feedback that will help you fix whatever mistake you made in your reasoning. My argumentation skills have dramatically increased from their level back in August--thanks to this class!\r\n\r\n--I familiarized myself with the general structure of college-level academic readings\/writings. This not only helped make the writing process less painful for me, but also helped me in being able to quickly scan other college-level readings\/\r\n\r\n--Learned about the general debate regarding anthropocentrism, ecocentrism and whatnot. Not super interested in environmentalism in stuff but this was a helpful way to get acquainted with the academics' thoughts on this phenomena.",

Even if it still takes me a ton of time and energy to write anything (I'm just personally slow), I feel at least that it can be done."

                "The strengths were how straightforward and to the point Hugo is. The weakness is, I think, the slight lack of an emphasis on writing \"style.\" We learned how to make rigorous and strong arguments, but did not really develop the \"flair\" that makes for an impressive writer.",
                "This course is a good introduction to writing essays for people with little to no experience doing it. The teacher offers personal feedback, which helped me learn more than from my other courses. The writing peer tutor, Jack, was also very helpful. I think more guidance on a research topic for our third paper would have been helpful.",
                "This course has many strengths. Hugo takes time to give detailed feedback on your papers and is always ready to answer your questions. The in-class discussions are also really great, and were my favorite part of the class. Hugo also relates the classwork with your personal interests very well. The only weakness is that I wish we could have gone over feedback in person (over zoom) rather than just getting comments on our documents. I think that discussing the comments on our paper would have been really helpful for writing future papers in the class.",
                "I think the biggest strength is that it was very well structured and each assignment built from the last. The biggest weakness is probably the time commitment. I had to spend a lot of time writing and it ended up being one of my most time-consuming classes. To improve, I'd suggest that maybe the expectations be cut down a little bit, but it's not a big deal.",
                "A big strength is the level of support from the professor outside of class, and the detailed and custom feedback on each and every assignment. Another strength is how we're eased into big essays, with drafts and psets that build up to final versions.",
                "Strengths--Fantastic Instructor (Hugo) who is a very interesting, intelligent and understanding human being! He makes the course rather interesting with the questions he raises and class organization he plans. He is not rigid with plans (which some might consider a weakness since syllabus was frequently changed)--this allowed us to engage in several tasks during one meeting session--with a 5 minute break! Another strength is that the class essentially meets JUST on Thursday, with Tuesday being a brief 30 min session with Hugo and two of your group members. Speaking of which, the Tuesday PSET feedbacks were very helpful in guiding us through our papers and our ideas--Hugo is very amazing with giving practical feedback. Finally, the fact that we were able to choose whatever topic we wanted for Paper 3 and Paper 4 really made the whole research\/writing\/editing process worthwhile since we all, of course, chose topics we were super interested in!\r\n\r\nWeakness--Thursday class times can be boring at times. The issue is not with Hugo, but sometimes the students. While it's supposed to be a discussion session, it's really not usual for most of the class to volunteer and raise a topic for discussion (or follow along a started discussion). Had we been able to do this, I think interesting debates\/conversations would have transpired--an interesting experience. Second weakness is that we got very little feedback for Paper 4 (even though it was similar to Paper 3, which we received a tremendous deal of feedback for). Although this was because we had to submit P4 after Thanksgiving break and so had little time for feedback, it still meant that key mistakes in our paper did not get the chance to be corrected, hurting our grades somehow. Finally, I feel like Hugo did not give us much feedback regarding our writing style (word usage, emphasis, sentence structure). It's probably because he felt that we were all fine with that as Yalies, but I hope more specific comments regarding writing will be offered for future students.",
                "Strengths: very involved instructor, detailed and informative feedback on writing, difficulty of essays increases gradually (not overwhelming), appropriate amount of reading (low enough to not be overwhelming and to allow students to dive deep into each one, high enough to allow exposure to a bunch of writing styles)\r\n\r\nWeakness: This got better over the course of the semester, but it would be nice to consistently receive the week's problem set at an earlier point in the week.",
                "I wish we had spent more time in full class discussions. A lot of the class was in breakout rooms with just one or two people and I would have liked more time discussing with the whole class.",
                "This course did very well with developing my agrumentative writing as well as my writing as a whole. It was very engaging and the feed back was very good."

                "Successes: I really enjoyed the \"whiteboard\" google doc. This was used so that each student could write their own questions\/responses in one spot that all other students could view. Also, a few minutes at the start of each class were dedicated to allowing students to talk to each other about things that aren't related to class (in breakout rooms). This was really nice because it gave me something to look forward to and also made the class feel more close-knit. There was also a short break part way through class to give students a chance to look away from the screen for a moment. This made it so much easier to pay attention.\r\n\r\nImprovement: I can't think of anything that should be improved. I think the adjustments made for virtual learning in this class were very successful."
