Of course, this was up to us, but a little formal encouragement would help.",

The course pushes you to potentially try a new medium and do so in a supportive environment where you learn how to workshop your peers' work. The guest lecturers and professors are all incredibly inspiring and I left the semester with excitement to continue writing more.",
