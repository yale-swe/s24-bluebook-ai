                "In general, the concepts found within the course are very interesting. Many of the artists studied are not included on most syllabi, so you do get a deeper look into the world of art protest. Yale courses often stick to one manner of thinking, but the content found in AFAM 122 prompts new and difficult questions that you are forced to sit with and answer. These questions challenge your way of thinking and really force you to come to a conclusion. And I think that being in a space which actively challenges your thought process is really beneficial.\r\n\r\nHowever, the weaknesses in this class unfortunately outweigh the strengths. Perhaps the biggest problem was the lack of syllabus and structure. While there was a loosely defined syllabus, things generally varied day by day and there was no way to double check what readings were assigned. Even though the content was interesting, it felt impossible to keep up with given the lack of structure. On top of this, most readings were only available through course reserves, which made it highly inacessible. And these readings were generally really long. I usually wouldn't cite long readings as a weakness, but without a prior syllabus to indicate the workload, the situation was quite frustrating. Another weakness is that the concepts weren't entry level at all and success felt impossible without a lot of prior knowledge concerning art history. All of these things combined made it exceptionally difficult to see a through-line within the course, though I think the inclusion of a more concrete syllabus is a small action that could make big change to improve the course in the future.",
                "The material of this course was interesting, but all potential gains were negated by the complete lack of structure and clarity in expectations. The syllabus provided was not accurate, reading materials were difficult to access, and often assignments would not be clearly communicated. In fact, there was a distinct lack of communication between the instructor and the rest of the class. During discussions, Professor Campbell was especially defensive and slightly hostile. This resulted in very uncomfortable classes, and on multiple occasions, students would leave class frustrated and angry about what they just experienced. I never knew what to expect when I walked into that class, and frankly, the sight of Professor Campbell made me anxious. She made the habit of singling out students in discussion and grilling them. I understand that challenging our perspectives is a key part in learning and growing, but her idea of challenging us was incredibly aggressive. She entered each discussion as if it was a debate to be won.",
                "Definitely, a chill class, and the instructor is very approachable. However, we rarely touched on assigned reading topics or fully touched on the nuances of what was attempted to be discussed in class. It was very go-with-the-flow which is not bad in some cases."

                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student for two main reasons. 1. There is no syllabus or structure to the course. Things change on a whim and it is impossible to follow any direction. On top of this, the grading is slightly hard and feels very random and nit-picky. And 2. The environment of the class is very harsh. It's good to challenge your beliefs but often I felt that the professor talked down to people and interrupted unnecessarily. This ultimately generated a classroom setting where nobody wanted to talk because it felt futile. Until these two things change, this is a class to be avoided irrevocably.",
