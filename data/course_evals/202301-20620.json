On a higher level, this course taught me to think in terms of information, which can have a pretty profound impact on how you view other topics in statistics and machine learning.",
                "The main topics in this class are entropy, Markov Chains, encoding, and channel capacity. They are super interesting! The course is all about how much information things contain and the most efficient ways to communicate information.\r\nI also developed my proof skills, both on problem sets and by learning proofs in lecture. We did a lot of proofs with upper and lower bounds, convexity and concavity, and other cool things.",
                "I learned information theoretic tools that can be applied to: compression, coding, channel design, and large deviations. I built intuition on mutual information, divergences, and entropy as well as their applications in modern statistics.",

                "Andrew's teaching style is always very clear and enthusiastic. He explains concepts and definitions with hand-written formulas in a clear and concise manner. I really enjoy this teaching approach.",
                "Just decent overall, perhaps more practical assessments.",
                "It assumed some knowledge outside of STAT 241.",
                "I think overall the content was very strong. I think it was difficult to intuitively understand what a code book is, so some more concrete examples might help in understanding specific areas.",
                "touches many topics, could go deeper in some if time permits",
                "Strengths: Barron clearly loves the subject. Not only does this mean he is well-prepared to give thought out lectures, but his excitement really enhances the class. The homeworks and exams are very reasonable. If you make the effort, youll be A-ok!",
                "The strength is that the course has a lot to offer regardless of background. My background in statistics and probability was only S&DS238 (not the recommended prerequisite), but I still feel it had a very positive impact on my mathematical development and left me prepared to incorporate information theory in my research. Nonetheless, I do feel I would have gotten more out of the course with a stronger background in probability and statistics. I did well enough in the course grade-wise but often felt lost in the lectures due to lack of familiarity with some of the underlying concepts. The pace of lectures is very quick, so it's helpful to already be familiar with the types of proofs you'll see in probability theory so that you can focus on the higher-level concepts. My experience may have been different had I taken the recommended prerequisite, but I'd still encourage people to take this course further along in their S&DS curriculum.",
                "The strengths are the interesting material, challenging but manageable problem sets that improve your understanding of the course topics, and the calm nature of the class.\r\nThis class had several graduate students in it this semester, and sometimes at the end of lecture Professor Barron would talk more generally about the material at a level accessible to them but not to me as an undergraduate. He also would occasionally reference topics from math courses that I had not taken and that were not a prerequisite to this course. However, these topics did not tend to come up on problem sets. Also, the policy for getting extensions is unclear.",
                "The course pace sometimes felt too slow for a graduate student. The course content is phenomenal.",
                "I think the book we used was very readable and it high-lighted a lot of the motivation for why we are studying the topics in the course.",
                "I enjoyed the course's content, a lot of the theories, applications, and problems were very interesting. The homeworks were reasonable and so were the exams. When I took this course, there was a large graduate\/PhD student population. Professor Barron sometimes goes off on tangents during lecture that the grad students will understand and ask further questions about, but for many of the undergraduates who do not necessarily have the same mathematical\/statistical maturity, it would be difficult to follow along.",
                "Overall I thought it was a really good course! Lectures were interesting, homeworks felt like an appropriate level of challenge to help improve skills.\r\nExams were somewhat easy but felt like a good test of what was covered in the lectures\/homeworks.",
                "I think the speed and difficulty could be increased a little.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Barron is a very good teacher. Regular homeworks, easy to follow readings and textbook.\r\n\r\nWeakness:  Nothing in particular.",
                "Strength: Prof Barron is somewhat of a superstar in the field, and has so much knowledge about information theory and its applications. He can explain topics at both high and low levels with ease, and is also very receptive to student corrections and questions. The class also closely follows the textbook, which is pretty easy to understand! Also, the professor would give some interesting historical tidbits about the field which were always fun to learn.\r\n\r\nCon: The course is definitely grad-student heavy. This isn't a bad thing on its own, but sometimes, as an undergrad, I would get lost on the more complex questions asked in class. There were also a fair amount of lengthy proofs, which I was not able to follow easily."

                "Yes!! Information theory is an extremely interesting (and cool) subject, and Barron teaches it as well as youd hope",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. It was interesting and fun. Notably, this is more of a probability course than a statistics course. What I mean by this is that we are not learning directly applicable methods, nor are we learning the theory behind those methods. Rather, we are learning more about the nature of probability distributions and other topics. This is cool and probably primes your brain to think better in statistical theory courses. One exception to this is for data compression and encoding, where we do learn applied methods.",
                "Yes. Information Theory is an incredible tool.",

                "Definitely.\r\n\r\nThis course not only helps you think about the relevant statistics, but also alternate approaches to proofs. Dr. Baron is a great teacher.",
                "Yes! I'm not someone who will likely pursue a research career in math or statistics, but I still really enjoyed this course. There's something about learning mathematical and statistical theory which I find really interesting, especially from such an esteemed professor in the field. I was happy I had the opportunity to take the course, even though I found some of the topics challenging. Overall, I greatly appreciate the work that people are doing in the field, and how its applications have helped build the digital world around us. If you're looking for a course that you can breeze through in terms of learning and coursework though, you should look elsewhere.",
