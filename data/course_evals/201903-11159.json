    "The course is great as it is.",
    "Simona is a fantastic instructor and I really appreciated the layout (though sometimes, it felt a bit fast paced).",
    "My teacher was awesome. It would be nice to be able to ask questions in English especially in the early stages of the course",
    "This course did a good job of giving an introduction to Italian without doing too much and overwhelming us. There were a lot of in-class exams, so we were taking exams practically every other week, which was a little fast, but the exams were not too bad and actually reflected the things we practiced in class.",
    "I think its strengths lie in the immersive culture of speaking in class. One thing that can be improved is practicing examples with each new topic on worksheets in preparation for the exams earlier.",
    "It is a very fast-paced course, although I learned a ton throughout the semester. I am looking forward to taking many more Italian classes!",
    "Strengths: high collaboration with other students, exposure to Italian media\r\nWeaknesses: very textbook-centered"

    "Yes Italian is a fun language with not a ton of work compared to other languages here.",
    "Absolutely, thorough yet manageable introduction to Italian.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! If you want to learn Italian, this class is a great way to begin to develop an understanding of the language. Simona was great at explaining the concepts and I definitely feel prepared to take more Italian classes next semester. Overall, it was not too difficult while still being extremely interesting!",
    "Certainly, regardless of interest in becoming advanced in Italian, this course is a must take for anyone interested in getting the basics.",
    "Yes I would, the department is awesome and I learned alot",
    "Yes, Italian is a great language at Yale. You learn a lot in a short amount of time, which can be overwhelming, but the daily and weekly assignments help reinforce it and keep you from falling behind.",
    "Yes! I think this was one of my favorite classes of my semester! Italian is not too difficult to learn (in my opinion), but the challenging parts are made fun its almost like cracking a code. Getting the chance to practice speaking while also learning about the culture of Italy makes for an interesting course.",
    "Yes! Great instructor, and interesting material!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone just starting out with Italian since it provides a good foundational understanding of basic culture and grammar."
