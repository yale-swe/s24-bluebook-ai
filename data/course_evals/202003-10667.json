We've learned all six cases and even colloquial expressions. It's actually kind of amazing how much Russian we've acquired into our brains in such a little amount of time. I've learned how to read Cyrillic, and I can hold a short conversation, albeit incredibly basic. We started with the alphabet, and while it was super rushed, after the alphabet, we started learning basic expressions. Then we dove into the concept of perfective\/imperfective aspect, which is arguably one of the most difficult aspects (ha! see what I did there!) of the Russian language. We learned dative, impersonal constructions to sound more idiomatic, and we also got a little bit about culture, too."

                "The class was very engaging--I found myself somewhat unfocused due to the Zoom format in all of my classes except this one. Every student participated in every class. The teachers and professors were also highly involved in our learning process, and they were very open to taking questions and meeting with students. I was impressed by how much Russian I was able to learn in this relatively short period of time. I though the class was bit disorganized, although this certainly improved as term went on. I didn't always get feedback on the assignments I turned in, and I felt that could have improved my skills a bit.",
                "The strengths of the courses were definitely the amount of material we were able to cover in such a short amount of time. The only weakness I can think of would be that the course sometimes felt a bit chaotic in terms of the schedule and the modules tab on Canvas.",
                "The strength of this course is the intensity and timeliness in which content is presented. The instructors are very thorough and each have a different style of teaching. I felt that the level of engagement and the personal attention given to each student by the instructors created a safe environment to speak freely (especially if mistakes were made) in order to correct them quickly and efficiently. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I believe it would be best to require students to compile a \"master document\" for the cases in order to memorize and distinguish each more efficiently.",
                "Strengths: Professor Muravnik and Ilia! Both of them were very good at explaining difficult concepts and were always willing to give extra help. I think they did a really good job of helping us build a foundation in Russian that we can later build on, rather than just having us memorize vocabulary and conjugations. Weaknesses: It wasn't always clear what material would be on our quizzes.",
                "This class has a ton of strengths. For starters, Constantine is an absolute gem of a professor. He epitomizes what any language professor should be: his knowledge is vast and far-reaching, and he really, really enjoys teaching. He also wants to get to know his students, and while it was certainly difficult to do that especially in an online format, he tried his best, and I really appreciated that. He made himself available and was very responsive to our feedback. I say all this to preface the fact that this is perhaps one of the most important parts of a language learning environment: comradery, but also overall cohesiveness among the class, something at which this course excels. The way the course is designed forces you to get to know the students with whom you are taking it, especially through conversation and speaking exercises in class. Outside of simply the class environment, the speed is perfect for learning. Sure, there were bumps along the way where it felt like we jumped from topic to topic, but I don't think I'd have had it any other way. It's truly a privilege to be able to take an intensive language course, especially with a language like Russian, and you are getting top-notch instruction from one of the best professors at this university. The grammar is hard, but Constantine knows how to teach it. \r\nHowever, that is not to say that there aren't any weaknesses, and I wish previous students had written more about their experience in the class. Perhaps it was different due to the class being on Zoom, but I think this class works better with a smaller class size. There was what seemed like a record number of students interested in taking this class, and so it was split into two sections; mine, with Constantine, had anywhere from 10-12 students. Minjin's section has 4-5. Because of that, it was difficult to receive the type of individualized attention you need from a language class, already made harder by the Zoom format. Also, the textbook is good in some respects, but really, it's absolute garbage. The videos are incredibly outdated and frankly irrelevant to classroom learning. Constantine and Ilia had us implement them into class in the second half, but they served no purpose. The textbook's method of teaching vocabulary is absolute trash, too. The vocab lists at the end of the units are way too long, and the method of teaching them without any clear progression makes it impossible for any student to acquire the skills necessary to not only memorize the words, but also use them correctly. There was no implementation of learning the vocabulary actively in class, and the textbook homework and examples didn't do a great job of reinforcing the new words, so at the time of this writing, I've certainly lost many of the words I had already known and learned. Speaking is also a problem; the final exam was switched to an oral exam, which is perhaps the weakest skill we had worked on throughout the semester, so that made it a pretty daunting task. Another of the biggest issues we encountered was typing and learning the Russian keyboard; one cannot simply learn the Russian alphabet and then be expected to type flawlessly in a matter of weeks. And this compounded my final weakness of this course, the online exams. Language learning thrives on tactile experience; we're already at a disadvantage because we are on Zoom and everything is digitized. There was an attempt to switch homework to an online format too, which was the worst idea broached throughout the entire semester. We're tired of technology, and having to do homework on Canvas would've made it worse than it already was. There needs to be more handwritten tasks incorporated, regardless of whether it's on Zoom or in a classroom. And the exams: they did not match the material in class. That's a huge issue in a language learning class. You can't quiz us on something we literally don't know. That's not fair to us, and means you forgot to teach us something important."

The professors were receptive to comments about technological difficulties (for instance when it was difficult to finish online tests due to unfamiliarity with the Russian keyboard, more time was added). I found the virtual homework issue to be a bit tedious, as we either had to scan assignments every night and send them or type out long assignments. However, I'm not sure how that issue could be alleviated. My only real complaint is that it was sometimes confusing to speak in class, especially when we encouraged to speak as a group. Mics were often delayed so it was hard to hear what exactly was going on.",

                "I really liked the frequent use of breakout rooms because it helped the students in the class get to know each other and create a good class dynamic. I also liked using the zoom whiteboard, jamboards, and shared google docs that we could all follow along on an exercise.",
                "Ilia, our TA, the Fulbright Scholar from St. Petersburg, did an absolutely brilliant job translating this course to a digitized format. From sharing presentations through the Zoom chat feature, to watching short video clips, using relevant images and documents pertinent to the subject material (while simultaneously introducing us to Russian culture in a more modern setting), to even his masterfully composed presentations, and then using breakout rooms and coming in and out to help us out, this was the best it could have been. Ilia excelled in every avenue and with every challenge that was presented to him, and it translated very well for me. Constantine, on the other hand, used far fewer digital materials; he made use of Miro layouts to show us images and go through grammar activities, and PDF versions of the textbook and an exercise book allowed us to complete exercises and look at examples together. He also used the Zoom whiteboard feature, which was a very effective way of showing us not only written Russian, but also replicating the classroom experience.\r\nFor what could be improved, the constant breakout room speaking exercises didn't feel very effective. We're thrown into the void of Zoom expected to complete speaking exercises, that for many of the prompts, we were inadequately prepared. I've said it already, but I'll say it again: online assessments and online homework are horrible for language learning. Language learning requires repetition and tactile experience, especially for me. When I use a pencil or pen and write Russian script, I am 100% more likely to remember what I'm learning. The assessments and their auto-grading do not allow for experimentation or risk-taking with the language, for fear of making a mistake and getting automatically docked a point or several. Homework is done in the book with a pen and paper, but making it online just adds more to the already ridiculous amount of time we're spending in front of a screen. So please, for the love of god, can we make some things pencil and paper? We can scan things (we already do it for homework) so there's got to be a way we can do some of the assessments on paper. Or at least have that option. \r\nI think because we were on Zoom, it was also difficult to make sure we were spending our time in equal amounts on each topic. We'd spend too much time on one thing, only to not cover another, and have to do a zoom speed-run of the topics we hadn't covered on Friday, only to take a test on it all over the weekend. Communication between professor and TA needed to be more open, too, as we'd repeat things or reinforce the exact same things twice or even thrice, for it appeared that there wasn't an open channel between the two."

                "Yes! If you are into languages, you should definitely take this course. But if you are only taking it for a language credit, I would recommend intro to Russian since this course is fast-paced and requires a lot of work.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, with the following: you need to understand that this course has two, not one instructor. And that can make or break the experience for you. Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, you have a TA. My section has Ilia, a brilliant Fulbright scholar who was supposed to teach at Yale. On Wednesday and Friday, for the two hour section of the course, we had Constantine. I did not realize this was the case walking into the class; while initially I was disappointed that I wouldn't be getting Constantine the whole week, it turned out alright for the most part, as Ilia was equally as effective an instructor. But you're really getting two entirely different classes in one, as they both teach in their own particular ways, and if you don't vibe with one, you're stuck with it, as you get both every week. The class is also very cyclical; you do basically the exact same thing every single week. It follows the same pattern, and there is absolutely no variety. You take a test every week, and you always have at least one quiz. Grade cutoffs are also exceptionally high, so study your butt off. But you should already be doing that, this is an intensive class, and if you're not prepared for that, you have no business taking this class. You need to be engaged and ready to be engaged each and every morning in one of the most difficult but beautiful languages in the world, and if that doesn't sound like something you can do, steer clear of this class. If you aren't ready to put the effort into the class and be present (especially in the COVID era, being mindful of your Zoom webcam and microphone, muting when appropriate so we don't hear you making your morning smoothie or your toilet flushing, but also just being ready to answer questions and just generally being attentive during the class period) then choose something different. You're about to spend upwards of 7 hours a week for 13+ weeks learning a language the works completely different from the one you probably speak natively, and if you can't do that, drop the class; it's not for you. However, if you are ready for the challenge, and want to learn from the best instructors Yale has to offer, at an upbeat pace with people who love language learning as much as you, then this is the place for you. Just, please, know what you're getting yourself into in advance. Because if you don't you're in for a rude awakening after week one."
