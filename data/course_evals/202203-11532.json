This course taught me to be able to articulate my thoughts and my reasoning about topics which I previously didnt really have the tools to write about effectively. It was also very effective for me learning how to write on a time schedule and put that into practice."

My favorite reading was Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience.",
