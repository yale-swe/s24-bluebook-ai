            "comments": [
                "Strengths - Really really interesting and engaging to learn how to produce and code music. Professor Peterson is super friendly and funny and just a great person to take a class from.\r\nWeaknesses - I feel like I was never really taught how to produce music or code. In particular, we were never taught how to really produce or really where to start when deciding to create a piece.",
                "The class gives you an intro to a lot of topics, however you aren't really given enough time to absorb a lot of it. Super collider can also be rough to people that have never coded before and complex topics are gone over very fast.",
                "The strengths are the hands on application and truly diving into the projects. I think you work really hard and if you put in the effort and go to OH, you truly do get the rewards and its very satisfying. I probably have learned the most in the shortest amount of time and across the widest breadth in this class. For weaknesses, at times the lectures can be a little droning and convoluted because details of sound synthesis are so precise but sometimes I wish it went a little slower to understand them a little better.",
                "The course covers a lot of material but also moves very quickly, especially through the programming section. Great survey of computer music, but only take this class if you are interested in all of the material, not just if youre vaguely into the idea of music production.",
                "Strengths: content is really interesting, specially if youre interested in music production or CS/music. Got a good overview of the DAW and SuperCollider (programming language for audio).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wish we had more time to go in depth into some of the topics. I felt we just skimmed some really interesting things and didnt get a good feel of it",
                "Interesting topics, lectures could be more engaging",
                "I think there needs to be a prerequisite of having known a bit of code. There was an expectation to know coding when a lot of us had never coded before.",
                "Strengths are how interesting sting the material is and how enthusiastic the professor is about it. Weaknesses are that there weren't as many hands-on activities but I think that was covid's fault.",
                "This class has a great foundation of information, but it's difficult for people with no programming or coding experience. I think its biggest downfall was that it was advertised as something that would be doable for people with no experience, but I would say it was pretty challenging and I often felt like I was falling behind.",
                "Overall, the course had a lot of breadth but less depth. The class might benefit from a smaller scope.\r\n\r\nI would have liked to spend more time on composition with electronic music. What I mean is that we learned how to make sound X, but I would have also liked to learn what is the effect of sound X on the piece, as someone who does not listen to much electronic music. We did spend some time listening to music and discussing it at the start of class, which was great, and I would have liked to go more in depth with that aspect of the class.\r\n\r\nI also would have liked to spend less time on composition in SuperCollider and more time on sound synthesis. Composition in SC just seemed a little redundant after we learned it on WaveForm, a much better tool for that purpose. On the other hand, the day we spent on making video game FX in SC seemed like a more useful application of the software. I wish at least one of the SC Psets had been in sound synthesis rather than composition.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would have been nice to have more written explanation of the SC examples. The lectures in SC were often hard to keep up with as someone without much coding experience. The documentation provided in the SC software is not very helpful because it does not appear to be designed with beginners in mind, and as a result the examples are often unnecessarily complex and involve other SC tools that we didn't learn in class. It would have been incredibly helpful to have SC examples that were as simple as possible.",
                "Dr. Scott taught us a lot in a short period of time about music production. He also embraced creativity in projects quite a lot, which was much appreciated and expanded our understanding of the process of creating music.\r\nI do think that he is amazingly knowledgable on the subject but that some of this course was far too advanced for people without pre-existing knowledge in Computer Science. Often, a lot of the class felt pretty stressful because the range of information was so large. Perhaps, adding a CS pre-requisite for the course would improve the course quite a lot and let students know what they are going to be undertaking.",
                "The strengths of the course are its content and its application. Learning about music production and sound design is a very cool class topic and Prof. Petersen mostly did a good job connecting it to real world applications. The biggest weakness of the course were the long, very boring readings, that were very much required to understand what was going on in the SuperCollider portion of the course. I was unwilling to do these readings and so were many of my classmates. Maybe more time spent teaching what's in the readings would help but then that requires a bit more restructuring of the course."

                "I would recommend if looking for an intro and outlook to the CS music classes at Yale. Most people will only be interested in DAWs which is only half of the class and the rest is coding. You'll spend a chunk of time outside of class figuring out what to do as well.",
                "Just make sure you know exactly what the course entails! It's half music production, and half coding in supercollider (and a brief overview of those topics). If you're only (and seriously) into music production, then this isn't for you. Keep producing music for hours every day, watch tutorials on mixing and mastering on YouTube if necessary, and hone your skills. That's how you'll get better.",
                "Yes, I would but truly only if your are deeply interested in computer music or the intersection of music and tech or if you have a natural ear for music and want to apply it to tech/production. Because if not, its a ton of work and a lot of nitty gritty and if you arent deeply interested, the work is going to be too daunting and you will struggle. The only reason I got through the projects is because I connected them to my personal goals and was super excited about the end of each piece I was working towards. You learn so much though but at times the material can be a little daunting or go over your head. Prepare to be thrown into the deep end, it was intimidating and scary, but it truly was the best way to learn.",
                "If youre interested in both music and CS, have a little bit of background in them and are fine with doing some independent learning, then definitely.",
                "Its very interesting so yes",
                "If you love electronic music and music analysis I would definitely take this course.",
                "I would recommend this to a student with an interest in BOTH computers and music. If you are a student who really only leans to one side, it's better to take a class that's more specific to your interests.",
                "This is a good class if you like electronic music AND computers. If you just like one of those two, maybe. The more time you spend on it, the more you will get out of it, so I don't recommend it if your other classes have a lot of work.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student if they have a background in CS. Although learning music production felt accessible for everyone regardless of experience, the coding portion of the class felt stressful without pre-existent knowledge. Dr. Scott provided many resources and that was much appreciated; however, in order to use them, you had to devote long amounts of time to unpacking them. Even within the resources, when CS topics were mentioned, they did not always make sense without an existing understanding of the language. SuperCollider (coding sound) is honestly a very cool concept and I am glad I learned it, I just wish I had known that prior knowledge would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThe only pre-requisite was an ability to read musicwe didn't really read any music or use that pre-requisite. Rather, I think that was intended to ensure that we had an understanding of music quality and scales, which was useful.\r\n\r\nIn honesty as well: I would also say that the course is facilitated well for student learning in terms of organization, but did feel stressful to attend class some days when Dr. Scott would appear frustrated with our understanding of the material. I think the course is very well-organized, but sometimes difficult on a mental level. I did want to drop out at one point because I felt so behind, but I am glad that I stuck with it.\r\n\r\nIn summary: if you have a CS background, yes! If not, no. (Or understand that you're going to be putting in a lot of work to try and stay on par).",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to some students and not to others. Students with a background in coding and an interest in the arts should totally be recommended this course but those without coding experience should be cautioned. One can still have a great time in the course without coding experience but expectations should be different."
