                "The breadth of literature used in this course is phenomenal. Our studies went from Senegal to Algeria to the Caribbean to Indochina to wartime France, and our knowledge of the language was enough such that we could truly have discussions and debates regarding all of the content we learned. There's a reason that my FREN 130 professor, current French professor, and students alike agree that FREN 140 is the best course in the French department's L1-L5 track.",
                "strengths: quick grading, small class size meant we all got time to talk\r\nweaknesses: it was sometimes difficult for Madame Burton to understand what we were trying to convey",
                "A course that has been taught many times, great materials. Requires a high level of engagement all semester long, which can be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on the student.",
                "Some of the strengths of this course were the many opportunities that we had to practice our oral expression and to talk about different topics of interest to us (actualits, expos...). The only suggestion I would have for an improvement would be a very minor one - I think it would be helpful to have weighted grades to the assignments on Canvas so that we could have a better idea of what grade we would probably get as the term progressed.",
                "This class is was definitely what is was advertised as: an advanced and intensive French class. While that was effective in some respects, it was also overwhelming at times. For a lot of the class I kind of felt like I was almost teaching myself. You haver to learn the grammar through the course packet and it isn't always clearly elaborated upon in class. I did appreciate the wide range of materials we were exposed to and felt that I came away with a strong understanding of francophone culture globally, not just in France itself.",
                "There is a lot of busy work for this course that does not increase knowledge or understanding, but the makes the course on the whole much less engaging.",
                "Strengths: Professor Burton was phenomenal. She created a great classroom environment in which students felt completely comfortable to work on their oral proficiency. The breakout rooms were great because they fostered a familiarity with classmates. There was ample opportunity to improve speaking-wise. Weaknesses: there were no significant weaknesses, although sometimes the reading homework could be a bit too much for one night.",
                "Strengths: done well over zoom given necessity of speech and writing during course, lots of opportunities to engage both voluntarily and on command, good balance of reading/writing/speaking practice; Weaknesses: grammar book required for course did not receive hardly any class-time attention despite its high cost so I would recommend making this book optional or incorporating its exercises into the curriculum more, relative pronouns were required during some parts of the course but not others making exams confusing for when they were/weren't needed",
                "Strengths were the focus on grammar and speaking but I wish there could have been more low pressure writing assignments other than the major writing assignments which were worth a sizable amount of the grade for the class."

I've taken French classes for more than 7 years, and this is the first course where I actually started to think in French and process the language in real time. I truly wasn't sure if I would ever become fluent before now, but this class really made me believe that fluency is an achievable goal.",
