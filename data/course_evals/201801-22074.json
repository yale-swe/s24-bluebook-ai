    "Prof Brick has been really encouraging and dedicated in taking us through the course through engaging class discussions. He has also gone beyond the boundaries of the syllabus to even give additional.information about Sanskrit as a language and interesting details about it which made the lesson far more enlightening. Perhaps slides can be shown to add more visual flavour to the class discussions.",
    "This was an awesome class. Had a great time taking this class and learned a lot about Sanskrit literature.",
    "Professor Brick is an incredible professor. His genuine love of and mastery over Sanskrit literature and ancient Indian history came out every class. He is wonderful professor, and it's a shame that Yale is losing him."

    "Professor Brick is one the best professor I have had here at Yale and this class is a gem. It is really a shame that he is leaving Yale next year because if he were staying I would definitely recommend this course to everyone interested even slightly.",
    "I will certainly recommend this course as this is a world of several tenets where we learn about history mythology, literature and even the politics of the different regions at different points of time. It enables us to share our perspectives which further broadens our understanding of these texts which enrich our minds through a variety of genres.",
    "I totally recommend this course to any other students. Sadly, professor Brick is leaving next semester.",
    "Absolutely would recommend, but I know Professor Brick is leaving."
