The subjects taught in class are rushed through, and ultimately require you to go to office hours to get taught by a ULA. The biggest strength comes from the fact that the ULA's are extremely kind, helpful and push you to actually master each concept taught.",

The problem that I had was that the quizzes were clearly much more difficult than anything else we did in class.
