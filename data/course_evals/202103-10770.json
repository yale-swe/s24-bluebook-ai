The readings helped give me a history of black religions in the United States and how this religious history intersected and interacted with the political history of black Americans. I also learned how to do critical historical analysis. I think an insight I gained is that religion and politics can often be an blurry distinction."

                "The course was good at facilitating discussion involving our personal experiences while simultaneously engaging us with historical aspects of the course.",
                "strengths:\r\neveryone was coming from such a different place religiously and in terms of religious history, which made for a really fascinating weekly discussion on whatever we were reading. Turner is a thoughtful and deeply intelligent professor, but she really lets us drive conversation, which I appreciated. The slideshows were interesting, and the class is set up such that everyone presents twice on two very different topics (one is of your choosing) -- I thought this kept class interesting, because even if the reading for that week was boring, students would make up for it with cool presentations.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\nI think we covered a wide breadth of information, but I don't feel like we got much depth. For instance: we talk a ton about Islam as a particularly useful form of resistance during the Transatlantic trade and chattel slavery, but the sentence for WHY that is doesn't get super deep. To be fair, maybe the answer for why that is lies in the substance of the Quran itself, and we didn't read it. But maybe that means having us read little (little!) excerpts of bible/quran could be helpful in engaging with what exactly attracted blacks to these texts and belief systems. Also: we didn't learn about black jews ):",
                "The teaching was very responsive and Professor Turner always gave us extensive feedback on our work. The course was also changed to improve the class and make it easier to learn the material. I would say that the discussions were also very strong. I don't think there were really any weaknesses..",
                "I really appreciated the depth of this course and the variety of modes of instruction during every seminar. In future iterations, I think the course could take on a broader scope maybe focusing on a wider variety of religions, or religious experiences outside of institutional settings."

                "I would, if you're interested in history and feel unprepared in the realm of religion. It's like 150 pages of reading a week (skimming mostly) and a long discussion where you have to really be in it. If you're not up for it, don't take the class. But I feel like I gained a lot of insight into (mostly) christianity and its meanings, as well as how religion intersects with politics beyond the simple church/state debate.",
