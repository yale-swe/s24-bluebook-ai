The class focused on works in translation and the idea of translation as a whole. We also learned a lot about literary theory and how the texts relate to the theorists.",
                "This course taught me about a literary framework, World Literature, which I had never heard of before. Reading about post-colonial French language literature through this framework and learning about different literary theories was an intellectually fulfilling and fascinating experience. I learned to read literary theory, write critically, analyze works through different literary lenses, and apply theoretical concepts to the courses' works.",

                "Strengths:\r\nThis class was intellectually stimulating. The weekly responses challenged me to grapple with the works and think about them critically. The two essays also helped me solidify my ability to apply theory to real texts, and the final essay challenged me to combine everything I learned through a creative medium. I also liked the diversity of the texts and the class discussions which were supplemented by brief lectures helping to put the stories in context.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone",
                "The texts were all very unique and interesting to discuss. The weekly writing assignments also helped me gather my ideas and allowed for me to receive weekly feedback from the professor. The pace was a little fast so we couldn't go as deep into the texts as I would have liked. This could be solved by removing one or two texts to slow the pace down."

                "Absolutely. This class was not only interesting but it was engaging, and I often found myself looking forward to discussing in class ideas that came into my mind while reading. The topic is also very interesting, encompassing many applicable, relevant topics that shape not only the world of literature but also the \"real world\" more generally. The course is also an excellent opportunity to explore a genre of literature which is not often taught.",
                "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone regardless of major if they like to read and think about the implications of colonialism."
