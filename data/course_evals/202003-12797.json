                "This course taught me how I can familiarize with topics\/issues that I do not have much background on within a very short amount of time.  Not only that, but it also opened my eyes to biases and other forms of inaccurate reporting that exist within the media. In addition, the fact that the course allowed students to pick and follow a particular beat of their interest for the semester helped me learn more about a topic that I am interested in. With the journalistic and analysis skills I was able to take away from this course, I was able to delve into this interest of mine in regards to how it is covered by the media. This course was also useful in following contemporary issues on the news (particularly the 2020 election), getting different insights on them and analyzing what they actually mean and imply.",

I learned a lot about the history of the conspiracy theories that dominate our national news. Beyond actual content, this course really improved my ability to participate in a seminar.",
                "I learned ways to evaluate and make my own judgement of the media's coverage (mostly print: NYT, WaPo, Fox....) of specific topics\/beats ( eg. the Middle East) and how these flaws in media coverage (such as false equivalency) affect the public's perception of these topics. I also learned a bit about how the media has contributed to some of the most pressing issues facing this country today (disinformation and the growing insanity of the right) and what it can do to act against these trends."

                "I think the assigned readings\/listenings were very interesting. Sometimes I felt like the students didn't get to lead the discussion as much as I would have liked.",
                "Strengths: There was always a respectful and intellectual class environment during the discussion seminars that encouraged participation and involvement. It was always easy to contribute to discussions and express our viewpoints to one another. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been better if the course had a bit of rigid structure from the start. We usually deviated from the syllabus that was initially distributed, and that usually left everyone with a sense of uncertainty.",
                "Could be less repetitive",
                "Strengths: very interesting content and very applicable to current events, must be especially fun to talk about it in-person, Professor Butters is very understanding and willing to grant extensions, available to work with you outside of class, and always ready to give you another try. \r\nWeaknesses: The class is very confusing. Professor Butters had to repeat how to do each assignment over and over, and I still did not exactly understand what to do. It was very common for students to ask Professor Butters to re-ask a discussion question. Another weakness of this class is the fact that each student concentrates on a different topic. While it was interesting to learn a little bit about a lot of different things through my classmates, I felt that this separated us since we were all working on different things.",
                "Some of the material that we learned in the class was pretty interesting, such as the pitfalls of resistance journalism and ways to cover Trump (and by extension, the right). However, I felt like it was overshadowed by the low level of engagement in the class. Very few people talked in class discussions, which ended up with the professor talking for a large portion of the class. The readings are interesting, but they are sometimes a bit too resistance-journalism, and focused a bit too much on Trump and not on other topics. The syllabus wasn't followed very closely and some of the interesting material wasn't touched on much (eg. climate change)"

                "Success: The discussion sessions we had were successful in the sense that we were able to do most of what we would do had we been doing the class in-person. We were able to have conversations and listen to one another, the same way it would have taken place had it not been virtual. Besides, the professors decision half-way through the course to turn all microphones on during discussions was very useful in encouraging participation and in making our virtual seminars more realistic. In addition, the one-on-one meetings the professor organized with each person throughout the semester were very helpful identifying what should be improved and what could be done differently. These meetings were also good checkpoints to get to know the professor, to determine where one the courses timeline we are and to identify the expectations for upcoming assessments.\r\n\r\nTo be improved: Setting up submission portals about a day before the submission deadlines would be very helpful.",

I think that breakout rooms could be used more, maybe more assignments that required collaboration between students. It is a large class to form connections over zoom, or even to stay engaged with each lecture."

Some of this might not be inherent to the class because of COVID and Trump, but at the same time, I feel like we barely covered much new material after the first half of the class."
