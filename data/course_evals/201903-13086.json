   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I gained a vocabulary to discuss current events in french; french social structure; and the elements that figure into daily french life: education, work, sense of history, family,etc, in a very advanced manner. I also developed greater speaking facility.",
    "Improved proficiency in French, especially spoken, and broader knowledge of some specifics of French culture (esp. policy-oriented, meaning recent\/relevant debates) that would be very helpful in inserting oneself into French society",
    "This class is a perfect way to improve and refine your French speaking skills. I have taken upper-level French courses which omit vocabulary lists, which I missed, because I had really wanted to improve my vocabulary. I found myself unable to say things, even some of the most simplistic things. This class is divided into units, each of which contains an extensive list of associated vocabulary to not only help you discuss topics pertinent to the unit, but everything else. I also learned a great deal about French culture and how the political, social, and economic systems of France function. I can now enter a conversation in French with much greater ease. I don't need to rehearse in my head as much, and I can give a presentation with little difficulty. You might feel like a 20-minute and 40-minute oral exam are daunting feats of speaking, especially in a foreign language--but as you go through this class, you'll realize that you can actually do it. And it's really not that hard after all. You just can't be scared to speak up and make mistakes. Which I was at first. But not anymore.",
    "I greatly improved my French speaking ability! I improved my understanding of French culture and current events, and had the vocabulary to express my opinions and construct arguments about these current events.",
    "French language skills, especially vocabulary and speaking, and cultural nuances"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength of the course was its broad scope and also the primary sources and articles we read, which allowed for both big picture knowledge and zooming in. A weakness was that some of the material felt tangential.",
    "Goes into many different topics and tries to be exhaustive as possible in limited time-period; perhaps too much focus on specifics over mentality (though to be fair, it's the type of knowledge that French people would probably have implicitly, like most Americans' knowledge of their own history). Debates can be too topical\/summary-oriented, though this is a necessary consequence of language learning. Might be a good idea to pick a few topics for more depth\/original thoughts, but I understand exactly why we didn't. Schneider is a fantastic teacher and is fantastically approachable\/tolerant\/kind\/very French!",
    "Strengths: improve your vocabulary. Learn fun expressions like \"de fil en aguille,\" which means \"one thing leading to another.\" A lot of my past French vocabulary was in a more formal register, but you'll pick up a few colloquial expressions, too. The units are very interesting, and we didn't spend too much time on the textbook either. You watch four movies and some other video clips throughout the semester, and they're very fascinating--especially Normandie nue :) the professors are there to help you. I needed extra practice speaking, and Mme. Schneider was more than happy to help. When you make a mistake when you're speaking, Mme. Schneider writes the correct word\/phrase on the board so that you can correct yourself without interrupting the flow of your thought. And everyone gets equal opportunity to speak, because you'll get cold called. But it's not scary!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you are not as strong as some of your other classmates, you might feel a little behind, in that you're not as confident speaking or contributing to the discussion--which is the main goal of the class. At times, it can feel like preference is given to stronger speakers in the class, which definitely hindered my learning. The written quizzes can feel a little tiresome, burdensome even because you've already proven your ability to use the vocabulary in class. But it's also a nice way to prove your mastery of the vocabulary in context.",
    "Need to engage in more debate and create more debates between students instead of each talking directly to the professor",
    "The course requires high level of engagement but is also fun because of that. It's a small class and Madame Schneider makes sure everyone is engaged in the materials. Over the course we touched upon different subjects and some might be interesting as others might be boring. Good thing is we change the topic every other week."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for higher level french students. The course also accommodates different abilities within L5 quite well.",
    "Absolutely - less rigidly academic context than the grammar courses and much more practical knowledge gained in an intensive setting. Best to take in smallest class size possible. Best language-learning class by far!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student--but only if you're willing to practice using the new vocabulary, and put in the time to do the readings. Except you won't need a whole lot of time to complete the readings, because they're never very long. You do need to have a good background in French to understand and contribute to class discussion, but as you go through the course, you'll begin to feel much more comfortable speaking on an impromptu basis. If you're not ready to dive into the literary world of France, and you want a class that will help you actually participate in literature-focused discussions, take this class. If you want to learn a little more about French culture, especially as it relates to recent times, take this class. If you want to speak French, take this class. If you want a very kind, knowledgeable professor, take this class. My professor was Schneider, but Pinzka is equally as good. So take this class! It's not too stressful, either.",
    "If you want to improve speaking French, yes! Be prepared that Mme Schneider has high expectations not only for speaking but for argument construction in the oral exams as well. She wants to make sure that you're not just using the language but that you're actually saying something. At times, it felt like encouraging class debate and disagreement allowed some students to use that as an opportunity to make inflammatory statements, but this can happen in any Yale course. I definitely learned a lot!",
    "Yes if you genuinely want to learn French and have some time to spare"
