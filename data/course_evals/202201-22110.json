This course teaches you how spatial dynamics exemplify these structures through specific examples of destruction, the built environment from airports to golf courses, and the manners in which globalization is spatialized through areas of different sovereignties, nation states, and the built landscape. Really imaginative / abstracted networks and visualizations of the flows of infrastructure and how this contributes to capitalizing and globalizing.",

However, there were other weeks when the readings and lectures were very insightful.\r\nThe choice of a topic and group for the final project can make the class very interesting and rewarding if you chose well, so it is important to self motivate.",
                "strengths: the class provided some really interesting insight and information about globalization. I LOVED how prof. easterling would spend the last 15 minutes of lecture soliciting questions. I was always excited to come to class and learn something new from such a a great professor. \r\nweaknesses: structure of the assignments. My group had some group members who weren't pulling their weight and that detracted from the experience. I would have preferred doing it individually, or with one partner. Also, if the group structure stayed, I would have preferred to have a rough draft due about two weeks before the final, with a meeting with the TA to follow, to make sure that the group was on track.",

The lecture style was not super engaging but the readings were really helpful with elaborating on some of the course themes where it was a little difficult to ascertain them from the lectures. The group project was definitely the best part and the main strength of the course in that it allows people to gear their learning in the course toward something they're really interested in. The course could really be improved by having each student only present for 1 section meeting, and having the other ones be more organized by the teaching fellow so they are a little more productive or engaging.",

However, the discussions during section are quite interesting and we got to talk about some applications of the concepts we learned about in class.",
                "Lectures are really interesting and enjoyable, but I found the course not be very organized. I also think that putting so much weight on a group project is quite challenging in a college context, especially because we had to pick our groups from sections. Everyone works differently and has different expectations for their work, and it inevitably led to really unequal work dynamics within groups.",

It would not be my first choice to do again, and only take this course if you like group projects since the last two thirds of the course are geared around one group project. You can definitely learn a lot from the readings if you engage with them but oftentimes there were too many to get through in a given week for it to be manageable as a fifth class.",
