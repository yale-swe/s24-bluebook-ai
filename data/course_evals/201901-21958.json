   "comments": [
    "Very strong - passionate teachers",
    "The course covers a lot of essential grammar structures and vocabulary, but I don't think it emphasizes everyday conversation topics enough. The course seemed to be more focused on how to survive if you were dropped into a Japanese business seminar than actually making Japanese relationships. \r\nThe design of the course makes it very difficult to master course material before class sessions and examinations.",
    "The work felt very repetitive after a while, and it would have been nice for the assignments to not always be utilization and Quia (more media assignments!)",
    "At times there was a lot of work to do that didn't help as much in the end with my learning Japanese.\r\nHowever, class was run in a way that really helped with speaking and listening abilities.",
    "Strength: creative and challenging teachings, and multiple ways to use new grammars in new circumstances, skit and clinic are helpful.\r\nweakness: I would like to learn how to practice what we learned in class after class.",
    "The class is very well taught, but sometimes the pacing feels erratic...sometimes it feels like there is a lot of ground to cover in a short time, and other times we seem to have lots of extra time."

    "Yes - very well organized curriculum",
    "Japanese was hands down my most fun class at Yale to date. The teachers are amazing, and I feel like we will be lifetime friends going forward. You wont get that from another language program here.",
    "Yes, I would because it is a great language to learn and the department is great.",
    "Yes, because it is engaging and challenging. And I make an improvement during class."
