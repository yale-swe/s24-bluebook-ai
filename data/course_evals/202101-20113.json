While the lecture focused more on the phenotype of birds in general, the lab delved into the extensive diversity of modern birds and their taxonomy. While reviewing the phylogeny, we were also introduced to unique aspects of specific birds, allowing us to apply lecture content to specific species."

                "The course is very comprehensive. However, it relies on a particular analysis of the phylogeny, which is now out of date (2015). Students should know that the relationships between orders and families are still under discussion.",
                "Strengths: paper discussions were interesting, oral exams were a fun way to assess your knowledge\r\nWeaknesses: memorizing the entire bird phylogeny was not what I realized this course was going to be about and just felt kind of pointless",
                "Strengths: Professor Prum is super passionate about his research, and you can tell just how much he loves talking about birds. He was a real delight. I also felt that the assigned papers (3 in total) were valuable in helping us learn about a more specific group of birds and ecosystems. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because of the virtual format of the lab, it turned into a 3-hour long lecture on bird families once a week, and for that reason, I lost interest in the class at around the hour mark every Tuesday. Further, Prof. Prum's slides could be more conducive to learning in a virtual environment. I understand why he didn't record lectures (as it is a lab!) but the slides were never posted and often the only cue that he had moved on to another order or family of birds was verbal. This was difficult, especially when my Zoom would cut out or if I got distracted for a moment or two. I could never regroup.",
                "Of course, with Covid, it was difficult to hold the same quality of lab over Zoom. Professor Prum did his best to give us a good lab experience, but normally we would see bird skeletons and bones in person in order to learn about their bodies better.",
                "This course was interesting. The lectures were engaging though sometimes ran too long. I wish we would have done more of the literature discussions in class.",
                "The class was interesting and the bird walks informative, but it would  benefit from not being over the zoom format.  Also, oral exams can be very difficult for people with intense social anxiety or just anxiety in general, so those were a weakness of the course in my eyes.",
                "This class was very rich and I loved the lectures. The main problem I had was the workload. Having 3 essays and 2 oral exams for a 0.5 credit course is A LOT of work. The lab is way more work than the lecture, and should be worth 1 credit for the workload. Because we were virtual this semester, we were at a disadvantage because we could  not study the birds in person. Despite this, we had to memorize every bird family (there were over a hundred) which was a lot of work, especially if E&EB is not your major and you're just taking the class for fun.",
                "I understand that the covid version of this class was very different from the way it was intended to be. For what it was, the class was very fast paced which forced us to be engaged, but generated substantial fatigue. I had no issue with this, as I found the content very interesting, but I could see myself being less receptive to information towards the end of each class. The assignments were distributed quite well in that I felt like the work was constant but bearable if I allowed multiple days to prepare for each of them. They were definitely well thought out too, as they encouraged us to do more reading into the topics we found interesting. Still, three papers combined with the term paper for the lecture course amounted to far more writing than I've completed in my WR courses. The oral exams were a clear strength of the class, as they allowed us to more accurately reflect the breadth of information we've retained. For example, even if we forgot the scientific name of a bird family, we could at least be given the chance to show that we known the common name and their placement on the phylogeny."

                "The course was fun and the lectures translated online well enough. I think that it would have been better to have 3 oral exams instead of two so the content was broken up into more manageable chunks.",
                "The course struggled with adapting its initial materials, so it was very different than it would have seemed to be in person.",
                "I feel that this class over-compensated for COVID by assigning more work. Assigning 3 essays in a half credit course is a lot, and I'm not sure if we would have had to do that in-person. The oral exams were difficult and made me extremely nervous (flunking is one thing, but flunking real-time in front of your disappointed professor is another). I would have preferred quizzes that were less memory-based. Memorizing the scientific names of 100 families of birds in order doesn't reflect how well you know the material, just how good you are at brute memorization.",
                "Not having any specimens to view did take away from the engagement of the course, but Dr. Prum made up for this with some very engaging content. There was also the potential for some great discussions of lab papers which, when the discussion picked up, added a much needed social component of the class."

I was excited to learn about bird morphology and be able to identify birds from specimens, but instead the entire class was memorizing the (not universally accepted) extant bird phylogeny. Though I learned some interesting facts, this class was overall definitely not worth it.",

If you are a birder or would like to be able to start identifying the birds around you I would even go as far as saying that this class is essential. While you'll be able to name about 150 bird families and provide some background about each of them by the end, this comes through a whole lot of absorbing lectures, note taking, and memorization."
