                "I learned how to merit the ideas and points so that readers dont have to just jump from point A to B. I also learned how to better take critiques in my writing and take it in stride in order to improve. I learned fascinating theories and methods of rebellion, and what rebellion meant to different communities.",
                "This course instilled a new approach to academic writing within me that values the importance of communicating ideas rather than appealing to the writing style encouraged in secondary school. In my own work, I now write with the focus being on what best moves my argument. While analyzing the work of others, the close reading skills I have developed from this course allow me to draw out specific questions and techniques that further my understanding of the piece and allow me to implement it into my own skillset. I am now able to effectively and carefully input my own voice into academic discussions.",
                "I learned how to easily build the foundations to an argument by identifying a tension in a text or research topic and choosing a defendable argument that contributes productively to the discourse around that tension.",
                "I learned how to write academically. Understanding how to elucidate ambiguities in writing and add something to the conversation seems to be an invaluable skill that I'm glad to have learned, and hopefully will master in the future.",
                "I significantly improved my writing ability and critical thinking skills. I learned how to be more thoughtful in my writing, delve deeper, and be more purposeful in my analysis. I learned different strategies for drafting and revising. I also learned more in-depth about the different modes of rebellion and how writing is used to further resistance.",

            "comments": [
                "We got a lot of time to work on our papers. The material we learned was sequenced in a way that allowed us to build on what we had learned. We got to work with classmates and receive feedback from them during in-class workshops.",
                "This course felt extremely inclusive and encouraging to all writers. It introduced me to works in a pattern that established foundational understanding, and then allowed me to branch out into personal interest. There could be improvement by including sample works earlier on for assignments, but that never substantially effected my process.",
                "There weren't many weaknesses. I thought the readings were insightful and helpful. The essays, while difficult at first, were made easier by going to the writing center and/or meeting with the professor. One weakness I can think of is the Wednesday readings were always posted on Tuesdays, so you didn't get as much time to read them as Monday readings.",
                "Strengths are that the workload is very manageable and we go more in-depth in all our discussions because of it. Also, Professor Baynes-Ross does a very good job of posing questions both in class discussions and in writing workshops which really pushes us to take our thinking that extra step further. Not really any major weaknesses, but maybe I wish we'd start class with reading discussions and then have activities like looking at exemplar essays after in the second part of class because I would sometimes be disappointed to run out of time to discuss readings."

                "Absolutely, but they should know that they will have to put in a great deal of work in order to score an A on a paper.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course. Although it required a lot of effort and time, thorough engagement in the course material helped me redefine writing and has made my writing process much more clear and direct. I feel much more confident after taking this course in inputting my own opinions and thoughts into arguments and discussions.",
                "Yes, this course is perfect for students who struggle to write without getting overwhelmed.",
                "I would recommend this course for sure. I think learning how to write academically will always benefit you, and I'm planned STEM major. Even so, writing eloquently and efficiently is just such an important skill.",
                "I would 1000% recommend this because you  dramatically improve your writing no matter what level or background you're coming in with, and you'll also get to grow tremendously as a thinker as the class engages in a variety of perspectives on rebellion.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to improve their academic writing while exploring ideas interesting to them.",
                "I would definitely recommend! It is a great introductory course to academic writing and challenged me to rethink what good writing is. It also helped me to develop my skills as a writer and researcher while engaging with essential questions about rebellion, decoloniality, and liberation."
