    "Game theory and strategical thinking",
    "I learned a lot about how to evaluate strategic situations through 2 different forms.",
    "general idea of how game theory as a field formalizes situations like bargaining, auction. the concepts of nash equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium etc.",
    "An Introduction to game theory",
    "I learned a lot of basic game theory concepts and their applications-mostly theory.",
    "I developed skills of induction and improved logic by taking this class.  I also gained lots of new knowledge about types of games, how to solve these problems, etc.  For example, I now know about Nash equilibria, subgame perfect equilibria, best responses, normal form and extensive form games, backwards induction, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother skill that was developed was using all the tools I have in my brain and pieces of knowledge I've collected to answer a question that isn't obvious.  For example, some logic and everyday knowledge can be very useful for answering a question rather than just solely relying on things learned in class.",
    "I learned a variety of game theory concepts and analyzing strategic games through backwards induction. I also learned about Nash equilibrium and the best responses of each player regardless of what the other players do.",

    "This course taught the concept of pure and mixed strategies, dominance, Nash equilibria, subgame perfect equilibria, strategic and extensive games, information sets, Bayesian-Nash equilibria, auction theory, among other topics that Im likely forgetting to mention. I learned to analyze strategic situations and games through the framework of players, actions, and payoffs.",
    "By taking this course, I got a basic understanding of game theory and its foundations in Math and Economics.",
    "I learned the basics of game theory and how to analyze situations as games with rational players",
    "Throughout the course, I gained an introductory knowledge of game theory and was able to develop a more in-depth picture of high-level cognition and logic.",
    "I learned about different types of games and strategies, as well as how to view different kinds of scenarios as games and attempt to solve them or determine what the most logical outcome would be.",
    "Mathematical thinking",
    "I learned a lot about the field of Game Theory and I learned about equilibrium and how to solve and model strategic games."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course content is inaccessible. The professor acts like were all game theorists even though we know basically nothing",
    "With 3 hour lectures, we covered so much material that it was hard to stay focused and not get overhwlemed. Also, the first half of the class seemed to cover a much more reasonable amount of imoformation compared to the second half. I liked that we had all the notes in one massive file that we could go back to.",
    "strength: the notes are really extensive. weakness: i personally felt like the level of engagement throughout the course was very low, perhaps in part due to the online setup. there is a really wide range when it comes to the level of conceptual sophistication and mathematical rigor of examples discussed in class and the problems encountered in the homework, to the point where it was really difficult to gauge whether the level of the course was appropriate for me in the beginning and whether i was meeting the expectation of the course as it progressed. the homework problems (graded for completion) were also quite different from the exam problems and felt frustrating at times when it was something way above my head. the curve of the course was generous but i dont feel like i have a good command of the material :(",
    "It was interesting but the notes over complicated the concepts",
    "The TAs were both very good at explaining concepts and remaining accessible to students.  The professor seemed somewhat disorganized and juggling competing priorities.  I also didn't think the format of lecturing from a long pdf was super helpful and the long pdf used as reference for the course was much less user friendly that sets of slides. The problem sets were also harder than the exams and hard to use as a starting point for engaging with the material, and the solutions were released like a day before the midterm and final, basically encouraging cramming.",
    "Strengths of the course were that there were lots of resources available to help (e.g. TAs), the lectures were recorded so we could rewatch them, and the professor shared lecture notes and practice midterms\/finals, which were useful.\r\n\r\nThe course could have been improved by having 3 slightly shorter sessions a week instead of 2 long ones as it was very hard to keep concentration the entire time, although the 15 minute breaks in the middle were helpful.  The course also could have been a little bit more interactive at times, but the TA sessions were useful for this.",
    "The strengths of this course are the problem sets; they are challenging and include good exercises that prepared me for the midterm and final exam. Weaknesses: amount of time for office hours (not enough)",
    "Very organized",
    "I thought professor Newman did a great job explaining and linking the study of games and strategy to real life examples which made it more intuitive.\r\n\r\nI think some of the mathematical notation couldve been clarified more along with how to do some of the proving in the psets.",
    "strengths- good use of online medium for videos and engaging content\r\n\r\ncon- online made it hard to go to review sessions \/ office hours",
    "Strengths: \r\nInteresting problem sets, great lecture notes, entertaining lectures, reasonable exams. \r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSometimes concepts could be explained in more detail.",
    "Weaknesses come with technological glitches, which are uncontrollable, but the class was ran extremely well.",
    "It could be improved by offering more understandable examples of problems.",
    "This course was generally engaging and the topic was very interesting. The primary weakness, in my opinion, was the mismatch between lectures\/problem sets and exams. Problem sets were incredibly difficult, often unsolvable, and lectures could delve into complicated mathematical concepts that went well beyond the scope of the course. Exams, in comparison, were surprisingly easy.",
    "I think the pace was a bit hard to follow",
    "The format of the course was not very conducive to learning in my opinion. The concept of a 3 hour lecture is already daunting, but forgivable considering it is a summer class. The lengthy, often unnecessary examples made the class difficult to focus on, especially when these examples contained knowledge outside of the class's scope, and when there haven't been more clear, simply examples beforehand. The saving grace of the course were the 2 TF's who had weekly office hours to help with homework and concepts. They often explained the material in an easier to understand manner than Prof Neeman.",
    "The strengths of this course were the variety of concepts covered and the different applications of Game Theory and Economics, Politics, sports, film etc. The weaknesses were that there were only lecture notes (no PowerPoints) and generally speaking only a few resources. The two TAs were amazing, but there should have been more TAs to better facilitate student learning.",
    "This course was very difficult to follow in this format. 3 hour lectures are difficult to get through, and though Professor Neeman is a nice man, many students were lost throughout the course and his curriculum did not seem well-suited to meet struggling students' needs.",
    "smaller sections with more class engagement could be beneficial. overall though, good course!",
    "I thought that the course was engaging and provided ample examples and office hours to clarify any issues or questions presented by the lectures. The only weakness was the overall length of each lecture, which was over 3 hours.",
    "I enjoyed the lectures since we covered extensive examples and real-world applications of the material. I do think the problem sets were much more difficult than the exams, which was good for preparation but somewhat stressful.",
    "This course can be made more interesting",
    "This course was strong because it introduced a lot of information without being too overwhelming. While the examples and video breaks were really helpful, I would have liked more practice problems and more structured problem sets to prepare for the exams."

    "I would be hesitant to recommend this course to another student",
    "Yes but in a full term",
    "I think the concepts are useful, but I would not recommend learning them thru this course.  The expectations of our mathematical understanding of the course material were also unclear",
    "Yes, I would recommend.  The content was very interesting, the professor was good and very knowledgeable, the TAs were extremely helpful, and it was a good mix of learning from the professor and TAs but also having the resources provided to help yourself learn.",
    "Only if you want to learn about strategic games and how players make decisions to maximize their results. This course can be a bit challenging.",
    "Yes! Great teaching. Very enjoyable",
