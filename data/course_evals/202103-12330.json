                "Strengths: Challenging problem sets connected to material covered in class, clear notes, good pace\r\nAreas of improvement: more engagement during lecture sessions beyond just lecture (such as the week when we went through Mathematica work)",
                "The greatest strength of this course is that it is very mathematically rigorous. Students are expected to have knowledge of calculus, and the course relies heavily on mathematical calculations and insights to prove relevant theorems and solve problem sets. This is an excellent quality for a graduate-level course and lends a great deal of rigor to the concepts covered. \r\n\r\nThe greatest weakness of this course is that there is no textbook, meaning the instructor spends a great deal of time walking through proofs but little time discussing applications or example problems. The problem sets are thus extremely challenging, and without a textbook, it's hard to identify supplementary exercises to complement the core problem sets and exams because the content of the course is very specific and taught differently from sample practice sets posted online. Moreover, there is no assigned reading, even in the absence of a textbook, so there is little outside of office hours that connects the theory learned in the course to actual historical or contemporary research in political economy. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the emphasis in the course is more on political economy as a method and less on political economy as a substantive field. Students who consider themselves political economists because they are interested in the impact of politics on markets or markets on politics may not find the course a substantial contribution to their research and knowledge, but it is methodologically essential. However, the course could go further to help students understand how to read and produce contemporary political economy research. I think the course could be greatly improved by pairing the foundational lectures and problem sets with political science research produced in the last 50 years that makes use of the insights produced in the course. For example, Anthony Downs' theories are repeatedly referenced throughout the course, but Anthony Downs' research and writing are never assigned. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend that students take game theory before they take political economy, as the course deals with concepts related to Nash equilibria that, in the absence of a basic game theory course, might be challenging upon first presentation. I had never taken a game theory course and felt my peers who took game theory in the spring had an advantage.",

                "Yes because it helped me understand more fully the logic behind political economy models and how to follow the logic/math behind them. This was a huge weakness in my prior training, so I think it would be helpful to other students.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student that wants to produce political science research in the field of political economy or using microeconomic methods, but for a student that wants a seminar-style elective course on \"markets in politics and politics in markets,\" they should seek an alternative.",
