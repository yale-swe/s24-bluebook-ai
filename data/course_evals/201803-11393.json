    "Stepping out of the traditional Eurocentric curriculum, I was able to learn a whole new set of skills and perspectives when viewing art outside of the west. \r\n\r\nYou might also become more educated in South Asia than your suitemate who is of south Asian descent.",
    "This class laid good groundwork for a more in-depth study of South Asian Art. Loved the unit on Mughal painting.",
    "Familiarity with methodology and problems regarding the study of the art of south Asia, familiarity with means of visual storytelling in Buddhist and Hindu artmaking traditions, more in-depth study of the Ramayana and Mughal painting.",
    "I'm a knowing viewer of so much South Asian artwork know! Beyond getting into the tropes, motifs and parallels of South Asian Visual storytelling, I feel much, much more confident in my visual analysis abilities once we stopped relying as much on the readings for class conversations.",
    "This class provided a rich and exciting overview of art history in India, offering me a solid foundation for future studies in South Asian art and philosophy. Rather than sacrificing depth for breadth, we narrowed in on a certain topic every week (like portraits of the Mughal court or erotic imagery on medieval temples). Taken collectively, the topics covered a broad timeframe and introduced me to the basics of Buddhism and Hinduism, historiography, and Indian politics.",
    "Visual Literacy with the arts of South Asia, particularly architecture and sacred space"

   "comments": [
    "We struggled a bit at the beginning because, lets face it, Yales curriculum doesnt prepare us when it comes to South Asia. But I think in future iterations this will not be a problem.",
    "The strengths were in Professor Kaligotlas leading of seminar discussion  she is very good at asking leading questions and helping a class probe deeper. Weaknesses are that many of the interesting themes we picked up in the beginning of the semester we put down and didnt continue to engage with.",
    "The subject matter was so cool, addressing a field that the history of art department has not paid much attention to in the past. I'm glad we looked at methods in addition to general info about the art of South Asiamethods is another thing that is overlooked in many classes and Prof Kaligotla did not skimp on this! Prof Kaligotla was very receptive to feedback and dynamic in adjusting the syllabus to fit our small class's interests and needs. In future courses, it would be great to look one of the course's subjects in more depth (e.g. a course on the Ramayana); the range of time covered (2000ish BCE to 2000 CE) was broad, even for an advanced class. In any case, I really enjoyed the course and am fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet and work with Prof Kaligotla.",
    "The content of the course was fantastic. While readings were lengthy, they were absolutely interesting and worthwhile, as they introduced me to the rhetoric, conversations, and controversies around Indian art, often connecting to religious and secular philosophy, politics, and historiography. Seminars were highly engaging, but, as they were only 6 people in the class, I did feel pressure to participate even when I had nothing valuable to contribute. While Professor Kaligotla was very encouraging, it did sometimes seem like she had a set viewpoint and wanted students to agree with her (and, to be fair, she was far more well-acquainted with the field than we were).",
    "strengths: interesting readings, focus on objects\r\nweaknesses: too much writing"

    "If you are interested in art history outside of Europe or America, this class is incredibly valuable. Professor Kaligotla is a mar velours instructor and you will learn so much from her. \r\n\r\nAlso be prepared for the reading responses.",
    "Yes, it provided good insight.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Yes! Even if you've never taken an art history course before, this is a phenomenal way to look at some truly magnificent works of art in an oft underappreciated region of the world in the West. And you will leave the course very excited about the Ramayana; I didn't even know what the Ramayana really was four months ago.",
    "yes, great way to learn about the arts of South Asia"
