                "Strengths:\r\n- Immersion method for language learning\r\n- Small class size\r\n- Attentive prof\r\n\r\nPossible improvements:\r\n- Simplify, digitize, and concentrate all study materials and homework in one online app, e.g. Canvas. We had to purchase a print workbook, which is not easy for those studying remotely. This also meant that we had to spend a lot of time each week scanning and sending our workbook assignments to the prof. We also had to deal with too many different materials (workbook, textbook, coursepack, slides, and numerous word docs and PDFs). This situation often generated confusion and diverted student time from actual studies to dealing with bureaucracy.\r\n- Update the learning audiovisual materials. They were produced in the 80s and are not very engaging\r\n- Find a better exam platform. The one we were using kept on producing errors.",
                "I sometimes struggled with some grammar learning. I wish we could have spent a little more time and a little less on the stories but I loved the teacher.",
                "In the first week, I felt lost because of the immersion method. However, as I started to learn and understand, my engagement with the course material increased and I grew to enjoy French. \r\n\r\nGiven that we were a small class, maybe some additional in-person elements could be incorporated.",
                "There were a lot of opportunities to practice oral French which helped increase my comfort level with speaking the language. I would have liked quicker feedback for assignments.",
                "Strengths: video material, daily discussions, interesting content and exercises\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: online test format (using OWL) is stressful and occasionally does not work super well",
                "Strengths: Well structured for learning. Class was very enjoyable \r\nWeaknesses: At times, it was hard to receive feedback from grades",
                "I believe the major weakness in this course was the long duration in which it took to receive graded work. Throughout the entire semester, I really had no idea how I was doing in the class. We never received graded tests so I did not know what to fix or improve on until the very end. Our test grades were not revealed until it was time to take our final. As a result, everything we missed on our weekly tests had to be crammed into reading period, making studying less effective in my opinion. If I learned my mistakes when I took the weekly tests, I feel like I could have corrected my mistakes earlier and learned more effectively. \r\n\r\nA large strength of this course is its fairness. The professor is very willing to accommodate the student's needs. She removes assignments that are unreasonable or overwhelming and she removes badly written questions from tests. This makes the students feel as if the professor actually cares for their student's well being, formulating a much stronger and comfortable relationship between student and teacher."
