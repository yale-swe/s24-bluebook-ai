It's obvious he loves teaching the material and this passion made going to class at 9am easy. He is one of my favorite professors I have had at Yale thus far. In addition, the class and syllabus structure builds on itself and gives a great synopsis of recent research and findings in the world of AI and robots. No weaknesses.",
