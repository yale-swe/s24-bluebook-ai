We didn't do anything in lecture. \r\nWeaknesses - He didn't translate his knowledge into formats that we could learn from. If you have little experience with actually building things out of wood and screws or coding with Arduino, the final project is a headache and a half. We didn't do anything in lecture.",
                "cool ideas for projects, but we weren't able to actually do many projects",
                "The course was pretty disorganized, the syllabus was not really followed and the professor didnt seem to plan lectures.  I would say that a strength to this course Was that it forced me to teach myself. A lot of this course was me teaching myself because the professor didnt teach us it. We had to code in arduino and we didnt learn how to code in arduino. The solid works that we learned was doing the built in solid works tutorials. On the syllabus it said we were supposed to get some experience in the machine shop machining a candlestick but that was cut out of the syllabus which was unfortunate because that is something that should be done in meng 185.",
                "Instead of one project ramping up only in the final two weeks, the course should have two or three (possibly slightly less complex) projects throughout the semester.",
                "the instructor was quite awful. literally did not learn a single thing. a single thing. im not even sure there was a syllabus or like a weekly agenda. had no test no quizzes no anything which is fine but then got to the final project, and didn't even know how to hammer a screw into a board much less build a ball and beam sensor.",

                "Seems like a great course in theory, but Prof Freeman was not organized at all. I couldn't tell you a single thing I learned this semester. We didn't have any lectures, homework assignments, or exams, which seems nice... but that meant our final grade was just based on vibes. I know this was his first time teaching the class, so he wasn't sure exactly how to go about it, but the class was not well organized to facilitate student learning. The syllabus wasn't posted until two weeks after add/drop period, and we didn't follow it at all. Lab didn't start until halfway through the semester. We had one project for the whole semester (a ball and beam balance, super cool!) but we didn't actually get the materials to build it until the last week of classes. This meant the whole device had to be built and coded during reading period, which was annoying since we didn't do anything the whole semester. If you need this course for the MechE major, it will probably be an easy A. If you're taking it to learn new skills as a non-MechE major, take it with a different professor.",

                "Yes, despite the necessity of course improvements, it was a productive class for aspiring engineers even in its current state.",

The labs were pointless and we didn't do anything practical. We were later asked to complete a project that was not even complicated, however we were not prepared for it. We were not required to put the skills we picked up in class to the test, we had to look online, improvise, hope it would work. And the entire semester grade was that, as we had no other assignments."
