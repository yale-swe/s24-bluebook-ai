                "This was a great class! I developed the ability to think critically about literature and plays throughout a wide range of history. I had never read Homer's \"Iliad\" before taking this class, and the course gave me an immensely deep appreciation for this work and the writing of the time. I am so grateful to Professor Robinson for encouraging warm, open conversation. He has the ability to captivate students into the world of the plays, and I couldn't recommend this class, or any taught by Professor Robinson, enough.",
                "Close reading analysis of plays/dialogue/irony.\r\nEssay writing skills.",
                "Overall, this course allowed me to engage with and learn more about classic texts from European literature, which I found to be incredibly insightful since I had to skip a course in high school that covered a substantial amount of these foundational texts. I also felt like I was able to take a lot of creative freedoms in my writing, which I appreciated a lot.",
                "A solid survey of the European dramatic form from the age of the Greeks to the age of the postmodernists.",
                "The ability to both analyse texts on their own, with Dr Robinson spending the last half of most classes going through and reading passages, and to look at things in the context of broader literary tradition. Loved how we kept seeing the Greeks crop up, and the play within a play motifs, but also the fact that reading and discussing these plays made me a more questioning, interesting, and grounded person.",
                "This class was a great introduction to European tragedy and gave me necessary intellectual tools to analyse theatre in a very creative, artistic, analytical, and a bubble critical way. This class taught me how to think about literature and how to sing creatively and also write creatively. Also thanks for the professors insightful conversations and comments, this class also taught me some valuable life lessons. It was overall very engaging, fun, and inspiring to attend.",
                "I learned about the origins of the genre by reading plays spanning multiple time periods as well as how to analyze these pieces.",
                "I learned a great deal about tragedy in theater and how to effectively write about it. I feel much more equipped to find meaningful connections between different plays."

            "comments": [
                "This course has many strengths. While it would seem fast-paced in terms of how many plays are read through the course, it feels like such a joy to read the plays, knowing the candid discussion to follow with Professor Robinson. The plays chosen from each period--Greek, Renaissance, and Modern--are amazing works of art. Professor Robinson has the ability to discuss the plays and place them in context without over-historicizing. He also cared tremendously about our success as students and is willing to help with any writing needs or concerns. He individually met with each student at the beginning of the year. As a senior who has taken six other semesters of courses, I can't recommend this class enough!",
                "I thought the course was awesome, especially with play choice and the discussions led by the professor.\r\nEven more so, I thought it was really cool how the last two prompts of the semester he opened up for a freestyle kind of paper which was really fun.\r\nWeakness: It might kind of depend on the class sometimes with the discussion. I thought my class was awesome in bubbling off of the professor's points and each other.",
                "As I stated previously, Professor Robinson facilitated an environment that allowed me to feel comfortable with taking creative risks that I normally would not have felt confident enough to take in other courses. However, I feel like the course could have benefitted from having more room for open discussions, as I felt that at certain points in the course, it was always the same select few of students who would consistently be participating.",
                "Strengths included great course material and funny class discussions. Weaknesses included the deemphasis of certain aspects of the syllabus and low class participation.",
                "I think the rapid-fire nature was needed, and LOVED the selections, especially when the class could tell that we had a banger of a play on our hands.",
                "This class was great, its seminar based discussions were my source of inspiration, I really enjoyed them, and above all, the greatest strength was the professor: he could identify so strongly with students guide them perfectly and helped me not only in acquiring the necessary concepts in the literature, but also into great personal and intellectual challenges. Again, I thought that in the theatre context and tragedy-teaching, this class, and mainly the professor also taught us some valuable life lessons. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I would comment on is the Reading load. The readings (a play a day) were quite a lot, although they were all very interesting and engaging.",
                "I would say that it is taught quite well as the discussions are quite engaging and listening to various perspectives is quite enjoyable. The only thing I would add is the inclusion of some sort of support for students who may miss a lesson so they can learn more about the play being read.",
                "The big strength is the wide array of plays you get to read. If you view it as a chore, then that's what it will be. If you really let yourself engage with the plays assigned, you'll get so much out of it. From the greeks into modern theater, this course is a great time. The writing assignments aren't too long, just enough length for what the prompt asks. Overall a great course."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to students! They will always feel supported and cared for by Professor Robinson. They will also expand their ability to read a diverse repertoire of literature, placing the plays into the context of their cultural surroundings and the audience the plays were intended for. They will also dive into human nature and motivations, love and loss, and even some references to modern film and television in this course. It's amazing!",
                "If you like plays, ABSOLUTELY. \r\nIf you don't, maybe not; after all, you read quite a bit of plays in this class.\r\nIf you're unsure but like literature, discussions, and writing, I would still take it.",
                "Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I think Professor Robinson had a lot of insight to offer in the texts that we read, and I found the material of the class itself to be very interesting.",
                "I would recommend the course to a student who wants a class that is focused more on his own engagement with the text rather than his anxiety over the grade he is going to get. I never once worried that an assignment in the class was going to fail me or give me more stress. I could choose to engage with it as much or as little as I wanted and still get a relatively good grade. However, the more I actually engaged with the texts themselves, the more I got out of the course as an interesting examination of truly seminal works in the Western literary canon.",
                "Hundred percent. Dr Robinson is wise, funny and compassionate and he made the class a place where you could just let go and get lost in the works for a few hours a week. I loved the feedback he gave, and the quirky essay prompts meant Id spend hours just reading around the topics and got to focus in on the most pertinent plays and elements of them.",
                "Of course I would. Not only is it interesting and intellectually challenging, but its also fun and inspiring.",
                "I would recommend the course to anyone who is vaguely interested in Greek tragedies in particular or needs to practice their writing skills. The material is quite interesting, and each play is quite different, so you are likely to find something that you enjoy from it.",
                "Absolutely! Even if you have zero prior experience with tragedies or theater in general, this course makes it all accessible and worthwhile."
