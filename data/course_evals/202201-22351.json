                "Strengths: Asynchronous Wednesdays! These helped a lot as they allowed me to identify areas where I needed review and allowed me to have more time to complete homework and daily assignments. Another strength was the way students were supported regardless of background and prior experience. There were many opportunities for small group and partner work which I found to be really helpful in practicing my Spanish.\r\nWeaknesses: I fell behind on supersite which made me feel disjointed - sometimes the grading on supersite was also strange but I went to my professor for help and was caught up.",
                "This course was easily one of the best language courses I have ever taken. I learned more Spanish in one semester than I did in one whole year of Korean at Yale. The course is very conducive to learning Spanish in the most efficient way. Meaning you grow more comfortable speaking, reading, and writing faster yet with minimal \"busy\" work."

                "Yes! I had taken Latin and only knew a handful of Spanish phrases before taking level 1. I felt supported in the course and learned from my peers and my professor. There were many ways the course sets you up for success especially with its emphasis on how to learn a language. This was affirmed in the variety of activities we did during class from partner speaking and conversations, small group projects, reading poems, listening to songs etc. Additionally although having work due every day can be difficult, it didn't feel enormous to incorporate into my daily schedule (my advice would be to plan to do the daily homework as soon as you can that day so you are not completing it at midnight).",
