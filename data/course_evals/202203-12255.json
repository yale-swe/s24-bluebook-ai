                "Very interactive, organized. Overall, great class.",
                "I believe that the tests should be online as it is impractical to assume that students can sit in a class and constantly look up to see the professor signing and then try to quickly transcribe what it is that they signed.",
                "I think the strength was the curriculum. I felt like I learned a lot in very little time and it made me actually rather comfortable in deaf spaces. The weakness would probably be the structure of the class in terms of L1 students diving right into a completely deaf space. While I think I learned a lot, it also made me miss vital information for the class.",
                "I really enjoyed this course. Professor Rubin was great, and made the class very enjoyable and a great learning environment. Exams for the class were fair. I learned a lot and will be continuing to L2.",
                "The strength is how many opportunities there are on campus and in New Haven to get involved with Deaf communities. A weakness would be better organization for some of the service projects.",
                "This is an amazing class.",
                "Professor Rubin is an excellent professor, and I learned a lot from her this semester. The only weakness of the course was that it felt repetitive at times, and it was sometimes difficult to balance between the different comfort levels with ASL in the class.",
                "ASL courses at Yale are very unique in terms of teaching structure, as the entire course consists of observing and producing sign language in the classroom. This made every class engaging but also required a lot of focus from each student. I definitely felt like my efforts paid off very quickly, and I felt supported and excited about learning a new language. The \"take-home\" aspect of the course, the online modules, were somewhat tedious in that they often used signs that we were unfamiliar with, which made it difficult to complete them accurately on the first try. Luckily the workload was relatively light and did not take long to complete each week. The service project component of the course was fascinating but it seemed difficult for ASL 110 students to deeply engage with the projects."

                "yes!!!!!",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn ASL or is curious about deaf culture. Additionally, learning ASL is a great way to learn about communication for hearing people too because of the emphasis on facial expressions and communicating with more than just words.",
                "Yes! Taking ASL (despite being finished with my language requirement) is a decision I definitely do not regret. I learned so much, so quickly, about something I had no previous knowledge about, and experienced the classroom in a completely knew way. Also-while this class does meet four times a week, I found myself looking forward to it nearly every day--it was manageable as a 5th course and brought me so much joy this semester."
