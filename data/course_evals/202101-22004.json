                "I believe the overall structure of the course as being centered around incrementally building a compiler is a great way to learn about compilers. However, I believe that the curriculum of the course needs some updating. The main textbook from Appel is rather terse and hard to understand, making the assignments very hard to implement sometimes. Additionally, I feel that the text ignores some of the newer tools that have been created for compiler implementation, making it hard to transition to implementing a more modern compiler. So, my biggest suggestion would be to find a new, more modern textbook. Additionally, I think the final projects would have worked better as a group project, like they have been done in the past.",
                "Professor is very knowledgable about subject, and very approachable. Lectures were very clear and contained lots of great information delivered in an understandable way. The textbook, however, was not great (we used the Appel book). Very terse, very confusing at times.",
                "Soule is very nice, funny, and engaging, I really enjoyed having him as a professor. Compilers are interesting, fundamental, and untouched in other courses which is a huge strength of this course; there aren't any other comparable options. I used to think Standard ML was a weakness, and it kind of is, but I really enjoyed learning to program and reason in a functional language. Hopefully the skills transfer to OCaml or Haskell or something. I think the biggest weakness was the disorganization of the assignments. Most say \"check the textbook\", but the textbook is over 20 years old, and the class assignments don't exactly follow the textbook assignments, and you are mostly left to figure that out on your own. It did make completing them very satisfying."

                "The virtual seminar form was very fun and because of the small size of the class, we were able to participate a lot in class and get detailed feedback on our assignments from the TA's. The Piazza really helped too.",
                "Our professor started the year with lots of built in time in case we got behind. This was a very wise decision; we got to take breaks or extend homework when needed, and we even finished all the material ahead of time.\r\n\r\nGrading of homework was also pretty quick, it did get much slower towards the second half of the semester. \r\n\r\nIn summary, lectures >> HW, and because of how fast we went though the topics, our homework would often be on something that we had learned multiple lectures ago (but in the case of compilers, this could be a good thing since the broader context of a specific bit of information often doesn't become clear until you learn more about other parts of the compiler)."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who would like to work with compilers in the future, as it will give you very good theoretical knowledge of the topic. However, be prepared to put in a lot of work and seek out resources to supplement the Appel book.",
                "If you are very interested in compilers, yes, this is a very well taught course. Be aware that the homework is quite a task though. Prior preperations for each HW should be done MUCH in advance so you can go to office hours and ask about it. The homework is assigned straight from the Appel book, and the Appel book is really a confusing mess.",
                "Yes, but I feel obligated to say that this course was the most work of any I have taken at Yale (including 323, OS, etc). Compilers are really cool and foundational to basically everything we do in CS (shoutout to Grace Hopper for inventing them), and you get to make your own compiler in this class. Standard ML is annoying at first, but the functional style of reasoning really grew on me. Soule is great and he clearly cares about his students; he gave us a few extra days off and extensions when we needed them most. He is also entertaining and engaging. The most frustrating part of the course is also the part that I think most prepared me for non-academic work: the assignment descriptions are very vague and sometimes the goal feels unclear. This can be extremely annoying\/frustrating\/exhausting, but each roadblock eventually fell and everything came together, which was extremely satisfying. It also made me feel very independent, as if I were coding something completely new \/ never done before (even though this is not a new class and the textbook is 20+ years old haha). I guess my final plug is one of the reasons Aho received the most recent Turing award is for his work on Compilers, so maybe you can get the next one.",
                "Absolutely! The course goes into tons of detail. This course teaches you essentially an entire textbook on compilers and the programming assignments have you built an entire compiler! While the last three assignments were a bit unorganized at times, that was understandable given it was a last minute change due to the online-format, something that was not really foreseeable. In the future, I would recommend have the students continue to build the entire compiler, unlike past years where students would work in groups on the last 3 parts, because it teaches you so much more and it feels like much more of an accomplishment to do so; my on critique would be to space out the last 4 assignments a bit more as they are definitely a lot more work than the first 4."
