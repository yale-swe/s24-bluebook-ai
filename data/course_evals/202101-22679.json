                "Although I learned a great deal about my specific thesis topic, I also learned about the process of executing and writing up a long-term research project. My senior thesis was by far the longest paper I had ever written, so I learned how to structure a long paper with multiple research-based sections. I also learned about the importance of focusing on my main argument throughout the paper, and my adviser often gave me great advice about how to keep reminding my reader of central points. Practically speaking, I got a lot of practice putting words to paper and revising my work. \r\n\r\nWriting a yearlong thesis was also really useful because it helped me see what it's like to narrow down a research topic into something executable. Especially this semester, I had to think carefully about the ultimate argument that I wanted to make and what parts of my research were going to be the most important for that argument. This meant that there were parts of the research I had done that didn't make it into the final paper, and I think it was a useful experience for me to see what that's like and to realize that it's all okay and part of the process of completing a project.",

I had an extremely attentive and invested adviser, so I felt that I had a great deal of support throughout the process and someone to talk through my ideas with. As it's currently structured, the yearlong thesis requires students to take an actual class about research in the fall and to then work independently (in consultation with your adviser) during the spring. I was able to work much more effectively in the spring when I no longer had the class to worry about--I felt like the class held me up a bit in the fall and I ended up doing most of the work for my thesis over winter break and during the spring semester. If changes could be made to the program, I think I would have appreciated having the freedom to work independently with my adviser for both semesters instead of having to take the class in the fall.",

                "If you're genuinely interested and invested in writing a yearlong senior thesis, then definitely! My thesis ended up being one of my most important commitments this year, so I poured a lot of time and energy into it. Because I decided to focus on it, I think that I got a lot out of the experience and I ended up having a lot of fun with it (even though it was definitely stressful at times). If you're interested in going to grad school at some point in the future, the yearlong thesis offers one of the best opportunities at Yale to gain experience with in-depth research, and it also allows you to test out the independence and self-direction that comes along with working on your own research project the way that you would in a research-based masters or PhD program. If you're not interested in grad school and you don't want the thesis to be a major commitment for your senior year, then I think it could make a lot of sense to shoot for a semester-long thesis instead. It's really a matter of what you want to prioritize and how you're most interested in spending your time senior year. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in doing a yearlong thesis, I would highly recommend reaching out to current seniors or recent graduates who have done it to ask if they'd like to chat! I'm sure that many people would be happy to share their experiences, and it's good to have some idea of what to expect going in.",
                "Yes, if you have a subject or topic you want to explore in-depth, definitely choose the senior essay option. It is very self-guided, so you need to be able to effectively manage your own time, but if you create a workable plan for completing your essay and communicate with your advisor, it can be a super rewarding experience.",
