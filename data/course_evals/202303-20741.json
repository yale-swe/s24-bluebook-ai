                "During this course, I learned basic economic principles, but also a deeper understanding of how to critically think. A great example of something I learned was whenever you see the number that there is only so many barrels of oil left you think you can do simple math-- taking barrels used each year and dividing how many are left by it to get the number of years. The problem however is that the marginal cost of each barrel is greater than the last, so eventually, green options will be cheaper.",
                "Deeper conceptual knowledge of the theoretical workings of our capitalist market",
                "This course gave me a really solid grasp on introductory microeconomics and gave me some insight into what the field looks like, considering that I had never taken economics before. I learned how to solve quantitative problems while also thinking through broader concepts and I feel like everything I learned is generally good to know and interesting.",
                "Learned micro material and definitions. Course was very broad overview of topic, so few specific skills\/insights.",
                "I learned a lot about basic economics which will help me with future economic courses.",
                "I learned both the mathematical and conceptual fundamentals of microeconomics concepts in a way which I feel as if solidly has prepared me for intermediate microeconomics. I will note that you do not need any sort of calculus for this course, as even though some concepts might be more straightforward to view in terms of calculus if you already understand it, the course is structured in a way where students are strongly discouraged from using calculus in favor of the methods discussed in class to solve the problems.",
                "Learned microeconomics and some math",
                "I developed foundational skills and knowledge in microeconomics, such as supply and demand, elasticity, monopoly, duopoly, and many other concepts. All of these things allowed me to develop relevant insights into the functioning of modern society as it relates to all of the concepts, since economic concepts can be applied to fields outside of just economics, essentially everything.",

                "This course was a seminar so there was more engagement in the class as opposed to the lecture however the lecture for intro to micro gets more resources. ECON 110 struggled to get a peer tutor until about halfway in the semester.",
                "I think the idea that only so many people in the class can get a certain grade is absurd. I chose the seminar over the lecture because I had no previous experience in economics and thought that it would give me a better chance to get a higher grade. I was gravely wrong.",
                "Strengths: very adequately taught. Reminded me of an ap course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: material a little dry and somewhat convoluted and disparate at times",
                "I appreciated how the course covers so many topics and gives very clear, structured assignments to complete. Sometimes it felt like the course material was taught fairly quickly and then never reviewed, but at the same time, there were enough external resources provided to make it straightforward to keep up with the work and review outside of class. The problem sets and exams accurately represented what we learned and the examples we did in class which made it easy to prepare and master the material. I also appreciated when real-life examples were used to demonstrate the concepts we were learning.",
                "Course taught very slowly. Since large course anyways, might be useful if there is accelerated version that goes more quickly over derivations and thus lets students practice while building skills in way of thinking about economics problems.",
                "Overall a good introduction to econ.",
                "I thought it was well done, I just didnt have enough time on my own to study and memorize the terms which was my fault.",
                "The two core strengths of Econ 110 is an incredibly high exposure to practice problems and the ease of asking questions. The only weakness I can currently think of is that even though Daniela changed the rules so the standard Economics curve would not have been strictly imposed on our smaller class, typically I will say that the one downside of taking Econ 110 over 115 is that you do run the risk of facing a harsh curve.",
                "Really ramped up in the 2nd half of the semester, could be more spread out, especially the first couple of units were stretched a bit in my opinion",
                "The strengths were that the course allowed each student to ask questions whenever, there were many opportunities for office hours and peer tutoring to be taken advantage of, and that the course material was taught in a good manner. Another strength was that there was always feedback readily available for one's mistakes, and it always made a lot of sense and aided greatly in improving my learning. Some weaknesses were that often I felt the lecturing overshadowed everything and we did not practice what we had learned enough.",
                "Strengths: smaller classroom format made it more engaging, ability to ask questions\r\nWeaknesses: We were told at the beginning of the course that we were going to be graded on the same curve as Econ 115 and grouped with them for grading purposes. That is one of the reasons why I decided it was OK to take the course to begin with instead of taking Econ 115, which I did not receive during registration but which I did not remain on the waitlist for because of the curve information I was told in 110. However, right before our second midterm (early November), we were told that the curve had changed and would now be contained within our class but would \"help\" us. However, many people I know who earned A or A- grades were curved down as a result of this change, and we were never informed as to what the curve actually was. I felt that the classroom context was therefore a bit misleading."

It's a solid intro course that is great for anyone looking for a broad overview but who is okay with taking the time to do tedious problems and review basic topics to understand the material. It is completely doable and can be interesting and satisfying for those who like solving problems.",
                "Sure. It has fun modeling-like elements, and it's a requirement for later econ courses.",
                "Yes. If you prefer a classroom over a lecture hall then this course is a great way to learn micro. It is nice to be able to ask questions and talk to the professor after class.",

                "YES! Especially if you need Introductory Microeconomics for your major, I highly recommend taking Econ 110 over the Econ 115 lecture. The smaller class fosters an environment where you can easily ask questions to ensure you leave the class understanding the material. Also, Daniela ensured that we were able to work through lots of practice problems together as a class, giving you exposure to more types of problems. \r\n\r\nIn terms of deciding what level of Econ to start with, I will note that I came into the course with some microeconomics experience already, but I am so grateful that I decided to start with this course as it provided me a much more tangible and broader understanding of the concept that I did not attain through the AP course in high school.",
                "good intro class that teaches micro basics",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who is trying to take an economics class and would prefer a smaller environment rather than an incredibly large lecture. This course is great for students who do well in independent learning and are not afraid to ask questions."
