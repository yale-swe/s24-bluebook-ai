            "comments": [
                "The level of support for this class was extremely helpful. The proof workshops and study groups helped me solidify the information from lecture. The psets are very relevant to the learning and do not feel extraneous.",
                "The graders are too picky on the homework grading.",
                "Strengths is the lectures are well structured and there is lots of support if you have questions. Weakness is that there are several students who constantly ask pointless questions that divert class time.",
                "I think the strengths of this course included the number of opportunities students had to support their learning, and the way in which the problem sets forced us to think about and apply material from class. I wish there had been at least a little more discussion of applications.",
                "I wasn't able to make the workshop sessions because they all occurred during times I had other classes, and the professors refused to record these sessions for me when I asked. I think this made it a lot more difficult for me to do well in the class, especially given this is the introduction to formal proof writing, and I think in the future it would be helpful if workshops could be recorded for students who can't make it to them.",
                "I don't think there is any considerable weakness to the course. One strength is the amount of resources available to students. There are tons of extra resources available if students are struggling at all",
                "I thought this class was taught and organized well.",
                "I think more practice sessions on proof writing would be helpful, but I really liked how our professor would connect abstract concepts to physical objects in everyday life to make them more visual, which is really difficult to do.",
                "I think that this is a good class for learning proofs and is also a good introduction to Linear Algebra. I think that this class, however, did have many weaknesses. For instance, I think that it was strange to not have an online discussion platform available throughout the semester. I also found some of the midterm exams to be designed quite poorly. I think that the professors should tell graders to be less punitive about certain assignments as it is an introduction to proof course and the graders were just arrogant. I also think it would have been nice to have some motivating factor behind learning certain concepts - maybe in relation to statistics and data science and\/or computer science.",
                "The pace of the course picks up across the semester so while in the beginning relatively little linear algebra material is covered, with a greater focus on being able to write proofs in the language of linear algebra, by the end the material is covered rather quickly to fit it all in. The course is not comprehensive, leaving many important areas of linear algebra, but the coverage of proofs in the context of linear algebra is solid.",
                "The course did a good job of covering linear algebra and giving us ample practice through problem sets and additional optional problems in the textbook. However, lectures were sometimes unorganized.",
                "The material is interesting and was well taught. The homeworks were challenging but really helped deepen understanding of the concepts from class. The pace felt slow at first, but I think this helped build a strong basis that was useful for the rest of the course. I thought sometimes too many points were taken off on homeworks for small mistakes.",
                "The course offered a lot of support and resources, and the Professors did a really good job ensuring that the material was understandable.",
                "Strengths: lecture notes are very helpful and organized, problem sets are graded in a very detailed manner\r\nWeaknesses: solutions to practice problems could be uploaded for more practice",
                "Strengths - 50-minute classes were more engaging. Great instructor. Good practice material\r\nWeaknesses - very challenging. The exams and homeworks are a lot of work. Very high workload. Not enough time for midterms.",
                "Strengths:\r\n-I think that the proof writing component was well-paced, felt slower than non-proof based math courses, but proofs are difficult, especially at the beginning, so I think this pace is justified.\r\n-A lot of out of class learning opportunities (workshops, discussion sections, peer tutoring, study sessions)\r\n-Homework was difficult, but I felt that it adequately prepared me for the exams\r\n-Since the homework and exams were difficult, I had a lot of fun completing them, as I love challenges and puzzles, which is what proof writing feels like, a lot more engaging than repeating the same formula over and over where the only times you get it wrong are with miscalculations\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-The lecture format sometimes does not lend itself to learning proofs initially, as I think that I learned proofs best through thinking through the problems on my own, through psets\r\n-Homework grading was difficult, at first my grades were not where I wanted them to be as grading is strict on proofs, but I think this also could be a strength as the difficulty of the homework prompted me to work hard to learn proof writing skills.",
                "The course is a great introduction to proofs for students that have never written formal proofs before. I greatly enjoyed the use of intuition backed by logic as well as the use of a variety of tools to visualize and make sense of concepts in addition to clearly proving them. The psets were challenging, but they were well designed to improve understanding. The proof workshops and ULAs were incredibly helpful to supplement the class materials. My only criticism of the class is that the last topics were covered fairly quickly.",
                "midterms are super hard",
                "Strength: very engaging lecturer, the notes were posted online, a lot of ressources and help are available to facilitate your learning. Main weakness: I felt like the problems that we would have to solve on exams were completely disconnected from the examples we see in class and were much harder than problem sets problems, when I believe that psets should be more challenging than exams.",
                "I had to go to a lot of sessions outside of class to learn the material. It is definitely possible to succeed, but it took a lot of effort on my part. Discussion section in particular was really helpful.",
                "Strengths: logical progression through concepts\r\n\r\nWeakness: no required discussion section",
                "Strengths: Overall, the instruction and lecturing was very clear and well-structured. The lessons clearly presented important theorems, definitions, and techniques, often with proofs or derivations, along with examples of how to apply them. The problem sets were good extensions of the material that we had covered in class, allowing us to apply theorems an definitions in new proofs. As a professor, Erik's enthusiasm about the mathematical material was great. There were also weekly interactive, ungraded quizzes that helped to review and reinforce materials. \r\nWeaknesses: Overall, this class had few weaknesses. Occasionally, problem sets could be quite long, although this did not necessarily correspond to difficulty of material.",
                "Weakness: The syllabus said we'd learn a little more than we actually did (e.g., Spectral Theorem), which is the reason I took the course. Since we didn't have time to cover these advanced topics, I didn't learn anything new, as I took linear algebra in high school. I think the syllabus should be updated to reflect what's possible to be taught over the summer. \r\n\r\nStrength: If you study and practice, you'll notice and feel that you're learning more.",
                "A strength is the course follows the textbook closely so I can refer to the book easily for help. A weakness is the course relies heavily on the tests for grades which put high pressure in exams.",
                "There are plenty of opportunities for clarification and help (office hours, peer tutoring, discussion sessions), and the lectures are very clear and concise. However, a weakness of the class is that no answer keys for discussion session worksheets were ever shared. It harmed the class experience for anyone unable to attend discussion sessions, and made it harder to succeed in the class.",
                "I feel like the course was slow paced at the start and then ramped up unexpectedly fast.",
                "The course was well taught and comprehensive and went through everything pretty in depth. One thing I would change is making the psets due at midnight instead of 5pm it was just awkward timing sometimes.",
                "Maybe more practice problems at the start. We only got extra practice starting at the mid of the course. Everything else was super cool and good!!!",
                "I really appreciated the professors' acknowledgement of issues of inclusion in mathematics \/ skills to focus while learning math in the psets, even if a bit annoying to complete. I think I received at least one email a week about a ULA being unable to host office hours, which was kind of concerning--I'm not sure how this might be improved but having consistent, available ULAs would probably be an improvement.",
                "Strengths: Professor Erik was great and was very approachable and always take time to explain the material, TAs were helpful and there were many ways to get help in this class, including lecture notes, office hours\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: harsh grading with PSETs and exams were always much harder than what you encounter in PSETs or class so you have to practice a lot(do problems from the textbook for extra practice)",
                "I think the homework questions were generally pretty straightforward\/cookie-cutter, and generally involved pretty standard applications of ideas from class. It could be cool if some optional \"creative\" questions were included, perhaps for extra credit (there were already some, I noticed, but perhaps even more?), so that I could try to apply the ideas in more unique ways. Same applies for the tests. \r\n\r\nI did really appreciate the lecture notes being posted online-- those were very clear and easy to follow, and really helped me follow along if I didn't get something from class."

                "I would recommend this course to students who are disciplined enough to keep up with material consistently, since this course (esp. by virtue of involving proofs) builds on itself quite heavily. I would recommend the course to students who enjoy math and want to see a different side of it, less heavy on computation and mechanics and more deeply focused on thinking about definitions and ideas rigorously.",
                "If you're not a math major, and linear algebra is required for the major, it might be a better idea to take MATH 222 instead, because only the second half of the class is going to be useful for its applications to other STEM subjects than math. However, proofs teach a really cool way of thinking in my opinion, so if you're willing to put in the extra work for this class, I think it can be worth it.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's definitely difficult, but I do think that the idea is a solid foundation for other abstract math classes.",
                "I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn how to write proofs or tackle problems with a mathematical mindset. Additionally linear algebra is fundamental to numerous other disciplines so it will likely be a stepping stone to other areas of study as well. Professor Hiltunen was fantastic; he always made sure that everyones questions were answered and really encouraged a love for the beauty of the math. The lectures never felt too rushed, even considering the large amount of material to cover.",

                "Yes, it is necessary for most stem students to know this course, and even if youre not going into one of those fields it helps provide you with the perspective of mathematical problem solving without being too abstract.",

                "Yes. If you've taken linear algebra before and are thinking of taking this class, then take 226 or some other math class instead. If you take 225, you'll learn nothing new (and the learning-to-write-proofs part of this class is pretty straightforward). If you haven't taken linear algebra before, take this class, but know that the class is almost entirely theoretical and conceptual with not much computation.",

                "Yes, especially if Erik is teaching--he is a very engaging professor and made learning the math fun.",
                "I would definitely recommend this class to other students who would want to get better at Math. It is a challenging course because you have to learn to think about Math in a completely new manner. I would definitely take this class over Linear Algebra with applications because this class makes you understand the material and not just memorize formulas.
