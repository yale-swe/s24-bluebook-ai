I also gained insights into how to develop my own idea of utopia and dystopia, which involved critical thinking skills of examining my own current world.",
                "This course was a great way to get exposure to a variety of utopian works across history, allowing students to refine their notions of what utopia is and who it's for, creating an atmosphere of open dialogue and discussion that led to unique conversations due to the students' varied backgrounds.",
                "I learned a lot about utopian philosophy over time. Class discussion was super helpful in developing argumentative skills and  a broader understanding of the readings.",
                "Lead discussion\/presentation",
                "I learned about utopian\/dystopian case studies throughout history and literature, from St. Augustine to South Sudan and everything in between.",
                "I gained a deep understanding of the history and roles of Utopias in different western cultures. I was able to read a lot of fun historical documents I had never had the chance to before, and have interesting discussions about them and a lot of other parts of history with a great class. As a STEM student who frequently feels the Yale cultural pressure to be well read on Plato and random historical texts, this class assuaged that a bit and let me attack them from a different lense that how they are normally approached.",
                "I learned about many different types and forms of utopias and dystopias, the historical context behind them, and how they impact modern literature and thought. Through the many readings we had throughout the semester, I saw many different approaches to building a utopia, and how the meaning of \"utopia\" can differ based on the times, circumstances, and from person to person."

                "Strengths: great professor with lots of knowledge, lots of interesting material, good class discussions\r\nWeaknesses: only meet once a week, heavily rely on student presenters",
                "Strengths: The emphasis on discussion in section was my favorite part of the course, allowing the \"section leaders\" to help propose thoughtful questions to students who would be able to debate and discuss their takeaways from the readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the syllabus would be constantly updated, making it difficult to know what was expected from students at various points in the course",
                "The readings are incredibly engaging and interesting. Professor Jrdan is one of the most kind and passionate professors I've had the opportunity to take a class with at Yale. She made the class something to look forward to and the grade distribution and range of assignments made the class manageable and fun.",
                "Super engaging and love the way it was organized",
                "Strengths: Maria! She is so friendly, easygoing, and passionate about the material that it is hard not to enjoy the class. She helps you with all the assignments and always has lots to say in discussions. I liked how we focused on one utopia or dystopia per week, and that each one had a clear theme. Workload was manageable as well. Weaknesses: class presentations often lasted for almost the entire class (~2 hours) and sometimes it didn't feel like there was a ton of structure to class meetings.",
                "It was a great class. Professor Jordan is wonderful and the readings were all great. Sometimes they were very difficult or there were a lot, so a more consistent reading load and more clear scheduel would be ncie, but Professor Jordan did try to tailor what we read to topics that we were interested in which I appreacited. The workload of the class was also pretty low, and allowed everyone to really just enjoy what we were learning.",
                "Strengths: The course introduces a great variety or readings, allowing for exploration of many kinds of utopias and dystopias. The class discussion format is especially wonderful, as it builds upon the course material with personal insights from students with many different backgrounds and worldviews. Maria's expertise provided historical context that also added to the ideas of the class. No weaknesses, this was an amazing course that I would absolutely take again if given the chance!",
                "Maria is a lovely individual. She is warm, intelligent, and thoughtful. She is a strength of the course. The material is also very interesting. There is not a very high workload - just weekly readings and blog posts as well as a midterm and final assignment. A weakness would be that the class is a bit disorganized."

                "I would recommend this course. Thinking about ideas of what we want and fear for the future of our society is important, if no other reason than the world subconsciously does this anyways. Understanding what these ideas say about who we are and what our society is makes discussion of these ideas highly relevant and important. Also, the material and class discussions are just incredibly interesting.",
                "Yes!!! Maria is one of the most genuinely thoughtful and engaging professors I've met at Yale and she creates an environment that encourages students to truly share their perspectives and engage with each other in new ways. The diversity in readings was my favorite academic part of the semester, exposing me to thinkers from Rousseau to Marx to Bradbury in ways that drew parallels that I had never considered.",
                "Yes. Though it is not light on reading or assignments, I always looked enjoyed doing the readings and blogs. The class material is both entertaining and fascinating and it really overlaps into politics and history.",
                "Yes! Super engaging and interesting material",
                "Yes! Maria is a phenomenal professor who is super passionate about the material. She goes out of her way to make sure the class is learning and enjoying the material. Units are interesting and aren't overly focused on philosophy (I don't like philosophy, so that was great, but if you do, this might not be the class for you). Overall a fun seminar with a manageable workload --- you get to design your own utopia for the midterm and write your own dystopia for the final.",
                "Yes! Whether you are in history or not, this is a great seminar and anything with Professor Jordan would be amazing. it is not the most rigorous history seminar, and is much more of a survey to track some specefic trends through time. But if you are intersted in utopias, historical comparisons, or just want the opportunity to read some new things, this is a great place for that.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as it was certainly a highlight of my semester. Even as a STEM major, the material of the course was very interesting, and the discussions were always engaging and thought provoking.",
                "I would recommend this course as a relatively low stress seminar that deals with interesting material. Dont expect a crazy intellectual challenge though."
