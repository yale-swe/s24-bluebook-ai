                "I think the class was set up really well to induce learning and reviewing signs from the beginning of the week. I've never felt the pacing to be too fast, and I like the flexibility we have in class to work with partners\/groups. You learn quite a lot in just a semester, so it's been really encouraging to see how much we are able to say now. I will say that there have been times when I wish the course was a bit more organized in terms of the service projects. It felt like for most of it I wasn't sure what we were supposed to be doing or how we were being coordinated but that might have been the nature of the project I chose since we didn't meet up in person.",
                "Strengths: Great, welcoming classroom environment to be in. Amazing professor. Weaknesses: The Canvas felt a bit disorganized, and there didnt seem to be any centralized place to access all the different Google Docs with the rubrics and instructions for different things (instead, you had to find each one by clicking through different links on other Google Docs). Also, this isnt exactly a problem with the class itself, but my service project team felt pretty disorganized, although this did mean we got to have freedom and independence with our work, which has really nice.",
                "This is an amazing course! Everything about it was great - the professor, the assignments, the class engagement, the outside of class activities. I absolutely loved this class and learned so much from it. The only weakness was the semester-long project...my project was a little disorganized, it was hard to communicate with students from other classes, so I don't think I got as much out of it as I could have. I would just suggest trying to make it more structured for future semesters.",

                "100%. You learn much over only a semester, and the ASL department in general is lovely. I really felt like I came away with a grasp of the language and am definitely happy I chose to take this course.",
                "Yes, absolutely!!! I think if you are seeking to learn a language at Yale, you should definitely learn ASL. Since it isn't an oral language, it really changes your perspective on communication since it is mostly through visual and gestural means. I am someone who often gets nervous about pronouncing things wrong and gets a little anxious in speaking language courses, but ASL has been really nice since there isn't that pressure that spoken languages can have.",
                "Yes! Everyone should learn ASL and about Deaf culture. If you can take the class with Dr. S, do so. She is so incredibly kind and understanding. I will say, I found ASL (the language, less so the class) to be very challenging to pick up, but perhaps thats just me (and learning *any* language from scratch is difficult).",
                "Yes, I absolutely recommend!! This has been my favorite class that I've taken at Yale (I'm a senior). It has opened my eyes to disability awareness and Deaf culture. It is so rewarding to be able to sign in ASL and communicate with Deaf individuals, you never know when a skill like this could be useful. You learn so much in the span of a semester, make friends in your classes, and have such a fun time during class. This is the most engaged I've ever felt in class.",
