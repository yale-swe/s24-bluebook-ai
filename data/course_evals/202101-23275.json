                "The course readings tended to be very loosely required, which made them easy to disengage from and in turn made the lectures more boring. Additionally, more space for questions (which would likely be facilitated simply by moving the course in person) would also help.",
                "Strengths: the material was very interesting, Professor Uskokov is very knowledgeable and interested in hearing from students, and the lecture notes and slides are detailed and helpful. Weaknesses: the course moved quickly through a wide breadth of doctrines, and it was sometimes difficult to trace different themes and similar belief systems through the course.",

                "I thought the lectures could be dry but its hard to make philosophy lectures too riveting in the first place.",
                "The strengths of this class were that it was quite flexible. I found that I was able to come to class prepared with the readings each day. The readings were also incredibly interesting. The one thing that was difficult was that, as someone who hasn't spent much time studying philosophy before this class, there was a bit of a learning curve for me.",
                "I think that this course was pretty in depth, and I wish I knew more about Indian Philosophy going into the class.",
                "Not enough of an introduction to philosophy for those who were unfamiliar. Also, the quiz study guide would have been more helpful if given before the readings so that we knew what to focus on in the readings.",
                "professor was confusing and material is extremely hard and complex to grasp on its own",
                "The subject matter was interesting but I fo wish we could have had more discussion.",
                "This was an interesting course that spent a lot of time on the details of various schools of ancient Indian philosophical thought. This was both a strength and a weakness--it was a strength in the sense that this is where many fruitful discussions lie and where the schools of thought are at their most interesting. However, this may also be a weakness for some students, because the arguments we learned about were at times very niche\/theoretical and may have been hard to follow. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion I have is to maybe re-shuffle the order of lecture. At times it felt like we were diving right in to a highly complicated subject, but grouping lectures by type (eg epistemology, philosophy of mind, etc.) and giving a broad overview of the positions of different schools\/of the terminology they use may have helped lecture be more accessible.",
