The readings are a lot of primary sources and historical papers, and learning how to identify and engage with the arguments being made, as well as the perspective the author was either explicitly or implicitly writing from, was a skill I developed over this semester.",

He is the perfect professor for the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The once a week format limited the amount of depth we could go into. The quality of classroom discussions varied, sometimes they were brilliant and insightful but sometimes they were just fine.\r\n\r\nImprovements: I wish there was a way to have more depth, though that would involve meeting more frequently. Basically I liked this class and would love if it was a higher commitment and workload in exchange for more depth.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings, professor provides helpful discussion questions, great class layout\r\nWeaknesses: feedback was limited for response papers",
                "Strengths: Subject material was engaging and reading selections were great\r\nWeaknesses: Could've received more feedback on prospectus and response papers, wasn't sure what to expect for the final",
                "The class structure was varied which allowed for interesting discussion every time. The reading responses gave us freedom to explore difficult topics we encountered in the texts and the questions that the professor generated were thoughtful and open. I think that it could be improved adding a few more assignments during the semester which are pointed towards the final research paper. It would alleviate the pressure of the final assignment.",
                "The course was arranged very effectively in chronological order, and Professor Machava's selection of readings was wonderful every class. The weekly response papers facilitated my understanding of the readings and allowed me to come to class with my own insights. Prof Machava was also a very good facilitator."

                "YES! Take this class. It opens up so many frameworks of analysis through practical examples. It addresses hard practical questions while getting a deep dive into the intellectual history. Also, Prof. Machava is an incredible professor and resource.",
                "Yes I would, especially as a departmental seminar. It is rewarding intellectually, as the subject matter is interesting and worth learning about. It is also not an overly hard course for what it is. The reading is very manageable, the writing is straightforward, and Prof. Machava provides good feedback and guidance for the final paper.",
                "Yes! This class is very interesting, intellectually stimulating, and enjoyable. I think students from all different backgrounds would enjoy this class.",
                "Absolutely!! The course was so interesting, especially for me who didn't know too much about African history. The readings started off at basic levels that helped everyone have a fundamental understanding of socialism, and the class followed a natural trajectory throughout history and even added in very interesting supplemental texts outside of the history of socialism. Highly recommend!",
                "Yes, I thought this class was very interesting, well-organized, and engaging. The subject matter felt important, practical, and every lesson was clearly connected to the broader themes of the course.",
                "Yes, as it's one of the few courses that engages with socialist experiments outside of Europe.",
                "Yes. It really dives into the subject matter.",
                "Yes! This class allowed me to delve into African history and the history of socialism, and Professor Machava is a very knowledgable and approachable professor to learn from."
