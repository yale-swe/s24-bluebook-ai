However, I appreciated the final project format, freedom, and peer review process! Many minds elucidating a unique idea is usually better than 1 or 2.",
                "Strengths: Every person in the class has a different interest and this really makes the discussions interesting. Professor Santos is really good at building off of everyone's points. Weaknesses: Class length was a bit long.",
                "Strengths are that there were realistic expectations on students regarding workload and engagement in class -- having fewer but more interactive assignments made for a lively class discussion every week. I can't report any weaknesses!",
                "This class was such a gem because of how engaged all students were in discussion. We rarely get to discuss research outside of academia, and so everyone was invested in the conversation and brought such interesting points to the table!",
                "Enjoyed taking a different type of psychology class and the content and assignments were interesting. Structure of lessons could be improved."

                "Definitely. If you are someone who wants to be able to talk about your scientific interests to people without the same knowledge, this is the class for you. Also, it's a relatively low workload and the projects are fun.",
                "Absolutely. Dr. Santos is phenomenal and I think there is no better qualified person to teach a class on communicating psych at Yale. She's super helpful, supportive, and kind.  An amazing role model and mentor!",
                "Oh yes! I think this class must be a staple in the major",
