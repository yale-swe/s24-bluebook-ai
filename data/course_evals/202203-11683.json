                "How to read papers and pick out what the most important results were. How to structure a research paper (i.e. have a lit review, regression results, explanation of your theory, discussion of important results and coefficients) etc. Hard to put into words what I learned, but I do feel like I grew as a researcher.",

            "comments": [
                "I think the course could be improved with a section component, that only met in the week or two prior to papers being due. This would have given more opportunities to work on papers in the presence of Professor Fair and our TA, but otherwise, I really enjoyed the course.",
                "Strengths: freedom to write/research whatever you are interested\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some readings arent that interesting",
                "I really appreciated that this course was centered around reading actual empirical research rather than lectures on econometric techniques. That being said, I think there were a lot of people in the class with minimal econometrics background and maybe more explicit introductions of different methodologies would have been useful. We checked in almost every class on the results and betting markets for the 2022 midterms, which was interesting but I don't really know how much it added to my experience.",
                "Strengths: Professor Fair really knows what he's talking about. He also has strong viewpoints on what he does and doesn't (i.e. tables in not inline in a paper and all put at the end) like in papers. Helpful to get an academic's understanding of what makes a good paper and how to figure out how to read academic articles. I actually liked cold calling as a tactic to get students to engage. \r\nWeaknesses: Wish there was a more concrete expectation of what students would learn in class i.e. I have a hard time describing what exactly I learned. Also, more guidance on the research paper (even a page recommendation or suggestion of figures to include) would have been great.",
                "Professor Fair is a treasure. The course was always interesting as we moved through different topics, and fairly low stress outside of the 3 papers. Prof Fair does a great job of easing students into creating a complete paper by the 3rd assignment.",
                "Strengths: very knowledgable professor, interesting topics, lots of freedom and flexibility given to students to pursue their own topics of interest. Weaknesses: not much feedback given on papers.",
                "Strengths: the freedom to explore whatever research question we found interesting, timely feedback from Professor Fair and our TA Anthony, a well-selected set of readings to help us get a taste of the literature. Weakness: too many class sessions were spent asking questions of the nitty-gritty content in pre-assigned readings. I would've appreciated more time spent on reviewing econometrics methods and how to actually use them in research.",
                "The class is entirely research-based. It allows for much self exploration.",
                "Fair is an amazing prof. There are no weaknesses in the course.",
                "Everything was great. Maybe we could have gone into theory a bit more but thats just my personal preference when looking at some of the papers.",
                "Extremely applied and hands-on. I think a clearer mechanism to force students to engage with the readings would help the class. Many people either did not read the papers or completely declined to partcipate.",
                "Strengths: professors insight, seminar style / active participation, interesting papers read\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: cold calling format was not conducive to learning, more open style discussion would have been preferable (and just use attendance tracking for participation credit), the feedback on papers was not as strong, more time discussing possible ideas although the time spent doing that I thought was a strength",
                "The leniency in deadlines is a great strength in this course. Feedback is often misguided and must become more robust, perhaps by multiple TAs looking it over. Rather than looking at a half-dozen papers every week, it would be more beneficial to look at a few papers and supplement that with teaching on the practices of applied/research econometrics (and how they might differ from a purely mathematical approach to econometrics which is taught in intro/intermediate econometrics courses."

                "Yes",
                "I would recommend this course because it really gives you the freedom to do research on almost anything you want. However, I think you need to have a solid understanding of econometrics and writing a research paper going into it, especially if you struggle to write without specific instructions.",
                "I'd recommend this course to people interested in learning how to hands-on apply themselves in research and write a paper about it.",
                "Absolutely, if youre interested in any of the topics. You get to discuss how the weather impacts wine quality, how runners slow down as they age, and Prof Fair even has a published paper on marital infidelity. You will leave knowing how to take a research idea and explore it in depth.",
                "If you're looking for a chill ECON seminar (only write three ECON papers) or are thinking about writing an ECON thesis, this is a good class to take.",
                "Yes, for the opportunity to explore interesting research topics through the literature and through papers, especially if you are planning to write a senior econ thesis. But the class time spent on going over the readings might not be the most productive.",
                "Yes!",

                "Yes. Great professor",
                "If you are debating whether to write a thesis or not, definitely take it. Do not just take it because you think it is easy. The course definitely needs at least some level of econometric understanding to be fun.",
                "Yes. This is a relatively light-workload seminar with a good, friendly professor. You will mainly learn how to think about formulating ideas where data can be collected and used to test hypothesis / come to conclusions. You will not really learn new econometric ideas -- more learn how to think about applying them.",
                "Yes this class was a great class and interesting in the field of economics",
                "You wont really take much away from this course other than practice in econometrics research, which you could easily learn elsewhere (even on your own). But, if you dont expect to gain experience in econometrics research elsewhere, its worthwhile to take the course, as long as you invest a lot of time in your papers and abide by feedback. Professor Fair is very, very lenient with deadlines so dont worry about taking time to submit quality work."
