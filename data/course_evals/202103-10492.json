                "The course starts with a historical overview of the impacts of imperialism and colonization on education, focusing on Native American experiences, the experiences of enslaved people, and other marginalized groups. This creates a base for more theoretical critiques of education and the ways it has affected our cultural, social, and political reality. The class focuses on the ability to pick out ways that our current system is plagued by an imperialist past.",
                "Content  the history, mechanisms and motives of U.S. education as an arm of imperialism and settler colonialism (read: Black vocational schools, Native boarding schools, imperial schools in the Philippines)\r\nSkills  how to theorize contingently and how to build your emotional and intellectual capacity for the contradictions of life as we know it as\r\nInsights  this course is a collective and affirming experience that forces you to reconcile with the meaning of your education as a Yale student, this course will not lie to you.",
                "I learned how frightening and terrible the world can be, and how compassion and imagination can combat that terror. I learned a lot of cold hard history and social theory, and I worked on considering myself within the structures around me. I learned about the American education system, and as a class, we tried to imagine alternatives.",
                "Education and Empire really transformed how I think about education, pedagogy, and curriculum. tzb is amazing and takes you through deconstructing many different aspects of learning  fundamental epistemologies (and epistemicide), the American history of education (including the US's legacy of colonial ed and Indigenous boarding schools), discipline and surveillance, alternate imaginations of education, and what we (as students) are to do about this. It is a really empowering experience that pushes you to think hyper-critically about future careers (particularly in education), as well as your own past experiences with education. Some classes are solemn and saddening, others are energizing. This course reveals things to you that everyone interested in education (and honestly every person at Yale) should take.",
                "This class really helped me think critically about U.S. education and its role in imperialism and colonialism. TZB talked about wanting to give us tools, and I feel like this class really did that, both to analyze the existing relationship between education and empire but also to look towards something more for education. This class challenged me to question a lot of things that are treated as standard or objective aspects of education; it also challenged me to want and think about something better.",
                "This class changed the way I think about education and about social reform and taught me about stamina and education in movement spaces. The class first gave background historical knowledge about education in the U.S. then readings provided insight into the unspoken and hidden ways education was used as a tool to oppress or ensure that the status quo remained the same, valuing order over change. From large scale educational and imperial movements and history the class also zoomed in to dynamics of control and surveillance within classrooms. Discussions often focused on what reforms are possible or if reform is possible at all. Alongside insights into the uses of education I gained confidence in grappling with large, difficult, and pressing questions about educational reform."

            "comments": [
                "The course allows students to think critically about a history that is often ignored and a current education  reality that is often glamorized. Students are able to unpack their own educational experiences and better understand the myths of education we often fail to recognize and buy into. I think the class was also a safe and supportive learning environment for many. That being said, the class did have a number of weaknesses. I felt that professor tzb didn't always teach in a way that aligned with the very pedagogy we were learning about. Knowledge felt like it was held by the professor, rather than created by the class. Even though the class was a seminar, it sometimes felt like a leminar in a way that didn't really allow me to fully grapple with the readings and ideas. I wanted a more collaborative environment that emphasized class discussion over understanding of specific theoretical concepts. Lastly, and this might just be my misunderstanding of the class, but I was frustrated by how theoretical many of the readings and class discussions were. I wanted tangible ways to apply the more theoretical concepts about education.",
                "professor tzb cultivates a learning environment in which you WANT to participate, not for points, but to challenge the way you think about yourself. this classroom has, without fail, created a community amongst its students over the years. there are no words that will properly do justice to this experience. know that the syllabus is intellectually rigorous, the professor is intellectually generous, and that you will be changed as a person.",
                "i think the readings could be cut down a bit and i think that sometimes there was a lot of groupthink happening, but the class is truly full of strengths and i really enjoyed my time.",
                "Strengths: The readings took me on a ride from colonial history to reckoning with institutions to apocalypse scenarios, and it's really quite well-structured and relevant and clear and emotional. The assignments are open-ended which always helps. TZB is awesome and encouraging and sincere and brilliant. \r\nWeaknesses: The nature of the intellectual work in the class is such that it sometimes makes it hard to see concrete solutions to the problems that the class poses. Not really a weakness, but something to be ready for.",
                "tzb is a fantastic instructor  brilliant, funny, down to earth. The material itself is dynamic, super interesting, and real, though you should be prepared to find it saddening or emotionally fraught. The course discussions, partner assignments, and classroom environment creates a collaborative space where you can lean on/cry with/support your classmates. In terms of improvement, I would just support tzb's own efforts to change the structure of the course to actually put some of its ideas into practice. It sounds like next year will be a real reimagining of what this course will look like.",
                "Strengths: Discussion formats and overall flexibility!\r\nWeaknesses: Occasionally I found myself a bit confused by what the reading assignment was but this is so miniscule in the grand scheme of things!",
                "This class consists of excellent readings, discussions, and guidance from TZB. She has really carefully curated a syllabus that is challenging but also empowering. I think there is a really good balance of learning about the harms perpetuated by education historically and also allowing us to imagine what education could look like in combatting this. I honestly cant think of any weaknesses right now.",
                "The strengths of the class include Professor TZB and the selection of readings on the syllabus. Professor TZB is amazing, the seminar environment was a welcome space for everyone and every participation style which made it possible for genuine, honest, and unscripted thoughts about the issues and texts we read about. In seminar people felt comfortable sharing their own experiences, mistakes, and reflections on changes in thought from the readings. The readings on the syllabus are all relevant and there is a balanced mix of dense/theoretical texts alongside personal narratives and accounts which made the heavy reading load manageable; I think the reading load could be considered a weakness of the class as it can be quite heavy at times. Another strength of the course was the flexibility for assignments and the opportunity to make friends through group work and group discussions."

                "I think it depends who you are. Personally, I regretted taking the class. The class felt so grounded in theory and academia that it was hard to apply to our education system. I think a lot of people in the Education Studies program really loved it, but I found it kind of frustrating. I kept wanting our class to take one more step and talk about solutions or at the very least, concrete examples of the theory we were grappling with. I think professor tzb truly has every students best interest in mind, but the class felt a little top-down in the teaching style and I regularly felt frustrated or lost in class discussions. That being said, this is an important topic and does a lot better than many Yale classes at tackling broken systems and ways of thinking.",
                "YES! While I recommend this to everyone I do think the students who are best fit for the course have a deep desire to think critically about their position as a Yale student. You will learn and unlearn so much, with the most loving Professor, and most generative community. Good luck!",
                "yes! tzb is an amazing professor and very caring and thoughtful. the readings are very interesting and engaging, but do not take this class when you are taking 5 credits because the readings are super long and dense",
                "If you feel ready to engage with radical concepts and be in intense dialogue about heavy stuff, then YES take this class. EDST-interested folks specifically should definitely take this. This class will challenge the way you see the world and how you feel about School and also maybe Life. It's heavy and demands a lot of reading, but the content is worth it. TZB is revolutionary to be around and to think alongside. Great vibes.",
                "Absolutely! This course is really revealing in ways that I anticipated and could never anticipate. The ideas that I've read and talked about have really shifted how I think about education, knowledge, community, and even raising kids. These ideas that I am taking with me have changed what I think I want from my career. They simultaneously build you up and take you down. They give you a language to describe the insane positionality that each of us takes in this world. With that said, you need some tenacity to take this course. Some weeks are really challenging. You need to be willing to think through your muddied thoughts outside of class. Find a buddy to un-break your brain after each lesson. The course requires a lot of mental energy (and sustained mental energy after the course), but it is so rewarding.",
                "YES.... honestly the best course I have taken thus far ever. Not only does it change your perspective on your interaction with educational institutions, but it also provides a space for each student to grow and learn from our peers. tzb facilitates a community like no other in the classroom",
                "Absolutely. This is one of the most impactful classes that I have taken at Yale or ever. It really sits at the intersection of the study of education and the study of imperialism/colonialism to gain a new understanding of education. TZB really wonderfully blends these seemingly distinct fields together to help students understand education in the U.S. as a tool of empire. This class was not only important to me academically; I feel like it impacted me deeply on a personal level.",
                "Yes! You'll get to know your classmates and have hard conversations. It'll be so worth it.",
                "If you are someone interested in education and education reform and about understanding the ways education has been used as a tool to oppress (and how we've been socialized to fit into this trend) I would 100% recommend this class. Although the reading load is a bit heavy (I would craft a reading schedule and try to stick to it to peck away at the readings) they are all worthwhile in providing the background knowledge and personal accounts to view the impact of education. The classroom and seminar environment is amazing and Professor TZB creates a special space to grapple with the topics of oppression, control, complicity, and how to break, act, and walk out."
