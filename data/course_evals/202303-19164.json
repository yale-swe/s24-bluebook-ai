I learned so much about my thesis topic, including what others have written about it, and corresponded with many people in the field. The thesis class gave me time and space to fully immerse myself in historical research, which was awesome.",

I also think writing a senior essay shows future employers/grad schools that you are capable of committing to a year long project and have some evidence of your reading and writing skills.",

The course assignments helped me stay on track and plan my thesis process in detail for the rest of the year, and they forced me to learn a lot about my research and writing styles. I look forward to building upon this work throughout the spring semester as I finish my history thesis.",

More emphasis should be placed around finding an engaging primary source early-on rather than digging into secondary sources because ultimately they might not be relevant to the primary sources available.",
                "The set of assignments in the first semester of the thesis is hefty and requires students to define their topics quite quickly. I think that is good, but could have been made clearer from the outside. In addition, it was unclear until around mid-semester how we were supposed to submit our work in order to make sure that our completion of assignments was documented.",

                "This course is hard to evaluate because it is so personal to each student, but I think the senior essay could be improved by having a weekly or biweekly meeting expectation set. I met with my advisor every two or three weeks at my request, but there was no expectation that we meet that often/I have peers writing a senior essay who hardly know their advisor.",
                "The strengths of this course were my history advisor and the class' required assignments, which kept me on track throughout the semester. However, the weakness of this course was its organization. Although I know it would be hard to organize, I think the history senior thesis could be much more effective if the class met in person rather than asynchronously. The department often did not send reminders or further information about upcoming assignments, sometimes leaving my peers and me to scramble. I also wish that the department could provide more information about historical and research methods to help us improve our technique as undergraduates."

I have had a fantastic time as a history major, and I think the thesis is a unique and meaningful process that every student should experience during their time at Yale. Moreover, I have learned so much from my thesis advisor, granting me in-depth one-on-one feedback unlike any other history course I have taken as an undergraduate.",
