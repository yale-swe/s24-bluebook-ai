                "I pursued an independent interest in the intersections between Greek tragedy and political theory. As the course progressed, I developed a research question with Professor Schillinger that gave our readings and discussions more focus. The study was most valuable as my first experience with a longer process of writing, and having rounds of feedback was invaluable to developing my writing skills with prolonged engagement with an argument or idea. Having a say in the specific readings that I would do and having a bigger hand in directing the discussion also felt like an important next step in my studies."

We read a mix of different materials with clear objectives behind each meeting."

It was more challenging than a seminar because you are so accountable and the conversation depends more on your ideas, but I would recommend it without hesitation."
