                "This course taught me so much I do not even know where to begin. Not only did I learn about so many different traditions and their visions of what contributes to a meaningful life, but I was also given an incredible set of tools about how to evaluate what is important to me in my own life. Getting the opportunity to explore the crucial course questions and share intimate parts of my life with my peers as we dived into the heart of what is means to be a human being made this class an academic course as much as a personal one.",
                "How to read, analyze, and discuss philosophical texts from various traditions. How to write informal philosophical papers.",
                "I learned so much from this course! I learned about various religious & spiritual traditions and their visions of a meaningful life  this was a precious experience, since I could learn about a whole range of religions and their practices from a place of curiosity & warmth, which is often hard to do outside the classroom. I learned more about the tripartite structure of a meaningful life & some course questions that I hope to return to, which make thinking about a life worth living a lot easier. I thought about normative claims, and the ideas implicitly communicated to me through Yale (the institution & community) and my own experiences. I learned from my instructor, Sara, what it means to lead classes with care, and from my classmates, I learned about their own visions, aspirations, and values. This was a course where I truly felt connected to my class & learned with them, and a lot of these skills (listening, asking thoughtful questions about religious practices and our own lives, and approaching hard religious texts) will stay with me for a while."

                "The preread materials can be more precise, summarized, but more in terms of numbers. So, we can have a broader and richer conversation is class.",
                "Strengths: We covered about 8 traditions so you are introduced and able to compare quite a few pretty big traditions. We also focused on the ultimate good in each tradition, which was a nice way to think about them.\r\nWeaknesses: Because we covered 8 traditions, we weren't able to discuss any of them deeply (only the basics and not the nuances within traditions) as each tradition just had a 3 classes assigned to it.",
                "I loved this course's selection of texts we read from each tradition we studied. They all were unbelievably insightful and engaging, and I loved the diversity of authors we read from. I felt that the amount of time we spent on each religion\/philosophy allowed me to grasp at their vision of what makes a life worth living without feeling that we rushed through them too quickly. I also greatly enjoyed all of the speakers who came into talk to us for each different unit, which enabled me to not solely engage with different traditions via texts but see how a life worth living actually plays out in a person's life. In terms of weaknesses, I would have loved if the classes had a little more variance, where instead of discussing the works we read every class there were instead a few more projects interspersed throughout the semester to keep it more exciting. Otherwise, however, it was perfect!",
                "Strengths: Sara! Selection of traditions and of the readings for those traditions. Selection of paper topics (so interesting!).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the readings could be a bit tough to wrap my head aroundI think a short primer on each tradition would help.",
                "There are so many strengths of the course: it is designed thoughtfully, to evoke reflection without being too intense. I appreciated the questions the course poses & the ways we return to it. It provides ample space for discussion & processing, while the weekly lectures were illuminating & clarifying. I particularly appreciated my instructor, Sara, who made the course an incredible experience by making discussions a safe space for genuine learning & her grading structure (Satisfactory\/Unsatisfactory\/Excellent) allowed me to appreciate learning over grading systems. The course's assignments were also a fun way to extend some of our questions to our everyday lives.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I wish the course had more diversity in terms of traditions considered. My favourite & most interesting traditions, by far, were the indigenous ecological visions unit and Buddhism. I wish we spent more time considering religions like Hinduism, Jainism, and other religious traditions that go beyond the 2 weeks we spent on Christianity\/Utilitarianism. It would be extremely interesting to have a feminist visions unit and to think more about radical visions that go beyond religion."

                "Yes, if they have not already been thinking about what is of most value in their lives\/what is most important after university. As someone who had spent a lot of time thinking about those questions before I took the class, I did not get that much out of it. But it's also good to become acquainted with different religions and traditions, so if you're looking to learn more about those, then the course is helpful.",
                "Yes! With Sara, if possible. Otherwise, I would still definitely recommend it.",
                "Definitely! Really pushed me to think in a new way and be more reflective on not only my own life, but life as a whole.",
                "Absolutely! LWL was such a joy & one of my favourite courses of my college career. I truly believe everyone should take the course and spend time thinking about some of the questions the course poses. The course is thoughtfully designed, but I would take it just for the intimate, warm relationships it fosters within the classroom as we embark on these questions together, and Sara (my section instructor), who was so incredibly smart, thoughtful, and truly changed the way I think about teaching & its related pedagogy. I'm not sure if the specifics of the religious traditions we encountered will stay with me, but I know that the ways LWL made me feel will  like my education & aspirations mattered, like I could truly reflect on & have space to think about these at an institution like Yale, and that there was a community of people equally passionate about these questions. Take the course  especially good as a not-very-intense senior year class!"
