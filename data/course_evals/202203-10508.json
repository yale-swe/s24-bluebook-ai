                "Strengths:  the detailed conversation of the critical literary tools used by Epic authors. The discussion was always facilitated so that I felt comfortable and motivated. Professor Diaz is a fantastic facilitator of learning. She feels it.",
                "Strengths: super interesting and good pacing in terms of how much reading is expected per week; also a great professor with good TAs; I liked how open-ended the papers were in terms of choosing topics that interest us within the Divine Comedy \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there were too many assignments (regular quizzes, discussion questions, 2 papers during the semester, presentations during discussion section, and a final paper) -- I think one of these, maybe the quizzes or 1 of the papers could be eliminated and it would clear a lot of stress while still providing many opportunities to engage with the material",
                "This course was perfect. We learned so much about very many topics without delving too far into theology, philosophy, classics, etc. so background knowledge on all of these topics was not necessary. I think having short supplementary readings on different aspects of history before readings would be very helpful because sometimes I would read a canto and not understand what was happening until class"

                "YES!!! Everyone should read Dante at some point in their lives, and the Divine Comedy really is the sort of text that becomes so much more meaningful when you take it in a guided class setting. I loved this class a lot.",
                "The Commedia is considered one of the greatest books of all time understandably. Dante is such a challenging, fascinating individual and the story he wrote came with so many questions that reward close readings. If you graduate college and don't read this book, you will never be able to get as much out of it as you would in this class. Definitely take it. There is very little workload and a lot of benefits to reading it",
