   "comments": [
    "Better writing style, knowledge about critical food studies as a discipline",
    "It definitely taught me how to be a closer-reader and my professor was great about helping me declutter my writing. The close-reading definitely translated into my writing and how deep I could delve into a topic.",
    "I learned about my recurring writing weaknesses and figured out how I should try to fix them. I also learned how to think more critically about readings.",
    "I learnt to be more analytical and to ask and answer crucial questions to a text.",
    "- Improved writing and critical analysis skills \r\n- Class discussion\r\n- Food critic ability",
    "I learned how to successfully write a college level essay while also learning about many aspects of food that had never previously crossed my mind. I learned how to scrutinize the origins and journey of what's on my plate, and how to be more mindful of the cultural, societal, and economic implications of my food. This was a fascinating course with a wide variety of material, most of which was very valuable and enjoyable to read. In the context of learning about many different aspects of food, I was able to grow in my writing: I feel as though I improved my close reading and learned how to successfully do research on a topic.",
    "I improved my writing skills and learned about the intersections between food and race\/gender\/culture\/socioeconomic status.",
    "We learned how to analyze books, poems, and essays about eating. We learned about what it means to be food\/an edible object. We also learned about the socioeconomic implications behind the physical practice of eating certain foods or in certain ways.\r\n\r\nIn terms of writing, we learned how to do close-readings and make original arguments about eating that go beneath the surface of the texts we read.",
    "I definitely made big improvements in my writing. I learned how to write more college grade essays and improved my overall structure of writing. I was not at all confident in my writing before, but this course taught me how to refine my writing and take the time to improve structure and grammar. I also learned the skills on how to properly go about writing a research paper, which I had no prior experience with at all.",
    "This course definitely improved my academic writing significantly. The four papers throughout the semester gave me practice in incorporating various sources into my arguments to better develop them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is amazing because Scarlet makes it amazing",
    "I think at the very beginning, the class was a bit all over the place and I found myself kind of lost. But as time went on, the course got much more organized and the direction was clearer. I also find the assignments and readings much more engaging. I think one thing that can be improved is the readings we do in the beginning of the course. The topics that we discussed in the beginning seem very abstract and I couldn't connect all the dots between the topic of the course and the readings.",
    "The class was generally not overwhelming, especially because the daily readings were on the short side. Having shorter readings gave me more time to digest the information given to me, instead of just skimming over it. I think I could have benefited from writing more--not necessarily research papers, but more self-designated writing.",
    "Strengths: Lots of class engagement, good mix of thoughtful and fun readings that appeal to everyone, close interaction with professor, personal experience, creative final project without being too demanding \r\nWeakness: Research paper took a lot of time out of class, but still very worthwhile",
    "The syllabus was easy to follow and the assignments are clear.",
    "The course was very engaging. The readings were interesting and most of the classes we just discussed the readings. We also did writing workshops which were very helpful for improving my wiring skills. A weakness is that we would finish a unit, but would not do anything culminating around it. We would just move on, which made it feel like we were just reading texts for no purpose other than to read them.",
    "Strentgh- Scarlet is a very engaging and fun teacher. Material was very interesting. \r\nWeakness - the only real weakness is that the class was offered at 9am.",
    "I think that the strengths were that we read a variety of different readings and therefore we discussed different styles of writing. Moreover, each paper was very different, which I think was good because it allowed us to gain more experience in how to write about varying texts."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely if Scarlet is teaching it. She's very engaging and a great teacher",
    "Yes. It was very interesting to learn about food from a social perspective and to dive into the implications something as ubiquitous as food has on our society. There are a lot of underlying themes in food that I've never heard of or explored, so I definitely feel like this is a class worth taking for a new outlook.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--after all, who doesn't love food? For real though, this was a really fun class and it helped pull me out of my shell a little. Because the topic is so relevant, it makes the course interesting.",
    "Yes! Fun class, especially if you like food. Readings and class discussions are more fun because they are mostly about food; but the class material is still super thoughtful and relevant to larger world issues.",
    "If you're interested in food, I would recommend this course. While all 114 classes have the same goal, it is so much more enjoyable to work towards better writing in a context that you enjoy reading and talking about. I could talk about food all day, so I loved delving into this world with more depth and scrutiny, and I learned things I will always keep in mind while buying, cooking, and eating food.",
    "Yes because it was engaging and the workload was good.",
    "Yes!! I would highly recommend a class with Scarlet in general. But it's important to understand that this class is not about food history or the food industry. It's more about the social\/political\/economic undertones of food as a physical object and eating as a physical practice\r\n\r\nAnd your writing will improve immensely with Scarlet's help",
    "I would recommend the course to those people who really want the chance to improve skills for more academic writing. The feedback I have received from the course has really given me things to think about and use to improve my writing. It is also good because there are a variety of readings which make the course interesting and allow for many different discussions.",
    "Yes. The essays and one on one scheduled meetings with the professor are designed to improve your writing and are very helpful. Also, the readings and class discussions were interesting and thought-provoking. This course has influenced me to think more critically about the social, political, and racial undertones present in the way food is marketed or prepared."
