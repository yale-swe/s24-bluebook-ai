This class gave me a lot of confidence in solving difficult problems without obvious solutions. This confidence, even more than the skills, will be useful in the future.",
                "This course was an introduction to game theory. From the first day, you start playing games in class. It was such an interesting experience. I had never thought through the theory behind solving games before, so it was very cool to see it in action and pick up tricks on how to analyze different games. I think everyone should take a game theory class at some point in their education!",

                "1. Logical reasoning: this class was incredibly helpful in forcing me to think in ways I have never thought before. To anticipate others' moves, to reason the moves of rational individuals, and to follow lines of thinking that are a bit deeper than our usual gut instincts as individuals. This class also provided insights on decision-making, lines of thinking that could help in making a decision further down the road.",

I was right in the fact that learning game theory was a similar but very different experience to other economics classes. Keeping the math and practical aspects of other economics courses I had taken, this course built on my ability to think critically. I learned how to assess a variety of games, and Professors Polak and Deb taught concepts that I will definitely take into my life, such as backward induction (that you have to start at the last step and move backward to understand how a sequential game will work).",

I learned how to find pure and mixed Nash Equilibria, the distinctions between strong and weak dominance, solving Cournot and Bertrand problems, how to construct subgame perfect equilibria for infinitely repeating games, some material on auctions and best responses in different cases, how to understand and represent information sets in games, the distinction between different types of imperfect information.",

It also allowed me to see how firms and markets might operate when 2 parties are making decisions that affect the other.

            "comments": [
                "Strength is definitely Ben Polak and Joyee Deb. Both great professors that keep you engaged. I'd say a weakness would be that you don't learn a ton. All we did was we were shown different games and learned a few strategies for how to solve these games (finding nash, SPE, backwards induction, etc). I feel like how well you do in this course is contingent on how good of a problem solver you are already.",
                "The strengths of the course are some of the lecture content and the interactive nature of the discussions with Ben and Joyee. The games played in class were also fun but I think there should be more of them to keep engagement high. It was easy for me to lose focus when the topics would get too far into the notation of the problems. I also enjoyed the historical relevance of certain games that were discussed.",
                "Some lecture topics needed more time, some topics much less time.",
                "I didn't love that we didn't get the problem set answers because sometimes we didn't get to all the problems in section after and it made studying for the exams a bit difficult. Also, the problem sets are graded super leniently which is nice but also not because the class is curved and this essentially puts all the weight on the midterm and the final. I liked the games we played in class, it definitely made it more engaging.",
                "One of the strengths is the flipped classroom. Awesome opportunity to see in detail how some of the harder problems on the pset are done. Could be improved by posting pset answers after they are due. They don't post the answers to incentivize office hour/section attendance but becomes super inconvenient when trying to study.",
                "Well taught and fun!",
                "The professors are very engaging and make the class entertaining to listen to. I think my engagement was based on the examples we did with some being very entertaining and others not.",
                "Strengths: super interesting and challenging (but doable) material; great professors; manageable workload; cool real-world applications\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: you have to be pretty engaged to do well -- problem set answers aren't posted (so you have to attend section); and some problem sets will require you to go to office hours \r\n\r\nFor future semesters, it could be nice to host more Zoom sections to improve accessibility.",
                "It was a great course overall. There were a lot of resources available whenever it was needed. The only improvement may be to make sections cover different questions instead of the PSET that was just turned in. Most of the time, students spend the week leading up to the PSET deadline attending office hours and learning how to solve the questions properly. To just do the same thing (review the PSET in section) seems redundant. It would be more helpful to have new questions so that the group can discuss the approach to answering.",
                "Strengths: professors are incredible and approachable and lectures are usually quite interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: the sections were not particularly useful and not mandatory, so I never developed a relationship with a TF. Also, the psets are graded pretty uniformly (most people get full points), so the final and midterm were super high stakes and a bit stressful.",
                "I think this course is taught very well and keeps the students incredibly engaged. The games are taught through class interaction and we learn while doing. I'd say the glaring weakness is the refusal to release problem set solutions.",
                "Strengths--lectures are very engaging. Joyee Deb and Polak are both engaging, and it's nice to have both to get a different perspective. Exams are fair and appropriately difficult.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--the Econ curve and cheating. The midterm was not held in a secure environment (people were allowed to use their phones and people stayed after time). This directly harms you in a course that is graded on a curve (where only 1/6 get As, 2/6 get A-)",
                "Engaging but lots of material that may be overwhelming",
                "Strengths: amazing professors who lectured incredibly well -- providing the content in ways that were clear, concise, and simple. TAs were also equally helpful and dedicated to our sucess. Furthermore, the class was incredibly well organized and the professors were prepared for every situation (especially around COVID and already having backup plans for when things moved online, etc.). \r\nWeaknesses: The problem set grading was a little bit random in my opinion -- I wish there were a rubric as to the point breakdown. But overall, the grading on those problem sets were still fine!",
                "Strengths: Super well-organized, phenomenal content and teaching \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The p-sets are graded on participation, so your grade ends up devolving to just the midterm and final. It would help if the p-sets were graded on correctness.",
                "Both Professors Polak and Deb were great lecturers, and I was excited to come to class every day. For all 75 minutes, we would learn about a game and then how to analyze it, and I found this structure of playing a game and then learning the mechanisms behind it to be very engaging. The problem sets were challenging but interesting, and office hours and sections unpacking the questions allowed me to really understand the material. I thought that I would not like the section format of just going over problem sets, but it was actually very helpful and allowed me to ask any questions that I had. The only weakness is that while I enjoyed both professors, I think that I would have preferred if the class was only taught by one of them, as I find that easier to follow.",
                "strengths\r\n- showing how what we learn applies to real life situations\r\n- having a wealth of office hours and peer tutor hours'\r\n- flipped classroom \r\n\r\nweaknesses\r\n- it doesn't feel like concepts we learn are related until you've finished the course (you're unable to see how ideas build onto each other until you've learned them all, but that's probably just the nature of game theory)\r\n- section would probably be more useful if it went over practice problems similar to the problems on the upcoming pset (instead of just going over the past week's upset)\r\n- posting pset solutions so that we can use them to study",
                "Strengths: flipped classrooms were great for the p sets to get a walk through difficult questions. These were engaging and relieved stress which made it easier to learn the concepts\r\nWeaknesses: I feel there was an inconsistency in lecture delivery between both instructors. One was far more technical in regards to economic concepts whilst the other made it far easier to understand concepts by explaining them using real life examples and demonstrations",
                "Strengths: good professor and peer tutors.\r\nWeaknesses: coverage of game theory concepts moves pretty fast, but sometimes class can be slow and boring. Section is optional to review the pset answers from that week (they're not posted on canvas) but I think I would rather have it be practice exercises for the games from that week.",
                "The lectures were one of the strengths of this class. I was always very engaged by the games and never felt overwhelmed by information. This class obviously lends itself well to hands-on learning, even in a large lecture. I also appreciated the general organization of the class. The professors always had a plan for every week in the class or any change in circumstances. In terms of improvement, I wish the sections had been used for something other than just going over the homework. I felt like doing additional practice problems, especially on more complex topics like asymmetric information or bargaining, would have been a more productive use of the time. Similarly, I think that toward the end of the semester, a lot of concepts were thrown at us, without many opportunities to practice them before the final.",
                "The course was well organized and well taught, but the problem sets were a bit too challenging to do without the help of TAs or peer tutors. Additionally the midterm and  final did not feel like an accurate representation of what we focused on in class, especially with the slight advantage given to econ majors by testing Cournot and Bertrand even though they were not on any practice",
                "Strengths: course organization, professors, responsiveness\r\nWeaknesses: course size (although nothing you can do about that), the psets are not graded very carefully so sometimes you are not sure if you are actually getting everything correct.",
                "This course is very well taught",
                "Polak is an amazing lecturer, but I do wish P-Set solutions were released after the due date in order to help prepare for the midterm and final.",
                "No weakness really.",
                "Strengths: very engaging lectures, managable workload, and really interesting content\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams are ridiculously hard, problem sets also very hard, no feedback given on problem sets unless you go to section",
                "Very well run.",
                "Strengths: very organized and easy to follow format, good pacing of games/serious content, engaging material\r\nWeaknesses: more help on intro macro-based problems would  have been nice",
                "The flipped classroom and the recorded lectures was a strength. It would have been more consistent to have one Professor the whole semester because the teaching styles were different but the slides the same. The exams were often much more difficult than the practices or the problem sets which was a challenge.",
                "Very well taught",
                "The professor(s) are fantastic and the slides and lectures are organized in an extremely intuitive way.",
                "Phenomenal lecturers, but I wish that we received more practice material.",
                "Strengths: great professor, interesting and important concepts\r\nWeaknesses: Problems were often more difficult than the class material",
                "Psets solutions are never posted so hard to know exactly what I did right snd wrong",
                "Both professors are incredible at explaining the material. I also think that the problem sets were very challenging, yet helpful because they ensured our understanding of each topic.",
                "The course was very interesting and the concept it teaches are extremely useful for every field, in my opinion. Because of the wide scope of the course, the class was pretty fast-paced, and you need to be on high alert always to make the most out of the course.",
                "Lectures were very engaging and interesting; office hours were plentiful and always helpful. I don't really know how else it can be improved.",
                "The lecture was extremely engaging. Professor Polak did a great job of making it interactive even with such a large class. I would say a weakness of the course was that lecture was often spent going over specific examples, so it was sometimes difficult to extend the reasoning used in class to the homework assignments since we didnt always explicitly learn the general strategies.",
                "The lectures and slides were very good",
                "Strengths: the lectures are very engaging! Weaknesses: the final was quite hard but doable, its not something you can really cram for though",
                "Great course, just please upload the lecture slides in PDF format and not each slide with one bullet point at a time, it made reviewing lecture notes much more difficult.",
                "I think this course is excellent for what the material is. I have no ideas for how to improve!",
                "the lectures were extremely helpful in learning the content. I think the practical examples of concepts were super important in helping us apply our knowledge. weaknesses: I thought they moved a lot faster in the second half of the semester (after the midterm). some of the things I only fully understood while studying for the final.",
                "This course was engaging and very manageable in terms of workload.",
                "I thought this was an awesome class",
                "This is a very well designed course that has, undoubtedly, been refined to near perfection over the many years it has been offered here at Yale.",
                "Great lecturing. Psets pretty difficult and not actually graded (can't gauge how you are doing); exams went far beyond content taught.",
                "Lectures were engaging and TF sessions were well organized.  Problem sets were challenging and also useful for the comprehension of the material.  There are no real weaknesses to report.",
                "Strengths: Extremely well-organised. Professors are both fantastic lecturers. Problem sets and exams were fair and challenging.\r\nWeaknesses: Would be better off with less focus on QR and more focus on application and modelling. For example, this would have been an incredible class to write a paper in, thinking about a situation or issue in economics, tech, psychology, etc from a game theory lens and figuring out ways it manifests in reality or limitations to your model. Too much focus on QR and problem solving detracts from the main lessons the instructors were trying to impart. I think the lessons would have been way better internalised if I had the chance to write a long paper using the game theory toolbox rather than memorise a bunch of solutions to problems wed done in class.",
                "Strengths: The class was taught really well and concepts were explained well. The flipped classroom also walked us through a challenging version of the concepts we learned. \r\nWeaknesses: They don't post PSET solutions. You have to go to section every week to get a walk through of the PSET questions.",
                "This was a great course. The lectures were very engaging and covered a lot of material while still being understandable. The problem sets were challenging, but there were plenty of resources available for help such as office hours, flipped classrooms, and peer tutors. Discussion sections were optional which was great.",
                "clarity of the materials",
                "Strengths - Great professors. Joyee and Ben are absolutely fantastic, entertaining lecturers and clearly passionate about the subject matter. Psets aren't easy, but are rewarding.\r\nWeaknesses - the second half of the course was hard to follow and more hand-wavey than the first half. As someone who's taken proof math classes, I would have liked to see content be a little more formal.",
                "The concepts were very elusive to me. Connecting the material from class to the problems on psets and other assignments was difficult. If the course had more TFs and more office hours overall, it would have helped me a lot to connect things and understand the material better. It would be nice to release pset solutions too so that students can clearly see how the problems were solved by the graders.",
                "The professors were fantastic.",
                "Strength was definitely Polak. Very great lecturer, knows what he's doing, and makes the class interactive with polls and games. A plus was that he made fun of Harvard students pretty often. Improvement would be getting PSET answers.",
                "The strengths of this course are Polak's expertise in the material and his ability to break it down into bite-sized chunks that anyone with any background in economics could understood. When he taught, it was like the perfect combination of a Ted Talk and a Yale lecture.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course were in Deb's speed (she's a grad school professor so assumes a strong background in economics and familiarity with complex variables etc.), which always made the class more stressful. It felt like a different class from Polak's, and a much less fun and engaging one.",
                "Strength was p sets relevance to the course material. P sets would help tremendously improve my understanding of subjects",
                "The course is weak in that it moves too fast. Several games were to confusing and involved too much depth to be covered in one class. The course was strong because it has a lot of TAs and office hours with a flipped classroom session that offers  many opportunities to get help with difficult concepts.",
                "I think the model of two professors was really hard to follow, quite honestly. I personally wasn't receptive to Professor Deb's lectures and so the days she taught I didn;t understand the material as well. It felt as if she was given the days that were more math based and she didn't do as good of a job explaining the material.",
                "I might be biased by the fact that I thought most of what we covered was quite interesting, but the whole course was a blast. Lectures are chill and I think worth going to, but also recorded, so it wasn't the end of the world if you missed one (and many kids missed all of them). The profs were great, very accommodating, and super helpful with the psets. And the psets were at times legitimately fun! The biggest weakness that jumps out to me was being told that we didn't need a calculator on the midterm, then very much wishing I'd brought a calculatorthat much can be partially attributed to me just being dumb, but it wasn't an issue in the grand scheme of things. Another gripe is my philosophical opposition to curving for a specific grade distribution; I don't think it really interfered with anyone's grade, but who likes the possibility of being curved DOWN? Nobody. Again, it's not like this actually happened, but if everyone studied up real hard it *could* have, which I find dumb. Overall loved the class though and would certainly take it again.",
                "Very structured and great teaching. Professor Deb and Professor Polak are both very good at explaining games and keeping class engaging. \r\nIt would have been helpful to have pdf copies of PSET solutions (although I understand the concern of distributing these digitally) in order to go back and review psets in a more methodical way.",
                "Strengths: The teacher is great to start with. The class looks at a bunch of real life problems and teaches us how to solve them strategically. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The exam problems are usually harder than the ones given in class.",
                "Ben Polak is one of the best teachers Ive had at Yale. His lectures were engaging and fun. However, I didnt find the sections to be useful.",
                "Strengths: excellent professors, interesting content\r\nWeaknesses: they don't give you your score on the final exam before posting your final grade! Also, I felt like sections weren't as useful as they could have been. In the future, it might be better to give out an answer key for the psets and then use the sections to answer students' conceptual questions.",
                "Strengths: Very organized and Professor Polak is an excellent professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes course moves too fast",
                "Polak is a great lecturer but I often felt that the oversimplification of the material lead to difficulty in having rigorous answers for the more involved questions on psets and exams.",
                "This is probably one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The only true weakness I would identify is that the difficulty of the class is very unevenly distributed. The second half is significantly more difficult than the first. \r\nProf. Polak and Prof. Deb are both engaging professors, the PSETs are actually a blast to complete, the exams feel challenging without being impossible. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would like to see improved is the summary files. Some of the topics in the first part of the class had a 2-4 page summary which was uploaded to Canvas (for example ES). However, there were none for the second half, where I felt it would have been significantly more useful. I hope to see this added in future iterations of the course.",
                "Great lectures, really important concepts, fair workload.",
                "Strengths: I really enjoyed the structure of the lessons; how each one tends to introduce a new concept or idea through a game. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the lessons failed to prepare us for the problem sets. Given the nature of the course, it would have been helpful if we had gone through a game that was equally as complex or difficult as the ones that are often given to us as problem sets.",
                "I really like the teaching style of this course. I feel the professors' strategy is more about helping students learn than it is about forcing them to fight for grades.",
                "Strengths: Professor Polak, clear teaching, lots of support during office hours and for exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the co-teaching deal, only having office hours late in the week (right before the psets were due)\r\n\r\nWould also recommend possibly giving an overview of the course at the first lecture. The themes and major skills that we learned took shape over the course of the semester (and I'm sure that if I'd paid more attention to the syllabus they're in there too) but might have made things clearer to give an overall roadmap of which areas we were going to hit over the next few weeks.",
                "This course was absolutely awesome. Both instructors were super engaging during lectures and they kept me wanting to learn more and more. It wouldve been helpful if they could have assigned specific chapters for weekly topics from the non-required books in the course they mentioned to us at the beginning of the year. I found that besides office hours or lectured themselves I used YouTube more than I shouldve for help, and instead it wouldve been nice if professors could have referenced specific chapters to look at the material from. Overall the instructors did a great job.",
                "The strengths of this course was that Professor Polak always kept students on their toes in lecture by asking random students questions which really engaged the class.",
                "Strengths: Polak is a legendary instructor. Has a great sense of humor and his explanations are clear. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish the problem set answers were posted somewhere since the course is designed so that students can only check answer at discussion section. Although I found my discussion section incredibly helpful, sometimes it is too short of a time to get a thorough understanding of all of the problem set questions during the section. It would have been more efficient to have the answers posted online instead. \r\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, the exams for Fall 2021 were comparably a LOT more difficult than other semesters (based on practice exams) to the point that I felt it was an unfair assessment of students. I wish I had taken it another semester, because this was the WORST semester to have taken it, almost to a discouraging point. The exams did not test how well students engaged with class, but really the student's natural ability to think in a specific way to solve games, which is not ideal or accessible. Going to lecture or discussion section does not strongly correlate with how well you do in this class. One problem on the Midterm for Fall 2021 was worded in an unnecessarily confusing way that depended on your ability to decipher difficult and dense English rather than your ability to think critically about a game. Like I just had no idea what the question was asking and how to set up some crazy table based on the information. \r\nMore objectively, I think the class could improve by having clearer English in the problems, because often I would get the answers wrongs because I misunderstood the set up.",
                "Id perhaps enjoy getting more feedback on problem sets or at least knowing what exactly we did wrong.",
                "This course was very well organized. The instructors always came to class prepared, and they were both very kind and receptive to in-class questions from students.",
                "Gloria, one of the peer tutors, is an absolute angel. She's better than any of the TF's (and others agree with me). I stopped going to my section because she did such a good job in her weekly peer tutoring session. Whenever we were confused, she could always make everything clear (somehow) and do so patiently and with a smile. She's also easy to reach by email and puts effort into her email replies. She's everything I could ask for in a peer tutor and was a main reason why I enjoyed the course.\r\n\r\nAnother main reason I enjoyed the course was Professor Polak. He somehow always makes us crack a smile or laugh during class no matter how badly life was going. He also somehow presents material in a way that is clear. Professor Deb's lecture weren't as good, probably because she held us to a higher standard: she expected that we know things and skipped them when we kinda didn't know these things.",
                "Nice to collaborate with friends but exams are so hard",
                "strengths: ppt and instructions are very clear, psets are helpful to understand the concepts, and every lecture is very engaging\r\nweaknesses: DS could be made more engaging, and besides psets, midterm could also be reviewed in sessions. But that's a minor suggestion!",
                "I think the lectures are done very well, and the assignments are useful and very fair. Great communication from the professors.",
                "I enjoyed the content and its application to real life scenarios, however, the power point presentations were a bit confusing and crowded which made the classes harder to follow when reviewing material.\r\n\r\nThe psets were not graded to the full extent. I would get marks off and not receive any feedback as to the reason or how I could improve. Very little notation on graded psets and exams. The answers for assignments/exams were never posted. Never had taken a class with such little feedback/faculty involvement which ruined my motivation for pursuing the class and receiving a letter grade.\r\n\r\nThe professors/content were the only positives.",
                "I like how this course is centered around specific games that often involve real-world examples. This helps make it clear how the content we are learning in class will be relevant to me later in life. The only downside to this approach is that I sometimes became too caught up in the specifics of each game and lost sight of the more general techniques used to analyze them. I also thought that playing the games in class was a fun, engaging, and effective way to engage with the material."

                "Yes if you like analyzing situations in economics and in politics. Very insightful perspectives.",
                "Yes, the instruction and topics were great.",
                "I definitely would recommend this course. I loved it so much but unfortunately I heard the rest of the ECON major does not live up to this course.",
                "I would recommend this to a student with either a soft background in game theory or a strong desire to learn game theory. It was definitely intellectually challenging but as long as you stay engaged in the lecture the course itself isn't too hard. Both professors also did a really good job of making themselves available to meet outside of class time.",
                "Yes! It's a great time.",
                "Take this course if you love theory. I tend to really enjoy theoretical classes like philosophy, micro, etc. and found this course super engaging and genuinely fascinating. That being said, if you only care about the practical side of economics, this course probably won't be very interesting to you.",
                "Yes! It's a whole lot of fun, even if you haven't taken a lot of economics before. It's a pretty challenging class, but fun and rewarding, too.",
                "YES! It is really cool seeing how game theory can be used to solve games. Mind blowing at times. Definitely worth it.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in economics or decision making!",
                "Yes, the class was great and engaging and I definitely learned a lot.",

It covers so many different applications, that without a doubt, something will be interesting to you. Polak is a legend and so is Joyee Deb. Take it!",
                "not really",
                "Yes, absolutely! If you are someone who wants to challenge their way of thinking logically and gain a new perspective on how people's minds work or how you may want to go about making a decision, this is the class for you! It is incredibly challenging but also incredibly rewarding. I was constantly mindblown in the class as I learned about different tactics in different games and the reasoning behind such tactics. Honestly a fun course, though difficult in my opinion! But the challenge was worth the amount I learned, definitely.",
                "Absolutely, it's one of those courses that you have to take in your time at Yale. It's definitely challenging, but you learn a lot and it changes the way you think about the world.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially another economics major. While the problem sets and exams were difficult, I found the material both engaging and practical. If you are willing to put in the work, it is a very applicable course that I think students with any interests should take. It was my favorite class this semester, and I will definitely be recommending it to other students who ask.",
                "YES! If you're interested in political/economic strategy, this course is a must (even though it's a challenge)",
                "Yes this was my favorite (but likely last) economics class. I would highly recommend to anyone even vaguely interested in economics,  but think the concepts are useful to everyone",
                "It depends: I really loved the game theory we did in intermediate micro with types of competition like Cournot, but it was not as fun as that. There are a lot of claims involved in this topic and not as much math as I would like.",
                "Yes! This is one of my favorite courses that I've ever taken at Yale. Ben Polak is such a wonderful lecturer, and I would highly recommend this class to any student, even if you're not an economics major.",
                "Yes, I think students that have not disliked econ classes in class could enjoy this course as its very engaging and the material is very interesting, the only drawback being the tests are quite disheartening.",
                "Yes. If you are interested in thinking rationally or games in general, this game is not only accessible but a lot of fun.",
                "Only if you think youd enjoy the material. Game theory is not as easy as it sounds, quite the opposite in fact",

                "If you're interested in learning more about games, bargaining, repeated interaction, incentive-design etc this is a really fun course. I'd definitely recommend this as a fun Econ elective to Econ majors and it is also just an overall fun course to take regardless of your major.",
                "No, not if you are taking it for an Econ elective. Take only if you are really interested or need it for your major",
                "Yes. A must take course.",
                "Yes, great course",
                "I would if you have a genuine interest or it satisfies a requirement. Polak is a great professor and its interesting but definitely not an easy class",

                "this class is so hard!!! It is interesting, but it is tough. You have to know this going in and be okay with not doing well. I did learn a lot though. Just my grade probably doesn't show that.",
                "Yes",
                "If you are interested in game theory yes",
                "Yes, the professors are incredible. The course itself is very fun. I especially love when we act out different real-life scenarios in class.",
                "Yes, I absolutely would. The content is very interesting to students from almost any background (especially quantitative). Furthermore, the useful applications of game theory make this course a must-take.",

                "Yes - Polak is a beast",
                "This is a challenging but hopefully rewarding course. I was never bored. The first half of the class before the midterm is easier, the second half picks up with the backwards induction. Exams are pretty hard. Maybe the final was so hard because it was switched to Zoom, but I found it to be the hardest final Ive ever taken at Yale.",
                "Yes, the grading is a little harsh because of the curving, but the class is great. Prof. Polak is an amazing lecturer and he definitely knows what he is doing.",

                "Yes.  This is useful knowledge regardless of your field of study, but especially for econ or poli sci.  Learning to think strategically is a skill that you will use everyday in your life.  Ben Polak is an exceptional lecturer with an amazing sense of humor, and if possible I highly recommend taking ECON 159 with him as at least a co-lecturer.  I was recommended to take this course my freshman year by a senior in the econ major, and I have not regretted following her advice.",

                "Yes. Good development of logic skills.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It really made me practice different problem solving techniques. You might not see the solution to the question immediately, but as you play around with it, you get to the solution. The exams were a bit challenging, but very fair. \r\n\r\nAlso, you get a class with Professor Ben Polak. He is an incredible professor who makes the class very engaging. I'm glad he is continuing to teach.",
                "Yes! Great class, the lectures were very fun and engaging. Discussion sections were optional. The psets were somewhat difficult, but there were plenty of office hours/peer tutors available.",
                "Yes! A great course for people of any major (as long as they're comfortable with algebra and a bit of calculus). Very applicable to real life and super interesting content.",
                "Yes. It's a fascinating, albeit quite challenging (at least in my opinion), class",
                "Yes, because of the great professors.",
                "I would. Definitely something new and challenges your thinking. If you want a course to push you intellectually, this would be the one.",
                "Yes! Polak is the best professor I've had at Yale in any department and provided an incredible introduction to applying the stuff we learn in school to the real world through applicable models and fun anecdotes.",
                "Yes, it's a fantastic and interesting course",
                "Yes, Professor Polak is amazing and expands lecture material to the real world",
                "It is really valuable and useful for those people who like thinking about games from a quantitative sense",
                "yes, absolutely - great course for econ or non-econ majors! really interesting topics, and prof. polak is a wonderful lecturer",
                "Yes, it is necessary to know how people will react in situations to benefit themselves",
                "Yes I would.",
                "I would recommend this course to economics students that want to understand game theory and apply some theoretical concepts from microeconomics in hypothetical scenarios.",
                "Yes! the course was really interesting and because it's required for many majors I would highly recommend it.",
                "I thought this class was great! I know some kids felt like it was a challenging course, but the psets and exams were, in my opinion, quite fair, and if you were paying attention in class I don't think they'd have too much of an issue. The best proxy I can think of for how much will you like this course is \"do you like brain teasers?\" I happen to love brain teasers and thought the psets were basically just fun puzzles, but I know some kids hate brain teasers and weren't feeling the psets. All in all though, I'd say take itprofs are great, the work is reasonable, and you learn cool stuff. The class has also been taught for quite a bit, so the whole thing functions like a well oiled machine now. I thought they handled the COVID curveball nicely, and it was cool to have profs that had a plan for a change.",
                "Yes! I had to take it for my major but it's a great class regardless. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.",
                "Yes. If your'e planning on taking an Econ elective, this is the one. You can not come to Yale, and not study Econ 159.",
                "Yes! Ben Polak is amazing and Game theory is very interesting. My favorite branch of economics so far.",
                "I would recommend it. Just know that for people who aren't used to this type of thinking (using mathematics to create precise logical arguments) it might be a bit of a learning curve. But it definitely teaches really interesting stuff",
                "Yes, very interesting class and actually applicable",
                "Yes -- Dr. Polak is an impeccable lecturer, and the course is really fun, although it can be challenging if you do not keep up.",
                "Yes. This is probably as fun a class as you will get in Economics. The PSETs are extremely rewarding to complete without taking up 10+ hrs every week. It teaches great logic fundamentals. The professors are engaging. The weekly flipped classroom gives great insight into how to approach PSET problems. However, quality of the TFs can vary wildly. Sometimes during office hours, they seemed even more clueless than the students about how to approach certain problems.",
                "Yes. Take this course if you are interested in a useful framework for thinking about human interactions.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who has a decent foundation in microeconomic theory and has a good mathematical intuition. Particularly if you're interested in taking a (somewhat) interesting but also challenging QR class.",
                "Yes, I would. You just learn how to think critically and notice the unobvious details.",
                "Yes!\r\n\r\nYou really do learn a lot. Professor Polak clearly enjoys the material and he's a solid lecturer. He also makes a point of acknowledging and trying to help people get past the idea that 'scary math concepts' will stop them from doing well on the exams. I don't think I got the best grade in this class, but I'm still leaving feeling like I've gained some useful lessons. The exams and psets are completely fair, the workload isn't terrible, and you actually learn something. Would recommend.",
                "Absolutely, especially anyone interested in economics for their major. Aside from the topics we learned themselves, it involves a lot of logical thinking that is useful for anything and the problem-solving skills I learned were super helpful.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who want to engage in positions of leadership where hard decisions need to be made.",
                "The ideas we learn in class is very versatile -- the games that were part of the course are applicable to many fields. For example, we discussed rock paper scissors in class and that applies to everyone. Plus, this course counts towards many majors at Yale thus, if Polak is teaching this course, definitely worth considering. \r\nHowever, especially for Fall 2021 I think the exams were much more difficult than anything we did in class. This class leans towards testing your natural ability to solve games-- Going to lecture or discussion section does not strongly correlate with how well you do in this class. \r\nIf you are Cred/D this class, definitely worth taking because the material and instructor are interesting and engaging. As a grade, I do not think it is a fair assessment. I did all of the problem sets, the practice exams, went to every lecture and discussion section and still tested miserably at the exams because they were just testing for the kids who were naturally good at solving logic puzzles. Class and problem sets were just practice, you do not really need to have engaged with them.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking it. Is is somewhat quantitative but doesnt really have any advanced math. Although some problems can be intellectually challenging they are enjoyable to solve and the course teaches you how to approach them efficiently.",
                "I would recommend this class to someone who needs a social science credit, but wants something closer to a quantitative reasoning credit. The style of thinking used in the course is more akin to what you would do in a math class, but fear not. The instructor takes care not to over \"mathematize\" the class so that majors from all backgrounds and take the class (provided you're willing to learn the necessary economics to understand the applications).",
                "Definitely, I think the benefits extend beyond game theory. It's a way of seeing the world differently and learning practical analytical tools applicable to other areas. Probably only good if Professor Polak is teaching. If he isn't, maybe not?",
                "yes only if they need to take the course for their major",
                "Recommend! Although the curve is a bit challenging for non-econ students, you can creditD and enjoy the course. Ben and Joyee are amazing instructors and it's very fun learning with them! The concepts are also very related to daily life and I learned a lot! The psets are hard but there are many helps from Ben, Joyee and TA. Dont worry too much!",
                "Definitely, lots of fun! Polak is an amazing lecturer. The class is a great exercise in really fun thinking about games.",
                "Only if you are truly dedicated to independently learning the material",
                "I would recommend this course to any student, regardless of major. Not only is game theory applicable to a wide array of disciplines, but I also find it an incredibly fun exercise in strategic thinking."
