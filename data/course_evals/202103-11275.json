                "I learned about the debates surrounding the ratification of the Constitution.",
                "Biggest takeaway: Land was absolutely central to people's conception of rights and sovereignty, especially in the writing of the Constitution. I learned how to read secondary sources efficiently and effectively, and I also advanced my historical writing skills.",
                "This course provides an excellent insight into constitution making and the reasons, concepts, and ideas that led to the US Constitution. It covers the Articles of Confederation and the need for the Constitution as well as applying the Constitution to later time periods."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: the readings and topics covered are really well-suited to provide students with a deep understand of the historical context in which the Constitution was formed. Professor Peterson is super passionate and knowledgeable about these topics. Weaknesses: the seminar discussions could have been better. Professor Peterson did at least half of the talking, which made it harder for students to really participate and engage in discussions. There were also a couple students in the class who spoke a ton, which was frustrating for other students who wanted to participate, and Professor Peterson did not do a great job ensuring that the discussion was not dominated by those few loud male voices. The discussions also could have been structured better; I often felt like our discussion went off on tangents and, as a result, there was a good portion of the readings each week that we just didn't touch during discussions.",
                "I think the course was strong, to be completely honest I was simply bored of the topic by the 10th week.",
                "There were days where it was hard for me to stay engaged for the full two hours of the seminar. I think a short break in the middle of the meeting would have been helpful. The content was fascinating once I had a better understanding of it through our discussions. The topics and conversation would always be super interesting when I had the time to dig into and understand the reading, so on weeks where I didn't have the time to dive in, I'd be a little lost.",
                "The reading load for this course is extremely heavy. This often made it difficult to complete the weekly readings while allotting time for other courses as well. The in person seminars were excellent. They remained engaging and allowed for much learning throughout the semester."

            "comments": [
                "If you are interested in developing a deep historical understanding of the constitution and you wouldn't be disappointed at having mediocre and not-super-engaging discussions, then I would recommend this course--I definitely learned a ton from the readings and from Professor Peterson. But if you are someone who prioritizes having enriching discussions where you have a lot of opportunity to engage and participate, I probably wouldn't recommend this course.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student interested in early colonial politics as well as the history of the Constitution. If one isn't interested in that, this class might be too dense.",
                "Absolutely. Professor Peterson is a fantastic teacher and he lights up when he starts talking about colonial Massachusetts. It was so cool to learn about the origins of the ideas that shaped the Constitution, dive into the debates about the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution, and argue about how the Constitution has and should be interpreted. The approach of starting all the way back at the Norman Invasion in 1066 and working our way to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 really pushed my thinking about what a constitution is and how we define rights, liberties, limited government, and national power.",
                "Yes. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Peterson is excellent in class. This course is engaging and informative. It allows for wonderful discussions regarding the Constitution.",
                "Solid course. Peterson really knows his stuff. But, a lot of the conversation in class was focused on figuring out what the texts meant, rather than interpreting them. Still, really valuable class to understand where the Constitution came from."
