                "You learn how to read and analyze some of the best poetry, nonfiction, plays, and more and also write and revise your work.",
                "Overall, I think I learned more about the American canon, and I improved my literary analysis skills. I also had the opportunity to read texts that I don't think I would've been able to outside of this course, which I found to be particularly meaningful.",
                "I developed critical thinking and writing skills, as well as learned how to craft my own question based on a text and then using that to produce an argument that isn't obvious --- creating a more \"fun\" and unique paper.",

                "I think we got a diverse set of readings, some stronger than others. The essays were well-spaced and we had a lot of support from Professor Homans to write them. I think we could have perhaps done more \"lineages\", since we spent a lot of time on the slave narrative and quickly went through a few more near the end, so perhaps the books could be more evenly distributed.",
                "Strengths: Professor Homans facilitates wonderful class discussions and creates an environment in which students feel comfortable and excited to contribute their ideas. The readings she assigns are wonderful, and likewise the essays are a joy to write because she offers us so much freedom to choose our topics and kindly offers extensions if we need them. She offers copious, insightful feedback and encourages students to revise their work, kindly offering to re-read and re-comment and re-grade it. You will really feel like youve grown as a writer and a thinker. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the reading load feels like a lot, but the good news is that you can prioritize certain readings so that you can master them and feel good talking about those in class.",
                "I think Professor Homans did a really great job facilitating group discussions in class, and I believe she offered meaningful insight into the material we covered. Personally, I don't think there were any noticeable weaknesses in how the course was run.",
                "By nature of this class there was a lot of reading and it was quite an eclectic list. However, during class discussions we only touched on like 1\/3 of the content we read, and I feel like the depth of this class is being compromised for breadth. The class is basically discussions and sometimes it drifts away or people just try to throw out as many ideas as possible without sticking to the topic."

                "Yes! While I mainly took this course to fulfill one of my major requirements, I genuinely found this class to be one of my favorites and I definitely learned a lot.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students because it gives you the opportunity to improve your writing while also having the chance to engage with a great and diverse range of texts that have so much to pull from.",
                "I would highly recommend this course for students interested in improving their writing.",
                "Yes if you know you can keep up with the reading and discussions. If you want an easy writing credit, I think there are some classes that don't have this much reading to do.",
