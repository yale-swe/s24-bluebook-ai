                "This course provided fascinating insight not only into the history and politics of ancient times but also into human nature as a whole. The historians we read often seemed just as, if not more, applicable today than ever before.",
                "My writing and reading skills are significantly improved. Ive learned to digest a huge amount of reading in a limited time. Ive also learned to pull out evidence from a dense text to support my thesis. Ive came to know the classics of the Western Canon, how they influence each other, and how they still influence us today.",
                "I learned how to read long, sprawling histories with an eye towards historiographic approach, political philosophy, and theology as opposed to a simple cataloguing of events. I also gained insight into the ancient world, which I did not study in high school.",
                "I learned a lot about how political theory and ideology has developed over the years. Professor Freedman was fantastic at relating all the material covered back to the present day and highlighting strands of thought that have persisted for thousands of years. I also significantly improved my writing skills, specifically learning how to lay out an essay in a way that makes it more analytical and to the point.",
                "I improved upon my ability to read and analyze large amounts of texts in a short amount of time. I gained a lot of knowledge about Greek history and thought and its evolution into Roman and later philosophies.",
                "I learned about ancient history, and more importantly, the framing of it. I also was able to trace political movements from the ancient world to the Middle Ages and understand the (surprisingly many) ways in which those schools of thought manifest today.",
                "I learned how to connect themes and identify commonalities from one period of history to another, and developed critical thinking skills such as identifying the author's tone concerning the history they are writing. I also learned the importance of understanding the context during which a history is written and possible purposes that influence the way the historian writes about certain events or characters. I developed a timeline of the history of antiquity, and I now feel comfortable engaging the political questions that arise from the rise and fall of the Greco-Roman states. Additionally, I learned plenty of conventional wisdom during discussion section, useful for both the study of history and living in the present. I learned about the various types of political organization and the arguments for or against each type. I realized the inextricable nature of politics and history when considering reasons, but also learned the subtle distinctions between the two.",
                "I learned how to analyze texts that I had never had any previous experience with. I also learned how to deal with a rigorous reading and writing schedule. In class, I learned how to collaborate with classmates in seminar and small group discussions.",
                "I learnt how to apply Ancient Greek and Roman thought to more current events, as well as different historical methodologies."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths- The lectures and seminars were amazing, always providing a bridge between the works when they were written and the overall message and how how it could be interpreted today.",
                "I think DS is the best Yale can offer for first-year students interested in the humanities. Although the pace of the program doesnt allow you to go too deep into the material, I found many lectures highly inspiring and most discussion sections extremely fruitful. Overall, DS provides a solid foundation for whatever you hope to pursue later.",
                "I believe that this course's syllabus is too long for it to adequately address each text and place the texts in a fruitful conversation. Further, I wish I had received more guidance about what the professor was looking for in the papers. I wanted to see improvement in my papers, and I am not sure that I did.",
                "Strengths: readings are in chronological order and we read multiple authors from the same period to examine different perspectives.\r\nWeaknesses: the weekly readings are often too long to finish on top of the other two DS courses, which sometimes has bearing on class participation.",
                "The reading is fantastically interesting, and Professor Freedman was simply wonderful at making seminars engaging and pleasurable to attend. On the other hand, the reading load could be a bit much at times, and this meant that it wasn't uncommon for a lot of the class to have not done the readings which meant seminar discussions were of a lower quality. Additionally, having only one week to go through works as seminal as Thucydides or St Augustine meant that the engagement with individual texts was often lower than I would have liked.",
                "Very engaging but a few too many people. It was hard to have discussions and the final exam seemed to contradict the purpose and edict of the program.",
                "Strengths: the readings and class discussions flowed nicely into one another so we got both a historical narrative arc and a wide range of authors with differing political views. Weaknesses: the readings are very long and often tedious. It felt like the \"points\"  we were supposed to get out of each reading could have been understood with much fewer assigned pages.",
                "Strengths of this course are certainly the amount of content covered and number of authors studied. A weakness I felt was a lack of a general timeline for all the events studied. It was hard to try to apply the authors to the larger picture of history, and I felt as if a basic understanding of major events was lost. At times I was confused about how the Roman historians fit into Roman history relative to one another in terms of dates, and many states written about felt like references to me. If possible, I would like more time spent on laying out the events so that the type of studying done feels more complete.",
                "I think the strengths were definitely the teaching style and discussions. Both were engaging and I found myself looking forward to each class. Though, if I were to pick one weakness, I would say that some of the timelining with the Roman historians confused me. I wish I perhaps had a little more guidance when it came to when and where each historian lived and recorded about in relationship to one another. Perhaps that is my own lack of understanding of the text, but I did find myself struggling to situate where each historian fit in with one another timeline wise."

                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was one of the most engaging DS sections.",
                "I would recommend DS wholeheartedly, but ONLY to students who are truly interested in the content itself. If you merely came for your strike of ego (for the admiring look you get from your non-DS peers when you say you are doing DS, and trust me, you do get it), you really dont have to do this to yourself. The workload is not insane. In fact, its pretty expectable and manageable. Still, it is A LOT. If I didnt enjoy the content, I wouldnt have made it through the semester. For H&P, some of the readings are really dense and could get a bit boring at a certain point, such as Tacitus. However, most of the readings are intriguing and enjoyable, and even for the tougher ones, youll gradually find a way to get the most important points out of it. That being said, DS is definitely a highlight of my first semester. Ive enjoyed it so much both inside and outside the classroom. Ive made my best friends in the DS community. Im so glad I chose to take it.",
                "I am not sure if I would recommend the DS History & Politics track to other students. The relevance of our subject mater and the chronological and thematic through-lines felt fuzzy to me. With that said. Dr. Freedman is a passionate and caring professor who created a very pleasant and equitable classroom environment, and I would take more courses with him in the future.",
                "Yes, if you are good at balancing multiple courses with heavy workloads, especially reading wise. Your experience with regards to class discussions and the papers really depends on the professor you get.",
                "Yes, wholeheartedly! The readings are so interesting and the teaching is wonderful. DS serves as a great introduction to the western canon in general, but H&P in particular is just fascinating. You learn how all the classical authors are still so deeply relevant to our culture today, and you begin to see patterns in human nature that have lasted thousands of years.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would recommend DS to anyone interested and actually committed to reading and contributing to discussion. Historical and Political Thought was my favorite DS section. It also helps to anchor the other two tracks of DS by situating them in history. Prof. Freedman was very kind and excited to engage with us.",
                "This course is not possible to be taken without enrollment in the Directed Studies program, which I would recommend if one has a genuine interest in the humanities and enjoys, or is open to enjoying, reading. This course in particular is a great component of the DS program that I feel helps provide conventional knowledge about history of the world and some important skills in engaging in political organization dialogue. I enjoyed it by keeping my schedule otherwise light.",
                "Yes with a caveat. I think if one is to do Directed Studies in general, they must be made aware of the time commitment each text and essay requires.",
                "yes! it teaches you to think more carefully and thoughtfully about things happening around you as part of larger trends and issues rather than individual events"
