                "I learned a complete review of all verb tenses in the French language, oddly specific vocab words, and a cool introduction to French literature and film studies. I learned how to cram for a French test every other week. I drastically improved my speaking ability as all classes are completely conducted in French, and many groups activities ensure that you must speak to your peers in order to get a better understanding of the material you are reading.",
                "I learned various grammatical structures in French (pass compos, imparfait, futur, conditionnel, subjonctif, imperatif, etc), as well as a large amount of vocabulary. I practiced speaking, listening, writing, and reading a lot.",
                "Subjonctif and Conditionnel",
                "I was able to improve my spoken and written french as well as my reading and listening comprehension.",
                "I learned to speak better french and skim read french literature. I can use the subjunctive now.",
                "I really increased my french literacy and speaking skills. I believe I was perfectly placed based on my placement test results to the point where I felt I was challenged enough to make a lot of progress within the course. It was a really supportive environment that motivated me to learn. Overall I really enjoyed this course and it was one of my favorites this semester."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: You will become a better speaker. You will learn lots of vocabulary. You will improve in your understanding of French culture. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are no vocabulary lists, so you literally have to make your own way to study for each test and practically guess at which words are going to be tested and in what way. The weekly quizzes were insanely difficult, and did not teach me anything except that I needed to be nervous if there was going to be a quiz every single time I walked into the classroom. The tests were horrible, because the way they test vocabulary is without giving you a word bank, so you forget the words you were even supposed to be using. Additionally, they make you sit in a large computer room with 30 other students to complete a speaking test, its impossible to hear yourself talk because of the noise of 30 students struggling to speak French. The tests were too frequently, meaning that my teacher often had to leave off material to teach us in class because we did not have enough time to cover it before the next test.",
                "This course is definitely a good way to learn French -- there is a lot of material to process every day so there's never really a break from it, which is (sort of) immersive. For most of the term, I think I probably spent 2-3 hours a night on French homework (I am slow but still). I enjoyed it because I like learning French and becoming more fluent in it, but if you're not sure you like French, this is probably not the class for you. Specific strengths are how much we talk in class and the personal writing feedback -- it's super helpful to becoming more comfortable and confident in the language. One weakness is that a lot of the grammar audio programs are kind of confusing and hard to follow at first. Sometimes they're impossibly fast (like they ask you the question and then give you like two seconds to respond out loud and write the answer down...) and sometimes they're frustratingly slow. They're also occasionally inaccurate.  I think one thing that could really improve this course is if the audio programs were all standardized.",
                "There is an unnecessarily heavy volume of homework. I couldnt focus on my other classes sometimes because of it.",
                "I am not quite sure how beneficial the daily homework worksheets were. At times they seemed helpful (usually when they explained topics and rules) but other times they seemed like busywork. However, I believe they were helpful to look back on in preparation for exams. Also, when being tested on vocabulary on the quizzes and actual tests, I do not really know how well that format of testing works. I believe that the majority of students study the vocabulary and can easily give their meaning in French and English and even use them in a sentence. However, this is when we are given\/give a word. Usually, when tested, we are asked to come up with the correct term to complete the sentence which can prove to be quite difficult because I believe it comes to a question of memorization rather than comprehension. It more tests our memorization of the 70+ words we have been assigned. It becomes hard to \"pull\" out a word from this large bank that we cannot really go through one by one in our minds. Also, at times, many of the students are at different places and levels of french knowledge and may already be familiar with a large portion of the \"new\" vocabulary material so when asked to pull from this list, it is hard to differentiate to if a word is one you already use frequently or if it was an actual vocab word. Although, these are very small weaknesses that do not really take away from the overall effectiveness of the course. The immersion that this class had was phenomenal. It created the perfect environment to feel comfortable speaking in and making mistakes in. Every lesson was very engaging from start to finish. I loved the fact that it also really pushed our reading comprehension skills with its great selection of readings and movies."

However, if you are born into a naturally French speaking family or if French is your best subject, absolutely take this course. This course favors students who have a natural predisposition for the language, and leave students behind who struggle or need extra time to grasp concepts.",
