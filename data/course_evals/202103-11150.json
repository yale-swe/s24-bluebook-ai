                "More about the culture of some** countries ion Latin America. You aren't going to learn everything about everywhere. Also, most of it is oriented at historical stuff. Do not expect to learn about more modern-day cultural aspects of let's say Argentina or Peru.",
                "I learned a lot about the mix of indigenous and european cultures that came to define what we know as Latin American culture. I think also I grew in how I read and understand Spanish text since most of the works we looked at were pretty old.",
                "Learned more about speaking and writing in Spanish. Insights into the development of latin American cultures from colonization onwards. Interesting discussions about periods in latin american art and thought.",
                "Learned more about Latin American culture through viewing ancient maps, artwork, and writings. We also watched movies and other videos in the class.",
                "I learned a lot about Latin American cultures that I had never thought possible! Exploring Latin America and its history was very insightful to the patterns that have existed for centuries in how societies have interacted and changed. We also learned to make StoryMaps, which I felt was very helpful for future courses and other projects that will involve making these.",
                "I gained knowledge about Latin American cultures (Mesoamerican, Andean, Caribbean, etc.), important Latin American authors and their work, and Latin American history.",
                "I learned a lot about Latin American culture and the influence that colonialism has played, dating back to the 15th century into the present day.",
                "I learned so much regarding how to interpret key Spanish literature, monuments, paintings, and poems to help me learn more about Latin American culture. Not to mention Professor Voigt is an incredible professor and makes class so enjoyable despite it being content heavy at times. Overall, it was such a great experience!",
                "I learned a lot about how Spanish colonialism changed the way of life in early Incan and Aztec cultures and how unjust the Spanish treated the natives which is not often represented accurately in media.",
                "I gained a base level of knowledge of the history, culture, and politics of several Latin American countries.",
                "I really improved my speaking, research, and writing especially.",
                "I learned a lot about the colonization of Latin America and the effect that Colonization had on local cultures. I also got a lot better at writing papers in spanish and doing analysis in spanish",
                "I learned about Latin American culture of different regions in Latin America through learning about art and literature.",
                "In taking this course, I got to dive deep into the rich history of the Latin American region and develop a thorough understanding of how the region's demographics and traditions came to be. I learned how to analyze a region's cultural makeup both spatially and temporally. Additionally, I was able to discover a new medium of displaying information as the class worked somewhat heavily on the ArcGIS StoryMaps website which allowed us to take our peers through a sort of digital tour of a region we were pre-assigned. Finally, it should go without saying that the course is taught in Spanish as it is categorized as an L5, but I was able to further my Spanish-speaking skills as both the required readings and the major writing assignments were in Spanish as well.",
                "Familiarity with texts and major figures in Latin American history, often related to colonialism.",
                "I learned about the history of European colonization in Latin America and how that influenced the culture back then and now."

                "The course is somewhere in between a seminar and a lecture: meaning that it was just a bit weird at times getting the \"flow\" of the conversation.",
                "Strengths: optional to talk in class, writing and speaking components every day, not understanding a text was okay\r\nWeaknesses: not a lot of collaboration or discussion with classmates",
                "Sometimes felt a little disjointed moving from one thinker to the next, but this was not always the case. Not a lot of opportunity for smaller group discussions, was more call and response with the professor instead. The short papers we wrote actually felt like a really helpful opportunity to analyze some of the writing and films we had watched. b",
                "Strength: manageable workload, structure of class was easy to follow, using StoryMaps\r\nWeakness: structure of class did not add much to learning",
                "Professor Voigt and our TF Esteban were very open to feedback and were willing to adjust some of the course to foster my participation. Overall, the class is very engaging and I always found a way to participate in some way. There were a variety of projects in the class (commentaries, essays, StoryMaps) which made it interesting to approach the content in different ways. There was also open communication about what was expected of us in the class, which is very much appreciated.",
                "One of this course's strengths is that all students are expected to have selected a quote\/passage from a reading before the day that it is discussed in class, so everyone comes to class with something to share in mind, which promotes lively discussion.",
                "The course content was very interesting and it was set up by geographic region which made the information palpable. I wish, however, that there was more group work and discussion in the class, and it was less lecture style.",
                "Professor Voigt and Esteban were absolutely incredible there is nothing I can complain about!",
                "There was what felt like a long stretch of long readings in the middle of this course that could have benefited from switching up the type of sources, or alotting a longer time to read.",
                "The strength could be improved by limiting enrollment to 12-18 students. We had at least 25 members of the class, which made it difficult to have very deep, engaging discussions with input from every member of the class.",
                "I really enjoyed the variety of sources we looked at, the only thing that I would have changed was downsizing the class to allow for more active discussion.",
                "Strengths was the fact that most of the works we read were primary sources which I really liked! Weakness was not that much conversation in class, and the different chapters of the class felt unconnected or a little separated instead of fluidly combined.",
                "I think a strength was the texts we read. They were really good sources and very interesting to read. They gave a good insight into Latin American culture. I think a weakness was how classes were approached. I think picking a quote and waiting for your turn to share your thoughts about it had good intentions but sometimes wasnt beneficial for learning bc sometimes we would say the same things someone else said. I think another weakness was the immense amount of work that had to be done for the final assignment. I feel like it should be cut down to a presentation or an essay, not both.",
                "The course really does live up to its name by providing those who take it with a thorough understanding of the different cultures within the Latin American region. One of the best strengths of the course was highlighting the complex relationship that exists between the people of the region as the Europeans became integrated into the region. It is this very aspect that makes the class a very good fit for any prospective Latin American Studies majors. Another major strength of the course was the writing-oriented structure which allowed my peers and I to fully engage with the course's content as opposed to using assessments which would allow us to merely memorize facts and figures and forget them shortly after. One of the weaknesses of the course (in my personal opinion of course) is the limited use of alternative media (anything besides readings) as the Latin American region has an expansive network of films and music that recounts the history that has played out within this region and we instead focused a great deal on written first place accounts (which though effective at teaching could have been enriched by analyzing other arts).",
                "Strengths: manageable workload, variety of topics, flexible (often options to participate in person or via discussion posts) \r\nWeaknesses: work was piled up at the end. We had just 2 essays all semester, and then in the last 2 or so weeks we had a project, presentation, reflection on the presentation, and 2 essays at once.",
                "This course is a good survey of the major cultures of Latin America, but I think students would benefit from a deeper diver into some cultures rather than quickly touching upon all cultures."

                "YES!, Prof Voigt and TF Esteban created a safe environment for learning, and they did a great job of incorporating a lot of different types of primary sources into the reading list. Classes can get boring at times, but it's a fine trade-off given that the workload is really straightforward and meant for you to explore topics in Latin American cultures. The group project ended up being a fun way to get to know people and learn about our assigned geographical areas.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course! I had a wonderful experience overall and it was helpful in balancing some of my other courses.",

                "I would, I liked the seminar-style and topic",
                "I would definitely recommend, it was fascinating subject material and the professor was so encouraging and welcoming to the differing levels of Spanish in the class.",
                "Yes! If you are looking for a laid back but still interesting L5 spanish class, I would recommend this class. It was not too hard but I still learned stuff. I will say it was very much you get out what you put in. It was easy to not pay attention in class if you didn't want to, in which case you'd learn less. But if you paid attention i definitely learned stuff.",
                "If youre willing to put a lot of effort towards the end, yes. But if not, no. But the class is really interesting because of the texts that we read.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. At the very least, this class is an engaging way to obtain a language credit if you place into the L5 category of the Spanish language. However, the course is especially great for Latine students who seek to learn more about how their cultures and heritage came to be.",
                "Yes, its a relatively low pressure L5 Spanish class.",
                "Would recommend if youre looking to fulfill the L5 language requirement, but beware of the workload. The workload is deceptively high because the readings are dense."
