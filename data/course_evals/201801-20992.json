    "I love how self-directed this project was, it was one of my favorite things that I've done at Yale so far! I felt like I was able to incorporate so many of the skills I'd learned throughout all my classes.",
    "I learned a great deal about the scientific process and the challenges of conducting research independently. I gained the organizational skills needed to organize a full scientific project and make it robust in its methods. This was a very good experience to have since I would like to pursue a research-based career in the future."

    "It would have been nice to meet with my advisor a few more times to understand what he wanted from me, and it would have been helpful to get some of the project expectations (i.e. deadlines) a bit sooner. I felt like the poster was a cool takeaway, but I'd never made a poster before and felt like I got absolutely zero guidance on this one, besides one example from a previous year. This left me very little room to innovate and make it my own because I had no idea where the boundaries were, so I felt like it was very difficult to come up with anything other than a slightly worse version of the example we were given. This could have been solved by working with my advisor more on it, but he never even gave me feedback on the version I sent him and asked for feedback on so I feel this is a little unrealistic. Instead, I wish there were more materials or guidelines available to everyone on how to do this.",
    "Desiree was a fantastic adviser - very helpful, made time to meet with me when I needed it despite her incredibly busy schedule, and very patient and unassuming about my (limited) past experience and knowledge. Another strength of this \"course\" was that I was lucky to have a great group of grad students from Desiree's lab supporting me. They helped me organize my work and showed me certain techniques that I needed to use, and they were also very nice to stay in the lab with me for all the hours I needed to work. I don't think there are any weaknesses to the senior thesis in this department; it's the perfect combination of actual rigorous science and flexibility both to set up the experience to fit into your senior year the way you want and to pursue whatever topic interests you the most - that freedom was very, very nice to have."

    "This is the best way to do the ENVE senior project, hands down. Don't stress about it, as long as you have everything by the deadlines set things will work out.",
    "Yes, I mean any senior will have to do a senior thesis, and I definitely recommend this course over the classroom-based join ChemE-EnveE course... I see no advantages to taking that other course - it's high work load and it's not directly relevant to or even fundamentally designed for us EnvE majors (I heard it's all ChemE stuff). You can pursue something you're interested in and learn a lot about it by doing the independent project, so I would definitely recommend that.",
    "I would 1000x recommend doing the senior project over taking Chemical Engineering Process Design. It is a huge amount of work, but you get to delve into a project that you're interested in, and there is a lot more flexibility in terms of how you pace the completion of it, especially since you can start in either the fall or spring (note that if you start in the spring though that doing experiments over the course of a few months can be challenging time-wise).  Completing my project was a wonderful experience, and it was a great capstone to my education as an environmental engineer."
