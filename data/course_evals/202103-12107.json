                "Knowledge of major theories of business ethics, landmark supreme court cases related to business, and major constitutional arguments and theories. Learned how to apply all of these to each other.",
                "Learned how to apply ethical perspectives to legal issues, as well as different ways to approach complicated legal questions.",
                "I gained a deeper understanding of how constitutional law applies to business practices, from antitrust to discriminatory businesses practices. I also developed my understanding of a variety of ethical theories and how to apply them to case law.",
                "I have a better grasp of the interplay between politics, laws, and business ethics than ever before. Prof. Collins did a good job of fairly presenting both positive and negative ethical implications from an objective and and unbiased position. He was friendly and welcoming to all opinions while helping students to dialectically engage with the material.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Collins is a really thoughtful professor, and the course is very well planned as far as content and assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The discussion style is a little bit slow at times; it may change for future versions of the course, but I didn't always like the way we had to put our names in a \"queue\" to speak. Many times, once it was your turn to speak the conversation had taken a completely different turn such that your planned comment was irrelevant.",
                "The content was usually fascinating, but some weeks were definitely boring. Also, the format was sort of half lecture, half seminar, but the seminar was structured around people raising their hands at the beginning of class, so we often didn't really get to respond to each other. More repsonses/spontaineity \r\nin our conversations would've been awesome.",
                "Strengths: readings were engaging and not too long; class discussion was incredibly informative and interesting; Prof. Collins was approachable and eager to discuss class topics",
                "The strengths of this course are the readings. I thought that other than the week on corporate personhood all the readings were interesting and encouraged me to think about a range of issues. That said, there seemed to be an overrepresentation of libertarian-leaning secondary readings and the primary ethical theories we engaged with were all part of the western tradition so a greater political diversity would have been appreciated. I also enjoyed the way the discussions were structured as they gave students time to prepare their verbal responses to sometimes tricky questions and they occasionally involved some great debates.",
                "Strengths: Good inter-student engagement, insightful reading assignments, fair presentation of controversial topics by instructor, and the conversation was guided in productive directions. \r\nWeaknesses: Reading responses were the least effective means of incentivizing students to do all of the assigned readings because they only required one to have completed a single reading at the time of posting. On the other hand, quizzes required one to have done all the readings beforehand. That said, reading responses allowed me to manage my time better because I could do the reading response and then do other pressing assignments before going back to finish the readings at my leisure.",
                "It mostly leaned on the side of legal readings over ethics, but a great class nonetheless"

            "comments": [
                "If you have interest in Con Law and ethical discussions about the role of government in regulating private business -- then yes! Be aware the course name is a tad deceiving -- the focus for the bulk of the semester falls less on what businesses should do ethically, and more on the ethics of governments regulating those businesses.",
                "I would recommend to most students who are intrigued by the term business ethics or want to learn about constitutional law without taking a huge class. Pretty reasonable workload, though sometimes the questions are a bit tough to answer.",
                "Yes, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in ethics, business, and/or the law.",
                "If you are interested in exploring the ethical implications of the legal cases on the syllabus, yes. It's an overall enjoyable class and I learned a lot about constitutional law as it pertains to business activities. If you already have a deep understanding of constitutional law and jurisprudence then you might not find this course the most engaging, although the ethical angle does provide an interesting lens from which to engage with the cases.",
                "I would absolutely recommend it because it offers useful inter-disciplinary practices. Most courses at Yale are so specialized they are difficult to cross-apply to other disciplines, this course was not. Furthermore, the instructor is passionate about the material and highly responsive to students--he gave me around 130 comments on my midterm paper alone! The combinatory effect between the professor and the course material makes this course a challenging intellectual exercise.",
                "Absolutely. This is by far one of the most engaging and informative courses that I have taken during my time at Yale.",
                "Yes if youre interested in the material."
