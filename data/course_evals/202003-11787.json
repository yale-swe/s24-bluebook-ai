                "A lot of the class is dedicated to microscopic models of metals, insulators, and semiconductors, in varying levels of complexity. Some are simple and phenomenological, some require context from spin-orbit coupling, statistical mechanics (in very little depth, don't worry), and the idea of symmetry breaking. It was a really interesting elaboration on a lot of topics covered in undergrad quantum mechanics, and now I understand things like the origins of magnetism, why materials have band gaps, why gold is gold, why minerals are different colors, and why physicists are obsessed with graphene.\r\n\r\nWe talked extensively about quasiparticles and collective excitations in solids, such as phonons, plasmons, and excitons. If you're an undergraduate who just took quantum mechanics, this is the first time you'll be exposed to these ideas. I learned a lot about how these excitations behave in solid materials, and how we can use them to describe phenomena such as phase transitions, conductivity in metals, carrier density in semiconductors, etc."

                "I think the lecture slides in this course were a big plus, and it was well-laid out with a very clear framework carrying us from the start of the semester to the end. I think the rigor of the class matched with student abilities well, and many of Yu's explanations for solid-state models helped clarify questions I didn't know I had about E&M or quantum mechanics. The problem sets posed really interesting questions, which I could generally approach without too much anxiety. However, the problem set sessions were very often necessary to clarify what assignments were asking, and I think a lot of questions could've been a bit more detailed about what the responses should look like. I also wish that we had spent a little longer solidifying our understanding of k-space at the start of the semester. I have studied Fourier analysis before, but I still struggled to get an intuitive sense of why we were using k-space as a tool for plotting reciprocal lattices or to integrate energy states."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to an undergrad who was concurrently taking quantum mechanics 2, understood fourier analysis, and had some baseline understanding of thermodynamics. I was able to succeed without having taken statistical mechanics. Particularly, I think this course was a really interesting extension of many ideas we covered in quantum mechanics. It answered questions I hoped would get answered in quantum mechanics that weren't (where does magnetism in materials come from, how do electrons behave in real systems much larger than the hydrogen atom, why is everyone always talking about semiconductors)."
