These are invaluable skills that I will carry with me for the rest of my time at Yale and beyond."

                "The class was great. We got really good practice and feedback, and it was very engaging. There was a lot of participation and it was a welcoming and warm environment. There weren't too many weaknesses other than that it was 3:15 minutes long, but that was unavoidable.",
                "The strength of this course is that it is extremely encouraging and inspiring. The course creates a friendly environment where students help each other reach their individual goals.",
                "Strengths: Professor Morrison is a phenomenal instructor. The close-knit, small seminar environment is very conducive to learning a lot in a short period (the goal of a summer session class). Weakness: This class should *not* meet for 3.5 hours straight, twice a week. It was very hard to focus for such a sustained period, and in a class that involves constant engagement and performance, I did not find this format productive. Three 2-hour blocks each week would have been much better.",
                "Prof Morrison is amazing and tried to keep the course as interactive as possible - however, of course, it is probably better to conduct a public speaking course in person (although that could not be helped). \r\n\r\nAnother strength was actually the size of the class, the smaller size meant we received particular feedback and were engaged with our classmates."
