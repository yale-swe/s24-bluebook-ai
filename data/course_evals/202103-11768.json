                "Through taking this course, I developed a genuine love and appreciation for writing, one that I did not have before. I always wanted to get into reading modern essays, but before this course, I never made a point in beginning to sift through the genre. The essays that Rachel chose were all diverse in essayists, style, and topic which made it clear to me how there is no specific way to write or be a writer. The only boundaries are what you create for yourself.",
                "Writing",
                "We read a range of wonderful essays this semester, many by authors I had never heard of before but am so glad to have read. Through these readings, we learned and developed strategies to craft effective prose in our own work. This course (and Rachel specifically!) has made me realize that good writing takes practice and thought, but that anyone can be a writer.",
                "I learned so much about what writing could be. Especially non-fiction writing. I learned that I am the authoritative voice on what is and what is not allowed in my writing. And I learned how to look at other writing styles and readings and how to use the aspects of those styles that I like. I also learned that writing is revising.",
                "Skills in close reading of non fiction texts, personal essay writing, seminar discussion format, providing helpful peer feedback",
                "I have never written a non-academic essay for a class before, and this class has been the best possible introduction. I gained knowledge of a wide range of different writers and styles, and learnt how to implement their styles and techniques in my own writing.",
                "ENGL 120 is one of my favorite classes this semester. Through reading and writing essays on 5 different topics, I explored them deeply and also discovered more about myself. My writing skills have also improved through the process.",
                "This course places a strong emphasis on honing in on your unique voice as a writer through the personal essay. I learned to value short and long-form essay writing that captured the emotive truths of its authors lived experiences and witnessing. I learned to love drafts and move away from expecting my first attempt to be anywhere near the final product. Mostly, I learned to write with clarity, heart and conviction.",
                "I learned about different types of writing, both how to produce my own works and how they are part of the modern world. Before this course, I had never thought of myself as a writer. \r\nI learned about vulnerability in writing: how it is used to make a piece powerful, relatable and honest. I was brave enough to BE vulnerable and saw the impact that had on my writing and its audience. \r\nI learned about different techniques used to evoke certain emotions from the reader and portray a specific image, such as omission, exaggeration, defamiliarization, specific uses of punctuation, admitting doubt, leaving the ending without a \"bow\"."

            "comments": [
                "I don't feel like there is any weakness in this course. Rachel is such an attentive and perceptive teacher, who successfully made the class environment one where everyone felt comfortable to share things that they might not have otherwise. I didn't particularly enjoy our workshop discussion classes, but I know that other students did, and they were necessary and helpful when it came down to it. Whether you need an extension, more direction/clarity, or assistance in anyway (related to the class or not), Rachel was so easy and welcoming to go to.",
                "Fun topics and a lot of freedom are good. Sometimes unexciting readings are not so good.",
                "The units are well designed and strategically placed. However, the experience within each unit varies depending on which pieces your prof. chooses for that essay.",
                "The essays we read, the professor, the workshops, and the feedback on our work were all great! The only weakness of this course for me was that the schedule for turning in our essays was sometimes a little strange or inconvenient. I think it might make more sense to have essays due on class days (when possible), instead of days between classes.",
                "(Prof. Rachel Kauder Nalebuff, section 14, fall 2021) I really liked the pace of the course. A lot of my stem-oriented friends thought the amount of reading and writing seemed scary, but I enjoyed all of it. The readings never felt long at all because they were so interesting and well-written. The class workshop seems intimidating but it was one of my favorite parts. We started doing in-class writing exercises toward the end of the semester which was amazing, so I wish we had started those sooner.",
                "The strengths of this course include the workshops where your writing is discussed by peers, the discussion format, in-class writing assignments and excellent professor feedback. No weaknesses.",
                "I think this is a very good choice of a course should you choose to engage with it fully, do the readings and think about how they should impact your writing.",
                "Strengths: 1) Rachel is definitely the highlight of this course. She is a wonderful instructor - she is very knowledgeable, nice, and encouraging. I especially appreciate her way of teaching because class discussions are never limited to content of the readings; Rachel tries to let us learn from the readings and apply those techniques to our own writing. 2) Although this course involves quite a lot of writing, I think it is amazing that we get to explore 5 different topics. 3) It is wonderful to workshop different classmates' essays. I feel that I learned as much from their writings as I did from course readings. Additionally, I think Rachel developed an effective workshop mechanism! 4) In the last unit (Humor), Rachel invited 2 guest speakers to join us, which also added light to the course experience.\r\n\r\nHow the course might be improved: Maybe invite one guest speaker in the Culture Commentary unit as well?",
                "The wide range in essay themes, diverse mix of writers in our readings and collaborative and communal nature of this course are all exceptional strengths. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
                "A huge strength of this course was the peer feedback. My piece that was workshopped by everyone was the strongest of the pieces I wrote for the class. I would even take it a step further: what if for each draft, you could get one or two classmates to give feedback on it? \r\nSomething that was a bit complicated was the submission process of our pieces on Canvas. The Collaboration feature worked fine until we had to submit multiple drafts, and keep the edits from the past drafts. Just a minor inconvenience, but the process could be streamlined. \r\nThe structure of roughly an essay a week was a strength. The pieces we read usually gave interesting examples that reflected the unit we were in (even if I personally didn't connect with a piece, I could see why Rachel chose it). \r\nSometimes, our class was very quiet. People could have talked more when discussing the readings. This was not Rachel's fault, but perhaps instead of letting us sit in silence for so long (because for a bit is very useful), she could break us off more in pairs / small groups and then ask us to share. Sometimes, she lingered on topics that were saturated and it was time to move on to other things. \r\nOverall: way more strengths than weaknesses."

                "I would 100% recommend taking Eng 120, especially with Rachel! If you want a teacher that genuinely cares about you as a student and a person, want a teacher who gives helpful, encouraging feedback pertaining to your essay in particular, and is in every way understanding of your life and responsibilities outside of the course, choose Rachel as a teacher! This course in general, though, helped me so much as a writer and made the act of writing much less intimidating and hard to grasp. Even if I don't pursue writing the conventional sense of the word, I will still take writing with me and my newfound love of modern essays.",
                "Yes--super great class to explore what writing means to you!",
                "Yes! Whether you're an prospective English/Creative writing major or simply looking to satisfy a writing credit, this course has something for everyone. Choose your prof wisely, though. They largely determine the experience.",
                "Yes! Take English 120 and take it with Rachel if you can. This was the perfect introduction to college English classes for me. You will learn so much and really enjoy the course. This is the class I miss most from first semester.",
                "I would highly recommend this course. This really was groundbreaking in how I view writing. Rachel is a wonderful professor whose classes were fun to go to, and whose readings were always amazing. I was exposed to so many different styles, techniques, and modes of writing. I feel like reading \"Several Short Sentences About Writing\" while taking this class unplugged me from my Matrix wire. This class and that book unplugged me from how I was previously taught that I was not the authority in my own writing. I highly recommend this class, and Rachel as a professor, if you are able to get her section.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to write in a non-academic setting! It was challenging but so enjoyable and at the end of the course you have a collection of polished essays. Wonderful class",
                "I would recommend this course to any student willing to engage with it. I think it serves both students who want to get a writing credit and those who plan on using this course as a stepping stone to more intensive writing courses, especially thanks to the opportunity to write and receive feedback on a draft for each essay.",
                "Absolutely! And I highly recommend Rachel's section. Rachel is a knowledgable and encouraging instructor, and as a writer and editor, she has developed her own views on reading and writing.",
                "I would absolutely continue to recommend this course to other students. This class was a pivotal experience for me as someone who loves writing but has often shied away from writing about myself in a medium that I end up sharing out to others. After taking this course, I began openly sharing my writing about vulnerable experiences and reflections with close friends and classmates in a way that I now will undoubtedly continue to do. It reaffirmed my love for creative writing and yearning for a community of writers who were looking out for each other, while still encouraging one another's growth.",
                "YES. If you can get Rachel as your teacher, take this course. The readings she chooses are super interesting. She takes into account your feedback and is happy to help you grow & develop as a writer & a person in any way she can. As a STEM kid and someone that didn't think she was creative in the traditional sense, I can confidently say that this course is so much fun, and will hugely improve your writing."
