                "Strengths: Prof. Chen is very knowledgeable, and has some interesting and funny anecdotes about China and other professors in financial econometrics. A wide-range of topics were covered in this course.",
                "Prof Chen's class is really unique. It is more like a graduate level seminar, where students exchange thoughts and give presentations. There are only five students in total, so I have many opportunities to talk to and work with my peers. I like the format a lot, but I also understand this might not be ideal to other students. \r\nThe prof is really smart. The topics covered are quite advanced for undergraduates sometimes (mostly based on Prof's own research projects) and it is a bit hard to follow a whole lecture. However, I learned a lot from the assignments, presentation and the term paper, where I looked into the theoretical models and did applications myself.",
                "Strengths: there were some mathematical parts that were perhaps too advanced for me, but I enjoyed being exposed to the more rigorous elements even if I did not fully understand. I also enjoyed the student presentation and final project. I think I learned a lot from preparing these as they allowed me to gain a more thorough understanding of one or two topics. Also, the professor clearly excels in research and it is always interesting to hear her ideas about research. Weaknesses: I sometimes found the lectures to be hard to follow. I appreciated when the professor wrote on the board to supplement the slideshow presentation--perhaps the lectures could benefit from more of this."

                "I would recommend to those who truly, seriously want to learn more about econometrics and have strong background in either mathematics or statistics. The prerequisite is intermediate metrics, but it actually assumes some knowledge in stochastic process. I would also encourage people interested in this course to shop the first few classes, have a general idea of Prof Chen's teaching style, and see whether this class would be a good fit.",
                "I would recommend if the student is looking for a survey course in financial time series econometrics. As someone unfamiliar with this area I enjoyed learning a little bit about many different topics, opposed to a lot about one or two topics. If the student likes the more technical side of econometrics, I think they are likely to find the course enjoyable."
