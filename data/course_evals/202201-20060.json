                "I learned a lot about Africa as a continent, and the current issues facing it. Furthermore, I developed my understanding of the anthropological discipline, and how it has emerged through interaction with the African continent, as well as the problematic aspects and how we can seek to mitigate them as anthropologists.",
                "Broader understanding of the diversity and intersectionality in Africa, the remnants of colonialism, ability to discuss higher level material in a group setting.",
                "It was a great intro to African Studies. Loved the readings and sometimes the personalization of the syllabus according to interests of the students.",
                "I left this course with a deeper understanding of how systems of power and identities are constructed, how they facilitate and influence interpersonal relationships, and how they fall apart. I truly loved this course so much; I have never really explored anthropology before and feel like I learned so much from it. The readings are really interesting, and valuable--with broad connections to other regions of the world, other historical patterns/themes, etc. I definitely learned how to think critically about how people interact and what those interactions are a reflection of--e.g. colonialism's impact.",
                "I learned about the category of \"Africa\", its history, its present, and its future, through the lens of anthropology.",
                "I learned about the history of colonialism in Africa and how it has affected Africans today in terms of subjects like race, gender, and money.",
                "Increased breadth of knowledge related to scholarship on Anthropology on Africa.",
                "Learning how to comprehensively explain my point of view.",
                "This was my first anthropology course and so for me it was an introduction to the discipline. That it focused on Africa, my research area, meant that I was able to explore African politics and history from a different (anthropological) perspective, and get a sense of the history, major works and thinkers, and politics/ethics of anthropology in Africa."

                "I really thought that the reading responses were great, in helping us develop on our understandings of the readings. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the final project format, as it helped me develop audio editing skills, which I previously did not have. In addition to this, the recommendation letters were helpful, and showed tht the instructor cares about our holistic development.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lombard is amazing at facilitating discussion. Readings are always applicable. Great discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is a bit long since it's only once a week. Readings can be quite long.",
                "Strengths: guest speakers! They're all great, and it's really interesting to hear from the people you've read or watched the work of. Another strength is the other students in the class--I loved hearing about people's experiences living in different African countries and comparing politics / understandings of race, gender, etc. between them. Professor Lombard is also great--explicates every theme super well and always has a connection to point to after students speak, whether it be a recommended text, or another similar example, or just a question to think about. Her knowledge of anthropology and Africa is really gratifying to learn from. Also, the reading is really really rewarding to complete--Professor Lombard assigns a variety of different types of reading (academic papers, fiction, journalism, even some movies) so you get a varied feel of writing/thinking about Africa that comes from a variety of approaches. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many. I think that we sometimes didn't have a chance to get to discuss all the readings in a week, which was a bummer, so maybe worth sacrificing some texts from the syllabus to purposefully focus more on others.",
                "Strengths: Professor Lombard is so knowledgable, she is a resource and a point of connection for all students, regardless of their specific interests within the topics discussed in class. Fun class assignments that allow for real connection between classmates. Anthropology is a really wonderful discipline to study Africa from, the ethnographic method is a refreshing departure from the tendency in other social science disciplines to come to conclusions based on preconceived, often euro-centric ideas.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Like any course, especially on a region like Africa, there could always be more time to discuss the nuances of all the authors we read. Some of them do seem to have a euro-centric lens and while Prof Lombard often called them out, and we problematized these notions in class, it is always something that students may want to spend more time addressing.",
                "It's a seminar, so it really depends on how engaged everyone is with the course.",
                "Strengths: Interesting variety of resources and materials\r\nWeaknesses: Instructor sometimes veered off syllabus and made multiple changes to syllabus throughout the course, which posed some accessibility issues.  Some materials on the syllabus were therefore not available through the library, the bookstore, or online. Sometimes this course felt like an odd lecture series, and did not incorporate as much discussion as I was expecting for its listing as a high level seminar.",
                "Strengths: Incredibly engaging and insightful. I found myself learning a tonne from my colleagues. Everyone came to the class with their own knowledge bases and that was amazing to be a part of.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses, I didn't connect with as many students as I wanted to.",
                "The course is an excellent introduction to the political anthropology of Africa. The material is fascinating and Professor Lombard is a wonderful teacher. Big, interesting ideas and concepts are presented and discussed in accessible ways, and the classroom environment is warm and intellectually stimulating. I enjoyed the assignments. My only suggestion would be that perhaps in future one of the assignments could be related to the final essay or project e.g. a research question memo or annotated bibliography. That would help students to start thinking and working on their final essays/projects earlier."

                "I would, especially for those who are looking to do an African-focused capstone, as the course gives a wide exposure.",
                "If you're interested in Africa--yes! Just be aware that the readings can be very long (and at some points dry). If you aren't much of a reader, this can be difficult! Definitely use a text to speech website to help (after Adobe to convert readings into PDFs with readable text).",
                "Yes, for intro to anthropology and African studies.",
                "Yes, definitely. Even if you are not an anthropology major (like me) or haven't engaged with the discipline much before, it's such an interesting course and provides a really valuable lens to view African politics through. I loved it.",
                "Absolutely, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. The assignments for class are really innovative and fun, they allow students to connect with the material in novel ways that often center their connections with another.  And Prof Lombard really is so wonderful and available to all of her students. Content-wise, you will definitely get a lot from this class, but perhaps more importantly you are likely to build strong community with your classmates and Professor Lombard.",
                "I feel like the course was a lot of reading, and the readings weren't always what we in the seminar were really interested in so it was hard to discuss them in class. I think the intention of the class was to make the class readings and discussions tuned to what we were all interested in, but we never really gave that feedback or guidance, so it ended up being a lot of random things that we sort of had to adjust to and discuss.",
                "Depends on the student. I would not recommend this to a student attempting to engage in in-depth discussion and analysis on topics related to Africa. The structure and activities of the class are not as focused on that topic.",
                "Absolutely! I think students should take this course to just learn the nuances of human life and interaction. Often we can get siloed in particular bodies of knowledge. I implore people to expand their view and make the commitment.",
                "Yes, I highly recommend this course. It's an excellent introduction to the political anthropology of Africa and Professor Lombard is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale."
