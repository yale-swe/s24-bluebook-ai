            "comments": [
                "The strengths of this course are the texts that we read and the means of engaging with them. I loved how after reading some of the texts we also got to engage with art of the text and even visit the Yale Art Gallery and Beinecke Museum to look at works of art and old italian texts. I also thought that the format of having students prepare presentations of the material made it more interesting. Lastly, I think that an improvement in this course could be more focus on individual texts. I feel as though some texts we did not spend enough time on them getting into the intricacies and focused more on the surface-level content.",
                "Strengths: wide variety of literary styles, Simona's lecture style is interesting and understandable, not too demanding workload\r\nWeaknesses: the course is not focused on learning new Italian vocabulary or grammatical forms so if you want to improve your Italian, you'll have to work hard and really put your brain to the texts to figure out exactly what each sentence means and why it is written the way it is.",
                "Strengths: covered a wide breadth of material, always had English translations available. \r\nWeaknesses: too many presentations, I think one per person would have been enough. No one really paid any attention during them.",
                "The course distill the content very well and covers just the right ammonta of material. I appreciated the opportunities to speak and present as well.",
                "Overall a great course! Sometimes it feels that we move from work to work too quickly and dont really get enough time to interrogate it. Its possible that it would be better to shorten syllabus so we can study the works in depth more.  And maybe it would be better to have students give 1 presentation during the semester instead of 2 since the presentations really ate up a lot of the class discussion time.",
                "Honestly, I can't really think of many weaknesses.  Simona is a wonderful instructor and the class environment is very welcoming and warm.  The course is intense in some ways, but manageable if you put in the work.",
                "Not a lot of time was dedicated to learning about certain authors in depth but it was effective to learn about different literary movements, I think the course would have been better though if we spent more time analyzing fewer authors and their works."

                "I think that I would recommend this course to another student - that is if they are interested in reading old italian literature.",
                "Yes, I would. The writing is beautiful and it is fascinating to view themes of love, morality, the role of government, gender and conflict through a medieval lens. I think everyone in our class found an author that they were captivated by. The Italian is difficult though, and you will probably learn more if you are using English translations as well, which can be frustrating. Still, Simona chose a great selection of literature and her lectures helped me digest the important themes from them.",
                "Absolutely! Especially if you're looking to get the Italian certificate, it's a great way to continue improving your Italian skills.",

                "Yes! Italian is such a beautiful language and its literature is so amazing- if you have taken Italian through L4 this is a great class to take to continue improving your skills in the Italian language.",
                "Absolutely!  The material is interesting and your Italian will get better, and Simona is just a wonderful person.",
                "Yes, the professor is very knowledgeable and interested in the subject and you get to read many interesting selected pieces from the Italian literary canon.",
                "I would, its a fun way to learn about Italian literature and practice Italian at a high level."
