                "prof meyers is very nice. i learned a lot of new techniques that i had no experience in before the course, but now feel very confident applying them. my only improvement- my only little thing is that instructions were not always clear - for the final project requirements and for the weekly problem set questions. another strength was the ta, carly, who was very helpful",
                "Strengths: Professor Meyers is super knowledgeable and wants you to succeed. If you're interested in the content, will learn a lot. Final paper where you find your own data to analyze is rewarding. Weakness: high workload (weekly you have to read and answer questions about a neuroscience paper and do a pset), midterm, time consuming final paper. Mix of grad and undergrads in the seminar so if you're an undergrad, can feel overwhelming \/ intimidating. Basically no guidance for final project. Not a lot of clarity about grading \/ hard to know where you sit in the class.",
                "As this was the first time the course was being offered, it was a little hard to know what to expect sometimes (in terms of midterm difficulty, final expectations, etc.). That being said, the class was still really well organized and enjoyable.",
                "Strengths- learning about very niche topics in neuroscience\r\nI hope for the future, the course can include more on the coding packages that focus in on specific topics rather than broadly trying to cover everything",
                "Practical and important methods in this field. Inspiring guest lectures. Engaging usual lectures and assignments aligned with weekly readings.",
                "Courseload was manageable and material was interesting. Final project guidelines were incredibly vague; there were barely any.",
                "Strengths: Wide coverage of material, interesting balance between statistics and neuroscience, engaging (yet not too hard) problem sets, final project instead of final exam\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A little bit of a learning curve if you don't know that much about neuroscience, but not too steep",
                "It is a great course. The feedback is always on time."

                "Yes, if you're interested in the subject. You should probably only take this class if you are an S&DS major or have experience in R. It's also really helpful to have some background \/ understanding of neuroscience. Don't take the class expecting an easy elective. It's not an extremely hard elective, and it's a seminar which makes it easier to talk to Professor Meyers and stay engaged, but there easier electives and you do have to consistently dedicate time each week to do well.",
                "Yes, as an engaging S&DS elective for thre major.",

                "Yes. The topics in this course are actually not only for neural data analysis. When applied with care, those methods are suitable for other kinds of data.",
                "Yes, very reasonable and interesting elective. Interesting application of data science methods that are learned in other lower-level courses.",
                "Definitely!! Yale doesn't really have a lot of classes in the S&DS department that allow you to apply statistical methods to a specific subject in detail. Taking this class is a really unique opportunity to see how statistics and data science can drive research in a completely different field. Prof. Meyers does an amazing job showing you how multifaceted the brain can be and how analyzing data from the brain can yield some pretty critical insights. You learn a LOT in the class, and it's one of the best structured (and most interesting) classes I've ever taken. Plus, unlike most S&DS classes, you are pretty much guaranteed to do well if you put in the work as the midterm, problem sets, and final project were pretty fair. Overall, best class in the department so definitely take it if you can!",
                "Yes, it offers updated and practical methods about the field of computational neuroscience.",
