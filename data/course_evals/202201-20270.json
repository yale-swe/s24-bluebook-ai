We did a lot of close readings of passages and learned to analyze them through specific lenses, with regards to feelings, information, etc.",

                "This class was great. The material was awesome. Sometimes, the class format of discussion-lecture got repetitive by the end of class. I think it could be improved by meeting for only 50 minutes instead of 75 minutes.",
                "strengths- each class was very engaging and the discussion was fun \r\n\r\nweaknesses- felt like only the same people were willing to engage in class\r\n\r\ncould be improved by breaking into groups to discuss things kinda like how we do in section,",
                "This class was listed as a lecture when in reality it was more of a constant class discussion. The class was definitely set up for student learning and participation, I just wish it wasn't listed as simply a lecture course.  \r\n\r\nstrengths: section was always very helpful with Jorge, love the content in class and consistently found it engaging.",
                "Strengths: Prof Ferguson and the TAs were so great! They actually just want to you to learn and engage with the material and care less about structured grades and stuff. They are very understanding and flexible and the material is so interesting. Our class had great conversations and Prof Ferguson would tell us really cool stories about his life. \r\n\r\nWeakness: not a big thing but I think it would be helpful to more structure to our assignments, like a rubric or something",
                "The readings are very interesting and manageable; there isn't much work outside of class, and Dr. Ferguson is really engaging. I think it would be cooler if we could have more discussions between students so it would be more of a seminar format than a mini lecture.",
                "I genuinely cannot think of any weaknesses. It is an absolutely amazing course and I'm so thankful I was able to get a spot in it. The workload is manageable, every single lecture is incredibly engaging, class discussions were always helpful for better understanding the material, the readings were interesting, participation was accessible (often giving us a moment to gather our thoughts before we had to speak more), and I learned so much!! \r\n\r\nI've been lucky enough to have taken a lot of great classes at Yale but I think this is the first time I've been able to mark a class as excellent with absolutely no hesitation.",
                "i loved the readings and info but i felt there could have been less of a focus on close reading and more broad discussion",
                "The course has extremely interesting content and a great teaching staff. The course load is also not very difficult, and we read a lot of the passages together in class so its not very overwhelming. I really was pushed out of my comfort zone and enjoyed the content. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course is that you arent held very accountable, so its important to motivate yourself to turn everything in on time.",
                "Strengths: Professor Ferguson and the TAs genuinely want you to learn and make class very low stress and engaging to participate in. The assignments for this course are also incredibly easy and build up to your final project. The final project is also an assignment that shouldnt take long to complete because youve worked on it all semester.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses!",
                "This class would be amazing as a seminar instead of a lecture. However, the small size of the lecture made it seminar-adjacent, which I think is a huge strength of the class. Prof Ferguson allows each class to run on student input, but every input is followed by his knowledge as he expands the idea someone introduces. It is so obvious how knowledgeable he is, and I love so much how he helps me learn by introducing me to concepts he is an expert on.",
                "Strengths: Prof Ferguson is awesome, TA Kevin is awesome, the assignments very helpfully cumulate to the final project, well balanced workload, super interesting class discussions and readings, excellent project feedback from Kevin. Extremely welcoming and supportive learning environment. Prof Ferguson literally just espouses wisdom that I am grateful to listen to during the entire class. When we did two weeks of virtual classes, anytime I had to use the washroom I would bring my laptop with me and sit it outside the bathroom door so I could keep listening and not miss one word of Prof Ferguson's lecture.",
                "This is an excellent course. The strengths are certainly the vibrant in-class discussions as well as the welcoming and collaborative environment. I think one thing that could be improved slightly is the clarity factor- it was sometimes vague what our assignments were. I also think if the class were organized into themed units that would be helpful to connect parts of the class."

                "1000%!!! I marked this course as relatively less coursework than other Yale classes--not because it doesn't give enough work, but because other classes I've taken have given too much work and we've kind of just had to accept that as the normal. This class understands that true learning is not simply about how many papers you have to turn in or how many readings you have to do. This class allows you to engage profoundly with each reading, making every single moment a learning experience. Assignments and class discussions ask you to think critically and to think creatively. Professor Ferguson and the TFs are so knowledgeable and they create such a welcoming learning environment. HIGHLY recommend this class, even if (and honestly, *especially if*) you have no prior knowledge on the subject--complex topics are made accessible and it's genuinely an engaging course.",

If youre queer or want to learn more about queer history in the U.S., I definitely recommend this class. If you also need a low workload class thats interesting, I highly recommend! This was one of my favorite classes I took this semester.",
                "yes!!!!!",
                "Absolutely. I'm grateful I took this class before taking a WGSS (or other subject) seminar because it helped me begin to feel comfortable voicing my thoughts and opinions. This class made me feel valued but it also kept me aware of how much I had yet to learn. It made me feel excited to engage with these new topics.",
                "Absolutely.",
                "I really enjoyed this class. The environment is very laid back but also I learned a great deal about queer and trans social movements. I think we need more courses like this at Yale, that really allow students to learn and be creative without worrying about needlessly competitive academics."
