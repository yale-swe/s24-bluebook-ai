                "Great introduction to a wide range of current cutting edge global economic research",
                "We discussed various modern economics-relevant topics in class. I also learned a lot about (and went more in depth on) specific topics through writing the op-ed and final paper, as well as by listening to what other interesting things people in class were writing about.",
                "This course is a perfect way to engage in deep, intellectual conversations about important economic topics of a wide variety. Professor is such an intelligent and unique mind so engaging with him in this style of a course really gets you thinking deeply.",
                "I learned to think through economic problems on a much higher level than I was used to from previous economics courses. I also got to brainstorm solutions to these problems which felt very rewarding.",
                "One of the most insightful courses I've ever taken. This course breaks down macroeconomic topics in a unique way but first starting with very basic almost childlike questions, that eventually are extrapolated on with examples included to explain these large complex macroeconomic concepts. The professor is extremely skilled at making econ accessible and breaking down concepts starting with their application, not the term itself. Also one of the most engaging courses I've ever taken where it's never been easier to participate in an econ seminar.",
                "Learned a lot about different topics in economics. Also learned to overcomplicate things less and simplify concepts more to see what real underlying issues may be.",
                "Many economic takes on current issues ranging from China to COVID to unemployment and back. Insights include generally having a better understanding of the complex forces at work and understanding things in a deeper way than introductory or even intermediate macro would get you. Also, lots of great people to meet in the course of the class.",
                "I developed insights across a broad range of topics in \"domestic\" and international economics.",
                "Applied macroeconomics! This course was basically one huge conversation about what's going on in the world and how economists study the events of the world. We talked about anything and everything since economics is intertwined in so much all around us."

                "It felt like almost every question Professor Tsyvinski asked always had some extremely specific answer in mind, and there wasn't really any room for student-to-student discussion since Professor Tsyvinski always had full control over where the conversation would go. More of a discussion would have been appreciated. Otherwise, this course might as well have just been a lecture.",
                "It is a discussion based class, and the course content builds on the professor's and everyone else's contributions. It is very engaging and interesting. Not much weaknesses.",
                "This course was very engaging and interesting, but it sometimes felt that the syllabus readings did not go along with what we discussed in class",
                "Strength: the format. The class felt like a discussion on interesting economics topics (and beyond), which I totally enjoyed!",
                "The strengths are Professor Tsyvinski and his facilitation of discussion and pushing everyone to participate without feeling singled out or humiliated for getting an answer wrong. Its also the professors ability to really push our thinking beyond the strict theory related to a topic. \r\n\r\nOne thing that some may consider a weakness that I personally did not find to be a weakness is that the course assignments were not extremely challenging and the course was not stressful.",
                "I loved how conversational this course is and how open-minded the professor is about the answers students provide. Something that can be improved is a bit more feedback on the final essay or guidance on how to write a good economic paper.",
                "No weaknesses to the course, only strengths. Course will expand your view of macroeconomics and challenge what you know about government and markets.",
                "Strengths: everything, Aleh is so funny nice and cool\r\nWeaknesses: none",
                "Strengths - Prof. Tsyvinski! He is a fantastic lecturer. He's clearly very passionate about the subject matter, tries to get us to think in new ways, is super flexible, and has awesome stories to tell.\r\nWeaknesses - nothing extraordinary.",
                "This course could maybe be improved by having more structure\/some slides to follow, but in general flexibility was one of the great strengths and one of my favorite things about the course.",
                "Strengths: Professor Tsyvinski made sure to talk about timely topics so class was always interesting! I also appreciated that the assignments in the class were not overwhelming at all. There were just two paper assignments and we chose what we wanted to write about so it was interesting in that sense as well. Professor also encourages us to think about economics more philosophically, not just in terms of numbers. He tries to push us and the field of economics to think about marginalized people more as well as consider consequences on a more personal level instead of just the overarching \"we need to hurt some people for the greater good\" mindset. \r\nWeaknesses: Professor Tsyvinski frames things in a very quantitative sense which is helpful but not the whole story. We shouldn't always be considering the costs of things in terms of money -- that is a limited way of thinking. There are more qualitative costs to things as well and there are harmful systems in place that the field of economics perpetuates. Things aren't always conducive to numbers and I don't think this course, and economics in general, takes that into consideration enough."

Frankly, this class is also a lot less stressful than other ones which can allow you to learn the material at a rate which is good for you. It's also a great non-curved Econ credit.",
                "Yes!  Great course!",
                "I would recommend this course to other students! I am in the ER&M major and still had a good time in this course as Professor Tsyvinski allowed all of us to bring our background knowledge and differing perspectives to class. There is not math involved in this course -- just talking -- and it's so enjoyable. It doesn't even feel like a course. It just feels like a group conversation every week. Professor Tsyvinski is so chill and so knowledgable about everything. He knows so much about ongoing and past economics research, always giving us interesting facts. He is also very understanding about our wellbeing. He always emphasizes that he doesn't want this course to be stressful for us, like other Yale courses are. He wants this course to be different and it is."
