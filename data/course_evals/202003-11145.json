                "I appreciated the comfortable and chill learning environment that was cultivated by prof. r and the TAs and freedom and flexibility we enjoyed with the assignments. Given the amazing readings and concepts we engaged with, it was clear that the instructor prioritized genuine knowledge acquisition and reflection compared to those that prioritize grades and unrealistic forms of evolution. Getting to hear from Beth RIchie and Gail Lewis when they came to our class was also phenomenal. Loved the freedom we had in crafting our final projects as well!",
                "Professor Ferguson's mini-lectures at the beginnings of each class, the TFs and their wonderfully led small group discussions and contributions, and the readings were definitely great strengths of the class. Our class, while big, was pretty quiet, so sometimes class discussions were a little quiet.",
                "strengths: content, syllabus, Prof. Ferguson; weaknesses: none",
                "Professor Ferguson was a great lecturer, but our class discussions were quite lacking. I think there were too many people on zoom for people to feel safe actually speaking up.",
                "Professor Ferguson is wonderful and has a nice way of expanding on students' comments and bringing out new ideas. The TAs were all very engaged and engaging. For the short writing assignments, I would have preferred to make more extended connections between the texts and cultural\/political phenomena, instead of doing vague creative thinking exercises.",
                "Strengths: The readings are beautiful and stretch your mind and heart to places of deeper consideration.  All seminars had a lecture component to it which helped in recapping our readings and catching folks up if they weren't able to complete readings\/if the content was difficult to understand. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: being online is rough. Also, more conversational prompts could've helped small group discussion. We did a group activity the last week, however, that was nice.",
                "All around great professor\/TAs. Great discussion and modes of thinking. The class itself just refused to engage, except for a few which to me spoke to the broader Yale culture expectation to only speak if it will be profound or correct. This class does not call for that, which is a plus. The class would've been so much better if people felt comfortable being wrong or not performing",
                "NO WEAKNESSES\r\nan amazing course\r\nactually amazing",
                "Strength: amazing readings, wonderful professors and tfs, really thoughtful discussions. Weaknesses: none.",
                "I loved the way the class practiced what it thought, in leaving room for creativity and nonacademic language. I also really enjoyed hearing from theorists themselves! In terms of weaknesses, I think maybe including more texts like Assata, that are less academicy and get down to communicating the lives of Black women. I also think it may have been helpful to have gotten more distinct due dates for assignments in the beginning of the semester, sometimes it got overwhelming when several were piled on students out of the blue.",
                "No weaknesses, a truly spectacular class.",
                "I loved the discussion sections. They were so useful, especially because after our main class I was often still confused on some parts of the readings. Professor Ferguson was immensely helpful in making the course accessible and enjoyable for us all. We had guest speakers, which was always amazing because we got to learn from original Black feminists. I think that the breakout rooms could have been better during the main class, but that's mainly because it was easy to not involve yourself in them.",
                "Professor Ferguson and the TAs were extremely caring and they did a very good job of facilitating conversations.",

                "No weaknesses it was awesome.",
                "The course is organized well and the content is interesting. Professor Ferguson and all the TFs are fantastic, perhaps in the future the course could offer more opportunities for students to create a classroom community so therefore conversation would flow more easily (maybe through short social activities throughout the semester or opportunites for breakout rooms for students to talk about material w\/o TF oversight)."

The style of teaching was effective, but some weeks were more lecture than seminar and I think that led to students not feeling as comfortable to share and discuss in a seminar style. The class might have been too big for that to be able to happen effectively this year, but it is a consideration moving forward."
