   "comments": [
    "I gained the ability to discuss various forms of comedy (stand-up, sitcom, digital content, minstrelsy, film, etc.) within a broader social\/historical context in which I could identify the mechanisms of race underlying different types of humor.",
    "I am really, really happy I took this class. Not only do you get to learn from an amazing professor, but you develop a closeness with the people in the seminar. One of the things we learned about in this class is the power of laughing. For example, when we laugh at something and someone else does not find the object of humor funny, we feel attacked and vulnerable. It was really interesting learning about the different forms of humor and asking myself constantly when reading\/watching the assigned materials \"why am I laughing?\"",
    "a deeper understanding of the ways in which comedy and race represent similar contradictions in american culture!",
    "Learned a great deal about the intersection of race and comedy in U.S. history and in the present. My close-reading skills definitely improved",
    "How to close read stand-up comedy specials, memes. How to analyze jokes more closely and not get \"offended\" over the material but rather place it in historical context. Theories of humor, race, and how the two are inseparable. How to do a 30-minute presentation.",
    "I was exposed to comedians and academic papers concerning comedy that I have never been exposed to before. This class really has an academic focus, and allowed me to write a final essay on a topic I was passionate about based on what I was exposed to all year.",
    "I learned how to think about comedy and cultural production through the lens of race and power.",
    "This course focused specifically on comedic form - throughout the class, we learned to analyze how comedians present before an audience. This class entirely changed my perspective on comedy as an art form. The class successfully placed contemporary comedy in a timeline of performances related to race; Laguna did a wonderful job of proving how modern comedy can always be historicized. Overall, I learned how popular culture (like comedy) is just as significant as high-brow cultural production at articulating societal ills.",
    "We learned about the intersection between comedic performance and race \/ theory of race.",
    "Over the course of the semester, I developed a progressively more nuanced appreciation of how both comedy and race work in America. Through a combination of theory readings and comedic material, I came to better understand how comedians of all forms can use race as a vehicle for humor, and to analyzed the complex work that such an implementation of race entails - this can be both productive and harmful. Long story short, I came away from this course with a more critical eye for comedy and the relationship between race and humor.",
    "I learned a lot from taking this course.  It is the kind of course which leaves you with more questions than answers, but that is definitely a good thing.  By the end, you wind up asking much deeper and richer questions than you came in with at the beginning.  I enjoyed the sweeping focus on various different forms of comedy in connection to race, and this made the class more interesting and engaging than I had been expecting, even though I already had high expectations.  The class was well driven by Professor Laguna to ensure we touched on a variety of different topics, mediums and time periods in a way I found to be a positive and enjoyable learning environment."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course would be well served by a few weeks at the beginning of the semester where students only study frameworks of comedic cultural theory and how to go about analyzing different comedic forms. Watching the standup specials along with sitcoms, cartoons, books, movies etc was very fun, but I didn't feel like I came away with the tools necessary to really delve into the mechanisms by which comedy operates.  Granted, this may just be more of a result of the field of ludic cultural studies which still is less developed than say, a history class. This lack of literature made the final paper an intellectual challenge because there was less to draw from but also wildly fun because there was ample room to contribute to the field and say something new.",
    "The strengths of this class is the professor (who is super engaging and almost like a cool uncle figure) and the assigned material. If there were any weaknesses of the class, I would say that it has to do with the final paper. I would have liked to have more information about what he expected for the final paper. It was rather open-ended and pretty much just has to relate to race and comedy. However, while this may be a weakness for some, it is a strength for another as it allows you the most opportunity to explore something of your interests. At the end of the day, I appreciated that the class was really focused on our growth in the understanding of race and comedy and not so much focused on our grades and competition.",
    "This was my favorite class so I have nothing, lol",
    "Strengths: This course was so well organized. Every week the material built on top of each other nicely. We covered so many aspects of humor that I didn't originally think to include (like sitcoms). The reading list was amazingly curated, the comedic material fit the readings nicely, this course actually challenged me on so many aspects of race and comedy that I thought I knew. Professor Laguna is an amazing professor and you should try to take a class with him no matter the subject matter. I will remember this class even after Yale. \r\nWeaknesses: Increasing the presentation time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes as it seems we all had trouble staying in the time slot.",
    "The course's main strength is that it was really based around class discussion. Comedy is something that really does require participation, and with the right topic and with high engagement this class really challenged us to think about comedy in different ways.",
    "The course had a strong theoretical framework in analyzing race as structurally the same as comedy. There was a wide variety of material from a wide variety of perspectives and contexts. Discussion sometimes meandered into tangents that werent always productive. It would be helpful to have readings about historical context, particularly with a lot of the late 20th century pieces. I didnt always have a strong grasp in where the comedians fit into their contemporary context.",
    "This course has only strengths. The readings and accompanying films were engaging and interesting. Laguna was an incredible discussion leader, always offering to meet with students for extra help. Weekly response questions helped students to truly engage with the material prior to class.",
    "The major strength of this course was the breadth of material. I would have liked to go a little more into depth into some of the particular units, though.",
    "Strengths: the topic, obviously. Laguna is also fantastic and given that this is his research focus, really engages students and forces critical thinking. The selection of readings and comedic material were nicely interwoven.\r\nWeaknesses: I think lumping theory readings together in the same week without any grounding material was a mistake. Class discussions flowed best when the readings had a mix of theory and material to apply that theory to. For some reason, the hype of the class dulled in the last month or so. I think this was due to the lumping of sitcom presentations, which made the last few weeks feel a bit uninvolved from a discussion standpoint. If possible, I would spread these out over the course of the semester.",
    "I think this is an excellent course.  It was the most fun course I took all semester, and I always came out of class with more questions, thoughts and observations than when I entered, which I think is the sign of a good course.  It touches on many different aspects with regards to race and comedy, from the good and positive to the bad, ugly and offensive which I think made the course more interesting and gave it more breadth.  It focused on many different mediums, time periods and conversations, something I think was also very positive.  In general, I thought the syllabus was great and very well assembled, and the class discussion always went very well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely - if you're someone who engages with or performs comedy, you will greatly benefit from understanding the 'why' and 'how' behind different kinds of jokes. You will also become familiar with a broader historical context that has framed the evolution of what is considered funny throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.",
    "Take this course if you appreciate creativity in academic writing and are ok with a more freeform class where it's sometimes hard to nail down exactly how the readings are interacting with the primary cultural objects you're consuming. Stay away from this class if you are someone who needs academic structure and learns through understanding practical applications of theory. I think I fell more into the second category but also I'm a taurus.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! I am a senior now and this is my first class with Laguna. He is great and one of the best professors I have ever had. He is really involved with the work and really open to giving feedback during office hours. I really hope other people get a chance to take this class in the future as it is one that has cultivated many crucial analytical tools.",
    "Please take this class if you get in. Laguna is great and he goes over so much info\/has introduced us to a great deal of comedic and racial history I have never been aware of",
    "If you can get into this class, take it. This class was so fun yet challenging at the same time. I never felt like I was really doing homework in it because the readings and other material we watched were so incredibly interesting. Best class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes! If you want to be exposed to more comedians and academic ways of thinking about comedy.",
    "If youre interested in viewing comedy and race more structurally then yes. The class requires a deep level of analysis that I found rewarding but others could find onerous.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student! This has been one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The material was challenging and really pushed students out of their comfort zones. I always looked forward to class discussions and interacting with my peers. I really enjoyed the flexibility of the final project; we were able to dive deep into topics that interested each of us on a personal level. Loved this class!",
    "I would! It's a fun class.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Obviously a cool topic, but if you engage meaningfully there's so much room for critical thinking and to really parse out how racial formation intersects with comedy in a lot of interesting and often nefarious ways. One of those classes that really encourages you to interrogate many aspects of American culture, beyond simply comedic performance.",
    "This class is very engaging and often, funny. The readings are super enjoyable and interesting. Professor Laguna is super cool and fun, and he values the perspectives of the students in the class. However, the conversations could be recycled because the same questions were unresolved week and week. The class only involved one week on women in comedy which reinforces a patriarchal system of comedy. I understand that these men are \"legends of comedy,\" but there should be a diversity of readings within weeks. The class would benefit from more thoughtful engagement and assignments about the topics each students. Despite my qualms, the class was pretty enjoyable and fun to go to each week, but unfulfilling in an overall intellectual growth experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you can hustle your way in.  If you are interested in talking about race and popular culture, and how race is operative and operating in similar ways to how comedy itself is working, this is a great course to take.  It focuses on a bunch of different mediums, from standup to films, from written comedic work to sitcoms.  This was super interesting and fun throughout the semester.  It also did not shy away from the difficult or hard to discuss, something necessary in disciplines such as American Studies or ER&M.  The weekly responses are not bad and allow you to think more about the reading.  Definitely a course you should take if you are an ER&M, American Studies or other similar majors!"
