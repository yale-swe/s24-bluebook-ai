We were provided with no history of context, only specific passages and ideas. This made the course more personally relevant to everyone, but makes me feel like I didn't learn much.",

Beyond this knowledge, I improved my abilities to engage in rigorous analysis of texts and to discuss this analysis with others.

This course has made me more aware of discrepancies between what I claim matters to me and what I prioritize in my actions!",

                "Strengths--really thought-provoking and the best part of the course was thinking through your own vision of a life worth living at the end. Weaknesses- a lot of reading and wish that I had a bit more of a foundational knowledge on the religions/traditions we learned about. A lecture on the foundation of religion before diving into complicated texts would be nice.",
                "It's hard to judge the course by my experience because my section was not the optimal iteration of this course -- there were too many students and we were not able to go on the retreat which is said to be an important part of the course. It often felt like a shoddily-constructed introduction to world religions class, which is not what it was intended to be. It was fun to analyze my own life, and I find myself thinking about what I wrote in the three papers for the course.",
                "I think the readings could be much be made simpler and more accessible. Some were pretty tough to read and make sense of.",
                "At times it felt a little disorganized. I think the content is interesting but it was not executed to the level I would have liked.",
                "I believe one of the greatest strengths of this course is the readings- even independent of the class discussions these proved very valuable and interesting. I felt that the discussions were at times limiting. We may have been able to get more value out of these readings if conversations were able to focus on what most drew our attention.  The plenary sessions were fantastic, and some were definitely my favorite class meetings.",
                "The conversations were really good and I thought the readings were fairly interesting. I think our class was a little large which made participating in conversations a little difficult.",

                "The course structure was very repetitive (readings followed by discussion of those readings every class), which lowered the overall engagement of the class as the time went on. I found that many students were not doing the readings, leading to discussions that were tangential to the readings at best."

I had initially thought because he had taught the course many times before he would be a better professor than most of the other professors, but I think he lacked the engagement that some of the other professors had (only really from the plenary lectures).",

If you are interested in better understanding your own priorities and goals, it is also valuable. I noticed a genuine change in how I view my life and my actions and how I discuss those choices with others.",
