Up to you whether you see that as a strength or weakness. \r\nProfessor Anderson is an interesting person and has many personal anecdotes relevant to the course matter. But there was limited classroom discussion and the class had a lecture format. The reading is almost too much to complete each week, especially when there's no discussion on it.",
                "Strengths are all of the material that was given and the wisdom as well as stories from Professor Anderson. Weaknesses would be the discussions. Professor would usually talk and share for a long time and then say \"Thoughts.\" By that point every one was tired and or lost a thought that they did have. Discussions should be formatted better and students should be allowed to relate the content to current events without having to \"stick to the script.\"",
                "I would like more structure, I wasn't clear where the class was going or what was expected of us. \r\nI would also like more opportunities for students to speak.",
                "strengths: the materials and resources of knowledge, including the instructors immense expertise and insightful experiences.\r\nweakness: I felt like the course could benefit from straying from the syllabus a little in class discussions, that way students could feel more invited to make connections beyond the materials on the syllabus."
