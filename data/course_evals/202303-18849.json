                "A little more of a directed point to be delivered and considered in each class. The breadth of experience of the students (from advanced grad students to STEM undergrads) seemed to make discussions tough at times.",
                "Only strengths. The professor is iconic, and has very realisitic expectations for students in that you aren't expected to perfectly grasp every single theoretical concept related to memory and memoir. I had trouble with some (some theoretical texts are incredibly hard to understand!) but then you come to class and the professor explains it all in such a way that allows you to internalize much of it just from lecture. You are expected to apply yourself in your own way, and that depends on each student individually. You're given feedback how you want it, if you want a lot of it you'll have it. The professor is very responsive to emails as well. No weaknesses!"
