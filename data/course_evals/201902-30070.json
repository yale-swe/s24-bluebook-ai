    "I really enjoyed the workshop sessions and wish there could have been more of them. I was also exposed to a lot of fun screenplays and movies throughout the class. More time could have been spent delving into the intricacies of a screenplay and discussing the different things that make a screenplay enjoyable or surprising. However, a lot of time was spent on lectures instead."

    "Totally! Especially if you're trying to figure out if you might have a thing for screenwriting",
    "Yes. It is a good introduction level crash course to screenwriting. It covered the fundamentals of writing a screenplay while forcing us to work out the kinks of our stories within a short amount of time, which is good writing practice for working with a tight deadline."
