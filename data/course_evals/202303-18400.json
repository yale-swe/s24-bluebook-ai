                "The course is a flipped course but needs to be taught in person. It is impossible to learn anything or ask questions since it learning through a video recorded pre covid that just keeps getting reused. There also needs to be different graders for the PSets because I go to every optional discussion section and get the correct answers and still get bad pset grades which shouldn't be happening. However, the professor is nice and the class itself os a good size.",
                "Professor Faison often does not attempt to help students understand the material.",
                "The strengths of this class were the weekly discussion sections led by Sebastian. The weaknesses were that this course used a flipped classroom method with video lectures that were outdated and Professor Faison often went on tangents during the videos about information that was not relevant to the topic. The questions in the problem sets and in class were often about things that were not covered in the video lectures, which would lead to confusion.",
                "Strengths: Material itself isn't hard to understand. \r\nWeaknesses: Academic support (professor, TAs, graders) were faulty in all aspects and course overall was not designed for student learning.",
                "This is a flip class, therefore the learning is done via lecture videos outside of class time. I am not a fan of this type of learning, therefore, I think this class would be better taught during actual class time. The homework for this class takes up a substantial amount of time, far more than I was expecting for an introductory astronomy course. I think the problem sets should better reflect the material that will be on the exams. The exams being only four questions each require intense amount of studying for only a small subset of the material to be tested on. In class we attempt to solve problems at the white board, yet it tends to feel like weve never been taught how to solve these math problems. The lecture videos tend to not go over the math processes were required to use, so its very easy to get left behind in class. Working the problems on the white boards rather than in table groups hinders students from writing down and saving problems worked on it class for additional practice outside of class. I attended the TAs discussion section each week to receive help on the weeks material and problem set, and reflecting on the semester, it seems that I learned the majority of the content from the discussion sections. Additionally, we did not receive the grades for the last two problem sets prior to the final exam, and it generally took numerous weeks or even a month to receive the grades back on a couple of the problem sets, making it difficult to receive feedback in time for the material to still be relevant. Overall, I think this course would be benefitted by an adapted version of the syllabus that more accurately reflects the course load and exam types.",
                "This course is inverted, as in students learn the content on their own and come to class to practice. This doesnt make the most sense in a lecture format. Also, the flipped classroom, in tandem with a strict attendance policy led students to feel disengaged in class where we were essentially being re-lectured what we learned ourselves online.",
                "Strengths-The prerecorded lectures made it easy to take detailed notes. \r\nWeaknesses-The flipped classroom made this course a very high time commitment. The problem sets, specifically the math questions, diverged so far from what we learned in lectures. This made section attendance a necessity for some weeks. But section times were not published before add-drop, so you're pretty much screwed if they don't work for your schedule. We only had one TA, and it would sometimes take an entire hour to get through a single problem.  I didn't feel comfortable asking Professor Faison questions. Problem sets took forever to be graded and the ULA's took points off for trivial reasons. The professor would say there are multiple answers and the key is merely a guide, but you will lose points if you don't regurgitate the exact answers from the key.",
                "The strengths of this course revolve around the teaching style of the professor who was able to attract interest in the topics at hand for each lecture. No apparent weaknesses.",
                "The course struggles from the fact that the math is not very well taught. If you are a humanities person looking for a science distributional, THIS IS NOT A GUT simply because of how the math is presented (I say this as someone who thinks of themselves as good at math and potentially majoring in such). It is not that the math is particularly hard, it is just that, for the most part, you are left to figure out how to do the math on your own with very few if any examples in lectures and in class. You are not given many equations for the problem sets, and often times have to google them to find the right one because they were never mentioned in the lecture video or in class, making the problem sets, which cover not super difficult topics, a real pain. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I did not enjoy the flipped nature of the class: new material is assigned via lecture videos due prior to class time while class time is dedicated to discussion. Since attendance is for the most part mandatory, and discussions could get awkward and unhelpful, it felt like I was wasting time in class. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I really enjoyed the conceptual parts of the class: a lot of the material covered is quite interesting and not super challenging. Its just that the class struggles presenting the information in a clear and concise way, making it way harder than it needs to be.",
                "The strengths of this course are the timeline and topics which the course covers. I feel as thought every concept was taught in such a way that it was necessary to understand before moving and understanding the next topic. I also think there was a strength in the way students had to takes notes on the lecture before arriving to class because it allowed for a level of self teaching that could prompt every student to understand the topics at their own capacity and at their own pace. However, this method of at home lecture reviewing and taking notes also proved to hinder our ability to performance in class. Often the lectures did not clarify or go into much detail for when it came to the mathematics and quantitative reasoning of such topics. I think because we weren't in a classroom setting to be taught these processes, there was a lack of understanding for the majority of the class and a greater confusion which was further strengthened by the need to present our understandings of such quantitative reasoning in class through example problems.",
                "The course is very interesting, and the classes are very engaging, however you have to see the lectures before the start of each class, which is fine if you plan ahead and have time for it."

                "No. I think it is taught in the worst way possible to facilitate learning. I retained nothing from this course, and the in class portion consisted of sending us to whiteboards to try problems no one knew how to do. Very few people did not credit/d/fail the course, and the Psets were hard and graded harshly so it was basically impossible to get a good grade on anything. the lecture videos were also long and you could not ask questions to the professor.",
                "I would not. Please do not take this class. It will be a time sucker if you plan for this to be an easy science or math credit. This class was not a good experience for me and it felt like the professor was actively working against us.",
                "No, the course was not taught at an introductory level and often relied on physics to understand how to do the problems, without explaining the concepts behind the math. Professor Faison would also use ratios to relate equations together, when it may have not been the easiest way to do the problem. There were also issues in the beginning of the year with TA's dropping the class and new ULA's being added that made it difficult to receive feedback on problem sets.",
                "No. The content itself isn't hard but the logistics are not set up for student success and everything is a huge headache because of the logistical nightmare. The people grading the psets is not the instructor or the TA, but someone else who doesn't know what's been taught in class or know what's been said during office hours",
                "If you are a prospective astrophysics major, then absolutely, however, otherwise no. This course has a reputation as a GUT science course, however, this is in my opinion incorrect. There is a substantial amount of homework involved and the course material is not necessarily easy. Participation is a part of the overall grade, thus you should always come to class, however all of the learning is typically done outside of class in the hours spent watching lecture videos, taking notes from the textbook readings, and the bi-weekly optional discussion sections. While attending the optional discussion sections is not required, in my opinion, if you want the best shot at receiving at least an 85 on the problem sets, you should be attending one or both sections each week. The homework is certainly required as you will be frequently out on the spot in class and will be expected to solve math problems each class. This class has caused me far more stress than I had anticipated, so as a student not exceedingly interested in astronomy, I would not recommend.",
                "I would absolutely NOT recommend this course to another student. This course is NOT a gut by any means. The flipped classroom made this course a very high time commitment. If you're not interested in astronomy, this course will be extremely frustrating. If you want an introduction to astronomy, this course will make you resent the subject. The professor was not helpful, the only time I got relatively helpful information was from the TA. The learning environment of this course was simply not for me. This class is not one where questions are welcomed and answered. We spent so much time doing board work in class. The entire class would stand with a blank board, completely confused. The professor never bothered to explain the underlying concepts or clear up confusion, he just displayed the correct answer and moved on. Class time left me more confused and one TA was left to clear up all of our confusion in one hour.",
                "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in astronomy, the Universe, cosmology, etc. It is a good intro course and could provide a solid foundation for more advanced courses.",
                "TL;DR Yes only if a few things are fixed\r\n\r\nThis class in its current state suffers from disorganization, which is unfortunate because the topics covered are quite interesting. Pset grading takes forever  (we had two ungraded psets when we took the final and most of them from each half of the course were ungraded until a week before the midterm and final respectively) and the required answer format for psets and exams is a pain. Furthermore, the pre-class lecture videos mostly teach the concepts, while the psets are almost exclusively math, and then the exams return mostly to concepts. The lack of continuity of material made it so that understanding the math (not because it was hard, simply because it was confusing and not really explained) took a lot of effort, only for none of it to show up on the exam; the exams were also significantly easier than the psets, mostly because they covered very broad topics and very little math. \r\n\r\nAlso, the class wasn't very well supported, and office hours were rare and talking about the pset was discouraged.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to explore astronomy and get into its science and concepts. I also think this course is a good and intellectually engaging course for those who have struggled with STEM courses in general and find themselves stronger in the fields of the arts and humanities.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about the universe, but not if you only care about physics, because it's not a physics class."
