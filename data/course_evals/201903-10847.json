    "healthcare is super complicated and I do not understand it... I took some big picture points away, but the details are not clear.",
    "I developed an immense amount of knowledge about health policy in the United States, especially how Medicare and Medicaid works in the context of current policy debates.",
    "Great economics elective that offered a well taught overview of the US healthcare system.",
    "I learned about how the Us healthcare system compares to other developed and developing countries.",
    "Learned all about our healthcare system, the way it's financed, and part of the reason why the U.S. spends twice as much per person on healthcare even though we have worse outcomes. This was one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale and was super relevant to what's being talked about in the policy world with Medicare for All (not as simple as it sounds) and the Affordable Care Act. It was a really good overview of health insurance, Medicare\/Medicaid, pharma, hospitals, and physician training\/compensation.",
    "I developed in depth knowledge on the major aspects of the healthcare system. I deepened my understanding of the healthcare system as an economic market.",
    "The details of Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid (what they cover, who they cover, how they are financed),  the prescription drug industry and key legislation regarding the industry, the FDA's powers and regulations, how\/why healthcare spending in the US is so high, etc. I also learned about a few solutions that have been proposed to solve healthcare issues, but healthcare is so complex that I left the course with the thought that there is no good solution.",
    "I learned about interesting topics in health economics such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the healthcare occupations job market. Professor Forman is very knowledgeable and passionate about the course material and adds his unique perspective to the class.",
    "Healthcare policy is a really complex topic that I didn't understand that well going into this class. This class will give you all the information you need to understand major issues we face relating to healthcare in this country and to carry an intelligent conversation about it.",
    "How messed up the health Econ market in the US is and how difficult it will be to get enough bipartisanship to address it",
    "I learned massive amounts of information about the American healthcare system - physician reimbursement and medical graduate education, Medicare\/Medicaid, the ACA, hospitals, and health economics.",
    "This is NOT an econ class, and the professor will admit as much. You will learn basic facts about U.S. health care markets, and very little else.",
    "Really thorough analysis of the U.S. healthcare system historically and today",

    "Information about the structure of the US healthcare system",
    "Learned a ton about America's HC system. A must take for all pre-meds.",
    "I learned more about how the healthcare system in the US works, and how economics plays an important role in the healthcare crisis.",
    "You will learn all about the U.S. Healthcare system in this class-- from Medicare to Med School Admissions to physician reimbursements. It's a lot of material, but totally worth learning about if you're considering a career in medicine or someone who anticipates utilizing healthcare in the United States.",
    "I learned the basic structure of the American health care system and also gained useful intuitions on how to approach real life health decisions. This class gives students a great deal of knowledge, but also implicitly arms students with a deeper understanding of economic structures. Professor Forman does a great job at striking a political balance and portraying just how delicate the entire health care system is.",
    "Role of healthcare in American society",
    "I learned a lot about the US health care system and its intricacies. We went very in depth on multiple different areas, and I came out of the class feeling very well educated on the topic.",
    "All about the HC system in America - very enlightening (especially for political debates)",
    "I gained insight to the US health care system and why it functions the way it does.",
    "Basic mechanisms, problems, and potential solutions of the healthcare economy.",
    "Incredible insight of the healthcare market, intersection of social justice and equity and empirical data",
    "Learned quite a bit about the health care system.",
    "A survey overview of the issues in economic issues in healthcare:\r\n\r\nRising costs of healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid, Hospitals, Insurance, Drug Companies, Regulation, etc. A whole lot!",
    "I learned a lot about the American health care system and how it operates. I gained a lot of information about policy.",
    "Focused more on policy than economics. Broad overview. All good material.",
    "An in depth understanding of the way healthcare works in the United States in terms of finance, political thought, and practical set up.",

    "Basic vocabulary of healthcare economics and applications of microeconomic concepts to the healthcare industry, a deep overview of how insurance is paid for and differences between plans (medicare, medicaid, private, employer-sponsored, etc), how healthcare professionals are compensated, and more.",
    "Health economics and the workings of the US healthcare system",
    "Learned that the US health system is terrible",
    "I learned about many of the problems in the healthcare industry and how different government policies and private entities have tried to address them or exacerbated them. \r\n\r\nI also learned where health insurance comes from in the US and how it works.",
    "Mostly health policy and the mechanics of how our healthcare system works from a budgetary perspective, not a ton of economics",
    "I learned the terminology and makeup of the healthcare system. Learned about topics ranging from Medicare, Medicaid, hospital management, physician reimbursement, and drug approval. I now understand far better how healthcare works in this country.",
    "You learn about how healthcare works in the US and its pros and cons compared to other international systems. You become better informed about the political debate surrounding healthcare legislation and the pros and cons of Obamacare."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths:\r\n- Lots of interesting material\r\n- Well structured\r\n- Many opportunities to ask questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- overwhelming at beginning with so much material",
    "Strengths - super relevant material, guest speakers are very well integrated with mission of course, low workload (all readings are completely optional), class style truly encourages deep intellectual engagement with the material, powerpoints are a godsend\r\nNo weaknesses!",
    "The professor is nice, funny, super engaged in the material, and really cares about the students succeeding.",
    "Strengths: Great, engaging lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: Readings are pretty boring and don't really tie into lectures very well. Little to no incentive to do them.",
    "Professor Forman speeds through material. It's frustrating for someone who wants to learn the material in-depth, but it's nearly impossible to cover all the material he wants to and still devote sufficient time to each concept. This course is more of a brief overview as opposed to geared toward developing any nuanced understanding.",
    "Strengths: lots of important and relevant info covered\r\nWeaknesses: I personally thought the grading was a bit harsh",
    "Strength: the material is very relevant to our everyday lives and it is easy to connect to current events, some topics are things that we talk about frequently but never realized before how they work\r\nWeakness: the slides are not always very coherent, and sometimes the lectures can seem unorganized and jump around a bit. At times it can be hard to follow\/connect the different sections of a lecture. Professor Forman knows his stuff really well, but sometimes this means that he doesn't understand which things will be more confusing for people who are learning for the first time",
    "Strength: Howie is just an awesome guy. He knows so much and loves answering questions. Very helpful, great professor.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I kept falling asleep because I didn't like the material. This was no one's fault but my own. I should have Cred D'd",
    "Professor Forman is the biggest strength of this course. Some of the content can be dense to understand, but he is a really engaging lecturer which makes it easy to understand the topic. The assignments and midterms are also fair. The only weakness of this course is that it has a final during finals period instead of a final scheduled on the last day of class.",
    "A lot of material but it was very interesting and Professor Forman was very engaging and made the information more accessible.",
    "Strengths - Pretty good lectures, not too much work\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - More clarity about grading, lectures in the beginning were extremely dry and repetitive",
    "Strengths: Howie is a really great and engaging lecturer, also the students in the class this year were always asking questions and super involved, the workload is low but you learn a LOT, the guest lectures can be really interesting and always raise really salient points for future discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of many, but it would have been nice if the final paper were due a little bit later \/ if we had a bit more guidance on how to structure it",
    "Strengths: I found the content very interesting and Professor Forman was funny and a good lecturer. I loved the guest speakers and got to meet amazing people who are currently working to change the healthcare system positively.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I found that the lectures were often just the slides and that the process for studying for the midterm and final were very ambiguous. Since there are no PSETs or practice problems given in class, the way to study was to just \"read the slides,\" which, in essence, meant to memorize all the content covered in class. On the actual exams, a lot of content covered in class wasn't addressed or some questions were worth more points than they should have been. On the midterm, we were given a question regarding numbers and calculations even though the Professor claimed no calculations would be necessary.",
    "Strengths: The guest lectures were amazing. Professor Forman brought in people like Rahm Emanuel (Obama's Chief of Staff), Troyen Brennan (Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of CVS Health), Mandy Cohen (Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services) and many more. They talked to us about different aspects of the US healthcare system, and their lectures were very enlightening and were a great supplement to the subjects that we learned in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Each lecture\/slide deck for the class is so long (40-60 slides usually), and there is so much information on each slide. Therefore, it is extremely unclear what main concepts we need to know for the exams. For example, we were forced to know statistics for the exam (what proportion of Medicare recipients are elderly or disabled), and with so many charts in the lecture slides, it was difficult for me to know what statistics would be tested, if any. Also, no practice exams or questions were given to the students before the exam, which I felt was a bit unfair. The only way for me to prepare for the exam was to memorize as much information as possible. I felt more prepared for the final, simply because I knew what the format of the exam was like, based on the midterm.",
    "I love the interesting topics of this course and the unique perspectives that Professor Forman brings to the class. Students also have an infinite number of possible topics to write about for the final paper; this makes the writing process much more enjoyable and exciting.",
    "- The class was relaxed, but I still gained a good understanding of the material. I think the people Prof Forman brings in are very accomplished and provide great insights. Professor Forman also does a very good job presenting the material.",
    "I liked the lectures but I thought that the grading was a bit unfair on homework\/midterm and there wasnt even guidance on the papers. I also thought some of the guest lectures were meh",
    "I thought the content was extremely interesting. I also thought Professor Forman was an interesting lecturer and the organization was quite good.\r\n\r\nI wish we would have gotten feedback on our homework assignments and tests sooner. I also wish we did not speed through slides so quickly; sometimes it was difficult to keep up\/follow - particularly guest lectures.",
    "It's fun getting to hear from several well-respected guest lecturers, this year including Rahm and Zeke Emanuel. Prof. Forman is a fun guy, and he does have a very deep understanding of U.S. health care markets. The homework assignments are just a mild annoyance and don't contribute to learning, but the essay can be fun -- you'll get next to no guidance, however.",
    "Honestly a fantastic class.  Foreman is absolutely brilliant and a great lecturer, really fun and engaging.  Really cool to learn from someone who is knowledgeable about both policy and practice in healthcare, having had careers in both.  Only qualm is that the dude speaks like he has a patient on the operating table with seconds left to live with the speed that he spits out information.  This makes it engaging to follow but quite difficult to take notes on with the extent of information you are expected to memorize, particularly given that you are tested on what he says, not just what is in the lecture slides. That aside, truly my favorite course in all four years at Yale College.",
    "Strengths: this course was unexpectedly a gem. We had incredible guest lecturers, Howie is amazing, and the content was so easy to follow.\r\nWeaknesses: none",
    "This course gives a great understanding of our healthcare system, without being too great of a workload.",
    "Strength: The professor\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lots of rote memorization",
    "excellent professor and not too much work. final paper and a final and a midterm. definitely fair.",
    "There was a lot of material covered in lectures and we were expected that be responsible for all of it. While I enjoyed learning, I think expecting students to be responsible for all of it, including guest lectures for which there were no reference slides, was a little unreasonable.",
    "Strength is definitely the amount of content. I feel like I learned more in this class than almost any other that I have taken. Howie is also a great professor and can answer almost any question that comes up. Weakness is that Howie speaks so fast so there's tons to write down and you never know what's going to be tested.",
    "Strengths: lectures were interesting, guest speakers great, TF and exam review sessions helpful, essay was nice because I could pick something I was interested in\r\nWeaknesses: homework graded a bit harshly, if you missed class it was hard to catch up on material (slides not very self explanatory)",
    "I loved the lecture content, but I think that delivery could be improved by giving students a brief introduction to each topic instead of jumping into each slide deck assuming that everyone knows what Medicare is, for example.",
    "Strengths:\r\nGreat lectures and slides.\r\nProfessor Forman is fun and engaging.\r\nGuest lecturers are relevant and applicable to course material.\r\nExams are well written.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe assigned reading is often not relevant to the course, and because there is such a large volume of readings, it is hard to find the motivation to read them.",
    "Strengths: Super thorough and useful introduction into the US Healthcare System.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the professor throws around some field-specific jargon without defining them, making some of the earlier lectures hard to follow until you eventually figure stuff out.",
    "Howie is a great professor, and his lectures were fascinating and well taught. The guest speakers were incredible as well and I looked forward going to every lecture.",
    "Sometimes the lecture slides lack a lot of the information that we need to know for exams (i.e., it comes from the instructor's actual lecture) and it would be nice if this content could be included somewhere in written form. Apart from that, very stellar.",
    "I think the homework assignments and readings were extremely appropriate and meaningful, and the lectures were very interesting. If I had one critique, it would be that spending multiple days on one lecture can get a bit confusing.",
    "Prof. Forman is very involved in the course, as he's taught it for many years.  He also has so much experience in the industry.  Most interesting are many of his anecdotes from those when he was a physician to when he advised Senators during the passage of the Affordable Care Act.  The pace of the class can vary a lot depending on the topic though.",
    "Strengths: engagement and commitment of Professor, organization, clarity, applicability to the real world and medicine",
    "Way too much material. Just so many slides that could be condensed into bigger broader ideas and concepts.",
    "Strengths: The topics are very interesting and Professor Forman is a good lecturer. His wealth of experience makes it so that he can answer almost any question with a very full, satisfying answer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm was graded kinda harshly, but the final was graded kinda easily, so I have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Also, in general, you won't have a great understanding of where you stand in the class.",
    "The lectures were interesting, but I wish the class had included more than just memorizing policy.",
    "The information given was super interesting and the guest lectures are very enjoyable. There can seem to be a lot of content at times so you have to go to lecture and pay close attention to keep up, but the workload is very manageable and fun if you do!",
    "This course provides an excellent overview of US healthcare economics. Overall, I liked the structure of the course, but I think having one or two more assignments to contribute to the grade and reinforce topics discussed in lecture would be helpful.",
    "Was probably the best class I've taken thus far. The lectures are engaging , the guests are fantastic, and the assignments are interesting. Professor Forman does an incredible job interacting with all of the students during lecture, despite its relatively large size.",
    "This course has an incredible amount of content, for better and perhaps sometimes for worse. It's an extensive survey of the healthcare industry (without being a survey, since each lecture was truly a deep-dive), but at times can be overwhelming trying to keep track of all acronyms and concepts, unsure of what's meant to be retained and what's meant to be kept as a general understanding.",
    "Great course",
    "Only weaknesses - very hard to do well, disorganized, boring lectures, too much content...",
    "The guest speakers brought into this course were definitely a strength. I was great to hear from people who are currently trying to solve big problems in healthcare after we had learned about the different problems. \r\n\r\nProf. Formans personal experience as both a doctor and a healthcare policy advisor also greatly enhanced the course. His personal stories made the things we were talking about less abstract and easier to understand.",
    "Strengths: I thought the course was organized very well, and the lectures were are pretty interesting\/engaging (if you choose to engage). Every lecture centers around a different topic in healthcare, whether its physician reimbursements, Medicare, long term care, etc.\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the guest lectures were a miss in my opinion. Cool people came, but sometimes we couldn't hear them and the session was just structured as a Q&A so it was hard to take notes. Also, all the readings were optional, which made the workload pretty low, but also lowered engagement. Additionally, while the TA office hours were helpful, the TAs were somewhat inflexible in that they would not meet with you any time outside of office hours if you missed lectures, and the office hours themselves were pretty limited (2 hours a week in the beginning, 1 hour a week later on).",
    "For strengths, I found the subject material to be extremely fascinating. Professor Forman does an incredible job of lecturing the material and portraying its nuance. Course was also not super time-consuming as there was no busy work, but I still learned a lot. For me, no weaknesses. This is truly my favorite class Ive taken at Yale.",
    "I liked that we had multiple guest lectures from very prominent people in US healthcare including Obama's former chief of staff and the Chief of Medicine of CVS\/Caremark.",
    "Lectures were just boring unfortunately. I stopped going"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! You learn so much about it. Such a great course for a pre-med.",
    "110% Everybody should take this course to understand U.S. healthcare",
    "Yes, the structure of the course is amazing and well organized for learning. There are a lot of resources from the TAs, to the professor, to the office hours.",
    "Yes! It's an easy, low-workload, and fairly interesting class. I'd especially recommend it to someone looking for a more chill econ elective.",
    "Yes if you want to have a general understanding of the healthcare system - be warned that the grading isn't very lenient - they are looking for specific phrases and terms, so even if you generally got the concept, you might not get the points",
    "If you are interested in the material, then definitely yes! That being said, some of the lectures are more interesting than others, and the less interesting ones can be dry or confusing. The workload is very low so it is easy to let yourself get behind, but when it comes to the exam, there is A LOT of material to review, and the slides are not very self explanatory (and don't exactly follow the flow of the lecture), so going to class is a must.",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in the subject. Don't just take it because you think you \"should\". It will be a drag.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student even moderately interested in health care policy in the country. You learn so much about health care in the United States and how the health care market fails and succeeds. This is not a gut elective for Econ majors, but the workload is not too bad and you'll do well on the exams if you pay attention in lecture.",
    "Definitely, especially as an economic elective.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in healthcare. If you are planning to go to medical school, you must take this. It teaches you a lot about humanity in medicine.",
    "No.  The class was not skill-based at all.  Exams were 100% recall.  Basically, anything that comes out of his mouth is testable material.  The tests are just trying to see if you went to lecture or not.",
    "Yes, definitely take it! This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale, and some of the guest lectures have really cool, really accomplished speakers (like former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel!) Howie is such a nice person and a great professor. If you have any interest at all in health care, health care policy, or the economy in general, you should take this class. The workload is relatively low, but you learn so much (pay attention, because the insights are really fascinating). I feel like a much more informed voter now. I'm also more equipped to talk about these issues and to choose a health insurance plan in the future.",
    "I think that, as consumers of the healthcare system, this class is very valuable for people who want to engage with it in an educated manner. I gained a lot of knowledge on the inner workings of the healthcare system and left with a greater understanding of how and why it works. As someone who will not be going into public policy, I believe I can now be a better and more informed consumer of healthcare. Additionally, I would recommend this class for the guest speakers who were interesting and inspiring. Pro tip: read over the lectures after he gives them and create quizlets\/flashcards throughout the semester. Study the lectures every so often so you are not bombarded with a ton of information to memorize for the midterm and final.",
    "I think that this course covers a very important topic, especially since one of the major points of debate for the 2020 presidential election is US healthcare. I took this class because I wanted to be an informed voter. I definitely learned a lot about the US healthcare system, such as its major flaws, why it is so expensive, what are possible solutions to the problem, the details of Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid (what they cover, who they cover, how they are financed), etc. The guest lecturers were all amazing and informative. The workload is not bad. Professor Forman is a pretty engaging lecturer. Overall, I would recommend the class. However, I do think that this course could be improved in many ways. For example, we received no practice exams or questions before the midterm\/final, which I would've appreciated. We covered an enormous amount of information over the semester (which makes sense because healthcare is so complicated), but it was unclear to me what were the main topics that we needed to know for the exams.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are truly interested about health economics and gaining a greater understanding about the general American healthcare landscape.",
    "Yes! Few people really understand healthcare policy, even though it is such and important issues. The class helps you understand it and gives you access to some really knowledgeable people, including Prof Forman.",
    "Yes! I think its such an important topic in todays world and its sad how many people dont understand how utterly dysfunctional our healthcare system is",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The workload is very fair\/manageable, and the content is engaging, interesting, and honestly very very important. The pace is a little fast, and sometimes it feels like if you blink then you've missed several slides of important, potentially testable information, which contributed to my exam stress. But, I think that having study groups definitely makes the course more manageable.",
    "This class should be a gut, but it's actually not because tests and homework assignments are graded so meticulously, and points are often deducted for no reason. In this class, you will memorize facts about the U.S. health care market, and you will not learn any more broadly applicable economic concepts. It felt very much like a return to high school in its emphasis on rote memorization (though not excessive). Forman is even-handed even when presenting highly partisan issues, he's appropriately skeptical of the American Hospital Association, but he sometimes gives doctors and hospitals a bit too much of a pass... He's what makes the class though -- really fun guy!",
    "Absolutely.  Whether you think you are knowledgeable about healthcare or not, there is so much to learn from this course.  Definitely don't take if you are bad at taking notes or have difficulty processing a lot of information rapidly because you're on a treadmill and every class is a sprint.",
    "YES. Learned a ton, had a great experience, and not too stressful at all.",
    "Absolutely. Overall, this is a great course. Super interesting material. Professor Forman is a great lecturer with well made slides. He is really knowledgable and cares about teaching. This class is not as easy as it seems, but if you stay up to date with the lectures and put in some time, it is super worthwhile.",
    "Yes, if you want to understand how our healthcare system works. Highly recommended for pre-meds\/anyone else going into the health sector.",
    "yes. all econ students should take this. also great for pre-med students",
    "Only if you want to learn about the *US* healthcare system.",
    "Of course. This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The workload is pretty much non-existent yet I still feel like I learned so much. Howie is a top tier professor and really cares about his students. Guest lecturers from some of the leaders in the field is also super cool. I took this with absolutely no econ knowledge and found it totally fine. The intro micro requirement is definitely not needed.",
    "Yes! Howard is very funny and teaches the course well. Very interesting material and a very nice break from all the more econ\/mathy electives. Best econ elective I have taken at Yale - no prior knowledge of healthcare (or econ honestly) is assumed\/needed. Low\/reasonable workload too. 10\/10.",
    "Yes! However, be prepared to do some Googling in class if you have relatively little knowledge about the healthcare system\/health policy. The lectures presupposes a certain level of familiarity with the material that some don't have. Other than that, this class is definitely worth taking, even if you aren't interested in a career in healthcare OR economics. Howie will basically teach you EVERYTHING about the U.S. healthcare system, which is valuable knowledge to have as some who, presumably, will probably get sick a few times in their life.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who would like to apply the thought processes of economics in a very real system. Health care is a dynamic field which is relevant for everyone (and their parents).",
    "Yes. This class is super eye-opening for anyone considering a career in medicine, academic research, biotechnology, public policy, etc. As a pre-med, I left this course with a much greater understanding of how the US Healthcare System works and how being a physician fits into the bigger picture. Could not recommend this class anymore.",
    "Yes! A must take class here, I learned so much.",
    "Yes. It was SO helpful for learning about the American HC system, knowledge almost anybody needs to know.",
    "Yes! This is probably the best class I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Forman is the best!",
    "Yes, for anyone that wants to gain a greater understanding and appreciation for healthcare.",
    "Yes!! Everyone should take this class, especially those who want to work in healthcare or focus on the convergence of economics and social equity",
    "I recommend it if you wanna learn about health care and health policy in the US but dont wanna do that much work.",
    "YES!\r\n\r\nI took this course because I saw a previous anonymous student recommender wrote that he\/she felt that this course should be mandatory for everyone. I was skeptical at the time because I was pretty sure I wasn't really interested in healthcare (Medicare\/Medicaid? bleh) nor that interested in the economics aspect of healthcare (i.e. it's pretty much adverse selection, seems too simple and nothing to really talk about), but boy was I wrong.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else, you should take this class BECAUSE IT'LL HELP YOU PICK OUT YOUR INSURANCE LATER IN LIFE (hint: choose HDHP + HSA :) ). And if you have even a MODICUM of curiosity into the U.S. healthcare system (e.g. why it's such a big issue, or Obamacare, or some aspiring premed pupil), then you'll find this course amazing. I had no interest in any of these, and I still felt Professor Forman to be such an interesting guy with SUCH INTERESTING lectures. I genuinely looked forward to every class because they all covered such interesting topics that I didn't know existed (e.g. do you know how hospitals make money? did you know many hospitals aren't nonprofit?).\r\n\r\nOn the more practical side, you don't really have to go to lecture (he posts slides that are pretty comprehensive), the guest lectures are super interesting (head of Caremark CVS, head of CMS under Bush, Rahm and Zeke Emanuel wow!!!!), and I'm pretty sure the grading is pretty lenient (so pretty easy A).\r\n\r\nAlso there's no HW lmfao. It's like 2 assignments the entire semester that take 1 hour tops (less if you just search for the answers instead of reading the articles\/watching the videos). The paper is kind of a bummer but it's also only 6-8 pages so you only have to suffer for a little bit (also you can write about whatever you want so hopefully it's kind of interesting?). Lastly, one midterm and final are pure memorization from the slides.",
    "I would recommend this course, since you learn a lot about a topic that is often not well understood.",
    "Yes, especially if you have any interest in medicine or healthcare at all",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is extremely important for anyone interested in pursuing healthcare in the future as a doctor, researcher, administrator, etc. to understand the policies and economics that drive our system. Even people not interested in pursuing healthcare would greatly benefit from learning about how the healthcare market\/ health insurance works, since it affects all of us.",
    "Absolutely! Every class was fascinating, the work was reasonable, and Professor Forman is a great lecturer.",
    "Absolutely! To anyone even moderately interested in American healthcare and welfare policy, it's incredibly interesting from the economic, political, ethical, and medical perspectives.",
    "Yes. Great class. Even greater teacher. Learned a lot.",
    "NO. This class is a mixed bag and I would definitely avoid. Doing well and getting an A\/A- is really really hard. It may seem easy at first glance, but do not underestimate it. It requires a ton of memorization (a ton!) and they grade exams super harshly and you get penalized for really small mistakes. The worst thing is that its not curved (except for the first midterm, because people did awfully and literally scored 75\/Cs on average). There is a lot of content to learn (approx. 600 slides) and its conveyed pretty badly, and for exams you need to study literally every footnote and every trend on the slides. Lectures are dry\/boring and the Professor would throw random healthcare terms out (like PCORI or SNFs) and just assume everyone knows them, which was so frustrating because most of us had absolutely no idea. In my opinion the TAs were really unhelpful and unclear, and little help was given for writing the paper, so it was hard to know what exactly they were looking for. Look - if you are ok with getting a B+\/B\/B- then take this class, but given that I always get As\/A-s in my classes this was just a really annoying experience and for the first time ever I have absolutely no clue what grade Im getting (!!!). There were countless things that really irritated me and that made it hard to do well. Take for instance the sheer inconsistency of the exams. The midterm was really hard and way too long (nearly no one finished) and tested very niche topics and even asked us super specific stuff about the guest lectures. Meanwhile, the final was extremely easy, but since everyone did so well there was very little room to differentiate between students - the final was basically a joke, so now the horrible midterm is what is weighing peoples grades down. Also, the classmates you are competing with in Health Econ are very ambitious (not like economics of natural resources, where many students slack off). Ive never seen this many kids take notes in class so many people were willing to participate and it often seemed like everyone read up on healthcare in their spare time (I certainly do not). There are a lot of pre-med kids (not just Econ students) in the class and if you dont study a lot for exams (catch people showing up to the review session with 25-40 page study guides), youre probably going to do below average. Retrospectively, I should absolutely have listened to the bad reviews. If you want to maintain your GPA, this is not a safe bet at all - there is very little guidance, assignments\/exams are hard, there is so much to study, and many of your fellow students very interested in public policy or medicine \/ are pros at learning huge amounts of material off by heart. Youre better off with intro corp fin or another hard Econ elective, where making an effort and studying at least somewhat pays off. I am so mad, I really did work hard in Health Econ but think Im walking out with one of my worst grades at Yale ever (B) and the class was totally not worth it and pretty stressful. Do NOT take it.",
    "Yes! Everyone in the US needs healthcare yet not everyone understands where it comes from or how it works! Take this course to better understand not just an incredibly relevant topic in US government, economics and policy but also your own life.",
    "Yes -- it's low workload and the material is all super relevant and useful (soon we'll all have to buy our own health insurance...). Don't expect it to be groundbreaking, but I'm ultimately glad I took it.",
    "Yes! My favorite class Ive taken here. Even if you dont have a background in economics, this course is accessible to everyone and Professor Forman makes the lecture feel like a seminar as he is always there to help. This course covers a lot of public policy and politics too, which is a new and very different way to learn from other classes Ive taken.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone that wants to learn more about the US healthcare system. I learned practical things that are important for when I will buy my own health insurance and also will allow you to understand the political debate around the US healthcare system.",
    "Econ gut. Take if u need. You will learn a lot about the healthcare system so thats probably good too"
