    "I thought the difficulties of the class were different, and it dependet on the teacher. For example, I didn't have homework so much, but my friends in different teacher's class of this course had a lot of homework everyday. If the amount of homework become the same, this course will be better and better, I think."

    "Yes, of course. I haven't been good at talking in English before I've come to Yale, but through this course I could communicated with other students much better in English. \r\nMoreover, I got many friends from all over the world and I could know many other perspectives or ways of thinking.\r\nThese are the reasons why I recommend this course to other students."
