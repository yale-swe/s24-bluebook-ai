                "Neil is a huge asset to this course. He is dedicated, insightful, knowledgable, and he allows you to incubate your own style for the videos you make, rather than making you adhere to any tradition.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a really well-designed course and I wouldnt change anything.",
                "Neil gives great feedback on every project you do and really wants to see you succeed. I really enjoyed our conversations brainstorming about my projects. I think the class could be improved with a more defined prompt for the final project or by opening up to the possibility of a group project. I think organizing shoot times, arranging for cameras, and setting up shots was very difficult alone and often very frustrating.",
                "Strength: Neil is an amazing instructor who challenges your mindset, inspires you to create, and encourages you to push forward the boundary and experiment with the craziest ideas that you dare not try before. Every conversation I had with Neil was inspiring and enjoyable. I feel comfortable raising weird ideas and discussing anything with Neil because I know he will always be supportive and never hesitate to offer critical suggestions. I'm so happy that I took this course. I have zero experience with video arts before, but filming videos with Neil inspires me so much and helps a lot with my practices in drawing and design."
