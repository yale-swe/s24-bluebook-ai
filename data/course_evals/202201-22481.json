                "I though that the workload was very manageable and the exams were fair.",

                "The lectures were good and reasonably paced compared to PHYS 180. I think PSET questions that resembled exam questions would be more useful than textbook problems.",
                "The course was very good! I loved how we did a lot of practice problems in class.",
                "Mehdi was a great intro physics professor and was much better at presenting the content than professor Steinacker last semester. I highly recommend that he continues to teach the intro physics sequence because he makes the material way more digestable",
                "This class was one of the worst classes I have taken at Yale. I dreaded attending classes and received no support after receiving poor grades on the first two exams, despite reaching out to the professor to ask how I could improve my understanding (he told me to come to class and I would do better, which I had been to every class to that point). Pretty much all of the content in the class I had to teach myself as the way it was taught during class did not make sense to me. The assigned workload of the class was not too bad for an intro STEM class, but the prof expected us to do the suggested problems on homework sets as well (usually an additional 20-25 problems each week) and acted as though we all should treat physics as our number one priority. For being a required class for so many STEM majors, it is facilitated extremely poorly and makes learning very difficult. If I had not already declared my major, this class would have made me switch to a different major.",
                "The video recordings of the class were terrible quality and couldn't be seen. The psets and quizzes did not prepare us for the exams and there is no clarity on grades or curving (for this semester and professor). This class overall was a confusing mess.",
                "Strengths: professor generally pretty good at explaining concepts, HW is not too bad\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: exams had way too many problems for the time allotted, and pace and content of the class is extremely difficult. Posted lecture notes would make content we are responsible for easier to understand.",

                "The pace of this course was too slow for my learning. The professor worked on many repetitive example questions instead of showing the derivation of the equations. I often found myself learning very little during the mandatory class sessions",
                "Strengths: Medhi was such a kind and personable professor; his lectures were always engaging and his warm personality always came through. The problem sets in this course were super super manageable, as were the quizzes. Exams were at the perfect difficulty level - fair, but a bit challenging. \r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps a few more harder questions on the problem sets would help prepare for the exams, but overall, no major weaknesses!",

                "I really enjoyed the course and the way it was structured. The one comment I would have about a weakness would be that it took a long time to get back grades on homework assignments.",
                "Strengths: We go over many examples in classes which really teach you how to solve problems and apply concepts. This way, you are less confused when it comes to the exams and psets.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A better focus on answering student questions during class would be great. Also, I did not appreciate how the midterms were graded on two separate curves due to the two different instructors. It caused a lot of inconsistencies and I felt that it was unfair that someone getting the same grade as another in the other professor's class would automatically get a 10 point boost for no reason.",
                "Professor Ghiassi-Nejad, in my opinion, taught in a sort of example-based, by a textbook, explanatory way that reminded me of my good STEM teachers from high school. This was a welcome change from PHYS 180, which felt much more loosely conceptually rigorous and hard to follow. Depending on their preferences, I know some folks liked or disliked this change. I notably heard that the professor for the other section was much more difficult to follow because of the amount of mathematical proofs and lack of descriptive explanation. \r\nStrengths: Homework is from a textbook, meaning the textbook is designed to provide a useful alternative explanation for concepts. The professors teaching style worked for me. The course was generally well organized. \r\nWeaknesses: Support is there if you have agency. Feedback for assignments is slow. Tests are often harder than the samples. One test required a surprising, disappointing amount of application.",
                "Strengths: Dr. Ghiassi was very kind and cares so much about his students. He taught me about physics and about life. Excellent instructor. \r\nWeakness: The feedback and grading of this course was a bit confusing at time. As of writing this, I still dont know where I stand in the course in terms of grading. Dr. Ghiassi said that we would curve a test one way, then it would be curved another way. The other section would do one thing with their grades and Dr. Ghiassi would do another. Also, I felt like the problems done in class and on the homeworks were a bit easier than the exam problems, but this is typical for a lot of math and physics courses.",

                "Strengths: Learning a lot of different physics topics and a lot of TF and peer tutor support.\r\nWeakness: Lectures were sometimes hard to follow, professor-provided lecture notes would have been helpful to review.",
                "Overall, the class was pretty smooth. The expectations were clear and the course content was clearly communicated. I think it was frustrating that practice test content was consistently much easier than actual exams, but this was mostly fine once I knew to expect it.",

                "The professor was super nice, but lectures were often confusing. Doing more practice problems in class and explaining the concepts a little more clearly might have helped with deeper conceptual learning.",
                "The Homework was pretty easy, but the questions from the book were boring and not very engaging. Often times I didnt feel very interested in the material taught in lecture. I wish it had been more rigorous, but everything is taught surface level to the point of knowing how to solve problems but not knowing why the formulas were using for that work.",
                "- the access to problems worked on in class was poor as it was done on a chalk board\r\n\r\n- the instructor was clear on how to work through problems",
                "Great introductory physics class!",
                "Strengths: followed the textbook well, concepts were introduced in an order that made sense for the student\r\nWeaknesses: no exam review sessions (other than what was done in class), office hour times were not consistent or clearly advertised",
                "I think it could have had more times in lecture for student participation",
                "strengths of the course: it follows the book very closely; if you do the suggested problems and homework assignments, you will be well-prepared for the test\r\n\r\nweakness: it was difficult to get help from the TAs and peer tutors since they did not have complete solutions for the homeworks and suggested problems. It was more effective to watch You Tube videos to learn the content. The lectures were also not essential; I found myself re-reading the textbook after lecture to understand the practice problems that were presented. It would have been helpful to go through more complicated examples during class rather than just skimming concepts. We also did not receive several of our psets back until after the final exam. This feedback would have been mroe helpful before the exam.",
                "The course is hard to teach, because there are people in the class that are overprepared  for it, and people that are underprepared. I think that overall the instructors did a good job of striking a balance between these two different groups. One thing that would be helpful for future iterations of the course is making sure that the problem sets and the assigned homework problems correspond a bit better with the problems tested on  the exams. Sometimes, I found the exam problems being conceptually harder than the problems in the homework, and sometimes they required more math than the assigned and recommended book problems did.",
                "There's a lot of available help if you need it. No review before exams and sometimes it was unclear what the exam was going to cover.",
                "Strengths: \r\n- well-organized course\r\n- lectures are clear and engaging\r\n- problem sets directly relate to lecture and exam content\r\nWeaknesses: cant really think of any",
                "Strengths: We did a lot practice problems in class.\r\nWeaknesses: The PSETS did not match the caliber of the questions that we saw on exams, so I did not feel adequately prepared.",
                "The instructor rushed through multiple concepts but made up for it by doing more practice questions.",
                "The class should be a little smaller and the feedback on assignments could have been more regular.",
                "The class could of used more rigorous PSETS or other resources to prepare for the exam.",
                "Exams should have reflected the problem sets more, or at least the practice tests. Problem sets were from the textbook, could be found on chegg, and were overall too easy.",
                "The class was not well organized sometimes and the material was often rushed through, to the point that I often did not fully understand concepts.",
                "The course, while it moved very fast, had a logical order to introduce new concepts and tie them to old ones",
                "Very well taught, easy to follow material",
                "Strengths: the class provided a good overview of this type of physics. However, since the class moved a bit slower, perhaps we did not cover as much material as we did in Physics 180. Problem sets were straightforward and the professor was easily available over Zoom office hours. Professor Ghiassi-Nejad is a great personality who is super dedicated to seeing his students learn and succeed in the class. Weaknesses: class this semester wasn't always the most organized; sometimes Professor Ghiassi-Nejad had difficulties answering students' questions, although he was always ready and willing to help. Unlike last semester, I often had to read the textbook to supplement what I learned in lecture."

                "Yes. As a mechanical engineering major deciding initially between this class sequence and the 200/201 physics sequence, I would 100% recommend 180/181. I have friends in the 200/201 sequence who are arguably learning more interesting physics, but the pain and suffering they go through on a weekly basis do not validate that decision. They spend 6-8 hours each week in office hours struggling through psets whereas I often do the psets in class while taking minor notes on the lectures, leaving me with little work outside class. I would rather spend these extra hours on other classes that are more interesting/learn physics myself in my spare time than go through the struggles of 200/201. Furthermore, Mehdi (and Adrianne for 180) is a fantastic prof, he really cares about student learning and goes out of his way to make him available to us. The teaching staff for 180/181 are truly sweethearts, and you definitely don't need the more advanced theoretical background from 200/201 to succeed as an engineering major. (Also fair warning, your class will be 90% pre-med students who are constantly confused by physics.)",

                "I would only take this course if you need it as a prerequisite class or are really passionate about physics. If not, it is a difficult, fast-paced course.",
                "I would only recommend this class if it is required or you are really interested in the subject. It is very challenging.",
                "I would recommend. Professor G really cares about his students and tried his best to explain things many ways until students can understand!",
                "Absolutely not, avoid at all costs (unless taught by Prof. Steinacker!). If you have to take this class for your major, good luck, otherwise do not take it.",
                "Unless you really have to take it, I do not recommend.",
                "This class gives you a very broad overlook of physics, which I appreciate. If you are a premed student deciding which physics course to take, I would recommend this one if you're looking for more applicability.",
                "Not really unless it's recommended for your major - just another difficult STEM class. I do think the professor is kind and not bad, but the exams are very difficult and I didn't feel prepared for them via just the lectures and homework.",
                "No, only if need as a prereq.",
                "I took PHYS 200 in the fall, and I regret not sticking with that sequence. I really did not learn much, but if you are engineering and need to fulfill prereqs easily, this is the best class.",
                "The majority of the students taking this class is pre-med, and it is clear that most students do not choose this class because they are passionate about physics.",
                "Yes! This is a great intro to electricity and magnetism. It is a very solid course and you will absolutely come out of it having learned physics.",
                "I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course for fun but its really not that bad. The homework is fair and the tests are ok. Mehdi is a really nice teacher and he wants every student to succeed. You're probably required to take this course for your major, so if you have to it will be fine.",
                "If you are asking if you should take this course, then you probably need to take this course for your major.",
                "Yes; as someone who switched from PHYS 170 to 181, 181 with Prof. Ghiassi-Nejad was so much better. He taught in a way that was logical and easier to understand, and he made class very entertaining and interesting. I learned a ton throughout the semester without feeling totally burdened by the work. If you can take physics with Prof. Ghiassi-Nejad, absolutely do it.",
                "Yes, the course was very useful for future courses I will have to take.",
                "Acknowledging that the content is always going to be relatively challenging, yes, I think that I would recommend this course, especially if the student felt that they would benefit from the teaching style I described.",
                "only if you need for a prerequisite/major requirement",
                "Yes. Its mainly a requirement, but it was far less stressful with Dr. Ghiassi.",
                "If required",
                "yes. definately take it with prof. mehdi. he is super funny and teaches you that the most important thing is to be happy and learn something and just be concerned about grades. the probelms were fun and the class is fair",
                "I think physics is super interesting, and this class was pretty low workload for anyone interested in the subject. That being said, it might be a bit dry if it is not a course you have to take. Just for fun, other physics courses might be more interesting.",
                "I would say take this course over 171. However, if you had some sort of AP Physics in high school, I'd say take 201 or 261.",
                "Yes!",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course unless it is a requirement for a major",
                "Yes! Phys 181 is a foundational course that gets you ready for higher level science courses at Yale. The class was a bit disorganized // hard to follow with the curve sometimes, but overall was solid, and the professor does try hard to make sure his students understand what is going on.",
                "Yes, it is interesting to learn about these topics, and especially if it is required for your major/track.",
                "Yes",
                "If it's a prerequisite.  This course is also a pretty good survey of E&M physics, so if you are interested in its content this would serve you well.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches a lot of information important to other classes and the workload was not too much.",
                "I mean, if you have to take it for your major, take it. Otherwise, there are better science credits.",
                "Only take it if you have to, and if you dont have the level of Maths required for 200/201.",
                "Absolutely, the sections of electrical circuits was very interesting, especially when covered at the same time at the PHYS 166L lab.",
                "Sure!",
                "Not really it was hard and a lot of work and I never really felt prepared for the tests despite studying very hard",
                "I would recommend this course if you have to take physics. It's structured pretty similarly to a high school physics class.",
                "If you are taking this course you probably have to. This class is not an easy one, but at the same time Dr. Ghiassi-Nejad tried to make it as digestible as possible. There's not too much to be said about recommending this class. If you need to take it you will. The math in the class is not too complex.",
                "Yes! Mehdi is a great lecturer and his assignments and exams are very reasonable.",
                "No unless you really love physics. The people who have already taken physics have an advantage because we don't go over all concepts well in class, and the homework does not match the caliber of the exams.",
                "Most of the time this is a prereq so only take because of that. Otherwise do something else for a science credit.",
                "If required for your major or if you're very interested in physics.",
                "Only if needed for major or for premed. There are more fun and approachable ways to learn physics than this class. Will probably be a totally different experience though when Professor Steinacker returns.",
                "If you are taking this course, you most likely need it for your major, but if it is not for your major, I probably would not recommend this course.",
                "It was a good course and I now have a general understanding of physics and physics-problem-solving that I can take to my other STEM courses",
                "Yes, useful pre-requisite and not too difficult to succeed",
                "Yes, based on what I've heard, this class is much better than Physics 170/171. You learn much over the course of the class and leave with a solid grasp of physics that you can apply to future courses, etc."
