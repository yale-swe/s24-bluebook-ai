                "By taking DS Literature, I became a far stronger writer, annotator, critical thinker, and speaker. I gained a much better understanding of historical events in the Western canon, compromising Greek and Latin culture. Taking DS was a big event for me, stepping out of my comfort zone. Although DS advertised itself as a program that was welcoming to students with no experience in the humanities, as I was, I was still scared of the learning curve I had to surmount in the face of many students who were well-versed in these texts. I learned how to manage my time better and, with encouragement from Professor Kreiner, approach each text with curiosity and a spirit to learn something new rather than a sense of just \"getting through it.\" I truly learned the importance of these texts and the significance of learning them. As a lover and writer of historical fiction, I feel that my worldview and perspective on the past have grown exponentially. I also learned how to think and extract thematic meanings from texts. We faced a variety of perspectives and opinions throughout the different writers we read, and learning to dissect their arguments and understand where they are coming from based on circumstance, environment, and upbringing is something I feel will benefit me as I prepare to major in Global Affairs or Ethics, Politics, and Economics. Overall, the new knowledge, skills, and insights I gained and developed during this course were invaluable."

                "The strengths of DS Literature lay in the syllabus of works, the discussion-based format, the intimate classroom sizes, the professors, the guest lectures, and the essays. The syllabus of works is far-reaching, expansive, thoughtful, masterfully curated, significant, and enjoyable. Each reading built off the last in some way, and my class was always making connections between books we had read prior. The discussion-based format, in my opinion, was the best way for the class to function. The professor started by asking an open-ended question, usually on the context of the writing or author, and our answers would guide the discussion. Our classroom sizes were about fifteen students each. This was really great. Not only did I make some really amazing friends in my sections, but I also felt it gave everyone an equal chance to speak and share their opinions. The professors were amazing and nothing but helpful. This extends into our guest lectures. All were enthusiastic and filled with amazing information, allowing me to conceptualize our readings better. The essays were also a really great part of the course. Professor Kreiner and my other DS professors would give us essay topics about two weeks before they were due, allowing us ample time to plan, outline, and write. The essay topics were expansive and thought-provoking, and we were also allowed to propose our own topics. Overall, I do not have any weaknesses on the part of the course that I consider. I think the classes would benefit from being longer. At the moment, they are one hour and fifteen minutes long. Sometimes, our discussions would be so interesting, but we would need more time to go deeper or address a certain topic. This is just a nitpick, however. I have no cons about the course."

                "Yes, I recommend DS Literature and Directed Studies in general to another student. The attitude on campus toward DS is that it is a massive undertaking that many do not enjoy. However, I disagree entirely. Through DS, I've met the most interesting professors and the most amazing students and learned so many amazing things. These are books and stories that most people intend to read during their lives but never get the chance or never find the time. The fact that I was able to experience all of these great works at eighteen years old and do it in an intellectually stimulating and supportive environment was amazing. It is a lot of work and a lot of reading. You'll have to think outside the box sometimes, and your essays may not always hit the mark you were wishing for, but overall, DS is a growing and learning experience. DS taught me so much about myself and others, about how I work and how I handle challenges. The self-reflection I gained from doing DS was amazing. I would most definitely recommend DS to another student. It's been an experience of a lifetime."
