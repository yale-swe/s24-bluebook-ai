The class would have benefitted greatly from a problem set component or a replication exercise so that the students could get practice actually conducting analysis using that method. Though the final project was meant to address this somewhat, it is hard to conduct original work and analysis in one semester because it often requires building a data set. Therefore, those students who do not start the class with data or a very well-defined research design don't get the most out of this class because they don't get the opportunity to practice implementing the methods.",

For the most part, each week is dedicated to learning about how to use a different method to accomplish a research goal or accommodate a certain kind of data. But it is not a course to really teach the art of *mixing* methods, which I am still a little bit unsure about.",
