                "Professor is great. Weakness is meeting 4/5 days a week.",
                "Strengths: Teaches you a lot\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes unclear expectations about what assignments require from you - for example, some activities seem like you could write a paragraph, but they will actually require a page of writing. (No warning - points are just taken off).",
                "It covers a wide array of topics. I would like more chances to present in front of the class to build speaking skills.",
                "Strengths -- meeting 4 days a week in person helped a lot with learning to speak the language. Having the LinguaMeetings really helped, as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- went through the grammar too quickly for it to absorb.",
                "Daily classes take a lot of time but mean you learn very quickly and have to keep on top of work.",
                "I think there was a lot of busy work that could have possibly been cut out but I think all the in class things were very helpful.",
                "Strengths: the rigor and daily requirement forces us to learn the language. I like the conversations and group work done in class because it encourages the students to bond and learn more about each other while practicing spanish. \r\nWeakness: there is an overreliance on VHL which can be a bad method for practice because it can sometimes have confusing questions and super specific answers that the students cannot naturally get to without having to use a peer's answers. Also, the writing requirement to get full credit on assignments can be ridiculous and strenuous on students when we have to write multiple paragraphs to do well on an assignment which incentives online resources like Google Translate being used.",
                "I think that the Wednesday free days are unhelpful. I would rather have class 4 days per week - or maybe Wednesday's could be dedicated to a Spanish drama series or something that immerse us in the language in a less active or involved manner (as to allow our brains to rest in a similar manner as the current schedule allows)."
