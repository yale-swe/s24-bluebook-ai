This class complemented my other plsc course, PLSC 342, very well, and taking both concurrently was fun.

We discuss broad topics such as international environmental agreements, bargaining, war, globalization & populist movements, trade policy, the international economy and more. I learned about the academic and strategic components that lay the foundation for much of the political and social rhetoric you hear in your day-to-day.\r\n\r\nI have walked away from this class with a firm understanding of international relations as a broad field and the many elements of the world political economy that it touches. I was struck by how consistent many of the ideas and themes are throughout time. Although our current global landscape seems outrageous and unprecedented, this class helped position many of this chaos as reactionary, logical and consistent with political developments throughout time.\r\n\r\nFor my final final, I analyzed quantitative data to build an argument about FDI.

                "Strengths: super interesting readings (and a pretty fair amount). super-well organized lectures that clearly explain material. Good sections that combine case studies, review, and analyzing specific theories from readings.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the course felt like it could have moved faster. We spent a lot of time, especially at the start of the semester, that I thought we could have moved through faster.",
                "Strengths: Cool concepts that are interesting to learn, especially if you have not been introduced to IR. Professor is a great lecturer.\r\nImprovements: Quizzes are difficult and don't really mirror class material well, making class a bit frustrating at times.",
                "Strengths: Very clear syllabus, organized structure, easy to catch up if you miss a class, clear dates and deadlines\/expectations set out in the beginning, material is thought-provoking and informative but not back-breaking\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Scheve is a political economist, so he likes to emphasize readings about international trade, development, and economics perhaps a tad too much. Nothing inherently wrong with that but be prepared to spend a lot of time on macro and models of trade and distributive politics. I didn't mind it but some people might.",
                "I liked the course's practical approach to international problems lots of the thinking involved the Prisoner's Dilemma.",
                "Strengths: Engaging and clear lectures\/sections, interesting material, helpful TFs, reasonable workload.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class was a bit too theoretical for me at times and it went really fast.",
                "it's definitely for people who are super interested in this kind of thing. I was often kind of bored in lecture but that's only because IR isn't really my thing.",
                "Strengths: many of the lectures were interesting and I enjoyed how it was 50 minute lectures. I specifically enjoyed the topics of international institutions, war, and treaties.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the multiple choice were heavily based on the readings, which we didn't really talk about. The multiple choice questions were often very hard to complete, also due to the wording of the questions. Also, we were never given feedback for our essay questions, which was confusing as we didn't know why we got points off, etc. Also, the units on globalization and trade were confusing especially as someone who does not have a background in macro.",
                "This is overall a terrible course - one of if not the worst I have ever taken in my life. The content can be easily self taught. The discussion sections are bland. The selected readings are not particularly interesting. The one strength is its quite east. Almost everything minus the final is take home. You can not ever go to lecture and still do fine in this class.",
                "Generally a strong lecture-format course. Scheve does a good job of delivering the information in an interesting way and there is little that I would improve about the course.",
                "Being more selective with the readings that were included and engaging more with them would have been appreciated.\r\nThe level of complexity was extremely basic.",
                "Strengths - I thought Professor Scheve's slides were incredibly organized, and made note-taking very easy. The information was very straightforward, and I enjoyed the distribution of material very much.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I would have liked if we discussed the readings in class more, or if we made the lecture-material tie in more directly with the nightly readings. Also, I would have liked if lectures were recorded.",
                "lots of content covered and interesting, very timely and informative when in tandem with major global events. does not honor label no prior knowledge required. strong upkeep with global politics required, basic game theory knowledge greatly assistive, game theory is frustratingly confusing otherwise. similar with global trade unit, will come easier if you have taken macroeconomics.\r\n\r\nbiggest gripe: class moves too fast, large and confusing terms consistently dropped without definitions, lectures become hard to follow.",
                "Strengths of this course included Professor Scheve's activities to increase engagement and add life to the lectures. He seemed genuinely committed to ensuring his students were getting as much out of the course material as possible. Strengths included the format of the class -- the quizzes, midterm and final were not intimidating whatsoever. All three types of exam were open note and either 48 or 24 hours long (excluding the final which was 3 hours long). I felt like this took pressure off memorization and focused more on the application of concepts we discussed in class.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this class was its failure to apply the big picture frameworks to real-world current events. I took this class Spring 2022 during the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine War. However, we only discussed the war during one portion of one class. I felt that this was a missed opportunity. Many of the real-world examples were historical ones from the 20th century. Meanwhile, there are many ongoing conflicts, legal discussions or economic problems that would have made great material for the class.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the class was the organization\/structure of the successive units. Sometimes I felt like our topics were a bit disjointed and random -- I would have appreciated a better sense of why we are studying **this** topic next and how it relates to **that** topic.",
                "The material was fascinating and broad in scope. The readings complemented lecture material very well and helped me learn how to read social science papers. Sections were very helpful as a supplement, particularly while we were writing our research papers.",
                "I think the discussion sections can be better structured as in follow the lectures and readings more accurately. I think the lectures were very well organized however engagement was a little bit difficult with the longevity of subjects.",
                "The lectures for this course were very information-heavy, and it was difficult to adequately digest the material at times. The readings were also not super relevant to lectures  they only really came up during exams, which was a little frustrating.",
                "Professor Scheve was a great lecturer and his slides were always very useful. Sometimes, the theory he would present in class felt a little disconnected to what we were discussing. I also really liked the research paper thats required in this courseIve never  written a political science paper before and it was a good way to familiarize myself.",
                "Strengths: the bargaining theory section (which explains why war happens) was good, the trade section was also insightful, paper project was good\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of the theory was very broad and not that applicable in many cases, also professor went extremely fast in class",
                "The lectures are good but sometimes I wish there was more structured discussion sections. Additionally, some of the readings were hard to understand",

                "strengths: interesting material, incorporated current events\r\nweaknesses: multiple choice on exams sometimes had ambiguous answers, final exam and final paper felt excessive",

                "The lectures are boring but the topics were interesting",
                "Interesting concepts but the actual course work did not require much engagement (open note, no checks on if readings were done, etc)",
                "Strengths: lectures were great, the content in lectures was engaging and concise, and the course content was really applicable to real-world events. For example, we learned about the bargaining model of war while the Russian invasion of Ukraine was happening and learned how to the predict the future course of events.\r\nWeaknesses: the readings were extremely long, but all the information wasn't entirely applied in the course",
                "The strengths were the engaging lectures. At times, the readings were a bit long.",
                "Strengths: The TAs can be helpful, Professor Scheve is really knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class doesn't teach much, it's a lot of common knowledge that is not helpful.",
                "Quizzes were very hard and hard to relate to the information in the course",
                "The course is incredibly engaging and educational, well organised, and designed well for students.  Readings and lectures are super interesting and applicable to current events.",
                "Strengths of the course are definitely the breadth of topics covered and discussed through section and lecture, giving me a really good idea of the different areas of political science, the ways in which one could conceivably take a quantitative approach to the field, and the different interactions the field has with other academic disciplines. Additionally, I really enjoyed the paper, as it allowed me to take my own individual interests and explore them further, albeit in a short space of time and thus limited somewhat in what I was able to cover.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect I would possibly change is the quantity (and perhaps relevancy) of the readings to what is in lecture. To my own fault, I did not do nearly enough of the readings for the class, but I think if more of the lecture was directly related to theses stated in the readings I would have been more pressured to do the readings. As in, because I could cope fine in the lectures without reading, I ended up often not completing them \/ not doing them at all, which was not conducive to an appreciation of the subject.",
                "The course assigned an overwhelming amount of readings , and considering that it was supposed to be entry level, made learning international relations very inaccessible and challenging due to the overly specific nature of quiz questions combined with large piles of reading. Several of my classmates have decided after this course that they did not want to continue studying international relations.",
                "Strengths: Application to current events, fair workload \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lacks nuance",
                "The strengths of this course include great lectures by Prof. Scheve and well-designed sections. There is no major weakness.",
                "Strengths: professor, great TA, interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses: All information given in class was read from slides",
                "My strengths were be able to talk about the topics and discuss the ideas with my peers. My weaknesses were completing the midterm and final, and showing my knowledge onto assessments.",
                "Good",
                "I have no major notes for this course.",
                "This courses quizzes were harder than they needed to be. I liked the lectures.",
                "Strengths:\r\n - Lecture slides are well-organized and encapsulate the most essential information.\r\n - Assessments are fair, grading is generally fair.\r\n \r\nWeaknesses:\r\n - The professor and TFs rarely or subtly mentioned the readings during class, leaving students lost and confused on the most salient points. Students would benefit from more mention of class readings in lecture and section discussion.\r\n - I found parts of lecture to be difficult to follow. At times, I struggled to see the relevance of certain examples briefly mentioned but never explained in-depth.\r\n - Lectures on globalization, free trade, protectionism, and populism felt repetitive.\r\n - At the beginning of the course, I suggest a lecture or section dedicated to how to read social scientific papers and interpret quantitative findings.",
                "While lectures were very informative, I would have hoped the course was a bit more engaging.",
                "I think we spent a bit too long on globalizationI know there's an enormous amount to talk about, but I thought it got a bit stale compared to the diversity of the previous topics. Other than that the class material was excellent. I wish there was some way to further incentivise doing the readings, as there were long periods of time where I stopped doing them, simply because they weren't necessary, although I would've liked a forcing mechanism. I also quite enjoyed how the lecture would frequently become interactive, whether with talking to people sitting nearby or answering online surveys.",
                "Interesting lectures, but the content could be much more clearly given. Sometimes the wording or structure of the lectures was a little hard to learn from, but it was overall good.",
                "The lectures were not engaging. The slides were simply read back to students. Maybe include one-page summaries with major topics at the end of each lecture. The engagement with students during lecture, however, was helpful and productive.",
                "good lectures, structure could be better integrated with sections for continuity."

                "Absolutely. Great class, especially if you haven't taken a PoliSci class before. Great prof and super interesting content.",
                "Clearly structured, which is nice, but difficult to justify taking unless you absolutely need it for your major.",
                "Not really, but yes if you're going for a prereq requirement for EP&E. Grading is tricky, especially for multiple choice and true\/false in midterms.",
                "Yes, absolutely. This is the intro IR course so if you have any interest in IR, take it.",
                "Yes, if looking to fulfill a EP&E prereq, it's a good intro to poli sci course.",
                "Fine for an introduction class. The sections were really disappointing - more debate + engagement would really help.",
                "yes, if you are interested in IR",
                "Yes",
                "No. Unless you want an easy grade or need it for your major. Could easily be a fifth or sixth class if you have to take it. There was nothing in this class that I felt I could not have easily learned on my own.",
                "Yes; if you're interested in the subject matter you will find the class manageable and entertaining.",
                "Yes. Low effort, good lectures.",
                "Yes! If you're interested in IR, then this is definitely an incredibly valuable class that gives you an overview of the major topics in IR. I thought unit 3 on war was the most interesting, and I definitely looked forward to class most during that period of time most. There are a lot of readings, and I started falling behind on the readings toward the end, but I think the trick is just allocating the work evenly so that you're not cramming at the last minute before the final.",
                "tentatively recommend. can be extremely confusing at times and extremely long readings with difficult jargon and methodological sections. interesting concepts at the end of the day though.",
                "Yes! This class is a very low-stakes introduction to International Relations. I was never worried about my grade or overall performance, so it helped me focus on learning the actual material. I did feel like I learned about concepts that were applicable to other classes and will serve me well in the future as an EPE major. That being said, I wasn't always super engaged with this class because it did feel super low stakes.",
                "yes if you are interested in foreign affairs",
                "Yes. It is an excellent course to learn more about international anarchy and the role of international organizations in trade and conflict.",
                "I would recommend this course to any students who want an introduction to international relations or, more broadly, the social sciences.",
                "I would warn a student that this is a fair introduction to the subjects but not as engaging as other courses at yale.",
                "Unless you're an EP&E major, probably not. It's a little dry, and there's a lot of memorization-heavy concepts. Another more specific PLSC class might be more useful\/interesting.",
                "I would if you are interested in international relations and are okay with learning primarily about theoretical frameworks.",
                "Not really, I feel that the course is too separated from real-world issues and too theoretical so it is hard to apply. Additionally, I don't think the theory part was covered in depth either so it felt like I didn't gain much from the class",
                "If they want an introduction to international relations from a realist perspective, yes. However, if you are simply interested in politics this course is misleading and not for you.",
                "Sure thing. Don't be fooled though, it can be surprisingly hard.",
                "would recommend! overall a good foundational course, especially if you need it as a prerequisite.",
                "I would. It's a solid class",
                "Yes, the course gives you the tools necessary to think about world problems and different ways of solving them. I think international relations as a field is really important for everyone to understand, and this course is a good introduction.",
                "If you are a political science major, yes",
                "Yes! Very interesting subjects covered. I learned a lot about how to think academically about current news topics.",
                "Yes - the course content was really applicable to so many real-world events we see every day and helps us understand how these events happen.",
                "I would recommend this course to a broad range of students",
                "Not unless this class is a prerequisite for another class",
                "Yes, I did not have any knowledge concerning international relations and this was a good class to start with",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course!  It is well taught, engaging, and teaches applicable theory and skills.",
                "I think it is a really good intro course, and does exactly what you expect in terms of introducing you to the different topics. It was difficult to accept the fact that only one lecture was spent on particular topics and there was little opportunity to discuss many topics due to the limited time in section and the need to prepare us for the paper, but in hindsight this is perhaps where intermediate courses allow us to engage further. I would recommend it to a student who wants to know what international relations covers, and more widely the approach of social scientists to research questions, whether that is through qualitative arguments or quantitative experiments.",
                "Unfortunately, this is a required course that does not rely on preference and instead must be taken. My recommendation does not matter, but a lot of word of mouth has dissuaded many other students from taking it.",
                "As long as you are okay with the classs strong economics influence and are interested in poli sci",
                "I would recommend this course to all students. This has been the most well-taught lecture course I have taken at Yale so far. Prof. Scheve gives engaging lectures with interactive activities. The sections are well-designed with case studies or introduction to the social scientific thinking. The workload is very manageable. A good course for both those who want to major in social science or those who are looking to fulfill distributional requirement.",
                "Fantastic introduction to international relations, exactly as the course promises. Interested in taking more classes like this, enjoyed it a lot.",
                "I would only recommend this course to someone if they are either planning to major in political science, or would love to learn about how countries interact with each other on the world stage. Unless someone is really interested in these topics, I wouldn't recommend the course to them.",
                "Good",
                "Yes, as an introductory course for first-years or sophomores. It serves as a great introduction to poli sci and social sciences in general. I don't know that I would recommend it to an upperclassman.",
                "Yes, but only if they are really interested in IR because doing all the readings carefully is important.",
                "I would recommend this course as a wide-ranging introduction to international relationsyou cover a breadth of the most important topics you see on the news, with a nod to international case studies. If political science is remotely of any interest to you, take this class!\r\n\r\nI would say that if what draws you to global affairs is the human impact of global trends, this class may feel a bit jarringit rarely acknowledges the actual human impact of phenomenons like war, climate change, and trade, rather essentializing people as states, institutions, and populations.",
                "If the student was interested in IR.",
                "Yes, absolutely. People need to learn how nuanced every problem in the world is. They need to know how and why the international system is the way it is, and what is within the realm of possibility. This class has a very low workload, since you don't actually need to do the readings, and it's only one paper. If you're at all interested, check it out.",
                "Yes. It's fun to learn how countries interact with each-other, and - if they do the readings - there's a lot you can learn from the course.",
                "I would recommend to students who need to take this course as a pre-req.",
                "good survey intro, not a painful requirement to complete at all."
