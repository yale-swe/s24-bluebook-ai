I came into this course having a weak command of written Spanish and barely being able understand spoken spanish at a normal speed. I was very shy to speak as well. I now feel that I can speak and write Spanish in a usable way, and I can comprehend spoken Spanish very well. This class has given me lots of knowledge about grammar and vocabulary, but most importantly it has given me the skills to have meaningful, conversation-speed interactions with people in Spanish.",

One small note is that it was a bit hard to know when to volunteer an answer in class without cutting someone else off, but that is just a product of Zoom.

I enjoyed I also felt that the workload was reasonable for 1.5 credits, and the assignments were clear and worthwhile .",
