                "I mainly learned how to investigate primary sources and historical documents, and analyze those to gain a greater understanding of the history of the times in which they were written. The name of the course \"Significance of American Slavery\" is very misleading, because we in no way really discovered the \"Significance of American Slavery\". I think the title of the course is trying to claim way too much. However. what we did explore was interesting. This course does not go past the movements towards the civil war. So you do not explore the civil war, reconstruction in the south, the Jim-crow south, and the civil rights movement, by any means. Rather, this course explores the beginning of American Slavery in the Carribean, and then up into the United States. You study the transatlantic slave trade, slave truancy, plantation life, and abolition movements in the north. And you use primary sources to do it. Thus, while before I felt like I had been taught about slavery in more broad terms, this course forced me to really look at it all face on, reading and exploring individual's experiences with it, and thus the true pain and anguish of it.",

                "Strengths- reading the primary sources did provide a better insight into what slavery was actually like. It is not enough to understand the numbers or concepts behind slavery. To truly understand how devastating it was I think it's important to look at individual's experiences with it and of it. And this course did a good job of that. Additionally, we did peer editing of each other's writing in class, and this did help me get a better idea of what good historical writing should look like. \r\nI also really like the Rugemer would cold call us at the beginning. This instilled in us the necessity of reading the homework so we could contribute in class. Later down the line we would then step up ourselves and share insights, and he did not need to cold call. But those initial weeks of it showed us we had to stay on top of work, which ultimately made it a better class. \r\nWeakness - Professor Rugemer didn't exactly enlighten us with our conversations. We did the readings (which is a lot but you learn to skim) and then would discuss them in class. But I didn't feel like Prof presented the most insightful questions for us to dig reallyyyyy deep. Sometimes it felt like we were more staying on the surface of the concepts.\r\nAdditionally, and maybe this was because of the zoom life, Professor Rugemer  was often disorganized about when assignments were due, and what assignments included what work. This sometimes made it hard to present my best work, because I wasn't always entirely sure what I was supposed to do.",
                "This course covered a lot of fascinating and unique elements of the lived experience of american slaves. I liked how in-depth we were able to go on each topic even thoughts course covered a large breath of history. I did think the course could be a bit better organized though.",
                "Strengths: Good discussion with many interesting texts. Professor Rugemer was knowledgable and engaging during class. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Class was disorganized with deadlines always being changed. Texts were too long to possible complete every week.",
                "There was quite a lot of reading and it sometimes felt like we read a lot just for the sake of reading it without a lot of discussion about its meaning. It might be better to cut down the reading list to allow more time to discuss each piece. (Maybe a result of the shortened semester)",
                "This course was really strong and engaging throughout. I think the readings could be reduced slightly in length, but other than that I enjoyed the way it was structured."

For the class to be good for you, you also have to be very interested in the topics or you may feel unmotivated to complete some readings. Class is more history based than writing.",

Sometimes our discussions were not as high-energy as I had hoped, but I think most of that was a product of a small seminar and an online format.",
