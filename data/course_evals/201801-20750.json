    "More guidance in dissection techniques",
    "The dissections were sometimes a bit confusing, and it was difficult to know if we were actually seeing all that we were supposed to be seeing. This could maybe be improved by having instructional throughout the dissection to make sure everyone is on the same page.",
    "The strengths are getting to work with different species. Some of the labs could have used more structure.",
    "The tests counted for way too much of the course, given that almost everyone got a 100% on the homeworks\/labs. One missed question on a midterm meant a letter grade drop. Ouch.",
    "Strengths include easy to follow lab manuals. Improvements: difficult to study for exams as most of what was done in class was identification and not learning about the systems in depth."
