It's essential programming literacy, but it feels like you learn so incredibly much because you're able to program things you'd have thought are unimaginable without years of prior experience if you had no programming experience (like me) before taking this course.",
                "I learned how to code",
                "Nothing. The teaching was terrible. Worst intro class you can ever take. Lectures were disorganized, fast, and pointless. The TAs in section were pretty useless as they didnt know how bad the lectures were. Instead of teaching us, they just introduced the next pset (way before any of us could start it since we usually needed a late day) and it wouldnt make sense. Office hours were poorly timed for anyone who has commitments in the afternoon (everyone).",

                "Strength: interesting psets every week, only one midterm, a final project to put things together",
                "Strengths: good pacing, order of material made sense, I felt that the psets were a good difficult\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes we did not cover everything that was necessary for a pset when it was released. There was also no discussion between section leaders / Professor Barron about where we were in lecture so we would sometimes do things in section that made absolutely no sense because we hadn't covered that material yet. For both lecture / section, there were a few times where there was simply way too much information for the given amount of time.",
                "Strengths: psets are good and challenging. rarely felt totally overwhelmed. lots of opportunities to pick up points and not centered on the tests\r\nWeaknesses: lecture can be long and drag on a bit. required section, which was helpful but the course is a really big time commitment",
                "I think the course starts off very strong, but then gets very advanced for someone with no coding experience whatsoever. Also, it is very difficult to stay engaged in lectures because the complexity of the code that is being analyzed is often a lot. Also, there is not enough emphasis put on how to think about the algorithms that you are trying to create.",
                "I loved the psets because they were always something fun, but the class itself is very difficult. I had a hard time applying what was taught in class to our weekly pset assignments, but if you want to do well, you DEFINITELY have to go to office hours.",
                "Because this course is in a fast paced but long lecture format, I think having access to the slides at the start of class would be very helpful so students can annotate the slides and or follow along from a smaller screen. However, it is very nice that the lectures are recorded, and the discussion sections are well organized (and appropriately on Thursdays at the start of the pset period) to facilitate the learning of new content.",
                "I sort of wish the lectures had been a little more interactive. I suppose you could code along as Tim went through applications in VS Code during lecture, but that wouldn't be the most practical when you're still just trying to grasp the concepts. I loved doing the psets, but the lectures themselves weren't always the most engaging.",
                "Strengths - The psets are generally interesting and engaging, and the TA's are very helpful when it comes to tackling any issues with your code. \r\nWeaknesses - lectures are not very engaging, and slides were usually only posted a day later; it would have been very helpful to have the slides / skeleton code examples earlier to be able to follow along during lectures.",
                "Strengths: fair psets, fair midterm, overall not a difficult class at all. Weaknesses: sometimes lectures were a bit dry/un-engaging. The course would befit from 3 times a week 50 minute lectures instead of two longer ones.",
                "I think a lot of the psets we do are too complex for our level of beginner and some feel too separated from what we are actually learning",
                "No strengths of this course. Genuinely the worst class I have ever taken in my life. I was super excited about learning CS and now I hate it and will never take it again. Much better to take CS50",
                "It takes a lot of time to learn how to code so expect to spend a good amount of time outside of class to work on weekly assignments. The course does, however, provide a TON of office hours and one-on-one assistance with those assignments, so take advantage of them. It is a great course but you have to put in the work to get past the finish line.",
                "Strengths: Interesting psets, wonderful and approachable staff, lots of freedom with the final project, engaging lectures, very approachable and accessible to all backgrounds!",
                "Strengths: Some of the TA's were really helpful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: So much. The lecture material was not taught very effectively and most of my learning was from the TA's at office hours or by trial and error while I completed the PSET's. I would not take another class with Professor Barron honestly. I wish I had just taught myself CS over the summer on Youtube and then taken CS 201 in the fall, or I wish I had just taken CS 50. The lectures were not engaging and were very difficult to sit through. Some of the PSET's were way too hard and even the TA's said they did not really understand how we were supposed to do them. I never felt adequately prepared to do the PSET based on what we had covered in class/section. Many of my friends who were in the class with me dropped. Sometimes I lost points on the PSET for things that had not been explicitly told to us in the instructions. The PSET instructions were also really unclear sometimes. Professor Barron was also very difficult to communicate with over email or after class. There were also frequently clear mistakes in grading that I had to point out in order to make sure I was given the credit I had earned.",
                "I loved how interesting the psets were, I also think the course doesn't prepare you at all for the midterm. The final project was fun.",
                "I think generally, the progression of the course was well-organized in that each pset built on previous ones in productive and interesting ways that rewarded staying engaged. \r\n\r\nThe last month of the class was definitely the worst - we rushed through swing and then were expected to use it for the final project, and I think most people felt pretty unequipped to do so, especially with inconsistent office hours (I would have liked the course instructor/manager to be more present at the last few office hours).",
                "Too much work, bad section materials",
                "The course requires a moderate amount of work from students. Lectures could be more engaging.",
                "Lecture could be a bit more engaging, and we definitely should've covered GUI interactions more thoroughly because I had to teach it to myself to do the final project.",
                "Strength: The problem sets became increasingly interesting as they grew in complexity, and I ended up building software that I was proud of and that I can see the use of. I also was able to appreciate the coding behind the technology I use every day.\r\nWeakness: I think that the midterm test being on paper was strange given that all of the coding we do was on the computer. I don't know if there are lockdown browsers or other ways to take a test on the computer while still maintaining academic integrity, but I think that changing that test to digital would more fully simulate the actual coding we do in the class and beyond.",
                "More live demos in lecture",
                "Lots of work, but worth it. You really get a good foundation of the basics, and some intermediate concepts.",

                "YES! I seriously think more people at Yale should be taking Computer Science. It gets a bad reputation but it is such a valuable skill set for anyone. I think the course does a great job at having examples that relate to the arts / non-STEM areas which is really great to see. I wish more people took this course!\r\n\r\nDo not be intimidated by the workload or what others say. As an upperclassmen in this course (lol), I think the high workload rating is because first-years (who are the majority of course participants) are not used to more rigorous courses where going to office hours / section is really helpful and almost necessary. I have definitely taken courses that are much more difficult with more work in non STEM departments. I also found the work to generally be very interesting -- CS is just problem solving!",
                "Yes -- it's somewhat required for the major but it's also just a really helpful class. I'd take this and CS50 if you have the time/energy",
                "I would not recommend. I think depending on your experience level the problem sets can take a tremendous amount of time and the resources available for the class are not structured in a good manner so it can be difficult to learn more about a concept you are struggling with.",
                "I would recommend it if you have no other classes that will need a lot of attention. I went to office hours about 14 hrs every week, and still worked on my psets outside of that time. Only take this class if you feel you're able to apply new concepts very easily and quickly.",
                "Yes I would. I enjoyed the problem sets and feel like I have gained a valuable skillset that I will take with me.",
                "I absolutely would recommend -- it was a lot of fun, and I think understanding how programming works is good knowledge to have regardless of where your career path takes you. Taking this course, though, has definitely made me seriously consider going into some sort of computing-related major.",
                "Absolutely! It's not very difficult and it's so important to know how to program in today's world. This is probably the most useful class I have taken at Yale thus far.",
                "I'm not sure if I would entirely recommend it. Some people find the class easy but I found it unnecessarily difficult. Maybe if this is their only tough class.",
                "Never in a million years. Stay away from this class. Trust me.",
                "Yes, if the student is interested in programming or a potential major in computer science. It introduces a lot of great concepts that can be applied in other fields but the real goal is to turn you into a programmer. If you don't think you'd want to use programming in your life or be a computer science major, it might be better to take a different programming course tailored to another discipline (e.g. programming for engineers, arts, etc.)",
                "Yes! I came into this course with no coding experience whatsoever, and I'm leaving this course with an excellent understanding of how to build programs with confidence. The prof, course manager, and ULAs were always encouraging. The psets always had an interesting focus across disciplines (music, natural language processing, animation, etc) which made them more fun to complete given how many hours you put into them. The workload of this class may seem scary, but by starting psets EARLY and going to office hours OFTEN, you can minimize the stress and actually enjoy this class! If you put your best effort into psets, the rest of the class (midterm, final projects, attendance) will be smooth. The final project gives you a great opportunity to be creative and explore CS more.",
                "Genuinely, no. This course is not worth it and is very poorly taught compared to other courses at Yale. I'm not even saying this because I got a bad grade. It just genuinely was not a good course. Please learn computer science in any other way. The PSET's will take you way too long and you will not be prepared by the lectures to complete them. You will basically be teaching yourself how to do a lot of stuff, so you may as well teach yourself in a lower-stakes environment. If I did not have a natural inclination for science-y stuff I do not know how I would have done this course.",
                "Yes, its better than cpsc100.",
                "No, bad introduction for little payoff. Would recommend higher level or not doing computer science at yale",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in programming or getting a start in computer science.",
                "Don't take it for a QR--way too much work--but take it if you want to learn basic computer science. The way of thinking is more useful than the actual language/syntax, and I feel like I grasp both now.",
                "I would recommend it if they were looking for a challenging introduction to CS, but would likely not recommend it as a supplemental class to take for fun.",
                "Someone in CS or that wants to learn Java",
                "I thought this course was fantastic, but only if you are really able to commit to spending lots of time on the problem sets. They are very rewarding, but I think would be quite unenjoyable and overwhelming if one was not ready to devote many hours a week to them. If you make this class a priority, it is a great and interesting way to learn how to code. I came in with minimal coding experience, and by the end of the class I was able to code an entire game from start to finish in Java.",
