                "I really enjoyed the readings and the course material. Professor Amanat's book is really well-written and I enjoyed reading it and learned a lot. I also found the lecture handouts to be very helpful. \r\n\r\nI get that the transition to online learning is really hard, especially for older professors.\r\n\r\nThat said, course was disorganized. I still haven't gotten midterms back as I write this, and Professor Amanat has expressed that he does not know whether midterms or finals are going on right now. There didn't seem to be a plan for any of the lectures, there was a lot of jumping from topic to topic, half the time was spent looking at pictures in no particular order which I felt was just way too much, and there was almost never any kind of powerpoint accompaniment that would have made it easier for non-Persian speaking students to take notes on the Persian words. Professor Amanat also did not know how to use Canvas or Google Docs, so a lot of time in lecture or section taking quizzes was spent figuring out how to work around that. Professor Amanat frequently stopped lecture to reprimand students for having their camera backlit, having their camera at an angle that was too high, and insisted that we leave our cameras on if we have to go to the bathroom, in a way that I felt was a distraction to everyone's learning and oddly hostile and accusatory. The lectures consistently ran 20 minutes overtime or more.",
                "The course was very engaging",
                "Strengths: The material is interesting and the lectures were often enjoyable. Professor Amanat is very knowledgeable and is a good teacher.\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of reading and we rarely had time to discuss it all in section. Also, there was not a lot of guidance on certain assignments, including the papers and the book reports.",
                "The lectures and readings were both really insightful. I also enjoyed the assignments and the freedom we had with our papers and book reports.",
                "Incredible teacher who made great efforts regarding attention to detail, it was truly an honor to take this class",
                "I honestly do not recommend this class to anyone. There was no PowerPoint to assist with visual aids, Persian words, or help students stay engaged in the course material. This was especially hard on me when Amanat went on tangents. I felt a powerpoint would have greatly helped with the organization of the course and Amanat's lectures. On the other hand, we spent time going over powerpoints with only pictures of people or events we had covered in other class lectures. On these days, we learned nothing and just watched as Amanat flipped through pictures to discuss their time frame and context. It was incredibly useless. We never received our midterms until we had to submit our finals, so it was hard to gauge what to improve upon for the final assignment. Really, I only liked Prof. Amanat's book, but the course itself is not helpful"

                "Prof. Amanat was incredibly disrespectful and surprisingly non-accomodating for COVID-19 learning. He had a policy to dock participation points off of students who did not have their cameras on during the live lectures (which I guess I understand), but if students quickly turned them off to use the bathroom or respond to something in their immediate surroundings (since we weren't taking the class in a classroom you would expect some background distraction from roommates, animals, parents, or other stimuli that would unexpectedly interrupt a student's learning), Prof. Amanat would stop the lecture to scold the student until they turned their camera back on. The docking of points for these situations was ridiculous, and he posted a patronizing Canvas update describing that participation points would be removed \"in the unlikely event you have to turn it [your camera] off.\" This was incredibly off-putting and honestly soured the entire class for me. Not everyone has a home environment or background where they would be able to keep their camera on the entire time, and Amanat refused to entertain this at all. I would not recommend taking a class with him ever, but even less so under a pandemic or online leraning."
