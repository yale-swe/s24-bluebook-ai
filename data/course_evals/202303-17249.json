We learned about a wide range of models that explain species interactions, species dispersal, and the distribution of biomes and biodiversity across the planet, with a little bit of EPS, economics, and anthropogenic activity sprinkled throughout the course.",

I especially appreciated the insights I gained into deeply relevant topics that we discussed and debated in class discussions. Topics included effective conservation practices, fire management, misleading carbon mitigation approaches, and a day spent discussing the 2013 IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Report and its impact. It was really refreshing to learn about climate change in a class in a systematic and scientific way.",
                "I feel I did not take away much for the way this course was taught.",
                "I learned a lot about plant ecology, and the course was very math-intensive. It did not cover much that I didn't already know about climate change, and I was very disappointed that it did not include ocean ecology or a very strong focus on animals.",
                "Applying mathematical models to ecological concepts, understanding how earth systems influence distributions of species, and thinking about likely changes to current ecosystems due to climate change",
                "I was given a pretty comprehensive foundation for ecology, and a thorough introduction to the topics in the field. We were provided many examples for each idea, which was helpful and grounding. I read lots of interesting, real-world papers on a wide range of topics, and discussed them with classmates productively!"

                "I think there should be clearer feedback on some of the psets -- most of the time they'd just take off points but not indicate why it was wrong, which was a bit frustrating.",
                "The course was well-organized. I like that we had a final paper instead of a final exam.",
                "honestly the discussions where we talked about readings with our classmates were not very enriching. I'd axe those",
                "Strengths: The community! Professor Staver, Marie, and Emmanuel were all really supportive and helpful throughout the entire course -- I always found the opportunity to attend office hours and discussion section to be really helpful. You will also likely meet individuals in the course who are similarly dedicated towards E&EB and protecting the environment -- our class was a particularly friendly group! The material is fascinating, and you will learn a lot about modeling, ecological communities, and anthropogenic climate change. The final paper was really fun to write!\r\nWeaknesses: The main challenge is that understanding models that can be quite quantitative and theoretical, without having to understand the actual math behind them. As a result, the exams can be challenging to study for, but this is more related to the material than the course itself. \r\nHowever, as long as you pay attention to the main points of the readings and try to understand the central ideas behind each of the models, you should be on the right track!",
                "Big jumps from class content to psets, and then in office hours the TAs aren't allowed to give you too direct answers so sometimes you just don't know how to answer questions at all",
                "I think the class in general is just not that good every year, so it has nothing to do with the professor. It was just really hard for a neurodivergent person to completely grasp the content of the class which made the final paper extremely hard. I think the only good thing about this class was the professor and the teaching fellows.",
                "It was strong in that the class size was small so there was always time for questions. However sometimes there was a degree of dissonance of whether the things we talked about in class directly related to homework assignments, or just things we had to infer where the connection hadn't been explained in class previously and we were supposed to know it.",
                "professor made it harder than it had to be sometimes, R seemed unnecessary",
                "The lectures were interesting and Professor Staver found many relevant and compelling studies to demonstrate the concepts we learned. The problem sets were a challenge, but there were many office hours throughout the week where we could ask questions. Feedback was very systematic, clear, and well-organized. Overall, it was a great course!",
                "PLEASE look at a better way to teach this course. It feels very inaccessible to really take away the important lessons. This is such an important course for those in the major. It how one begins to see themselves doing research and using their degree. Yet this course didnt help do any of that.",
                "I would not recommend this course unless you most definitely have to take it. The professor explained concepts in a very nonchalant and dismissive way. It was clear that everyone in the class was confused. The problem sets were very difficult and covered information that we did not discuss or dealt with data that we collected but was highly inaccurate and variable. Often the TFs were even confused. The sections were a joke at best and often used as a study hall to work on the problem sets, but even those were not very productive. As mentioned above, the course only covered plant ecology and fundamental aspects of climate/global change which was very disappointing.",
                "Strength: this class gives exposure to a wide range of ecological concepts with conversations about important papers in the subject that have influenced major ways of thinking about ecology (island-biogeography concept, predator prey cycles, alternative stable states)\r\n\r\nWeakness: this class depends really heavily on being able to understand certain calculus and differential equations concepts that I dont think the ecology prerequisites prepare students for. I think this class needs a math review unit, optional or not, to at least provide resources for students with less solid math backgrounds. Additionally I think many students found the professors explanation of the math to be unhelpful and confusing which didnt help the problem. Math 116 is the perfect preparation for the math in this class, but few students had taken this class.\r\n\r\nThis has been an issue with this class for many years now based on the reviews of past years the class has been taught.",
                "Lectures were sometimes pretty engaging because of paper discussion. I actually did feel like these helped me to digest papers much more thoroughly. Discussion sections, however, were often not very fruitful, and I felt that this time could have been used more productively. PSets also often were confusing, and I didn't always feel prepared to do them from class."

                "Absolutely! Aside from the individuals who need to take this course to fulfill a major (such as E&EB), I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in conservation, climate change, modeling ecosystems, or solving other environmental issues -- my peers included aspiring environmental engineers, pre-meds, herpetologists, microbiologists, and conservationists, and I think we all took away something meaningful from the course.",

                "Yes, I think that it gives you an idea of the innerworkings of ecological concepts and how to model them which I found very interesting. It is also a pre-requisite for other ecology classes at Yale. However, it isn't for everybody, there was more math than I expected, and some of it felt very removed from real life. There's also the constant reminder that the models we fit aren't actually all that realistic/representative because populations are hard to model, so at times it make you question why you're studying them in the first place, but I think that's a flaw in the field and not necessarily the class.",

                "If you're interested in ecology, yes! Professor Staver is really smart and knows the field. I learned a lot from this class. I really enjoyed the lectures and the psets were challenging but interesting--when else are you going to get to calculate the amount of carbon stored in the trees on Hillhouse Avenue?",

                "I think it covered a lot of useful materials, but was always presented in the most organized way. It's a good introduction to ecology, but a lot of the harder science wasn't fully explained, so it left some to be desired. It wasn't the most engaging but with personal effort, a good amount could be gleaned from the course."
