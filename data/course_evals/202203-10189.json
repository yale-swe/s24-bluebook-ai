It was well organized and well taught. The guest speakers were great. The workshops were helpful. Great stuff!",

                "I would definitely recommend. It offers a great survey of multiple different types of creative writing genres and also helps create a portfolio to apply to other creative writing courses",

                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, if they have the remotest interest in any type of fiction they will certainly get a lot out of this classthe work is a lot of fun and something you can really be proud of, and you gain a significant appreciation for other fictional works.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, regardless of whether you have a lot of experience with creative writing or if you're just starting out. This class provides the opportunity to learn about creative writing in a low-stress and incredibly friendly and supportive environment, and by the end of it, you have a whole portfolio of work! I was in Professor Skilling's section, and it was wonderful!! Definitely take it with her if you can!",
                "this was one of my favorite classes at yale. i felt safe to express myself and write without worrying about getting a certain grade and i felt myself learning how to love learning again. the only weakness is that it's over, i would take this class again and again if i could :)",
                "No piece of creative writing that I could make in this recommendation would let you know how much I think you should take this course!! It's truly a gem at Yale. It is very accessible and working between the different mediums was really great. I'm sure all the sections are great, but I can't imagine anyone being a better teacher for this course than Emily. She gives such great feedback across all the different mediums and is just a light in the classroom. One of my favorite classes at Yale!"
