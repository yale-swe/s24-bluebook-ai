                "I developed a way to think about poetry and religion in a new way. In a way that intersects with one another and also diverges. I learned how to analyze poems--not just in the English way of analyzing them for literary devices, but in a way that really got at the heart of the meaning of the poem. I also learned the skill of how to think about religion in a context outside of a religious institution, and in a way that incorporated all denominations and meanings of faith. I also learned how to memorize poems, which is a skill I will cherish.",
                "I learned how to analyze poetry from a personal lens, as well as how to fill out ideas of important things like love, family, and home.\r\n\r\nThe poetry in this class has been a helpful foundation of reflection for me.",
                "The class is organized by topic. Each week we read poems about happiness, or joy, or suffering, etc. There were a couple weeks during the semester when we discussed the week's topic as a whole. For example, during the joy week. But class discussion was usually more focussed on reading individual poems. I felt like I became better at reading poems; at figuring out what difficult poems were saying. And why they are written the way they are written.",
                "I learned skills for close reading contemporary poetry",
                "The best part of this class were the discussionswhich, it being a seminar, constituted most of the classes. It was so powerful to have conversations about faith through the lens of poetry with a group of students with such diverse experiences of faith. They're the sort of conversations you don't really have with other students in the college.",
                "I learned a lot about my faith, that of my classmates, and how to approach looking at faith through different lenses.",

                "I developed an expanded idea about what faith is, connected to each of the themes in our anthology, such as happiness, joy, and family. I learned to see a through-line of faith in all poems. I reinforced a skill I had gained from other courses, which is to be able to engage with material in a way that is not stereotypically academic but is nonetheless intellectually stimulating."

            "comments": [
                "This course was so wonderful in teaching the value and weight of poetry--as more than a way of literature but as a window into life, and accessing higher meaning into life. I learned how to think about poetry as more than the words on the page, but as a living entity and work, with impressions and meanings that move beyond the language itself. I also learned about how faith, and ideas of faith, can be thought about beyond just the literature of the Bible or the Torah or traditions or beliefs. The discussion facilitated in this course, as well as the assignments of journaling, opened me up to a new way of seeing both poetry and faith. The journals in particular let me access parts of my mind and understanding I didn't know where there. I maybe thought I didn't have any impressions or understanding of a poem, but the journal let my mind run free, and allowed me to access and find new meaning I didn't realize existed.",
                "Strengths: poetry selection, teaching, group discussion\r\nWeaknesses: none, really",
                "One strength is the syllabus. Many of the poems that we read are masterpieces. And it was really helpful when Prof Wiman would intervene in class discussions to explain why they were so masterful. The weekly reading journal meant that everyone was coming to class with something to say about at least some of the poems. When people were excited, the class discussion could be great. But I sometimes felt like discussions were more Professor Wiman collecting comments than us talking to each other. While the number of poems assigned per week was reasonable, I still found it difficult to read 40-ish poems intensively, and so I think in class discussions there were often only a few people who had given real thought to a poem before class. I also wish that we had had more feedback throughout the semester.",
                "No weaknesses. Incredible course. Maybe one extra session of office hours earlier in the class wouldve been good.",
                "No weaknesses!",
                "This course is incredibly interesting and thought provoking. Class discussions were so insightful and very fun to be a part of. The format is definitely a strength, with our weekly reading journals and poems memorizations a few times in the semester. A weakness is that some weeks we had a ton of poems to read, like nearly 50, which was a lot and hard to appreciate all of them. Maybe shortening some of the readings would be good. But not by too much, because it was fun to start off class by everyone saying which of that weeks readings were their favorite.",
                "Strengths: thematic nature of the course/curriculum, poetry itself/reader, thoughtful students leading to thoughtful discussion, not too much reading \r\n\r\nWeakness: Perhaps the fact that the themes/way we discussed them felt very Judeo-christian   but also a product of who is in the class",
                "I think a strength is the balance between thematically-guided readings and open discussion. The readingsmany poems each weektake a lot of time, but are meticulously chosen and thus worth it. A weakness might be the loose structure of the content if thats something you dont like.",
                "More guided writing would be awesome.",
                "The course packet that Professor Wiman gave us was fantastic. I also really liked keeping weekly journals. The one suggestion I have would be to have the course meet two times per week instead of one. I did not feel that one meeting per week gave us enough time for discussion."

                "If you want to read great poetry in a way where your mind isn't stuck in the weeds of the poem--but you are able to access higher understanding and grasp great meaning from poems, then this is the class for you. We don't spend time debating punctuation. This class is about how the grander scope of the poem--what is it telling us about the meaning of life and faith and love and suffering. This class is about how seeing how a few stanzas can reveal grand truths about those great themes of life and death and beyond.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes, and you definitely don't need to be religious to learn from this class. It is a great opportunity to both read great poems and discuss faith. Just be prepared that it is a lot of reading, and discussions of poems can happen at a pretty high level. Also, while we haven't yet received final paper grades back, Prof Wiman seems like a pretty tough grader. But if you can put up with that and take it as encouragement to do your best work, then this is a wonderful opportunity to read the work of poets you may have never heard of and hear Prof Wiman's great analyses and stories. Also great to hear how other people  in the class think about questions of faith.",
                "Yes  best class Ive taken at Yale",

                "Absolutely  challenged my way of thinking about my own life and values and faith like no other class Ive taken here.",
                "yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course, though noting that you will appreciate relative to your level of investment. If you go in with the desire to be vulnerable with yourself and your classmates, you will be richly rewarded. And probably even if you dont, you will learn a lot from Professor Wiman, the poems, and your classmates.",
                "Yes. I happen to take a lot of courses that aren't traditional Yale courses, so this wasn't my first experience in which personal/spiritual enrichment and intellectual enrichment overlapped, but for those who haven't ever taken a course just for themself, I would tell them all about that but emphasize that it's not not serious about what it is. There was the additional element of a wonderful classroom environment that helped this to stand out even among those classes I have taken previously. It's very cool to be in a classroom with a professor who has worked out in the world among artists and can tell you the background of some poems personally, especially because we often think of analyzing poetry for meaning as guesswork. It's also awesome to be in an environment where people feel so comfortable sharing about their personal faith, whether that is religion based, atheistic, or anything else. Everyone is earnestly seeking, and we turn to the poems collectively to do it.",
                "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. Of all of the courses I have taken here, this is certainly my favorite.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in reading or writing poetry and are open to exploring questions of faith. I did not leave the class with any answers, but I definitely left with more questions (which is all you can ask for in a class about faith and art)."
