    "I learned how to read and write Hangul Korean and basic Korean grammar.",
    ". Although I wouldnt say Im the best at it, I really enjoyed this class. It was my favorite class this semester by far. Weve learned so much too; past tense, present tense, future tense and so many nouns and adjectives. Lets just hope I remember it all for L2.,",
    "This was my first semester of Korean, during which we covered basics: alphabet, pronunciation, greetings, and grammar. I was surprised at how much we covered in the course and how comfortable I felt with the material as the semester ended.",
    "Basic Korean grammar and vocab. Also, some info on Korean culture"

   "comments": [
    "The class was relatively easy and simple to follow, making it a low-stress class. However, the way the material was taught was a bit unorganized and I quickly fell behind because I couldn't mentally organize the information I was being given.",
    "Im really bad at listening and speaking in my opinion but my will to learn is very strong.",
    "I have no complaints about this course. It was rigorous, informative, and a lot of fun.",
    "The class attempted to give a mixture of learning on vocabulary and grammar as well as a cultural understanding even at the introductory level. I especially enjoyed the cultural presentation that students were to give. They were interesting and engaging while edifying students on another aspect of Korean culture that we are unable to talk about in Korean.",
    "The class helps us to develop multiple Korean skills (esp. speaking, listening, and writing), using interesting materials that never bored us"

   "comments": [
    "If the student is very interested in learning Korean, yes. If not, learn a different language.",
    "I recommend this class to everyone already.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course, though the decision to take it is more about whether that person is interested in Korean language. Given some interest, I would highly recommend the course and this instructor.",
    "Yes, it's really a great introductory class - not too much workload, but you'll know how enjoyable it is to use and learn Korean"
