The pace was also very nice.\r\n\r\nThe testing procedures could be improved, considering some students are remote from home. Not everyone lives in the same kind of households where we can have our mics unmuted for two hours.",
                "This class would really benefit from more peer tutors\/office hours in more days throughout the week. I found when I had questions I would have to wait days to have them answered because of how few tutoring resources were available, which negatively impacted my work. \r\n\r\nAlso, it would be very appreciated if explanations to the explore\/concept checks\/problem sets were posted after the due date to learn how to do the material since peer tutors weren't always available.",
                "Strength: Psests\r\nWeaknesses: Test format could be odd considering how we practiced in psets",
                "The level of teaching varies greatly, and it's unfortunate for those who are placed in sections with less-than-great instructors. Not sure why the classes are set up to have so many instructors teach small classes. I think it'd be better to have larger classes if that means more students have access to better instructors. Newer or less experienced instructors can listen in on these classes, but not teach them until they can match that high level of instruction.",
