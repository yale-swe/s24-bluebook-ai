    "This class helped me hone my Chinese speaking and listening skills. I learned a lot of new vocabulary and grammar patterns, including those used in formal Chinese writing.",
    "This course greatly expanded my knowledge of Chinese vocabulary and grammar structures. We read topical texts and focused on writing, reading, speaking and listening.",
    "Further advancement of Chinese language abilities and understanding of the Chinese culture",
    "Many new sentence patterns and chengyu \r\nA more in-depth knowledge of some social phenomena\/ problems in China",
    "I learned how to better speak and read Chinese in more formal settings and capacities.",
    "I improved my Chinese, mostly through vocabulary. Not much opportunity to freely speak Chinese in class."

   "comments": [
    "The small class size was really helpful. Assignments followed a consistent pattern. Overall, I think this course was structured and taught excellently.",
    "I think the course could be improved by having more outside readings and activities. The majority of the course was just textbook work, and I would have appreciated more time for debate and non-textbook learning and activities.",
    "STRENGTHS \r\n- the aforementioned things I learned \r\n- the small class size \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n- not many chances to put the structures we were learning into practice e.g by getting the chance to form our own sentences  \r\n- not that much student interaction, it was mainly the teacher lecturing \r\n- I am not sure if the format of quizlet tests is that ideal for vocab memorisation",
    "This course has a higher level of dependability than former advanced Chinese courses, in that the homework is more consistent and the quizzes are regular. Both the homework and quizzes are rather easy; as long as you read the textbook, you will know the answers. The tests are not too hard, and the workload is about two hours three days a week. Both the good and bad thing about the course is that it does not require very much writing in Chinese, which made it easier but also unfortunately caused me to forget a good amount of writing.",
    "Zhou Laoshi cares a lot, but I think there's some extraneous work in the course (mainly required Quizlet sets) that doesn't do much for learning the language. I also felt like tests were strangely organized, as they didn't really require us to put together sentences very often and tested how much we could reproduce a phrase, which felt inappropriately simple for this level of Chinese."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If anyone wants to continue their Chinese language study, I would recommend CHNS 154 with Zhou Laoshi!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to continue improving their Chinese skills.",
    "Abolutely, Zhou Laoshi is amazing and I would absolutely recommend him",
    "Yes, to learn 4th year mandarin.",
    "Maybe",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody wanting to continue Chinese at Yale. It is not too hard; the teachers are fantastic; the readings are interesting; and it's a great way to keep up on your Chinese, even if it;'s not as rigorous as a summer or Light program might be.",
    "If you want to continue the Chinese sequence, you probably don't have much of an option here, but I would probably recommend trying to get into the heritage class if your speaking ability is good, since the general level of spoken Chinese in this course was lower than I expected. People also freely spoke English far too often, and it didn't feel like classmates really cared about learning the language, which was strange for me in a Yale course."
