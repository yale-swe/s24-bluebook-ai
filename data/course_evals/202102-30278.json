                "In general the course was great! Profe Tortora brought in many cool guests to speak with us on zoom (obviously things were different from usual because of the pandemic and the class being virtual). Students also presented on different specific topics, which was interesting and fun because of the kahoot element of that. I think something that would have made a big difference would be to have breaks in classit was 3 hours 15 minutes on zoom without a break, which was way too much.",
                "Strengths: all of the material was interesting, the professor and TA were excellent, and the grading is very fair\r\nWeaknesses: I think this only applies to when it's taught online, but the class length can be very tough (3hrs 15mins)",
                "Professor Tortora is very kind and caring. The course material was interesting -- watching Ecuadorian films and then speaking with the filmmakers was an amazing experience.",
                "Weakness: \r\n- Online (but that was inevitable) \r\n\r\nStrengths;\r\n- Work wasnt bad at all \r\n- Great prof \r\n- Weekly group conversations (very informal and helpful, with native speakers)",
                "I think we could devote more class time to actual discussion of the content. I enjoyed the movies and the conversations with guest speakers, but more conversation between the peers would have been helpful to share opinions and further improve speaking skills.",
                "Strengths: This class focuses on a lot of different interesting topics about Ecuador. The class is well organized.",
                "I loved all of the special guests who visited our class! Speaking with Ecuadorians helped us improve our conversational skills and showed us insights into the culture of the country. I appreciated the detailed feedback on each of our weekly discussion sections and in class essays.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this class is that it was simply too long. 3 hours and 15 minutes is a ridiculously long time to spend on a Zoom. I understand of course that this is a summer class, so it had to be accelerated like that. I appreciate that Profesora Trtora made efforts to keep the class activities varied (i.e. movie, discussion, guest speaker) to keep it interesting for us."

                "Yes! Especially if you can take it in-person, abroad. Profe Tortora has a ton of amazing connections in Ecuador, and I think it would have been really cool to meet people in person, although the zoom meetings were also great. If you engage with it, this course will help your Spanish improve and teach you a lot about Ecuador, which is a pretty cool country.",
                "Absolutely. Relatively light workload, very interesting material, and the professor is passionate about what she does. It's a fantastic way to improve your Spanish while learning about Ecuador. Highly recommended!",
                "Yes! It was a well-organized and fun course.",
                "Yes of course. The professor is great and our class assistant as well. The weekly conversations will improve your language skills if you arent already a native speaker or have high fluency. They are very informal and not something to stress about at all. The information covered in the class is quite insightful and meaningful.",
                "Yes--great way to practice your Spanish while also learning about Ecuadorian history and culture. There are a lot of movies to watch, novels to read, songs to listen to, etc., so you can engage with Spanish in many different ways. Probably the best part was the visits from Ecuadorian filmmakers, authors, and journalists, as well as weekly conversation groups.",
                "Yes, especially if you are interested in learning in detail about a specific Latin American culture. I think you will also enjoy it even more if this is held in person in Ecuador.",
                "Yes, I would. It is a really good class to learn about a specific Latin American country because it focuses on Ecuador. The class is helpful if you want to improve your Spanish skills in an interesting class.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. I hear that this course is usually actually taught in Ecuador, which would make it all the more amazing!"
