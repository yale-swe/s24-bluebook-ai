At the end of the semester I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of epic, western cannon, greek culture, etc. This class enables me to add many literary and religious allusion in my own writing. It is truly a class that teaches me how to read and think.",
                "Close reading analysis, essay writing, etc.",
                "I learned so much from Professor Yeazell  techniques for efficient writing, close reading, insightful discussion etc",
                "Coming into this course I did not really understand how to close read a text, and this above all others is a skill that I have practiced and learned to adeptly do over this semester. I have also learned how to write a literature paper, which I thought I knew how to do but did not really when I began this course. Looking back at my first literature paper, I see how far I've come in terms of organizing an essay and commenting on the right things. But I believe the most important thing this course has given me is knowledge of important texts, knowledge that will be applicable next semester in DS and in all other classes and even post-graduation. Before taking this course, you do not really understand how much the Odyssey, Dante, the Aeneid, and all the other DS Literature books have impacted Western culture. Intimate knowledge of these books is an enlightening and useful skill to have.",
                "I developed skills in textual analysis and critical literary thinking.",
                "We read a lot of classical literature especially epic poetry and Greek tragedies. I gained a comprehensive view of the trajectory of western literature and personally enjoyed seeing how certain themes repeat themselves or morph under the hands of new eras. The quantity of reading and essays required of DS definitely taught me to digest literature at a faster pace.",

                "During this class, I learned how to write a close reading essay at the college level. I also developed my ability to find connections within a text and between related texts.",
                "One of the most significant changes I noticed over the course of the semester was that my literature course opened my eyes to all the possibilities of what one can look for in a literary text. Over the summer, when I was reading The Iliad, I had no idea really what to annotate for, or what I should be annotating for. A few months in, the pages of my text were filled with annotations tracking things that I had never even considered before (like what a change in epithet signifies, or how to analyze these texts from a feminist perspective). Professor Yeazell also really taught me to slow down, and question my initial instinct. At the beginning of the year, I would often just say the first thing on my mind, and often times I was analyzing the text too quickly and failing to question my perspective. Over time, I found myself really sitting with my initial interpretation, and honing my thinking in order to come away with more nuanced conclusions. This class really changed the way I read -- I really never used to annotate while I read, and literature was the DS section which changed that for me. Annotating not only helped me read more carefully, but allowed me to come to discussion prepared and excited to participate."

                "The course was very strong in close reading and creating productive conversations to engage with the selected texts. Greater focus on the expected writing style and the skills needed for this would have improved this course.",
                "I was a poor writer at the beginning of the course, but through the help of the professor I learned how to competently write (or at least began to learn how to do so).",
                "DS Lit is, of course, too fast paced (but thats the point!). I thought every text we read was really interesting and I appreciated that Professor Yeazell allowed us to be flexible with exactly how many classes we devoted to each text, giving us extra time to discuss a given text if students were especially interested in it.",
                "I cannot think of much that could be improved about this course. The reading requirements were strenuous but possible, and I believe this is the correct difficulty level for a course that is supposed to be like a cultural bootcamp. My section professor, Ruth Yeazell, was absolutely great. Unlike many professors, including DS teachers, you could tell that she was extremely knowledgeable about each and every text. And she was not afraid to use this knowledge to correct students. I have felt a twinge of sadness in some classes when students are allowed to spout any theory they like, and the professor does not correct them, but allows them to continue, regardless of the truth of what they are saying. This is not how Professor Yeazell handled out seminar. If someone said something that she disagreed with, she would tell them why they were wrong. And, owing to her expertise, the scolded student would quickly see the error of his/her ways.",
                "Strong course in the breadth of material we read. Weak in that the depth to which we analyze each book is limited--but it is difficult to change the curriculum too much to fix this latter point, because all of the books we read fit the canon well",
                "Great seminar discussions, phenomenal texts, wonderful professor. As in all DS courses, the volume of reading can feel overwhelming at times, but these books and these professors are worth it.",
                "Strengths: breadth over depth/ pace, Prof. Yeazell, classmates, texts\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough time to establish understanding of the plot of a text in class (and then feeling underprepared for the final)",
                "I loved the selection of books that we read and really enjoyed class discussions. I especially appreciated when Professor Yeazell gave us a couple topics/passages that we would be discussing during the next class, as I felt it helped guide my reading. I think the course could use a lot more guidance and explicit advice on tackling the intense workload and preparing for the final exam.",
                "I very much enjoyed diving into each of these texts with my enthusiastic class and knowledgeable professor. However, I found that the sheer volume of text being covered made it difficult to fully connect with and analyze each portion of the text.",
                "One of the main strengths of this course was that the syllabus was really well constructed, more so than the other strands of DS. I loved getting to read a text authored by a woman (shoutout to Sappho, an icon and inspiration), and I felt that more so than any strand, my professor (and lecturers as well) really made sure to highlight the role of women in the texts we read. One moment that really stood out to me was when my Professor got us to question how the fall of Adam and Eve could be read from a feminist perspective. My first time reading it, I felt that it was pretty misogynistic, because Adam immediately blamed Eve and Eve was forced to \"bear the punishment of childbirth\". But then, we had a really interesting discussion about how Eve's curiosity and her decision to choose wisdom over mindless peace could be read as a demonstration of agency. It was an awesome moment, and representative of so many other moments when Professor Yeazell breathed new life into texts that at first had not resonated with me as strongly. I think one way this course could be improved, and this goes for all of my DS classes, is that I think it would be game-changing if we the first paper we turned in could be considered a first draft. I think students should be given the opportunity to edit their papers based on teacher feedback, as this would allow us to really improve our writing by applying our teacher's comments."

                "I would absolutely recommend DS if you are reading for the intellectual challenges and huge workload. But be cautious of harsh grading and maybe disorganized seminar. Also take DS if you want an intellectual community where everyone can talk about philosophy, literature, politics, history, etc during lunch and dinner instead gossiping random things. DS is also a very solid foundation for any other humanities course you might take in the future.",
                "Yes--absolutely! DS is very rewarding and Professor Yeazell is wonderful. You will leave the course with better reading and writing skills and a solid understanding of ancient Greek/Roman texts.",
                "absolutely  I think Yeazell was the best option for Lit, it ended up being my favorite DS class",
                "Yes, I definitely would. It is true that this course is tough and that there are a lot of readings to do; there is no way to get around that fact. But the rigorous workload is necessary for what this course is trying to do - give you a crash course in all of the important works of western literature. At the end of the semester, you will feel proud of yourself for getting through it and all the other DS courses, and you will know that you have gained a lot of useful knowledge. The class discussions are also very useful for increasing your analytical and persuasive abilities. It is hard to argue a point against other DS students and professors (especially if you have not read the text in question) and you will get better at crafting an argument. This is also true of the DS essays you will right. These essays, for literature and all other classes, will make a you a better, more persuasive author.",
                "Yes -- I enjoyed the course material and thought it was taught exceptionally well",
                "Yes! Professor Yeazell is so knowledgeable and astute. She cultivated a wonderful intellectual environment; there was so much to learn in seminar discussions. Rather than a hinderance, the pace of the curriculum kept us moving and prevented those often-inevitable stagnant conversations.",
                "Absolutely! I especially loved the connections between disciplines in DS this past semester. The quality of our discussions was consistently very good.",
                "Yes, absolutely! DS demands a lot of time and effort, but it will completely transform the way you read, write, and think. Reading these texts provides an amazing foundation for reading other literature outside of class, as well. It's so gratifying to pick up a book for pleasure and realize that it is responding to or building off of many of the same questions posed by the classics.",
                "I would certainly recommend this class to any students interested in literature and exploring new texts and new cultures through the lens of writing.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Yeazell is brilliant and an incredible role model for female-identifying students. The books and plays we read in literature were also SUCH enjoyable reads! I always loved settling down with one of my literature books, and felt like they were each a puzzle to sift through. The way the course is set up is also so amazing, because each book on the syllabus builds on the last. This allows students to really understand the allusions made in these texts, and reading them chronologically in this way in order to really understand the epics and the works inspired by them is a rare opportunity."
