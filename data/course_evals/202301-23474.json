                "Gained insights into the experiences of others in STEM, particularly how identities can intersect to yield barriers to entry\/progress in STEM. I learned to discuss personal, vulnerable topics with a group.",

            "comments": [
                "The strengths are the low pressure on grading and assignments, as well as the amount of student-directed content that we have. We had an intervention project that I loved doing, an op-ed on a topic of my choice (related to STEM), and we had to prepare a class to discuss a topic of our choice with our fellow students. I think that the student-led part of the course was actually even more interesting than the first half.",
                "Strengths: As a STEM student, my courses often feel depersonalized--especially in large lectures. Content is empirically standardized, and there is little room for individual expression. I enjoyed this course because it force me to think more about how my peers and I fit--as a unique individuals--into STEM work environments. It made me reevaluate what the STEM industry currently is and what it could become.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The \"open ended-ness\" of discussion format meant that discussions often stalled or sidetracked from the original topics. Some days, I felt that our discussions were sporadic and would jump between topics and experiences without resolving the questions and issues we posed. I think that guiding questions for discussion next year could keep discussion more focused. Likewise, I found myself identifying a host of barriers others face, but I would have appreciated learning more skills to mitigate those barriers for others.",
                "The instructor is incredibly accommodating, which was especially helpful for me.",
                "The course brought to light a lot of topics in the stem field that are often experienced but not discussed."

                "I would definitely recommend this course. I think everyone should learn about the issues that are discussed in this course, especially to build empathy with our fellow STEM people.",
                "Yes. I think that this course was extremely refreshing as a MB&B, pre-med student. The course typically features round table discussions over weekly readings (which relate to identity in STEM). During these discussions, we might share our own experiences with a certain barrier\/challenge in STEM, and I always left class feeling as though I learned more about my peers and how I could be more conscious of others' struggles.",
                "Yes, 100%, especially with Rona Ramos! She facilitates amazing conversations.",
                "Absolutely! This class was incredible and I am grateful to have taken it before graduating yale. It has completely reshaped my view of STEM"
