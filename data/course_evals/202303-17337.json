Doc Freeman is a great professor, and he teachers you quite a lot without providing a burdensome workload. The course makes coding feel very natural and fun with the thorough explanations in lectures and fun problem set assignments. The lectures themselves were engaging, and the slides were very in-depth and helpful. I cannot think of any ways the course could be improved.",
                "The class was extremely easy with Prof Freeman. There were barely any psets and tests were open note. This is good if you want a gut, but really bad if you were hoping to learn anything at all. He teaches extremely slow and is pretty disorganized with his lectures. We didn't learn any of the most valuable part of C, like using pointers, and the class is \"for engineers and scientists,\" but we didn't really learn anything that would actually be applicable to engineers and scientists. I wish it was more rigorous."

This class is fairly undemanding in terms of workload so it may be a good place to start if you feel intimidated by the concept of programming and need a place to start.",

I feel like I learned how to code properly on the base level, and I am happy to have taken that away from this class. Doc Freeman is also a great guy, and he makes it very clear what you will be tested on. He has a wealth of information from his diverse working experiences and truly makes lectures entertaining and engaging. The course was one of the more fun ones I have taken at Yale.",
