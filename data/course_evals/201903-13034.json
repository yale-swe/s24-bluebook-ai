   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned mostly from the great readings, various non-fiction essays from a diverse collection of sources and authors.",
    "This course has helped me to grow so much as a writer, teaching me to be concise, thoughtful, and efficient in my writing.",
    "I developed my reading and writing abilities, especially in regards to incorporating other authors' strategies into my own work. I also learned how useful the revision process could be.",
    "I learned how to express myself in a way that others would want to listen\/read. And I think that's valuable no matter what I'll go on to do in life.",
    "In this course, I built upon my creative writing skills. I had taken a memoir class in high school, but I liked that this course was specifically about creative nonfiction, which allowed me to push my boundaries. \r\nOverall, this course has made me much more aware of my writing. I found that Prof. Riley's advice, from the mantra \"make every sentence count\" to  omitting certain \"banned words\" that didn't contribute to a piece, started to influence my writing in other academic subjects.",
    "My level of essay writing was dramatically improved by this class.",
    "Better appreciation for essays, confidence in my own writing",
    "I learned how to synthesize my thoughts  and read writing better. I learned the meaning of creative nonfiction and analyzed other essays, my classmates essays, and essays of my own.",
    "How to appreciate essays and craft our own essays. A good essay comes from editing it too.",
    "I gained greater insight into some of the greatest works of short nonfiction in this course and a deeper understanding of how to craft an influential narrative or argument due to intensive peer feedback sessions and detailed suggestions from my professor.",
    "How to assess essays on a variety of topics, and consider the implications of these essays. How to outline, draft, edit, and critique!",
    "Learned a lot in this course about how to transform personal experiences into essays accessible and meaningful to larger audiences."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Riley is very knowledgable and a great professor, and gives really good feedback on your writing. In class, discussions and essay workshopping were useful and interesting,",
    "The strengths of this course were the structure (centering it around 5 types of essays), the professor's passion for the subject, and the selection of readings. One way it could be improved is to have more in-class writing exercises.",
    "The readings are fantastic. I loved all of the essay prompts, and I think I would have enjoyed writing a humor piece, which I know some other sections do. I am also glad we did not have to interview someone for our profile. Professor Riley is also amazing.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Riley is a great instructor and the kind of people this class attracts is just wonderful. Weaknesses: I wish there was more writing instruction. I learned how to become a better writer through picking up trends in Prof. Riley's comments and reading other essays, but I wish there was more structure to it. Maybe a book like Elements of Style would have helped?",
    "One strength in this course was the draft\/revision process. I liked being able to see which parts of my essay garnered the most feedback, because I would look for similar errors in my following essays. I also liked the amount of essays that we were exposed to. Even though I was reading more than 15 versions of each type of essay, it never felt overwhelming. There were multiple times in this class when I read a piece and couldn't believe that I had never heard of the piece or the author before, because I had enjoyed reading it so much (see: Ian Frazier's \"Take the F\" and Jhumpa Lahiri's \"Rhode Island\").",
    "I believe that this class has no weaknesses. It is the most encouraging and overall best English class that I have ever taken.",
    "This course is absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend it.",
    "I really like the broad range of topics read and discussed from the Norton Reader anthology, as well as the freedom to choose what essay contents we wrote for the five submitted pieces. The course was very fun, and I left with a glimpse of some classic \"modern\" essays in the English language.",
    "Strengths of this course include engaging readings, fulfilling discussions due to the seminar format of the class, and creative topics for papers that allowed students the freedom to explore their own voice in writing while still fulfilling the requirements of the prompt. The workload was also quite manageable for this course.",
    "This course is a fantastic introduction to reading critically and writing thoughtfully. I found the breadth (and diversity) of essays covered and the depth to which we analyzed them truly amazing. Our fantastic instructor guided conservation and elicited careful consideration of the text, and I learned from my engaged peers. Perhaps my favorite part was the beautiful balance between reading essays and writing essays. This course truly integrates these skills and allowed me to enjoy learning about both concepts.",
    "The strengths of this course were the workshopping sessions and the level of engagement of the readings required before each class. Perhaps one weakness of this course would be the lack of conversation about some of the required authors works rather than focus mainly on the strengths. One idea could be to have students acknowledge one strength and one weakness of an essay in the reading responses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially with professor Riley.",
    "Absolutely, it was one of my favorite classes this semester and I have made so many new friends along the way.",
    "Absolutely! You learn so much about yourself and the writing process, and you also have the opportunity to develop a close relationship with your classmates and Professor Riley!",
    "Absolutely. If you want to improve your ability to express yourself vividly, concisely, and in a way that others would want to listen\/read, this is the class to take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only do you get a writing credit from it, you get the chance to feel comfortable building your writing skills through the draft\/revision process, not just turning papers in and receiving a grade. In addition, the essays assigned for this course were so engrossing that they didn't even feel like assignments.",
    "I would heavily recommend this course to any student that wants to gain confidence in their writing and to discover their own writing style.",
    "Yes I would!! It allows you to grow as a writer and a person.",
    "Yes! You will learn a lot about reading and writing essays.",
    "Absolutely. This course changed the way I approach writing and made me more comfortable responding to various essay prompts. The seminar format of the class is also conducive to a setting for dialogue, allowing each student to learn from their classmates and gain a greater appreciation for literature.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite course this semester. You learn from the instructors feedback (I had never received such carefully considered comments on my writing before), you learn from the essays (which are low risk because if you dont like an essay its finished before the next class period!), you learn from your peers...you learn! The combination of engaging leadership, material, and fellow classmates creates a phenomenal English seminar.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to any other student looking too improve on their writing skills and interested in writing about personal topics."
