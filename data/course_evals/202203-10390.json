                "This class was very  disorganized. There seemed to be no communication between the TA and Professor; the professor never knew what we were reading for section, and indeed we did not at all follow the syllabus in section readings. Assignments and due dates were constantly changing; we never actually received a syllabus that even remotely resembled what the course looked like.",
                "It could be hard to know what discussion section would be about beforehand, and it wasn't physically possible to do all of the readings between all my other classes. It would probably be better with fewer readings that get more intensely focused on instead of many readings where we only read 1-2 chapters each.",
                "This course serves as a great introduction to Latin America History and delves deep into the theme of colonialism. It would benefit from better organisation of readings and a stronger, more set syllabus. Nevertheless, this is a great survey course and Professor Schwartz does a great job of making the small lectures engaging.",
                "I think the structure was a bit unorganized",
                "We rarely followed the readings listed on the syllabus, so it was hard to know what content we were learning each day.",
                "I thought the lectures were interesting and discussion sections were engaging. Overall not much to recommend",
                "A major strength of this class was a solid syllabus with books that enriched one's understanding of the content rather than merely repeating the lecture material. A weakness is that a focus on the actions of European powers in Latin America leads to a corresponding lack of focus on native cultures."

Unless you have a strong particular motive to take the course, I would recommend other preindustrial / Latin American history courses.",
