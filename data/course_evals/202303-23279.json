I also got a lot of practice in watercolor painting which was fun because I did not have much experience before.",

                "If you need a chill FYS for fun, go ahead and take it. You might improve in painting because you'll be making two paintings every week. That sounds like a lot, I know, but it's a good refresher after other classes and bunch of psets.",
                "Even though it is a seminar, the professor conducts the class more like a lecture so student participation is mostly just attendance, meaning you dont have to talk in class much if you dont want to. It is a fun class if you want to paint more, half of the three hour class each week was spent painting outdoors on campus which was fun. The only bad part is the three essays due throughout the semester, it is excessive for a course that is not a writing credit and the professor often nitpicks on the writing aspect more than the actual art analysis. Painting for this class was a welcome break from the workload of other courses and it was nice to change things up from studying at a computer. Sometimes the weekly paintings due for homework were hard to keep up with along with homework from other classes. I would recommend if you are passionate about learning more about art and watercolor painting.",
                "Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed the class as we were able to do something different from the typical academic rigor. Painting has a therapeutic nature to it to me personally and I believe it would to others as well."
