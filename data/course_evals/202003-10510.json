                "The course uses a variety of methods to teach Italian (speaking, questions, compositions, projects) which was very well rounded. The pace of the course was just a tad too fast, especially with daily quizzes.",
                "I loved Michael's ITAL 110 class! He really catered the class to our own strengths and weaknesses and facilitated a class where everyone felt comfortable participating. I did have technical issues with the VHL activities for the entire semester, but other than that, I would say just keep doing what you're doing.",
                "this class was really fun and I genuinely looked forward to it everyday. although this is not a class you can get behind on because it met everyday and we had daily quizzes, the work did not feel overwhelming. I wish we had received more feedback throughout the semester because we never got any grades.",
                "Great teacher, great class. Only wish it could have been live",
                "This class was fun, and my professor was charismatic, but I would have been more comfortable if 'homework' assignments were given regularly through the VHL service that we were using. I felt as though there was some ambiguity in what exactly we were supposed to be studying and a more concrete assignment list would have assisted me greatly.",
                "Professor Farina is a the main strength of this specific section. Class was extremely engaging; he makes sure to call on everybody at least once during class. In class, he goes over the workbook exercises and makes sure to call on every single person as we go through the answers. The only fault of this class, which I believe translates to all sections, is the fact that you are essentially teaching yourself. All reading and learning is done prior to class, and class is only used for going over the problems associated with the lesson or addressing any concerns-- if they are brought up."

There is of course daily reading, weekly compositions, and exams every other week, but this class was one of the few that I truly enjoyed over Zoom (even though it was 7:30 PST)",

                "Yes. Only if you are actually interested in the language. Do not take it just because it might be easier than others-- especially if you have previous knowledge with Romance languages. While having prior knowledge will make it more manageable, it will not make the class an easy A. You will still need to put in the work.",
