                "Strengths: Professor was great and very understanding. I feel like I have become a better Spanish listener and speaker by taking this course. Weakness: Directions for assignments were often unclear.",
                "This course moves very quickly, and I think that students could benefit from covering less topics more in depth. Also, the umbrella site was not very well organized and oftentimes assignments were not communicated to students (they were just expected to know about them).",
                "Profesora Reymundi is so kind and truly wants her students to succeed!  I felt like there was a lot of time in between exams, which was good, but I felt that by the time we were tested it wasn't as fresh in my mind.",
                "I thought this class was great. At first it was tricky with the masks, but then the professor switched to a clear mask which really helped.",
                "I think that the course requires a lot of outside independent work, which Prof. Reymundi made clear from the first day of class. As a result, students that practice on their own (and really, with their own material) will do the best. This was both a good and bad thing in my case, but something that ultimately really impacted one's ability to both enjoy and participate in class.",
                "The course was not very well organized. The syllabus was new so that explains most of it but the instructions should have been better clarified. It would also be useful if canvas was organized better (i.e. all the information for each assignment being posted in the \"assignments\" tab rather than the modules.",
                "Making attendance mandatory in a pandemic is ridiculous.",
                "Lots of speaking and listening improved my conversational Spanish skills. I also improved my grasp on certain grammar rules. \r\n\r\nNo clear weaknesses."

That being said, the workload in Spanish was almost always the highest compared to my other classes, and often impacted my ability to put as much time and effort as I'd like into classes that I knew would go toward my field of study.",
