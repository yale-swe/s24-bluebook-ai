In addition to discussing individual practices and facts with my professor and peers, I was able to learn methods of study from them and feel far more equipped to study antiquity after the class. This class nicely blended modern issues with the study of history and placed issues in conversation that I typically wouldn't think to."

                "This course was very intentionally crafted and that was visible in the texts selected and the organization of lessons. Encouraging students to bring examples or relevant observations from their own lives created an environment of creative comparison and active engagement. Certain themes were touched on throughout various topics, creating an interesting continual conversation around them. I think a way the course could improve would be through a little more discussion of the historical context. In many cases we did do this, but sometimes we dove directly into the texts without laying the groundwork first. As a non-major, this made it occasionally hard to follow, but was not generally a large issue."

The conversation was fairly natural and students were clearly engaged with the material. I think including two virtual lectures, two seminar discussions, and two conversation posts per week could be a little much in addition to the readings and workloads from other classes. That being said, I really did enjoy learning about the material covered in class and the provocations, as well as reading my peer's thoughts in the forums."

While it was exciting to me, by nature of the material and limitations of the subject it might not be the best introductory course to antiquity. However, if someone happened to enjoy the niche intersection of the two subjects (as I most certainly did) I would strongly encourage them to take this class.",

It was hard to understand the discussion/readings sometimes as a non-classics major, and I think the class would have been more insightful with a good deal of background like most of the students had. However, it was a super fun class and we got to talk about subjects I simply never would have treated otherwise, like ancient food, cooking, alcohol culture, farming, etc.!"
