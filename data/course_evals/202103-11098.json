                "The openness of the course projects allows students to explore a variety of applications to the topics discussed in lecture. The course could benefit greatly from a more in-depth introduction to SuperCollider, specifically with regard to syntax, functions, and object definitions. To some extent, a student's experience with the class projects could be greatly improved with more instruction on the actual language of the course as opposed to relying on online documentation. Since experience in SuperCollider and sound synthesis are very useful for algorithmic and heuristic composition, I would recommend that CPSC 432 be taught in the Fall with CPSC 431 following in the Spring.",

                "I definitely would recommend this course to any students who are comfortable with object-oriented programming and have an interest in computer-generated music. Computer science students should take into account that the class projects are not like other CS assignments. There is no spec with required functionality, but instead, there are guidelines for what each project should focus on. This openness is definitely something to take into account, as the workload of the course pretty much depends on how much effort one wants to dedicate to each project and how much one wants to get out of it. Since having a background in sound synthesis can be helpful when creating algorithmic music and experience in SuperCollider helps immensely as well, I HIGHLY recommend taking CPSC 432 BEFORE CPSC 431.",
                "Great course",
                "Yes! This course is great for learning about the intersection of music and computer science. Note that if you are looking to work with a DAW, this course does not really touch the subject unless you choose to integrate Supercollider with a DAW for the final project. Still though, speaking as a (past) musician majoring in computer science, this course was an ideal blend of the two subjects.",
