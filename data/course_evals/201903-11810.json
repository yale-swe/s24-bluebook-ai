    "I developed knowledge of the way spanish is spoken as it relates to speed and answering certain questions. I think my skills in Spanish have been greatly improved and I learned how to understand spanish because its a different process than other courses.",
    "We definitely learned Spanish quickly. I came into this class knowing no Spanish and we got through a lot of material.",
    "I learned valuable study and time management skill in this class and well as how to memorize large amount of vocabulary in short periods of time.",
    "I became much more confident in my general skills and speaking abilities",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: You learn an astounding amount and have learned a lot by the end of the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: The course moves very very fast, having very little time to fully incorporate and understand new vocabulary and constructions.",
    "Nightly homework is at times a bit annoying but definitely keeps you on track with the material. Exams are at times a little overwhelming to study for, but not impossible by any means.",
    "the course could be improved if \"quality of spanish\" was not included in the participation grade. I feel that class time should be available for students to make mistakes while speaking and not fear for loss of points.",
    "The strengths of this course is introducing the language and forcing engagement to speak in the classroom and practicing. The weakness is how the course teaches its student to listen to spanish and respond back. I do not think students were prepared enough for the listening exam.",
    "Strengths:\r\nObviously Yelsy. She is a terrific professor and made it known that she cared about us as students and our success. Her office hours were amazing and super helpful for me. I would definitely try and get into her class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere are two very clear sections of the class: the students who took Spanish before and the students who hadnt. As someone who hadnt, it was frustrating to be judged to the same standard as people with extensive Spanish experience. There needs to be two lanes of Spanish 1. The class goes incredibly quickly which I understand, but it doesnt leave enough time for anything to sink in when youre learning it for the first time.\r\nAlso, tests are graded in a way that incentives you to write the bare minimum which makes no sense to me.",
    "I think my strength lay in how much time I was willing to dedicate to the class. I put a lot of time into studying and meeting with professors and peer tutors. My weaknesses lay in spelling.",
    "It was very quickly paced and their was minimal days designated to test reviews especially for the finals."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, coming in with almost nothing I learned a lot and other students can too",
    "Yes! A great way to learn Spanish!",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student looking to learn spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they really like the language or if they have a a true curiosity of speaking Spanish themselves.",
    "If you are not linguistically inclined and need to get your language requirement out of the way, I guess Spanish is easier than most classes, but it is definitely not a breeze. It took up a majority of my time compared to my other classes and was a real struggle at times.",
    "Yes I think that this course was great for if you want to learn Spanish.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes because I learned a lot and enjoyed my time in the class."
