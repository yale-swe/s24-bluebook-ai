The class is about law and legal history, but understand it is more than anything a legal history course, reviewing caselaw (and the social environments that produced that law) and its lasting effects within the class' 3 units.",
                "Throughout this course, I was consistently introduced to topics within the law.  I gained knowledge surrounding immigration law, slavery codes, and much more.  I noticed an increase in my familiarity with legal terms and especially with legal circumstances and the terms that are then required.  This entire course gave me a very powerful and wholesome review of U.S. law that left no perspective or controversy untouched."

                "In class discussions moved too quickly and rarely would hear from students. It also didn't seem as though much of what we spoke about in class would help with the papers or connected in the papers we wrote so was never really sure of what to take notes of. Another weaknesses is that there were weeks where there was a lot expected to read in just two days, and rarely would we be able to spend a decent amount of time on each reading and sometimes we didn't go over all of them at all, so lighter reading load so then students can have deeper discussion on topics and not feel rushed through would help.",
                "Would be better as a lecture. Prof LaFleur has a lot to say (almost all of it very interesting), but because of that seminar discussions seem a little lopsided towards their thoughts.",
                "Strengths: The five paper assignments were very manageable and allowed for feedback, the rewrite policy is a good opportunity to revisit topics and improve writing quality, the four until breakdown was easy to follow and the units clearly built upon one another, Greta is great and really approachable, really interesting content, guest speakers were cool \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings were a bit redundant and the reading load was a lot for the class meeting twice a week; moving forward it may be better taught as a once weekly seminar, the turnaround time for grades was a bit on the slow side, the American Indian Law unit took up a lot more time than the later two units",
                "I really liked the assignment format of short, regular papers, rather than a big midterm and really big final paper. It was nice both because it allowed us to explore a handful of topics rather than investing tons of work into a single topic, and also because it made for a really manageable workload that was spread out rather than concentrated at the middle\/end of the semester. The course content is really interesting, and I thought the different units were organized super well. The readings were excellent and most of them were new to me.\r\n\r\nI do think there is too much reading -- Greta acknowledged at the beginning of the semester that she gets this comment a lot and that she wants us to read for exposure, not hanging on every word. However, particularly given that there are first years and sophomores in the course, I think the massive amount of reading (up to 150 pages per class, twice a week) discourages people from even attempting to do the reading. There were many classes where I could tell that there were only a few people who had even looked at the material. This was also problematic because class discussion would often focus in detail on specific pages; so while we were told we weren't expected to read every page in detail, class discussion required a level of specificity that most people couldn't achieve. Class felt more like a lecture than a seminar at times, with Greta going on long (but still helpful and interesting) tangents that didn't really encourage discussion. I think this was probably also in part a result of our inability to do the entire reading. I think that if Greta assigned the reading but highlighted maybe 50-80 pages that were particularly important or that would be discussed in-depth in class, that would be helpful. There were also times in the course when I couldn't tell what we were supposed to be getting from the readings\/class -- several readings would be listed in the syllabus and discussed without a clear message about why we were reading what we were reading. I think this class could be improved if Greta provided for each class or week a brief organizing statement to orient us, or a set of important questions to guide our reading.",
                "Strengths: The Indian law unit was definitely a highlight (and we spent most of the semester here), but honestly I came in knowing little to nothing about tribal law and found it quite important to review. Prof. LaFleur is also a fantastically enthusiastic professor and more than willing to meet to discuss through papers and also offers an option to rewrite. (And a very fair grader.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class has a lot of reading. Like more than the amount I have to read for my once-a-week-seminars for one class session, and we meet twice a week. It lightened up a bit at the end, but many days it was simply impossible to get the reading done and made it stressful trying to pick and choose what I had the time to review. Prof. LaFleur mentions they assign a lot of reading at the beginning of the class and says that it's a skill to be developed to know what to skim and not, and while I slightly agree, I think the class would have run smoother if we had less reading, and then we'd have more to say. By the end of class, the semester got overwhelming and it was clear some readings would be brought up that almost no one got to preview ahead of time. Beyond that, the assignments were a bit confusing as they felt quite unrelated to the class, which especially disincentivized doing the reading (combined with no participation part of the grade) and it didn't seem clear how it connected to any of the class discussions. I'd also say the slavery and immigration units weren't as well organized or clear-cut as the Indian Law unit (perhaps only make the class 2?).",
                "One strength of the course was the three-topic split, which let us get into three areas in depth, and another was the structuring of the four short papers. However, I wish the papers had been more evenly spaced through the semester. Also, the short worksheet was worth very little in the grade compared to the work it required, so the class would benefit from some rebalancing thereit was frustrating to spend so much time on something that was worth very little.",
                "I, sincerely, have little to no suggestions except I would recommend the readings be compressed.  There was quite a lot of knowledge to digest."

                "Yes, but only if you can motivate yourself to do the readings. There's no participation grade, no reading responses, and class discussion was definitely hampered by the many students who did not do the weekly reading assignments\/said very little in class.",
                "If youre at all interested in American history or the law I would definitely recommend this class. It really changed the way I think about the law and the three big course themes allow you to explore really important topics in great depth. The reading load is a lot, but the trade off is that there are only five short papers",
                "I would recommend this course! It was a new course this semester, which I think was pretty clear, but I still really enjoyed it. I have no doubt that the course will get stronger the more it's taught as Greta makes changes to the syllabus and format. The course content was amazing, and the paper assignments\/topics were really thoughtful and strong.",
                "Not really",
                "All in all, this was a new course, so none of us quite knew what we were getting into. The name\/initial syllabus was a bit misleading, but with some tweaking I think this can be a really interesting legal history course about the ways in which United States law has codified exclusion. I would recommend it to someone interested in going to law school and interested in histories of oppressed people (and the essays are a route to explore social movements in legal history).",
                "I would! The material is really interesting and the professor is engaging and friendly. The biggest drawback was a high reading load.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student!  As a prospective ER&M major, this course was such an interesting course to take and I appreciated the critical perspective that was applied to US historical law.  It was such an amazing and interesting semester learning about the precedents and cases that have set the base for US law today."
