Weaknesses: definitions and concepts are sometimes really abstract and hard to grasp, actual class time is a little disorganized and I'm not actually sure what was covered in each one, and more guidance on the final project could have been given.",
                "The strengths of this course were the small class size, ability to communicate sufficiently with the professor, and the respect for all opinions to be brought to the table without judgement. The weaknesses were the format of each class (they were always the same, and this became monotonous), the length of readings sometimes, and the students' lack of understanding how some concepts or words were defined. It was as if the definitions always changed from class to class, so this made it very confusing.",
                "very discussion based which i loved, but sometime the discussions made it difficult to nail down precisely what we were supposed to be taking away from a given reading",
                "The course structure is a bit loose, and the meetings tend to be less discussion and more lecture, but that has more to do with student participation than professor teaching. More thorough teaching of the material before discussion might remedy the issue.",
                "Too much reading and could use more discussion but very interesting and applicable information, the exams were all very straightforward and I like having specific goals.",
                "A strength was the culture of engagement and discussion created by Professor Fernandez-Duque. Our class grew very close over the semester. I cannot think of a glaring weakness of the class."

                "Yes, in the end I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to complete a science requirement. I think that in order to succeed though, the student should meet with the professor a lot and communicate with his/her peers in the class.",
                "Yes, the professor is a great person to get to know and the structure of the course is perfect for a first year seminar",
                "Yes, this is a great course to improve scientific literacy. It is kinda like being exposed to the tips and tricks of the scientific trade.",
                "I do not want to sound bias but I would advise fellow students to steer away from this course. The readings are redundant and uninsightful. Compared to other courses at Yale, this class has much less to offer. In this class you learn how to memorize a bunch of facts and vomit them in the midterm without gaining any intellectual value. I felt like we did not move forward from the first thing we learned: P values suck, here is why. Participation by fellow students was practically 0 because the content of this class is simply not engaging. Overall, if you are looking for an easy science credit I would definitely advise you to keep looking because this class has a lot of insipid work. The professor is an expert in primates but in spite of a conscious effort, one fails to see the link between the method he uses to study primates and the methods he teaches us in this course. I certainly did not feel the enthusiasm I felt with all my other classes.",
                "I would, because it allows students, especially those who may not be going down a STEM path, to use the means of science ethically and effectually in their lives, especially as decisions must be made by policy makers with those tools."
