                "The course allowed me to exit my comfort zone and learn so much about Latin American cinema in the context of Latin America. I learned how to structurally analyze a film and tie it into readings and manifestos.",
                "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. The chance to watch the films selected by Moira and the TFs alone would make the course worth it, but the animated class discussion, which was unlike any other lecture or seminar course I've taken in college, and supplementary reading material really set the course apart. You learn how to think structurally, theoretically, and aesthetically about film, history and politics in a way that American universities simply do not offer.",
                "I really do not know if, in the 4000 characters allowed here, I could write out all of the ways this course changed how I think, all of the things I learned, skills I developed, realizations I had, etc. etc. There are so many. Starting with content, I feel this course gave a good introduction/foundation in a lot of the (revolutionary) history of Latin America - and, importantly, not in a detached way. All of the films we watched were amazing, and it never ever felt like we were watching something for no reason - every film and filmmaker brought another perspective on art, on revolution, on society, collaboration, work, life in general...Although the course's focus is not on analysis of film, I do feel like I got better at watching films critically and understanding them. Moreover, I think this course really reshaped how I view academic work. Seeing the (teaching) team work to teach us, hearing how they (and the grad students) understood things and studied them, and also just seeing the work of the filmmakers and their thoughts was all really enlightening - academic and artistic endeavors were really, in this context, things that worked concretely toward the bettering of society and the freedom of people. \r\nTaking this class also developed my skills in articulating my thoughts, in class discussions as well as the written, online ones. I always felt myself being pushed just enough to grow, and the support and feedback from the team was always extraordinarily constructive and helpful. \r\nFinally, I feel that in this course, working with and alongside everyone else there, I grew a lot as an artist, as a student, and as a person.",
                "I gained a deeper appreciation for the gorgeous and politically charged Latin American cinema in the 1960s and 70s. Taking this class opened my mind to a whole new way of viewing cinema, as a kind of audiovisual manifesto. I became more conscious of the various cross-sections of political activism and cinema, and also of the extent to which the act of movie-making itself can be a radical political statement.",
                "I learned how to watch and evaluate films structurally, and learned about Latin American history and cinema.",
                "This class gives an understanding of 3rd cinema principles, form, and messages; teaches close and structural analysis of film; and presents the historical, political, and cultural landscape of Latin America.",
                "A STUPENDOUS course. Gained strong insight into Latin American revolutionary politics, movements, and overall culture. Learned lots about film and the role of artists in revolution. Learned about the purpose of aesthetics. Loved it so much!",
                "I knew almost nothing about film prior to this course. I feel like a whole new world was opened up to me in that now I have the skills to see what messages films are conveying and how (through tactics such as camera angle, editing, etc.). \r\nI also appreciated the practice in staring head-on into the violence, hunger, and poverty in the world and talking about solutions without backing away or becoming too uncomfortable given my implication in it all as a member of the U.S. bourgeoisie.",
                "This course taught me much about both film history, politics, and Latin American history. It was also immensely helpful in developing my political analysis of film, drawing connections between formal choices ad political context and intentions. Lastly, the course taught me to see outside my limited US perspective, and to see just how much my background as a US citizen has unconsciously biased my perception of media and history (and attempt to think outside these biases).",
                "This course was an opportunity to dive deep into the 1970s/80s in Latin America through film. Moira has so much knowledge about this time period and personal experiences relating to the subject material. For me, this was an essential introduction to modern Latin American history, political thought, and aesthetics.",
                "Throughout this course, we immersed ourselves in an entirely different milieu from both our own as Yale students, and from those typically discussed in Yale courses. This course could not have been more insightful regarding the historical, social, and political context which shaped Latin America in the 1960s, and in attempting to channel that spirit, the class achieved something truly special: a kind of communal learning.",
                "Deeper historical knowledge of Latin American politics and film.",
                "For one, this course has done the most for my comfort in public speaking than any course I've ever taken. Films are something that can be intimidating to talk about, especially films with such heavy political content. However, the course is structured in a way that encourages participation and discourse, and overtime you build your confidence to participate more and more. The course is also a great introduction to Latin American politics and, by extension, global politics -- especially within the context of the history of the Global South. As for skills, I think the course will restructure how you think of and analyze films; it pushes you to think about the structure of the film and how that structure lends itself to present a political thesis on the state of affairs.",
                "I learned about general political history of counties in Latin  America, about the history of US imperialism in the region, about the US American's ideological preference for individual narratives (as opposed to structuralist lens), and about the banking theory of knowledge. I also was reacquainted with a refreshing dose of interest/excitement about the course material, which was spearheaded by the phenomenal teaching team, and then maintained by my classmates.",
                "I learned how to analyze films in a structural context. I learned how to question the views I came into the classroom holding, why I hold those views, and how I have been influenced by the media I have consumed. This class introduced me to a part of the world I knew very little about truly. I look forward to continually applying what I have learned in this course.",
                "Learned about collective liberation and various Latin American movements against dictatorship, labor exploitation, police brutality, sexual violence, etc. Would have greatly regretted if I'd never been introduced to the films in this class, so very much appreciated this space. The classroom was also organized to have a more equal relationship between teacher and student, having the students present on each film and being discussion-based to follow along with Friere's model in pedagogy of the oppressed. A lot of warm energy in the classroom as well - very wholesome group of tas and the Professor was definitely a prankster, and very kind and understanding and gave great feedback. I might recommend taking a history class before this class because it moves very quickly and skills to analyze and unpack history are helpful"

            "question_id": "YC403",
            "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
            "comments": [
                "The strength of this course is how connected we were as a class. This was the only class where I developed meaningful connections with every student and member of the teaching staff.",
                "Strengths: everything\r\nWeaknesses: Monday screenings can feel long sometimes, especially when there is discussion after",
                "The way this course is taught is an enormous strong point: it is the most refreshing, anti-hierarchical, dialogical course I have ever taken. Yes, Prof. Fradinger and the TAs do explain things to us as needed, but always the focus of class stays on dialogue with one another. Discussions never felt like lectures, they never were one sided - the Team were always always sitting in and among us while discussions were going on. It truly felt like a collective learning experience (and personally I felt I learned and developed more in this one course than maybe all of first year combined). Another strength of this course, besides its really refreshing structure and teaching team, is the content: the films you watch are, again, all amazing and all worth the time spent watching them. \r\nIf there were a way the course could be improved, it would be in accessibility I think. Of course there are limits to how accessible things can be made, especially watching the amount of films we do, but for example someone I know with diagnosed ADHD has said it would be literally impossible for him to  watch the films back to back and pay attention the whole time. That said, Prof. Fradinger is very accommodating and I think that generally the course is really accessible.",
                "The biggest strength of this course was the professor and the teaching team- they are incredibly dedicated to students and the course overall. This isn't a weakness, but something to consider when considering this course is the fact that it's a time commitment.",
                "This course has a spectacular and provocative lineup of films that spurred some of the best in-class discussions I've had at Yale. It is intellectually challenging, but the TFs and Moira do a great job answering questions, providing resources, and participating in discussions to guide them to productive places. The readings were well chosen to provide context for the films and their era and insight into how people were thinking at the time.",
                "Strengths: Unlike any other course. Tons of engagement while in class, but not necessary to sink a ton of time in outside of class time since class meetings take up a lot of time. Don't be scared by that! It is easily worth it. Professor Fradinger and the teaching team were spectacular. Special, special, special. Loved the engagement of the class, the community, the emphasis on using people's first names. It goes on and on. The uncapped and no-prerequisite aspects of the course led to a diverse and varied course group.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is fundamentally amazing. As such, I want the details and logistics to be as amazing as possible too. Professor Fradinger is extremely attuned to student needs and is so committed to supporting students. A few basic small changes could even further improve the course. Moving screenings from Monday night to perhaps Thursday would helps students stay awake, engaged, and focused. Being clearer from earlier in the course about how grading works in the course may also alleviate some student stress (though students were really not stressed in this course compared to most). Perhaps providing some more clear instruction about how to analyze film at the beginning of the course would help move the class toward the type of analysis the teaching team was after earlier in the course  how to aesthetics and analysis with a structural mindset support the political statements the film makers are making, etc.",
                "Given the large class size, I wish that we were sometimes split into small groups during the Wednesday discussions. It was very difficult to stay focused for 2 hours without others saying anything. I also wish that the screenings were slightly earlier if possible. \r\nA strength of this course is that I felt encouraged to share my thoughts, and others would interrogate those thoughts without fear of making me uncomfortable (which was actually very useful).",
                "The course created a great atmosphere, in which all students were encouraged to participate. There was a feeling of community that made everyone feel safe speaking, regardless of their experience level with the subject matter. However, one weakness, related to this strength, is that class discussions sometimes went down unproductive paths, veering away into tangents. As the semester went on, the TAs and professor began to reign in these tangents more and keep the class discussions focused.",
                "The strength of the course was the films and Moira's knowledge. I felt like discussion were too long. This course is great, but the time commitment was unreasonable. I will not take night courses in the future. I think this course would be improved by only showing 1.5-2 hours of film on Monday nights and then having students watch the other materials in their own time or on a different day. I also think we didn't need to have both Wednesday night and section discussions. One or the other would be enough.",
                "The strengths of this course are the incredible syllabus, the knowledge of the professor and TFs regarding the subject matter, and the willingness to have long (very long, almost always past the scheduled end of the class) discussions about the state of class based politics today. None of the weaknesses I encountered in this course could be attributed to the class itself, some students were simply unprepared by the institution to participate in a truly meaningful conversation about revolutionary politics.",
                "The library of films and the sheer depth of knowledge Moira and the fellows brought to the class was staggering. I will be forever grateful to have had the chance to see these films under the thorough and supportive guidance of this class.\r\n\r\nFree-wheeling discussion during the full seminar meeting was stimulating, but often a bit meandering. I could see how this might in fact be a valuable venue for undergraduates to discuss and work through the political reckonings these films bring about, but at times I wished the graduate students just had a separate section.",
                "Strengths - Everything! Professor Fradinger is incredible and the TFs did a great job in section. There is a great selection of films for viewing and the class has a clear structure that is unlike many courses at Yale but that encourages participation and actual learning in the way that few do. You will learn a lot and will come out of the course with renewed perspectives.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Screenings can be a bit long; make sure you have time to fit the course into your schedule! It is worthwhile to take this course when you can be 100% present.",
                "It's clear that the teaching staff is very passionate about the content but it was hard to be fully engaged because the class requires so much of the students.",
                "Strengths: shear breadth of material covered; teaching team is AMAZING!; moira creates a close class even with 40+ students; the desire among the team + class to make a community; and the way the teaching team encouraged us to interact with eachother on the canvas forum made that weekly assignment feel like the most useful \"iteration\" ;) of that type of weekly assignment that I've had at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like I did not have an understanding of Latin America or film or radical politics. this made it hard to feel comfortable engaging in the discussions because I never knew if I was missing something obvious; this class was also very demanding -- in order to \"show up\" I felt like it required a lot of time and effort.",
                "Having the class be primarily discussion based not only allowed me to really engage with the material but also to get to know my classmates. I will saw at times the large-ish number of people and layout of the room made it a bit intimidating to speak at times, but I really appreciate everything the instructors did to overcome that difficulty.",
                "Learned about collective liberation and various Latin American movements against dictatorship, labor exploitation, police brutality, sexual violence, etc. Would have greatly regretted if I'd never been introduced to the films in this class, so very much appreciated this space.

                "Absolutely!! Such an expansive class not only in teaching me about third cinema and radical Latin American political history but also in showing me how to build such liberating and exciting conversations despite the physical constraints of this semester. I did have trouble with the length and hours that class would run (note that this is not a class well-suited for folks who go to sleep  / wake up early), especially because I was juggling a lot of other academic commitments this semester; while I'm glad I took this class, if I had known about the time commitment of the class I probably would have tried to build my schedule a little more intentionally around it from the beginning.",
                "100% recommend for everyone to take! I went into this class with zero knowledge about Latin American cinema or film in general; I didn't even know any Spanish, but I still found a place in this class.",
                "Yes. If you are into film or are a leftist, you need to take this class. If you aren't, you need to take this class.",
                "This is the best course I've ever taken. No matter your major or what you plan to do later in life, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend you take it. Again, this is the BEST COURSE I've EVER taken.",
                "I would 100% percent recommend this course to another student. Definitely take if you are remotely interested in cinema or activism, or not at all. It is a class that will challenge you in ways that most classes at Yale will not.",
                "Absolutely. I learned a great deal about Latin America, politics, and film all in one. The teaching team is incredibly dedicated at building community among students, and this course was a highlight of my semester.",
                "Yes! This course was the most intellectually challenging, yet the most fulfilling course I've taken at Yale. The films are spectacular and unlike anything I'd seen before, in style, editing and cutting choices, and the topics they discussed. Seeing all these films together is a very unique opportunity that you are unlikely to come across later in your life. If you have only seen Hollywood movies before, this course will make you reimagine what a film can be and what it can do. This class also offers deep insight into the political and cultural history of Latin America. The readings and films bring you into the minds of Latin American thinkers in the 60s and prompt important questions: What does a revolution look like? What is the relationship between entertainment and revolution? What does it mean to be marginalized? The discussions in this class have been some of my favorite at Yale. Never have I had my mind so repeatedly blown before.",
                "Definitely!!!!! This is a very unusual course, different from any other I have taken. The amount of class time looks scary, but it's easily worth it. You learn so much as part of a unique community, and the types of the students who take this course are wonderful  made a bunch of friends! It's a very challenging course intellectually, but not too much work outside of class which is essential because there is a lot of class time to watch the films.",
                "Yes! The films we watched were incredible, and it gave me a new perspective on a lot of things.",
                "Yes, I think this course is immensely interesting. Particularly for those interested in leftist politics, this course, more than any other I've taken, genuinely engages uncompromisingly with radical ideas. Additionally, it truly explodes the traditional Western canon in a way few other courses do.",
                "Overall, I would not recommend this course to another student. The time commitment was brutal and suffocating on top of my other courses. Perhaps for a student who is not taking other classes with a lot of in-person class time, this course would be a good fit. The films were amazing, though understand that they were not meant to serve as entertainment for the most part. They can be tough to watch: both emotionally and in terms of attention span.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested in either cinema or leftist politics. This corpus is one of the most impactful I have ever encountered at Yale, but one must first be willing to engage with works which may at first feel aesthetically alienating and with politics entirely different from the halfhearted brand of politics practiced in the US.",
                "It is a time commitment, but can be worth it for anyone interested in Latin American studies or film history.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Professor Fradinger is great and so are the TFs. The selection of films is interesting and will provide with you with brand new perspectives on a lot of the history that you might have been taught in the past as well as a new framework through which you should analyze film. Would especially recommend to students who come from Latin America and want to learn more about the political history. Great class! Great community!",
                "I would recommend this course for the community it facilitates. I think that all of my classes that have coalesced into community at Yale have had a common thread -- that of being physically with people for long periods of time. This class consistently met into the late hours of the evening multiple times a week. This was difficult for me, (and perhaps too demanding for 1 out of 4-5 classes to ask for 9-10 hours of class time a week), but it also played a big role in generating such a committed group of humans. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this course solely for the community, with the caveat that at times it felt like way too big of an ask and too much for me to handle.",
                "I would recommend this course to practically anyone. I think that whether you are an expert in radical Latin American cinema or know nothing about it this course will teach you so much about the content of course but also as an exploration of humanity.",
                "Learned about collective liberation and various Latin American movements against dictatorship, labor exploitation, police brutality, sexual violence, etc. Would have greatly regretted if I'd never been introduced to the films in this class, so very much appreciated this space.
