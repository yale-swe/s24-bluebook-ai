                "The texts were very hit or miss for me, but they did each offer a lot of opportunity for engagement and discussion.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Eccles is definitely a strength, she brings really interesting insights to class and offers a valuable perspective on the discussion. She also allows the discussion to flow naturally, though, and the students wind up leading their own class a lot of the time, which is interesting. The presentations by students on the supplementary readings each week fostered great discussion, and she has you write a letter every other week to your writing partner about what you've been reading and what your thoughts are, which I thought was a really unique part of the class and I really enjoyed getting to do those\r\nWeaknesses: the reading list a little obscure, and there were so many texts on it that it forced us to cut discussion short on most of them, which was disappointing because it always felt like we'd only scratched the surface before we had to move on to the next text. Also, while Prof. Eccles gives really great feedback on papers, it takes her quite a while to get that feedback to you, so we didn't have grades/comments before the end of add/drop or our second paper, which would have been helpful"

                "Yes, I would, just to take a class with Prof. Eccles! Full disclosure: the readings are long and sometimes not super accessible when youre reading them by yourself. I would say, however, they become 1000% more interesting when you and your classmates and Prof. Eccles are talking about them in class! So make sure you are interested in the readings before committing. But I loved the class!",
