It was a very comprehensive course.",

You learn the ins-and-outs of different protest models and I think it's a very useful skill to apply during your own essays. Furthermore, the course provides a lot of practical insights through documentaries and guest speakers which allows you to ground the knowledge in reality."

                "The strengths of this course lie in not only the syllabus and course materials but also in Professor Hierro's skills as a professor. The material is very comprehensivewe talk about the theories of collective action, themes in protests and issues that people protest, including climate activism. Professor Hierro is very good at facilitating discussions and encouraging everyone to speak.\r\nA weakness of the course is that the theory portion of the class is difficult to comprehend, at times. The textbook we used to read about theories of collective action was written very comprehensively and not necessarily for beginners in political theory. The whole class struggled with the theories.",
                "The class is incredibly well-structured from the begining.",
                "Strengths: The primary strength of this course is Professor Hierro. She is so passionate and knowledgeable about the topic, and always willing to adjust our seminar discussions to center around what interests the class the most. Her office hours are also very flexible and she is accessible outside of them if you need additional guidance or support. The workload of the course is very fair, and the assignments don't seem like busy work as they do for other coursesthey are thought-provoking and challenge you to engage with the readings critically. The seminar is also far more engaging than most seminar classes I've taken in the department; we've had activists Zoom in and speak to our class, connected our readings to the ongoing protests in Iran, and  engaged in collaborative group activities (such as presentations) that seminars typically do not allow for. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No weaknesses. I just wish the course was longer. This is by far my favorite seminar I've taken in all my years here.",
                "I wish there were more guest speakers, as well as a better introduction to overall social movement theory. Many of the theory parts at the beginning of the course were very dense and having Professor Hierro, instead of students who did not quite always know what they were talking about, explain more would have been helpful.",
                "I think we could spend more time digging into specific protest movements and relate them to course readings/theories throughout, rather than just at the end in our final paper.",
                "I think a strength of the course is Professor Hierro herself as she is incredibly knowledgable about the subject! The first few weeks of the course are very theory-heavy and was quite difficult to get through. Once the course transitioned away from theory-based discussions, my enjoyment of the course quickly increased.",
                "Strengths: interesting readings; great discussion and great facilitation by professor Hierro; guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeakness: not really a weakness, but, the theory weeks can get a bit dense so just be prepared for that"

                "I would recommend this course to another student! It's an excellently crafted course, and Professor Hierro is very intentional about the material she picks for our class discussions and how she crafts class discussions. I learned so much in this course, and I was always engaged.",
                "I think this course is rare because Professor Hierro offers such an incredibly detailed roadmap to the course-- there are no surprises which I really appreciated.",
                "Yes! This is by far one of the best seminars I've taken at Yale. The topic is very relevant and interesting, and the work pushes students to engage critically with the readings and theories we discuss. I think it's important to understand that this course focuses fairly heavily on theoryit isn't necessarily a course centered around a discussion and analysis of modern day protests (although they do come up very often in discussion). Overall, it's a course that left me feeling like I learned a lot and I am able to more critically understand the emergence, success (and failures) and evolution of protests today. Professor Hierro is also a great instructor and an amazing resource as she is so knowledgable and passionate about the topic.",
                "ABSOLUTELY! Such an important and powerful course",
                "Absolutely do take it! The first four weeks or so are very theoretical, but it gets so interesting after that.",
                "Absolutely. This was one of the best seminars Ive taken during my time at Yale, and Prof. Hierro did all she could to facilitate a robust and active discussion throughout the course. The first half of that class was an intensive dive into collective action theory, which was quite informative from a political science perspective, while the second half of the course was focused on protest processes and more in-depth discussion of cases. Every week, I felt actively engaged in the course and like I was learning new things. Definitely a seminar worth taking!",
                "If you enjoy theory and are interested in protest theory, then this course is definitely for you! If you find theory to be difficult, keep in mind the course focuses on theory for the first four or so meetings before transitioning to being more case-study/real-life-application based.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and I learned a lot about how to think about social movements. Professor Hierro is very kind and happy to engage with your thoughts/ideas. Very student-discussion centered. Also, the guest speakers are truly wonderful."
