I learned methods to develop my style, while also having the freedom to think creatively about my writing in ways I havent before. I was taught that I can grow as a writer while also trying new things in my own ways.",
                "I learned a lot in this class: \r\n\r\n- how to write\r\n- how to communicate ideas\r\n- how to write a research paper\r\n- how to craft my own voice",
                "I greatly developed my writing skills through taking this course. I learned how to collaborate in discussion groups on writing projects, present comfortably in front of an audience, and to develop a writing style that I greatly enjoy.",
                "Many skills, including making improvements in my writing and learning to read and understand texts more deeply.",
                "I didn't find this course particularly beneficial for my learning, and I believe another professor might have been more suitable. The grading structure in this course was challenging to follow, and it included numerous unconventional elements that seemed unnecessary and confusing. Additionally, the course required us to perform manual labor at the Yale Farm once a week, which, for individuals like myself who do not enjoy such tasks, makes the course seem not worth the effort. Additionally, accessing the Yale Farm involved a considerable uphill walk, adding an extra layer of effort to each visit. In my opinion, this course caters to a very specific type of person and is designed with them in mind. I sorely regret taking this course.",

                "The strengths of this class were the professor and the farm. The professor was so engaging and the farm made this class just so much more fun.",

                "The course is a wonderful course. The style of teaching and grading allows for students to focus on learning and improving writing.",
                "Strengths: the relief of the course finally being over. Weaknesses: uninteresting content, dull readings, uninspiring classes, a challenging contract to follow, and the requirement to walk far to the Yale Farm to engage in free labor.",
                "Strengths of the class is that we got to do a lot of field work on the farm, and got to implement that into our text. \r\nWeaknesses of the class is that since we spent a lot of time on the farm, we got less time to spend on our text in class."

                "Yes! Yes! Yes! I already have as this has been my favorite class of the semester. It was a fun English class and a hidden gem for first years. Well, next year it probably won't be hidden anymore as I've talked about it to literally everyone!",

                "Yes! The style of the course is wonderful, and is conducive for learning.",
                "I strongly advise against it. Please learn from my experience and avoid making the same mistake I did. I found the course to be unfulfilling, and in hindsight, I regret not choosing a more enjoyable one. The course mandates participating in free labor at the Yale Farm, a commitment that often feels obligatory and uncomfortable. Additionally, the grading contract is annoying, and the content lacks excitement. Without a doubt, this course stands out as one of the most frustrating experiences during my time at Yale.",
                "I would recommend this class because it gives a very good base on how to write good university level essays."
