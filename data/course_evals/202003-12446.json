                "It is very free flowing and was difficult to do art in the virtual format.",
                "I loved how the teacher pushed me to try a new way of learning and research. The class time was quite long and it could sometimes be hard to pay attention.",
                "Strengths: Instructor is awesome, topics are great, assignments are fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 3 hour continuous zoom calls are kind of hard. Perhaps splitting it over two days and having breaks during the meetings to stretch.",
                "The strengths of this course were the guests, Karin's knowledge, and the setup (guest, presentations, etc.). It was an incomparable experience to hear from so many talented artists and to be able to interact with them. The only improvement I would make is to have a five minute break in the middle of class.",
                "One strength of this course was its fluidity and acceptance of various types of work. It allowed me to pursue topics that I was interested in researching. Further, engagement was a strength of this course as well. Hearing other students present about topics they were passionate about was fascinating and enlightening.",
                "strengths:\r\nall guests were passionate and willing to talk to the class about their work\r\ninclusive of students (or as prof. schneider would call us, \"artists\") of all backgrounds, in regards to experience and skill\r\n\r\nweakness:\r\na few of the guests did not hold my attention as much as others; however, this is simply a personal preference",
                "Strengths: Really great guest speakers that gave a lot of insight into their work. Weaknesses: A 3-hour Zoom lecture is just way too long to be able to stay focused on one topic for. I wish there was more room for experimentation with art during class rather than just all discussion for that length of time.",
                "The lessons, exercises, and speakers were all great strengths. The teaching style, practice, and our presentations made it very enjoyable to experiment along the way and bring out the individuality of our pieces and thoughts."

                "In an in-person setting, I think this class would've been super fun to be able to interact with the artists and the art other students were creating, so I would recommend it. But taking the seminar virtually really made it difficult to enjoy those discussions.",
                "I really enjoyed the strong focus on experiential learning in art and focusing on the interpretation, perspective, and process elements. I felt that this greatly strengthened my individual creative efforts and I will certainly hold the practices with me going forward in my education and life."
