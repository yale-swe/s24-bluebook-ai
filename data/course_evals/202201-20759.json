                "I learned a lot about the history of neurolinguistics and got more familiar reading neuroscience papers. The class reframed the way that I think about language, which was really helpful. It also introduced me to numerous research methodologies that neurolinguists use.",
                "I learned a lot about the field of neurolinguistics, which I had never studied before. I also learned how to read through hard studies quickly and find the important key points.",
                "I learned a lot about the field of neurolinguistics -- we covered the ~50 years that the field has existed in depth, which I really appreciated. This course revolves around three \"degrees of freedom\" in the course, language, cognition, and the brain, and I appreciated that we were able to look at the neurocognition of language through these three lenses. This course is has a lot of work, but I honestly really enjoyed most of it. I learned how to construct a linguistic pilot study and argue more confidently in favor of my theories and hypotheses through presentations in front of class each week. The final project was a study proposal based on our pilot study, and I found it very cool that we, as neurolinguistics students, were learning how to apply to fund a study of our own interest. I learned so many skills about linguistics, science, and learning in general.",
                "How language is accomplished by the structure and functioning of the brain -- we really worked on the skill of reading scientific papers and getting the most important parts from them, building them into a bigger picture of the linguistic system in the brain.",
                "Learned in-depth about specific topics in linguistics, neuroscience, and cognition. Lots of skills in research/study design, gaining fluency in how to read \r\nscientific literature in these areas. The insights about how language comes together in the human brain were fascinating if you are the type of person to be interested in those types of questions.",
                "I gained extensive knowledge of how language is produced, understood, and stored in the brain. I also learned about how knowledge in general is stored in the brain, and how this foundation allows us to efficiently process language. The course has a heavy focus on Brocas aphasia and Wernickes aphasia as a reference point for learning.",

            "comments": [
                "A major strength of the course is the material, which is objectively really interesting. It was exciting to learn about language in the brain. One thing that got in the way of me fully enjoying the course was the workload. We had about double the amount of assessments compared to other classes, and the class required all of my academic attention at all times. Cutting down on some of the assessments would make the course much more doable, and I don't think we would really lose a lot of the learning experience.",
                "Strengths: You'll learn so much about this field that you'll leave the class feeling like an expert. Professor Piango doesn't treat us as incapable of absorbing this difficult material--she believes in our ability to comprehend the material. She cold-calls a lot during class but it's never mean, and when she keeps pushing your answer, it's because she knows that you'll get there eventually. I really enjoyed certain units in this class, like when we learned about Broca's patients for the first quarter of the semester. Weaknesses: I don't think we got enough feedback during the semester, which made writing the final paper very hard. I also thought that the tests sometimes had confusing questions, which was hard because a lot of them were true/false (and I'm not good with true/false questions). I honestly couldn't tell you what my final grade will be in this class as we get no feedback, but I really enjoyed taking it! Sometimes I wish we had a TA or someone else who could explain the material, because if I didn't understand Professor Piango's explanation, there was no one else I could ask.",
                "Strengths: The material is very interesting, and I really enjoyed reading most of the papers in this course. The professor is also a wonderful asset -- she actually wrote or co-wrote several of the papers in the course and knows many of the other authors personally, which was very cool. She is extremely knowledgeable about the material and I really enjoyed learning from her insights. The pilot study was also structured so that we did a little bit of work on the project every week, which was at times a lot of work with the reading, but I appreciated it being spread out.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of work that wasn't spread out through the semester. The first six weeks or so we had a Pset every week (graded for completion) covering 100-200 pages of reading, which was a lot considering the last half of the semester we had much less reading and less homeworks. The pilot study was also a lot of work to do on top of the reading/psets every week. I also felt that we could probably have one less exam. Sometimes the material is gone through quickly, which is understandable because there is simply so much of it, but I did get confused here and there. Other students in the class may have much more linguistic/neuroscientific background than others, which may feel a little frustrating if you have not done that much coursework, but I found that to actually be stimulating.",
                "The main strength, but also main difficulty, for this course was the sheer amount of content covered and the amount of work we were able to complete. I feel like for a semester's work, I have a really robust understanding of how language happens in the brain, but it was difficult at times to tell what takeaways we were trying to get from each paper because we could get a little bogged down in the details. A lot of the larger picture only coalesced for me when I was studying for the final exam. One weakness of the course was that after a certain point, we were expected to do multiple assignments for one day, e.g. read the papers and do work for the pilot study, and then we got stretched too thin and did neither very well.",
                "The strengths were in the material itself and Professor Pinango. She's great at explaining difficult concepts, putting everything together, and always gets excited about the material. The homework assignments, although often very time-consuming, always led me to develop a basic understanding on the topics before going into them in depth in the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe main weaknesses were about feedback. Through the semester, we only got grades and feedback for maybe 2 of the weekly homework assignments. The main group project and the final project proposal ended up being educational, but it would have been great if expectations for them had been explained earlier. We would often be working on these projects trying to guess what the assignments were, since they were never explained explicitely in class or section.",
                "This course covers a lot of material and is very dense. While the readings were difficult, I found that class time helped me understand them more thoroughly. The course also requires that you compete a pilot neurolinguistics study, which can be a lot alongside the course material, but I found it enjoyable.",

                "Yes, but with the caveat that you'll be expected to do a lot of work and absorb a lot of information, especially by the end of the semester. Also, if you don't have a background in linguistics, I wouldn't take this class. I had only taken one linguistics class before this one and I really struggled through certain units, as I felt like we were expected to know much more about linguistics than I had initially thought by looking at the course description.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in the material. You will have to put in a lot of work for this course, but it is very rewarding. This is a very niche course but I would definitely recommend it.",
                "Absolutely take this class if you want to know how language happens in the brain. That said, this class is not for the faint of heart -- you will read a bunch of papers and work to assimilate that content, but you also will design and execute a pilot study with a group, write a report, and then have to write your own research proposal based on the pilot study. There are also two quizzes and a final exam. It is a lot of work but if you would be interested and you have the time to devote to it, it is truly one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale.",
                "If you're interested in the topics of Neurolinguistics, I couldn't recommend it highly enough-- there is no one more passionate or who teaches these topics better than Professor Pinango. \r\n\r\nIf you're not really interested and are thinking about taking the course to fulfill a requirements, just know that it is a work-intensive class. You'll be able to pull it off but this class is far from a low-effort credit.",
                "Absolutely! I left every course with more answers and more questions, and a better understanding of language in the brain. This course shaped my career and academic goals, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I find myself applying lessons from it to the ways I think about language in daily life.",
