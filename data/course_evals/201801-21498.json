    "Saw many of the concepts discussed in MENG285 in practice--stress tests, different types of microscopy, XRD, etc.",
    "Cool hands on skills in mechanical engineering and fabrication that you wouldn't really get anywhere else.",
    "I learned how to use several pieces of lab equipment, such as furnaces and electron microscopes.",
    "Metallic glasses and getting into a MechE lab and practicing all of the skills was a big step forward.",
    "LEarned some lab things but otherwise a repeat of the material science class",
    "Despite the very poor organization of this class, I learned more about the processes of forming and characterizing alloys. I did not feel I learned much useful information about writing scientific papers, though it was a goal of the class.",
    "basic scientific writing and techniques",
    "This class was a follow-up from MENG 285. The lectures did not bring in much new material: we go over the basics of dislocation theory, alloying, and properties testing at the beginning of the course. The new skills I learned were working in the lab environment, writing lab reports and outlines, and preparing a final presentation.",
    "it was cool to actually get to do the stuff that we learned so much about in 285 (alloying, tensile tests, etc)",
    "I learned how to write a proper scientific lab report, and how to use various machines to test material properties.",
    "Learned materials science concepts and basic lab writing and presentation skills.",
    "We learned the different methods of measuring mechanical properties of materials."

   "comments": [
    "I liked that the structure of the class gave you practice with both lab writing and presentation skills. It felt like this was the main focus of the class rather than teaching a specific scientific topic, but it was very useful for future labs, I feel. Not the most organized though.",
    "There's a disconnect between the TFs in the class and the Professor. The TFs run the actual lab times while the professor does all the grading and creating of assignments. This means that if you have questions during lab about writing reports or turning in assignments, you can't really get answers and must instead send an email and hope the professor sees it and responds in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nThere are also no grades in this class, because the professor doesn't believe in giving grades. This is fine, but it makes it very difficult to know where you stand in the class, how you might need to improve, or just generally gain confidence from having feedback.",
    "The course is very disorganized. While Professor Schroers and the TAs are nice people, they don't seem to know what's going on a lot of the time. Professor Schroers could be more on top of things and run the class better so that the labs run smoothly and there isn't as much confusion. The labs themselves are very interesting and with some better organization, it could be much more enjoyable.",
    "Many labs we really didn't do anything. Also, most labs were returned for aesthetic things or otherwise mediocre things",
    "This was the worst and most poorly organized class I have taken at Yale. The lectures at the beginning of the semester were a waste of time as they covered the exact same material (down to the slides) as the previous semester's MENG 285 class. Once the labs actually started, the TA's tried their best, but there was clearly poor communication between them and the professors and they oftentimes could not answer our questions about assignments. Additionally, many of the procedure steps were done by the TA's and the class merely watched. Professor Schroers' comments on lab outlines were not very helpful as he mainly told students to refer back to vague instructions from a slide in a previous lecture. We had read over this slide many times, but his main advice was to keep reading it instead of providing more constructive criticism. We were told we would have two chances to revise our final lab report but only received one. Additionally, we received no quantitative feedback about our grades throughout the semester.",
    "good overall!",
    "I thought the labs themselves were pretty strong (although I would remove the optical microscopic verification of hardness testing, which was extremely tedious). The lectures, however, would benefit from a time limit (60 or 75 minutes) so Prof. Schroers can make sure he gets through the material without getting too off-topic. The final presentations were also pretty boring considering we'd all already studied these topics to death. It would be interesting to have them on new topics that were related to the labs.",
    "I think the material and labs are very interesting. I think the overall organization of the whole class was all over the place. Definitely learned how to think on my feet. TAs and Professor were not spoon feeding anything to the students.",
    "Strengths are that the labs are fun and interesting. Weaknesses are that feedback is often vague and lectures are a repeat of MENG 285.",
    "Chill lab with good feedback for the writeups!",
    "This lab was very hands on and allowed students to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. TA's were also very helpful in assisting."

    "Aside from organizational issues, it's a pretty good course in terms of learning lab writing and presenting skills.",
    "It's definitely an interesting and fun way to get hands on! You're probably taking it because you have to, but material science is actually really cool!",
    "Yes. It was a valuable experience and foray into mechanical engineering.",
    "Don't do it if you have to",
    "Although most students who take this course have to as a major requirement, I would strongly recommend against taking this class unless it is significantly improved next year.",
    "yes! chill mech e lab",
    "This is a good lab course for the Mechanical Engineering major, and it won't be too difficult, especially if you have taken MENG 285 (Intro to Materials Science). It is cool to make alloys in lab and use some of the equipment  to test it, although it's a bit frustrating to feel like what we're doing is so far off from the more interesting research of the graduate student TAs. That said, the lectures are a real drag, and you won't learn new material if you took 285. It is fun to be in a lab setting with fellow MechE majors, but make sure you pick a good lab group because you will be working with them the whole semester.",
    "Yes! Not a hard class for ABET kids",
    "I would definitely recommmend this course. It is a very unique lab class. Professor Schroers is an extremely accomplished material scientist and it is a pleasure to get to hear him talk about the topic.",
    "Yes, if the are interested in Materials Science or a mechanical engineer.",
    "Yes! chill lab where you see some cool stuff",
    "Yes"
