                "Learning of how to conduct archival research and write research papers. Additionally I gained an understanding of Yales place and history in the world.",
                "Writing better essays, working with archival evidence",
                "I gained incredible experience working with primary source archives in Sterling Library's Manuscripts and Archives. We would visit the archives almost biweekly and got to both examine and research with fascinating documents there. I greatly developed my skills as a historian in this class.",
                "I thoroughly enjoyed this history seminar. My writing improved and so did my research skills. It was fascinating to learn more about Yale's role in different world events that has helped to shape the university it is today.",
                "It was wonderful to learn about the history of the institution I have been at for years, especially in the context of world power and global affairs. The course covers a good span of Yales history, not all of it but a good portion and its a great opportunity to have conversations in reflections on Yales past- the good and the bad."

                "Strengths: Having the opportunity to use Yale's Manuscripts and Archives during class sessions was wonderful. Exposure to the Peabody Museum and  Yale-in-China was fantastic; You learn a lot about Yale's history and mobilization in the world wars. \r\nWeaknesses: I thought the deadline for the final paper was slightly difficult to meet.",
                "Strengths: special trips to the Yale archives, engaging class conversations, thoughtful and approachable professor\r\nWeaknesses: none that come to mind, though it's inevitable that some weeks' topics will be more/less interesting than other weeks'",
                "Strentgths: some interesting no readings and freedom to write a final paper of our choosing.\r\n\r\nWeakness: need more opportunities/workshopping of individuals for bettering their writing.",
                "It's very good, good discussion, good readings, good assignments",
                "The main strength of this course is how much it engages resources of the university, both through archives held by the university and by inviting faculty members of the university to attend class and share their insights with the class about particular historical events they know very well. One example was speaking with Tim White from the Peabody Museum, who had played a huge role in the repatriation of Machu Picchu's artifacts that had been exported to Yale during Hiram Bingham's expeditions there.",

I learned about the Yale Daily News Historical Archives and how to critically engage with primary source material from online to museum. You learn about different episodes of Yale that are not covered in the media.",
                "Yes, definitely. You can only take a class like this at Yale, and it's a really cool experience to learn about Yale's history through the archives.",
