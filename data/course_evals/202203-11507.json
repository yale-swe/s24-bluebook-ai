                "In the context of Brains, I learned the different philosophies and perspectives surrounding the brain and its relation to the self and society. In terms of general skills, I learned critical reading skills (how to read academic papers in philosophy, medicine, psychology, sociology, etc.) as well as how to craft a good argument. I also learned how to write a strong conclusion.",
                "Through ENGL 114: Brains, my classmates and I explored a variety of neurological topics, ranging from Ian Hacking's labeling theory to the neurodiversity paradigm, in the context of academic readings and popular media.",

                "This was my favorite course this term; it was engaging without being overbearing and complex without being overly difficult.\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Awesome vibe in class\r\n- Great readings, fruitful discussion in classs\r\n- Loved the freedom to explore new topics for assignments like P3.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not many! If you don't like reading, discussing, and then writing, don't take this, but I think it would difficult to find a writing class where that wasn't the case.",
                "The strength of the course was most definitely the instructor, Dylan. Every class was engaging because of his choice of the sources we were using and his own interest in them. Additionally, he incorporate cool sources such as memes to provide new perspectives about the brain. He kept the class very friendly, where we would have \"threshold\" thoughts to talk about what we were thinking about as we walked into class, and there wasn't any pressure in the class. There was also clear and prompt feedback on the work, and Dylan was very accommodating to help with papers outside of class.",
                "The course felt perfectly paced, such that everyone in the seminar was strongly engaged throughout the semester. Course content was challenging, but not in a way that unreasonably stressed students out. Overall, I personally felt that from the seminar, I was taking away more new ideas and perspectives that I had from any other course before.",
                "This course was one of my favorites this semester. Everyone in the course clearly cared about the material so every class was a lively discussion in which everyone participated."

                "Without a doubt yes. This was by far the best, most insightful, class I have taken at Yale as a math major. All the readings provided a unique, nuanced perspective to the brain that expanded my horizon. I really enjoyed the incorporation of memes in the class and the freedom to write about any topic pertaining to the brain. And, if you can take it with Dylan Davidson, that is a true plus!",
                "Yes! ENGL 114: Brains is an excellent course that challenges one's manner of conceptualizing selfhood. Though mind-bending at times, the seminar is truly intellectually rewarding.",
