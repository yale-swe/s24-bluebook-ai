                "I would prefer having a more typical Business French course, with practical content such as:\r\n- writing a CV/cover letter\r\n- interviewing in French\r\n- presenting in French\r\n- research on business/economic topics pertinent to our future careers\r\n- Business/economy vocabulary presented in an organized way (e.g. by industry)",
                "Strengths: The course was very well organized. The carefully curated selection of literary material, documentaries, and films allowed for a very comprehensive understanding of and engagement with French politics and economy. I really appreciated that we covered various different countries in the Francophonie as well. Class discussions were always very enriching and interesting. Weaknesses: none.",
                "Fantastic course! Prof Tertrain is an incredible professor, I learn so much from him and I really enjoyed the balance of assignments, including papers and presentations, and I really enjoyed all of the films and documentaries we were assigned.",
                "Strengths of this course is that the professor does his best job to let everyone practice their french and participate. He ensures to include everyone in the conversation, frequently referencing the responses of students who hadn't had the chance to speak yet. I think a weakness of this course might be the scheduling. With the presentation schedules and essays as well as the homework for every class, someone could easily have an essay due, a major presentation, and a 2 hour film to watch and reflect on over the course of three days. I could tell Professor Tertrain did his best to mitigate this through making the essays due Saturday night, but I still felt the burden of a lot of work all at once at times. The only other weakness I could think of is the class size sometimes felt too large to have enough time in each class to properly practice my french.",
                "Strengths: engaging discussions in a small seminar format; professor is very passionate and cares deeply about students; assignments have a good variety (e.g. presentations, paper, vocab quizzes) and are evenly spaced throughout the semester, so the workload is never overwhelming.\r\nWeakness: sometimes the professor's questions become too specific to the readings and it's hard to kick off a discussion that way. But a minor issue!",
                "Strength: structure of the class was great, without unnecessary stress but also reinforcing high engagement. Super interesting content and very fair assignments. The course is really made to improve your skills and learning!",

                "Yes, if you are interested in thematic and political topics within the world of business in France and Francophone countries. There were some good opportunities to do research and presentations in areas related to my own interests in the business world.",
                "Yes! As long as you are comfortable speaking in French or comfortable being uncomfortable having to speak in class. The class is extremely well-organized and you learn a lot with the documentaries/movies, readings, and class discussions. A fair warning that the workload is quite high: before every class (twice a week) you have to write a reading response after watching a 2-hour documentary or doing a good amount of reading, and on top of that, throughout the semester you have two 1400-word essays and three oral presentations, so in my experience, you have A LOT to do for this class for five weeks of the semester at least. But that being said, I do think it's worth it, especially because the material is truly interesting and it's a great way to practice your French.",
                "I think every French student/French major should take this course... it is a perfect introduction to the politics and economy of so many different francophone countries. Prof. Tertrain is an amazing professor, and class discussions are always very stimulating and enriching.",
                "Yes! You'll learn so much about the economy and business in France and other francophone countries",
                "Yes absolutely!! If you are at interested in more real-world application of the French language this is definitely the class to take",
                "Yes, I would. It is fairly intensive in the work that you have to put into every course, but my french greatly improved.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course for everyone looking to improve their French speaking and writing, especially those with an interest in business topics and the ethical issues surrounding them. The workload is very fair and manageable and discussions are very engaging.",
                "Would highly recommend. The course is certainly different from other more literature-oriented courses, and it is very interesting to discuss current themes in French and also learn about themes that are particularly relevant to the francophone world. The class structure and professor are great. Take without a doubt if you get into the course.",
                "Definitely. A great introduction to the French workplace and all of its nuances  both from a business and cultural perspective."
