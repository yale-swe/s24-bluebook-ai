                "Some overview of history of opera in the 19th century (ranging from content as famous as Verdi and Puccini to, in some readings, that as obscure today as Marschner and Boieldieu) and theories of identity and representation (including both philosophy and various fields that end in studies). Also covers a lot of European intellectual/cultural history. Most of the class was about engaging with recent scholarship about rather well-known operas. In terms of skills, analyzing libretti, scores (typically with clips of the music played in class, which made it more accessible to non-specialists), and musicological writing.",
                "I learned how to systematically study opera as an academic subject, especially in relation to the issue of representation as influenced by social and political backgrounds.",
                "(Note to Prof. Kreuzer - this is one of the PhD students in the course!)\r\n\r\nThis class opened up my understanding of opera as a medium. It was a chance to see the ways in which issues of representation I encounter in my own work are exacerbated and re-inflected on the opera stage, and I also encountered a lot of scholarship and ideas that I will carry forward with me. It was also a great introduction to 19th century opera in a framework around representation that I found interesting and engaging."

                "I honestly wish it it was more times a week instead of one huge block on Friday. Regardless, it was really interesting.",
                "A major strength of the course is the syllabus. I think the methods of assessment were very appropriate and helpful. I also greatly enjoyed the structure of the course-- each day had a specific theme/opera (though it sometimes became confusing when different units would bleed into other days). All of the readings and other materials were thought-provoking and great for the course. \r\n\r\nSometimes, the class discussions were unorganized. This might have been improved with coming to class with a set number of questions to discuss (generated by a designated student or the professor).",
                "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Kreuzer is incredibly organized and efficient at working through a century's worth of content. Classes were structured effectively with room for both discussion and some lecture/presentations.",
                "There are many strengths of this course. This is a challenging course to teach due to the sensitivity of some of its topics and the diverse backgrounds of the students, some of whom (myself included) had little prior knowledge in music as an academic subject. Prof. Kreuzer makes the classroom environment inclusive and conducive to student learning by incorporating different perspectives on each of the operas we studied. She is a great discussion leader who is more than knowledgeable about the subject matter but also willing to let students contribute to the conversation. She also provides helpful verbal and written comments on the paper, which was very enjoyable to write.",
                "I would have liked to see more room for open discussion as opposed to the instructor looking for specific answers to questions.",
                "The class was organized and structured nicely - I feel like we had a great progression of topics and ideas through the weeks. I liked the structure of the writing assignments and the ability to expand my midterm project into a final. I would have enjoyed the ability to get deeper into some of the articles we read - I felt like sometimes we skimmed the surface in order to cover more ground. That might also have been because of the large class size/ mezzanine level class, though."

                "Professor Kreuzer gives useful feedback and communicates assignments/deadlines clearly. I'd definitely recommend this course!",
                "If youre interested in opera at all, then yes, even if  youre not a music major and just want a fun class. You should certainly be able to read music to get the most out of this class, but it is still very accessible to those without more specialized musical training. There is so much thats unexplored in the field that you will surely find a way to highlight your unique perspective in the final project.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. This has been one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale. I came to this course with little background in music, let alone opera (except for a personal interest in the subject, of course). I finished the course having learned much about not only operas but also how I can incorporate that knowledge to other fields that I am interested in.",
                "Yes! It was a great introductory course into 19th century opera while also dealing with larger issues of representation and conversations about contemporary stagings. Prof. Kreuzer creates a productive and engaging learning environment, and I felt like she held space for everyone's individual interests and points of view in the class."
