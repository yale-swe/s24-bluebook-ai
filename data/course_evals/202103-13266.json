                "Flexibility is both the greatest strength and greatest weakness of the senior capstone project. In my group the students were the driving force behind essentially all major decisions beyond the initial scope of our task. This meant that I worked at a pace decided by the group, and worked on tasks that I wanted. This was helpful for my own intellectual curiosity and schedule but dangerous since my group ultimately fell behind in the last month of the semester, and at times made decisions I didn't fully agree with.",
                "I think the course topic is very broad, which gives students a great opportunity to dive deep into the topic. However, I think it would be helpful to have a more general structure with the course in the beginning. For example: A weekly plan or table of contents overview\/timeline of topics and tasks, that is developed by the professor so that students have a more clear expectation of how the course will develop throughout the semester. Then, with this foundation\/skeleton, students can flesh it out more as a group, as well as with the professor. With this, students will have a more clear footing from the beginning of the semester and can feel more confident in the direction that they are going in."
