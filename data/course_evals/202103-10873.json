            "comments": [
                "It was just boring content, I wish we went over naming as that would provide a foundation",
                "Material is interesting, but our lectures were so poorly organized and structured that I learned almost nothing in lectures. Had to learn nearly everything by myself or through my TA. All of the required material wasn't even taught in class, and we were tested about some topics that weren't even covered in lecture.",
                "It's just basically a lecture, but I think presentations with more examples would be much more helpful.",
                "Strengths of this course include firstly that there are many options to get help if needed. Between peer tutors, section, and office hours, if you need help you can get it. I also really felt that the lectures were informative and helpful in understanding the information.\r\nWeaknesses are firstly that I felt that the second exam was especially unfair. I felt that the exam was made to trick us rather than allow us to show our knowledge. I also thought the weekly PSETs given in section were sometimes unnecessary as some of them just seemed like they were made to be hard and make us struggle rather than helpful. Finally, the achieve problems were not that helpful and honestly I think if you give us a PSET every week you should not also give us online achieve problems.",
                "The strength of the course is that it is taught extremely well, and I definitely feel like I actually learned the material. The problem with the course is that so much weight is placed on only the exams, so that even if you know the material and feel like you learned it, if a test comes around and you just have a bad day and make mistakes you normally wouldn't on the test, or if the test throws something new, mostly unfamiliar, or even worse something from a long time ago that hasn't even been mentioned in a month (which happened) and you miss a lot of points, you get a bad grade in the class, even when you've done all the homework and PSETs.",
                "A strength is that it was well organized. \r\nA weakness is that we did not receive very much feedback. The achieve problem sets were helpful with feedback but our exams never had corrections on them and instead were just the points we missed so it was hard to tell exactly what we did wrong. For each exam, two practice tests were posted (the 2018 and 2019 exams). These two practice tests would always have the exact same format which alludes to the exam being the same format but it was never. If practice tests are going to be given, they should be at least similar to the format of the test or have similar questions but often times, the test would have questions that we had never discussed.",
                "The course was unnecessarily difficult because the lectures we attended never gave us any real understanding of the necessary content. Many students had to just teach themselves from either the textbook or from YouTube videos from other professors. This made attending the class largely a waste of time.",
                "Strengths are the TAs and all of the review sessions they hold for the midterms. The collaborative PSETs are very helpful.",
                "Strengths: none \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: boring lectures, difficult material",
                "Strengths: The TAs were really helpful, I liked that between them and the peer tutors there were office hours all the time. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the communication between teaching staff and students was difficult, there were tons of announcements that were sometimes hard to keep up with.",
                "Strengths: Structure, lectures, and TAs. Weaknesses: Seth might seem a bit grumpy sometimesbut he is generally super nice and you can tell how smart he is. I feel like there should be a bit more control on PSets, as sometimes I feel like not everyone in the groups would contribute equally and some people got credit without working. Still, the idea of having study groups was nice, and a good way to meet people.",
                "Strengths: midterm drop\r\nWeakness: not organized for student learning. Discussion section didnt cement topics in the name of challenging us. Achieve problems didnt really feel helpful when tests were so vastly different.",
                "I found the material very interesting and thought that the class did a good job of establishing chemical principles and building on them throughout the semester. The lectures were enjoyable, and I found that supplementing them with the book readings worked well in learning the class's concepts. To that end, the PSETs were usually on the shorter side (usually ~1-3 hours) and the readings, though a bit long, were definitely manageable. The exams were on the harder side, but out of three midterms the lowest is dropped, and that helps a lot. Also, the TAs were very helpful and (mostly) chill.\r\nThat said, the administration of the class could definitely have been better. The class could be very qualitative at times, and I think knowing that more at the onset would have been nice. Additionally, the way that exams were handled throughout the class was not always the best. The first exam was remote, and when the staff found out that people cheated (shocking!), it almost seemed like they took it out on the rest of us.  The next two exams were in person and more difficult, which I personally didn't have an issue with (although one was scheduled on Diwali and that wasn't great), but the *remote* final exam was cancelled (probably due to that initial cheating), and we were forced to either take our current grade or take an ABX and the final in spring. That felt very unfair, especially because final grade distributions were not calculated yet.\r\nAll of that said, I think this was a valuable class and I am very glad to have taken it.",
                "This course facilitated an unwelcoming environment in many ways. The professor was in a bad mood all semester, Aaron (the preceptor) acted fake, and most of the TA's (though not all) were very condescending. The professor always complained about it being a large class but so is general chemistry and I felt completely different being in this course. I loved chemistry but I really regret taking this course. There needs to be people who actually care about the students teaching this course. There were so many insensitive comments made throughout the semester that made me feel not only unwelcome in the course but also unwelcome at Yale. I learned a bit of chemistry but I truly believe this is the worst course I've taken at Yale.",
                "Strengths: lectures were good and covered most content, abundance of peer tutoring resources\r\nWeaknesses: not enough guidance on problem sets, same mechanism drawn in different ways in class/section/resources which was sometimes frustrating",
                "This class does a good job laying the basic chemical foundations before diving into organic chemistry mechanisms. It would be even more helpful to have the discussion of solvents earlier so that students learn how solvent type impacts reactions why instead of just memorizing solvents and reactions. In general, I do feel this class does a good job providing the basic understanding of chemistry to facilitate understanding and not just memorization.",
                "Strengths - TA team is very good and puts together great handouts. Weaknesses - rather unclear expectation of what we need to know; lectures are dry, basic, and not very helpful; professor does not seem to foster any sort of student learning, but gets upset when test scores aren't up to his 'standards'; honestly, professor makes students feel as if they are a burden to him",
                "The weakness is that the class is hardly perceptive to student needs and communications with students lack empathy or fail to take backgrounds into account. Strengths are helpful TA's. This course did a great job picking out talented TAs and section was by far the best part of the course.",
                "we had a lot of help available to help aid us through this experience so it was helpful to know that we had support throughout this experience.",
                "A strength was that it built on prior topics well so that as you went along, you wouldn't forget what you learned. A weakness was that we missed out on a lot of content.",
                "The course was very well taught in the beginning. While the topics were confusing, there was no problem that couldn't be thought through with a little bit of extra work. Coming to the end of the semester, it felt like there was nothing being taught. The things appearing on the exams and Psets were not what we learned in class.",
                "The TAs were very helpful and the handouts they made clarified many concepts. It was hard to learn concepts presented in lecture to a detailed enough level that was needed for the exams.",
                "I think a weakness of this course is the scheduling of the class period. Especially for a class this mentally taxing, a 9am class period is not the best time to learn this material. Another weakness of this class is the way that it is taught. I do not think that the lecture style of this class with the teacher only writing reactions and lists on the chalkboard was effective in learning this material. I think the class would be much better taught with an organized plan for the day with powerpoints in class etc. I think a strength of this class is the multiple resources/TAs the class offers for extra help.",
                "9 am is early for a class like this. Organic chemistry demands full attention from its students, and the truth is that this isn't feasible at 9 am. Students will do better in the class with an incentive to come to class and waking up early is a deterrent, not an incentive. Not everyone loves organic chemistry itself, and that should be accommodated and not punished. The professor lectures well but only by keeping up with the textbook readings will students learn the course material. That must be made clear. An oversight of a student is a lost opportunity. Weaknesses come from the approach and rigor of the class. A class that demands a lot is not organized well and flawed. I think the course could take a different approach -- a philosophy of instilling discipline in students in order to succeed. You need to encourage students now so that they feel prepared, rather than warn only of the difficulties ahead (i.e. organic chemistry being a cumulative course). This is why the TFs are a great strength. I learn more from review sessions than lectures because of the practice problems that were given and the simplicity of the TFs' explanations. Their patience and passion for organic chemistry is admirable and inspiring. The TF handouts are great resources and provides good practice for exams. Posting answer keys for some of the handouts would be helpful so that we don't have to email with every question.",
                "The material of the course was interesting, but very difficult and thus the way that the material was taught was in my opinion, not sufficient. The textbook was dense and difficult to understand and lecture was frustrating because it often did not clear up any difficulties in understanding gotten from the book.",
                "The class was helpful in that there were recordings from the last year to use if u could not make it to class but did not teach many key foundational topics, such as naming of important functional groups. Additionally, a lot of the examples used were unnecessarily complex leading to much confusion",
                "Strengths: Seth explained concepts pretty well, and the availability of Seth's lecture videos on YouTube was key to my understanding of the organic chemistry concepts.  Many of the TA's were very helpful and friendly and really facilitated my learning.  \r\nWeaknesses: I think we should have learned SN1/SN2/E1/E2 reactions before trying to memorize all the different mechanisms (hydroboration-oxidation, oxymercuration, etc) and their stereochemistry.  I would have had a much better understanding of the mechanisms.  I was told to memorize something that seemed so complicated without actually knowing why or how these mechanisms and their respective stereochemistry worked.  We only learned the how and the why AFTER the midterm, which was frustrating.",
                "The course was well-structured and I love how Dr. Herzon also released his recorded lectures from last year to the class.",
                "Strengths: Professor Herzon is a great lecturer. He explains the material well and is engaging. Lectures were well-organized and interesting. The psets were helpful to better understand the lecture content. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Although Professor Herzon was a clear and concise lecturer, he wasn't involved much past that. He did not seem to put in any effort to engage with the students. The exams were unnecessarily difficult. We were giving past years' exams to prepare and practice, but our exams were formatted completely differently than prior ones and felt much harder. I felt like I understood the lecture material very well, but the exams really made students extrapolate the lecture content so, so far that it felt impossible to figure out an answer for some questions. Even if you study for hours and hours and feel like you have a solid grasp on the concepts, you can leave the exam feeling like you failed miserably. It seemed like the TAs and professors tried to think of the trickiest, most difficult questions to put on the tests. Some of the TAs seemed to enjoy watching students struggle during exams. During the second midterm, they pointed and laughed while flipping through each exam that was handed in and denied to answer questions during the exam even if the questions were completely within reason. After students cheated on the first midterm, it felt like the professor, preceptor, and TAs wanted to punish and torment all the students even if they weren't involved in the cheating.",
                "The course was well-organized in terms of assignments, exam dates, etc. However, the course and seem designed to perpetuate some of the toxic traits of pre-med culture through its grading methods and the demeaning attitudes of some of the teaching staff.",
                "strengths: \r\n- taught the required material\r\n- Aaron was really helpful and taught material clearly if you went into his office hours!! \r\nweaknesses: \r\n- material was not taught clearly (i didn't go to lectures because they were unhelpful and after that started doing a lot better on exams)\r\n- not a great transition into post-covid life. Students i found had a very difficult transition through this class and it definitely impacted my mental health\r\n- section was not helpful",
                "Almost everything about how the class was run this semester should be altered. Lectures were good, and the material we needed to know was clear, but when Aaron took over, it was clear he did not fully know what needed to be covered and did not communicate with Seth about what material was discussed leading to incredible confusion over what material was necessary. The system of assessments as also bad. Achieve was fine for some basic practice, but problem sets were badly run as they were both too short and we were forced to do them in a group which is not how many people work. They also completely consumed every discussion section so instead of having a chance to ask questions we only worked on a short worksheet. These worksheets would have been better as discussion section practice with additional assignments outside of class that we could receive feedback on, even if they were just book questions. There was an absence of instructor provided practice which made it unclear what we needed to know; the GAs supplied everything and that was not completely their job. However, the TAs went above and beyond in terms of answering questions and helping with understanding.",
                "I thought the course was well-taught. I also thought devoting the sections to working on problem sets was great, especially assigning small groups to work together, and that definitely helped my learning. \r\n\r\nI only really had small issues. At times Seth wrote really small so that it was only readable from basically half the seats in the lecture hall, and sometimes he used a dying dry erase marker which was also hard to read. I also had an issue with the exams--I don't think it's fair to put \"challenge\" problems on exams, especially when they count for a lot of points.  There also weren't \"challenge\" problems on any of the practice exams so that gave me kind of a false sense of security.",
                "The lectures themselves were pretty good. The TAs were also helpful for the most part. I didn't like the group PSETs but that's pretty subjective. The weaknesses of the course were mostly in its setup. The worst part was that the midterms were written by TAs. The second midterm contained material that was covered in the week AFTER the exam, which was completely ridiculous. We were explicitly told that some material would not be on any of the exams, but then it was. There was also a lot of content that was not covered in lecture then dropped on us in an optional review session a few days before the exam, which was then a significant part of the exam. It was overall incredibly difficult to study for any of the exams, as it was unclear what would/wouldn't be on it. Another big issue was that the syllabus explicitly stated that all the midterms + finals would be take home exams and then they were all switched to in person after the first one. In addition to all this, there seemed to be a lack of communication between the professor/preceptor/TAs. We were told conflicting information about exams; it was unclear whether or not the take home one was open notes. Also, the professor just didn't show up for the last lecture and nobody really knew what was going on.",
                "Strengths: The TA's were the saving grace of this class and perhaps 75% of the reason that I managed to get anything out of it. They were the only reason I (and many of us) knew what would be expected with regards to acceptable answers on exams. They also worked fairly hard to create and distribute handouts that went more in-depth on material presented in-class and material that was more reminiscent to what would be tested on exams. \r\nWeaknesses: This class was highly disorganized, from the student perspective. It seemed like no one was ever on the same page about anything (as was evident starting from the first exam, when conflicting information about whether the exam was open/closed note was propagated widely throughout the class and not ever clearly-addressed by the preceptor or the instructor until the day of the exam). I found the problem sets to be too short, which I consider a weakness since it meant that not all important material from class was addressed on them. There was never any build-up in difficulty in terms of problems we were given (not enough material was given for us to properly build intuition on the types of questions that we would be faced with on exams). Some of this does fall on us (the students), but the onus of education does fall on the instructor, and not the students.",
                "strengths- lectures were really good and concise, told you exactly what you needed to know and explained well, textbook was also helpful in studying and aiding in understand because it explained things in a slightly different way\r\nweaknesses- grading for exams was sometimes harsh, hard to get partial credit if you don't give exactly what they're looking for",
                "strengths: there's a lot of resources created to help\r\nweaknesses: assessments are frightening and have covered material we didn't really learn, scared of asking the profs for accommodations or help because they're kind of under the mentality that \"if you work you will get good grades\" which is not the case a lot of times",
                "This course was very reliant on what the student does outside of the class, and less to do on the lecture material. The achieves were very helpful to engage with the material. This was a very hands on course. I did feel that the tests were unfair assessments on the material that was presented in class. There were some questions that felt out of reach compared to the reviews and materials we were given to prepare.",
                "Seth's lectures were great! He was an engaging lecturer with neat handwriting and good visuals. Summary handouts posted on Canvas were great. That being said, I really did not like the culture perpetuated by this class. The class is curved based on the median, making students outcompete each other for grades. I felt that much of the content would have to be learned outside of lecture, discussion section, and the problem sets to get top grades. A solid working understanding from lecture and assigned material was not enough to get an A. Some of the TAs (I honestly don't even know their names) would make fun of students behind their backs after they turned in tests (i.e. flipping through and laughing at students' tests when they submitted them) or assume that things that were not yet taught were common knowledge. I did not feel like I could talk to someone about my mistakes without being judged or made fun of. Weekly problem sets plus online Achieve homework sets resulted in about two problem sets a week. Often, my TA would acknowledge that we probably wouldn't know how to do one of the problems on the weekly discussion section problem set and that we'd get it wrong.",
                "Strengths: Resources to help.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were not well-structured and hard to follow. Often times we were given different information from TAs, the professor. etc.",
                "Full of weaknesses and no strengths. Course exams were absolutely brutal and materials were very unclear.",
                "This course was a little uneven. The content is interesting. The peer tutors are excellent. Mechanisms are interesting and I can appreciate the idea of developing a vocabulary to discuss organic chemistry--that organic chemistry is a language to be learnt gradually. However, I think many of the ways the class was actually run were counter-productive and it often felt like communication was inconsistent. (I will go in depth into my thoughts on classroom procedures but I want to say that some of these are based on my understanding of what was occurring behind the scenes, if I am wrong about any of this, I do not necessarily retract my point because clearly there is some disconnect but I would amend my point).\r\n\r\nFirst and most importantly, it was my understanding that TAs wrote each midterm and that it wasn't always the same TA writing the midterm. This made the midterms feel uneven and it can make it harder to prepare for each one when what is prioritized/how the questions are framed changes on each midterm. It also becomes a weakness when some TAs make the midterms much harder than others. For example, midterm 1 was fairly doable and I felt prepared for it. Midterm 2 included a question that it seemed many students in the class struggled with because we had never gone through a mechanism on that scale before. Simply having one person write every exam would alleviate some of this (again--if I am mistaken and the exam writers were consistent then I withdraw this point).\r\nSecond, at some points it didn't feel like the teaching staff were \"on our side\" so to speak. It felt like sometimes TAs enjoyed the anxiety midterms caused--with one laughing at students as they struggled during a particularly difficult question. Students also received an email about how the results of the second midterm reflected some lack of effort on the part of some students. This was extremely disheartening to read and I know several students talked to the TA about how this email was discouraging rather than the intended matter of fact but encouraging. The person who sent the email then proceeded to double down in an in-class lecture the following week. I know this person did not mean to be discouraging either time. But this cannot be how students are talked to after a difficult midterm. It does not make us more likely to seek the help we need. I'm an adult, you can speak to me matter-of-factly and I'll deal with it. But I don't think that makes the learning environment feel particularly welcoming. I'll get over it but I shouldn't have to.\r\nThirdly--and I know future students will hate me for this-- PSets were a weakness. I don't think we should turn in one problem set per group, I think each person turning in a PSet even if we work on them in groups would work better. I know that turning in one PSet per group allowed me to shirk responsibility--I would fully complete one question and attempt the rest. But if I couldn't do it, no worries, another member of my group would attend peer tutoring hours and figure it out. But also, it often felt that PSets were overly complicated. There was one PSet question that my TA confessed to our section that he didn't know how to do until he looked at the answer key. I appreciate the idea of making the PSets more complicated than the exams but I think the PSets should still be doable.\r\n\r\nOverall, the teaching staff should consider what success in organic chemistry looks like. Are they teaching the people who learned some organic chemistry in high school? Because those are likely the people earning above a 100 on the exams. Or, are they focusing on us in the middle, with little to no prior exposure to the subject, the people who want to succeed but maybe don't know how? Those are the people who are earning average grades and maybe (initially) look like they're not putting in much effort. And regardless of who they decide to focus on, how do they talk to students? Do they sound aggravated in emails or are they welcoming?",
                "This course had great content that is essential to understanding the basics in organic chemistry. The teaching staff was also very willing to help! There was some miscommunication between what was presented in class and discussion sections.",
                "Strengths\r\n- very complete course, teaches you from the very foundation to the very complex in a single semester \r\n- the cumulative nature of the course stimulates your understanding of even the physics of organic chemistry, which then enables you to develop a problem-solving mindset as opposed to having to learn everything by heart\r\n- the TAs for this course take time to create worksheets and notes to supplement your learning which is very helpful",
                "I thought the course was taught very well, although as we found out after the first midterm, the exams should all be in person.",
                "I wish the lectures were recorded, but otherwise there were lots of practice problems and practice tests and review sessions that really help with understanding the material taught in class.",
                "- course did not go too fast (if anything it was too slow)\r\n- exams were not too difficult relative to discussion section p-sets\r\n- discussion section p-sets were nice and challenging",
                "The class is poorly designed for students who are bad at time management or for students who procrastinate because achieve psets were due cumulatively before each midterm exam. There is SO MUCH information to learn in this class and lectures were difficult to follow. The youtube lectures posted were very helpful though and much clearer and easier to follow than in person lectures. The recordings for live lectures were also not that easy to follow. The achieve questions were also nothing like questions given on the exam. The teaching team wasn't very helpful in creating a good learning environment either.",
                "I liked how much material we were given to prepare for exams. I liked walking into an exam knowing what I was expected to understand and be able to do. I also liked that the problem sets and achieve problems were very low stress because they helped me to learn the material in a low stress way. I think at some points, the lectures were a little difficult to follow, and the content felt out of order sometimes.",
                "strengths: full of resources for students to use! lectures were available both virtual and in-person. the loudon textbook is a good choice. the achieve problems were extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the virtual lectures didn't capture the board, so they were pretty much useless unless you can get notes from a friend. the TAs were hit or miss. i managed to switch into a section i loved, but my first section... oh dear. i hope they treat the grad students okay here because my first TA was taking stress out on us.",
                "Strengths include certain TA's and the Achieve learning. Weaknesses include the in-person and recorded lectures (which were broken most of the semester...), grading practices, flexibility of help sessions, etc.",
                "The course does a good job of teaching conceptually difficult material. The examinations were a fair evaluation of what was taught. There were ample opportunities outside of class to brush up on difficult topics.",
                "Strengths are the achieve problems, teaching philosophies, and TA's. Weaknesses are the peer tutors. I grew sick of being \"tutored\" by people who had an organic chemistry god complex. Definitely didn't feel connected to or represented in individuals who were supposed to make learning more manageable coming from a peer's perspective.",
                "I thought this course was taught well and students were well supported by the teaching staff.",
                "The strengths of this course were the pace of the course, as well as the lectures. Some weaknesses were the difficulties of the exams, and the sudden changes that were made to the syllabus, without enough prior notice given to students.",
                "Strengths - the textbook is an incredible resource (really helps you understand course content in-depth); problem sets were done in groups which made them less stressful and helped me understand things better because I got to discuss lecture material with my classmates; midterm exams were cumulative (even though this made each exam more stressful it also really helped prepare me for the final); Achieve practice problems were a very helpful resource to study for exams and to gauge my understanding of course content after we covered it in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lecture was honestly not super helpful; I only attended in order to know what would be covered on the exams. Seth did not explain concepts in-depth and assumed we would understand things despite little explanation and background knowledge. It is assumed that you have a fair amount of background knowledge in chem if you are taking this course, but that is not necessarily true for those of us that took gen chem a while ago. Also, lecture moved at an incredibly fast pace; we would cover tons of material and concepts in a very short amount of time and not in-depth enough to truly understand things. All of my learning in this class came from the textbook and office hours (shoutout to the TAs and peer tutors!)",
                "I'm honestly really disappointed by the teaching of this class.  I felt like a lot of us did most of our learning from the textbook, online, or through our peer tutors. I think the lectures were not well-organized, and to me, it felt like Professor Herzon gave up on our class after that one student cheated on our first test. I don't think that he handled the circumstances around and regarding the final well at all. I don't feel like the teaching was conducive to understanding.",
                "Weaknesses: I think this course has a lot of the weaknesses of any big lecture course at Yale (lack of individualization, inconsistencies among TFs, etc.), but I think that the group problem sets were a huge weakness, because it had the potential to let students fall behind their group members.\r\nStrengths: Professor Herzon has a really great way of explaining organic chemistry concepts so as to make the information digestible to students for the first time. The TFs were also really great at explaining things (from my experience, at least), and I think that the exams were pretty fair (not harder than the PSET questions).",
                "Interesting content. Really good TAs",
                "The strengths of the class was Professor Herzon's recorded lectures from spring 2021, the textbook, and the Achieve work. The weaknesses of the class was Professor Herzonn's live lectures this fall and the exams. I stopped going to lecture after October and just watched the lectures from the spring and I thought he did so much better of a job of explaining concepts in a way that was easily digestable. This probably had to do a lot with my own learning style, as it was nice to be able to pause and rewind and turn on captions so I could get a more engaging lecture experience. The textbook readings were great in supplementing  the lecture and the Achieve work was really great practice. Great practice for reviewing lecture but not really for preparing us for the exams. All of the past exams from the last few years were released and the exams that were given this year was just undeniably more difficult. I won't complain too much because in the end they weren't impossible and did make me think deeper about the concepts and probably improved my understanding overall, but it was just annoying in principle.",
                "Instructor never came to class or showed up late - very unorganized. Terrible course",
                "Strengths: THE TFS (Alex!) - the saving grace of this course, exams were fair and focused on understanding rather than naming/memorization, lectures were relatively easy to follow\r\nWeaknesses: psets were often much more challenging than exams, volume of material can be overwhelming, also it's orgo",
                "Strengths: Professor Herzon was very clear in lecture about what we were expected to understand, and I thought he was good at teaching his curriculum. Recordings of all of the classes are available online from last year, in case the 9am class time doesn't particularly suit you. Structured discussion groups were incredibly helpful for providing students ways to work together and help each other. The TAs are generally helpful. Professor Herzon was generous and was planning on having all exams be take-home until he found out students cheated on the first one. \r\nWeaknesses: It's at 9am. The class is 95% premeds - this just meant that the atmosphere was one of getting through the class, but regardless, I thought Professor Herzon's expectations, tests, and teaching were fair and good."

That said, I think I am in the VAST minority here, so take this review with however much salt you think is necessary.\r\nI found that the chemical concepts readily built on each other and provided a framework which let me actually understand what was going on at the molecular level. The qualitative nature was vexing at times, but I honestly thought it was really cool that we didn't need intense calculations to determine reaction outcomes and could reason our way through based on simple principles. If you're more quantitatively oriented, this class might get frustrating because of that. However, I found it very valuable and fascinating.",

The professor always complained about it being a large class but so is general chemistry and I felt completely different being in this course. I loved chemistry but I really regret taking this course. There needs to be people who actually care about the students teaching this course. There were so many insensitive comments made throughout the semester that made me feel not only unwelcome in the course but also unwelcome at Yale.

Be prepared to work incredibly hard and still have members of the teaching team tell 98% of the class that they aren't doing enough. Organic chemistry is a TOUGH bit of material to grasp conceptually. You will spend countless hours outside of class trying to study and understand the material just for there to be trick question after trick question on the exam. You may feel unsupported by the teaching team, especially the professor, but just know that you're unfortunately in the same boat as 200+ other people. Understand that on day 1, the professor will tell you he's not there to teach you organic chemistry - and he's right.

                "Yes, over CHEM 174 if you are a first-year for sure (unless flipped-classroom learning is for you). I started with CHEM 174 as a freshman and the learning format definitely didn't suit me. Switching to CHEM 220 (same content, but technically a sophomore class) was the best choice I made: Prof. Herzon prepares his lectures very thoroughly, explains every concept to its fullest extent, is always available after class for questions, and fosters a great class environment. The class is bigger than CHEM 174 (about 1.5x I think), but it doesn't hinder your learning- all of that depends on how much you want to communicate with professors/TAs etc. The latter are also incredible for CHEM 220- the content is very conceptually challenging at times, but TAs create great synthesis not-esheets about every topic for students which help a lot. Don't get me wrong, it is a difficult course with a lot of content and mechanisms to learn. What you'll find though, if you put time into understanding the foundations of the chemistry at the start of the semester, is that everything makes logical sense and you can eventually develop a problem-solving as opposed to memorization mindset.",
                "If they are interested in the class, then yes I would. If they are just looking for another science credit I would probably tell them to look somewhere else just because the class is really difficult for someone just trying to fill out distributional requirements.",
                "Only if you have to for premed or as a prereq otherwise no. Dont do this to urself unless you LOVE chemistry/ochem",
                "Yes, orgo is fun. On some level, you're just drawing pictures...and that's fun",
                "no",
                "sure, if you like organic chemistry or if this is a requirement for you. the course content is good (though i might be biased. i like the puzzle-solving nature of orgo), but the community? that's up to you, but i personally feel like this course did a horrible job of building a sense of community among its students. i guess that's just the nature of a lecture course with 200+ students, though.",
                "Definitely not. You probably don't want to take orgo either, but will anyways. Even as a ChemE major this course was repulsive and made me doubt if I even like chemistry. The course culture is toxic; certain TA's and the preceptor frequently had a negative/mocking tone towards students, which severely eroded my confidence. Even ignoring the difficulty of the content which was to be expected, this course has too many problems to list so don't take it unless you have to.",
                "I would recommend this course to any student who needs it for a requirement, but the challenge presented by the material means I wouldn't suggest it for anyone to take \"just for fun\".",
                "I initially was taking this course effectively just for fun. I wasn't pre-med, a chem major, or anyone who would traditionally take the course. That being said, however, I've gained so much more confidence in my skills in the sciences that I do plan to continue my education in them. I would recommend this course because the course is all about growth. Yes, it's challenging. But everyone on staff there wants nothing more than for you to step up to and conquer the challenge. I believe in you, and so do they.",
                "Yes, the teaching team was great and the lectures were fairly interesting.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they are required to take this because of medical (or other graduate) school prerequisites, or major prerequisites. The course is the most difficult one I have personally taken at Yale, and in order to do decently well in the class, the student must commit a much greater amount of time to studying when compared to other Yale College courses. In addition to the workload, the intellectual challenge is also far greater, and the exams are far more challenging than the material covered in lecture, the textbook, the problem sets, and the achieve problems. However, it is still possible to do well if one is willing to put in the work and effort.",
                "Honestly I really liked orgo... it was definitely a challenging course, but if you take the time to really understand course content everything really comes together! (Unlike gen chem, which can be hard to truly understand since it is heavily math-based.) Orgo actually explains why things work the way they do in chemistry! However, since this is a pretty challenging class I would only take it if you truly enjoy chemistry and/or if you need to take it for your major. (I needed it for my major.)",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course. It's kind of sad because I actually enjoyed the semester of organic chemistry that I took in high school, but the teaching and organization of this course was really not great. I think in theory, the organization of class makes a lot of sense - psets every week, etc. However, the way that Professor Herzon taught was so ineffective that I, and a lot of other students, often thought that going to lecture wasn't even worth it. All of us defaulted to the internet and the book when studying for examinations.",
                "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student! That said, if you're not a STEM major that is required to take it, or a premed student who needs to take it, a lot of the work might not be worth it. The workload was never too much, but it definitely required a good amount of individual work to keep up with the fast-paced learning. Overall, it's a pretty solid intro orgo course.",
                "Yes I thought it was interesting",
                "Most people probably do not have a choice to take this class, but in the end its not really that bad. Its definitely a different pace than general chemistry but I thought it was fairly interesting.",
                "No- terrible instructor and poorly organized. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS NECESSARY",
                "No.",
                "Yes, I think that out of the STEM classes at Yale, this one might be the best I've encountered so far in terms of clarity of expectations and content. Unlike other STEM courses, the homework and tests accurately and fairly reflected the content that was taught in class. Very importantly, I felt that the content was taught well, and catered to student learning."
