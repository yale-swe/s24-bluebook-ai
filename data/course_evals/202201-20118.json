I really appreciated the focus on French culture as well, such as knowledge of seating arrangements and customs to better understand the language as a component culture.",

                "I think Prof Ngame is amazing. The amount of speaking and engagement we had live in-class was super helpful. I also really like the course packet. I highly recommend forgoing the FiA workbook that accompanies the textbook in favor of the course packet. The course packet had more targeted exercises that I actually learned from (especially since we went over them in class and talked through the corrections). I did not learn much from the workbook, it felt like busy work and too much of it. I would be okay with the workbook being supplementary to the course packet, but I really do feel like the course packet is where it's at. I also would appreciate being able to view my grades. It is a way for me to track my progress through the course and learning the language; I understand that the department doesn't want grades to serve as a discouragement to the learning process, but if that is the case, then grades shouldn't be a thing for the language requirement and it should strictly be Credit/D/F. Otherwise, we as students are measured by the college as a whole and future graduate/professional school programs by the grades we receive, they are the way we can track how we are doing within a course, and if they are going to be assigned to students, then students should be able to view them prior to the final/conclusion of the course, preferrable throughout. But that in no way reflects on any particular professor, just a general concern I want to share.",
                "Strengths: Prof Ngame... he's the best...! Weaknesses: I wish I spoke more in class to improve my speaking more, but I guess that's on me...",
                "Strengths: The course is well-organized, with a video or 2 videos every week presented on Monday/Tuesday. There is a bi-weekly test. The consistency of the course is a great strength -- the workload is heavy, but it is easy to plan your week because there is a consistent group of assignments (test/workbook pages) due every week. Also, the teaching in the department is very strong.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The French in Action videos in the course is a bit dated, and especially terms used for technology could be updated. Overall, the storyline is great though and keeps you really engaged in the story. Also, not being able to review old tests was a bit difficult for me when reviewing for the final.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the presentations we did in class about places in Paris. It was a fun way to practice our French. More presentation options in class (perhaps replacing few tests?) could really improve the course I think.",
                "The classes nicely transitions from the content in L1 to L2. It teaches you a lot of grammar and expressions to properly express yourself in French. Additionally, it exposes one further to the french culture in addition to the language. My class section was at 9.25am which got intense and stressful around the mid semester.",
                "Overall this course does what it sets out to do quite well. I think the course could be designed to have a slightly lower workload and still achieve the same objectives. French in Action workbooks are usually less helpful, and it may be better if more time was devoted to learning grammar.",
                "The strengths of this course are Professor Ngames teaching style and ability to incorporate student questions into the lessons and the variety of practice we got through the workbook, worksheets, presentations, and tests. The only weakness of this course would be the ability to view tests once they are graded since we couldnt always do that with the earlier online tests to review.",
                "Strength: well-organized\r\nWeakness: the French in Action textbook is outdated both in the picture of French society it depicts and some of the associated vocabulary. Would be good if we can switch to more up-to-date material",
                "I wish they could bring back the weekly tests instead of bi-weekly, and hopefully not on Mondays.\r\nIt's a shame how we cannot bring back the tests to actually view them and understand what we got wrong (and right), instead of briefly taking a look at them for one minute after class."

                "This is a tough question. \r\n\r\nI really did enjoy the class this semester, but it was such a drastic change from last semester and it was all dependent on the instructor. I can't help but think of how much further along I'd be in my French learning journey if I had Prof. Ngame last semester in addition to this one. \r\n\r\nLast semester was honestly such a traumatic experience for me. Prof. Angeli did not care at all about our success in the class. People have mixed reviews, but the students who struggled did not feel like they were welcome in the class; it is something I have discussed with others many times throughout this semester because we were so SHOCKED by the difference in quality and culture in Prof Ngame's class. Not all of us had the privilege of going to schools with rigorous language coursework, so language classes are really out of left field for us and we really had to fight to stay afloat. Nicola seemed apathetic to the different factors that could play into a students success or struggle in the class. To him, either you had it or you didn't and if you didn't get it, well, too bad. We honestly thought the brutality we got during the fall term was just the culture of the language department of a whole, and that we should switch to a different language.  When I went to office hours to go over my exams, when I asked him for tips to improve, Nicola made a point to tell me that that he \"was not an easy grader.\" I found that to be incredibly disrespectful to me and my work ethic; I would never ask for easier grading. I want to be challenged, because it makes learning all the more exciting, but I want to know I have support no matter how hard it gets. I did not have that last semester. To be honest, that class made me feel unwelcome, by the department and Yale as a whole. I thought I wasn't good enough to be here. I thought I didn't really deserve to be at the school. I already had imposter syndrome coming from the background that I had, but Angeli seemed to increase that exponentially. I dreaded going to class, I would actually almost have panic attacks each morning because I didn't want to see him. Eventually, I just stopped trying. I was strongly considering dropping French all together because he essentially told and made me feel like I was a lost cause and French wasn't for me. I won't sit here and tell you I did phenomenal this semester. But I felt SO MUCH BETTER emotionally in this class, and felt like I was encouraged to learn. I barely worried about my grade because I just knew I was improving, I could feel myself getting better and more confident, and that made me happy. I was playing a lot of catch up this semester from last, but if we're talking recommending the class if Ngame is teaching it: yes, 100% take it. \r\n\r\nIf there's a chance you get Nicola Angeli? Avoid it at all costs. He really should not be teaching. Like, ever. He should never get tenure at this or any institution that values their students' wellbeing. I would not knowingly let another student go through what I and my peers had to go to. A lot of emotional distress and tears were shed all because Angeli didn't care about those who were struggling.",
                "Yes -- if truly interested in the language. This is a really good introduction to French. I would not recommend this course to anyone if they're trying to get an easy language credit, though. I love the language and found learning French very rewarding, but the workload can be intense at times.",
                "Yes, I think this class nicely builds your confidence to speak and understand french.",
                "If they genuinely like French and if Prof Ngame teaches",
                "I would and have recommended French 110 and 120 to fellow Yale students who want to start French and also become confident in their speaking abilities. I think French In Action makes the content approachable and easy to review while still utilizing immersion.",
                "Yes if you want to learn to speak French. For reading you can probably get a grammar book and learn more relevant content more efficiently"
