I developed my writing and planning skills and improved my ability to write academic essays and research papers in this class.",
                "Taking this course I was able to more in depth analyze history and our place as people in analyzing history. It was interesting to read so many excerpts to better understand different perspectives on the \" other\" and archives.",
                "I developed numerous writing skills, specifically evidence based analysis and the proper way to write a claim.",
                "A brilliant deep dive into understanding the systematic and powerful nature of knowledge archival, from perspectives of inequality and opportunity alike. This class offered a great way to ingest information from a knowledgeable vantage, and how to portray information in a well-organized manner in writing and research.",

                "The strengths of this class are the class discussions and the checkpoints assigned by the professor which made the process of writing the research paper more streamlined and less daunting. A weakness of this class is that little time was spent teaching writing techniques. Instead, we had to rely on past knowledge when crafting our essays. I would recommend that more class time be dedicated to teaching aspects of writing that we can incorporate into our essays.",
                "greatest focus was on the historical/social context of the course with writing used as a tool to explore it, little emphasis on how to improve writing or essay techniques",
                "The course was very well organized with extremely interesting topics and talking points. One weakness was that sometimes the text we read were long and a little confusing but eventually I was able to understand what I was reading.",
                "One strength would be the dicussions that took place in class. I enjoyed reading and hearing everyones opinions about the topic.\r\nOne weakness would be the amount of time to receive feedback on my essays. I feel like I could not see what I did wrong on some essays and would make the same mistake on the next essay so I lost points without being corrected the first time.",
                "The assignments could have been better scheduled, or held to their original dates and told of further in advance more. We were often left to question the dates we were given as they were soon in the future from the assignment being given, as though we were told a week too late: this lead to the pushing of deadlines, which led to projects coming up against the end of the semester.",
                "the essay writing, readings, and discussions in class were not very well-connected. i found it difficult to stay engaged with the readings because they were dry and long, and the discussions during class were very hard to keep up with because it was essentially the same people talking. feedback on essays were also very slow, and it was hard to understand what was expected of me in this class."
