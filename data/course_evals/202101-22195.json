                "Strengths: the texts!  They're amazing, and they stimulate such fascinating discussions.  Professor Handler Spitz is also a great strength of the course.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think there is anything that can be done about this, but the reading load is uneven: some weeks you'll have 350 pages to read for Lit, and other weeks only 100.  This also means that some books get covered in a lot more detail than others.  \r\n\r\nI also think DS should rethink its final exams.  I get that timed essays are the classic exam format.  But it's a little jarring because DS teaches you one skill -- how to write a paper on a narrow topic over the course of a week -- and then tests you on a completely different one -- how to write timed essays covering lots of authors at once.  I don't think timed essay exams are really true to the spirit of DS, which asks you to think deeply about texts and let them sit with you.  Moreover, I don't think they are a good learning experience, especially for a remote semester.  I think that the pandemic was the an opportunity to rethink how DS students can synthesize their knowledge at the end of the semester.  Maybe DS can still change for a future year.",
                "The reading selection for Spring DS Lit is pretty interesting with works that are very important to the Western canon. This course was also probably more work than most of my other DS classes because of the weekly reading responses in addition to papers and discussions.",
                "The syllabus is a strength of this course. I enjoyed all the texts and found them to be interesting and worth reading. The reading load can be quite heavy at times, but the quality of the books and seminar conversations makes it rewarding to complete it all.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely the in-class discussion and the detailed feedback we received on our essays. The main weaknesses of the course related to the fact that it was taught online, so the Zoom format sometimes affected our communication and interaction."

I enjoy being able to watch the lecture at my leisure and stop/start it as necessary, although it isn't possible to ask questions. Obviously, Zoom seminars are inferior to in-person, but it works relatively well and I don't see how they could be improved.",
                "I thought that the recorded lectures worked pretty well, and Zoom made it very easy and convenient for one-on-one meetings with Prof. Handler-Spitz. However, I think that the Zoom format at times hindered the flow of the in-class discussions and made us feel a bit disconnected because we were all in our separate rooms."

I'd also recommend the course especially with Professor Handler Spitz, who was my favorite professor this semester.  She is so kind and cares about all her students.  She always emphasizes how literature is personal and emotional -- not just something to be picked apart -- and she gives amazing feedback.",
