                "Office hours were a savior. Psets were the killers. Exams were tough.",

                "This is purely simply an INCREDIBLE class. I never thought that I would learn so much of -- and understand so much of -- machine learning in one semester. The class strikes the perfect balance between theory, coding and applications. We never went too depth into the technicalities (so no hard math or complicated proofs), but still went deep enough to actually understand what is happening. The assignments, quizzes and exams might take up a lot of your time, but they come together beautifully to maximize the learning that you will do in the course. My only suggestion would be to reduce a little the number of evaluations for this class. There was not a single week that we did not have either an assignment due (the assignments take up quite a bit of time), a quiz or an exam.",
                "Strengths: The progression of topics we covered throughout the semester made sense, because each subsequent topic was building on some of the previous topics we had discussed. Problem sets helped us practice the concepts we had learned in lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: Details about the grading were not as clear as I had hoped. Also, the course was a little too fast-paced, with concepts not being explained enough in depth. This left many questions unanswered.",
                "Strengths:\r\n1. The materials are broad and cover a lot of methods.\r\n2. Professor Lafferty is very patient to explain every question regarding the material.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. Not suitable for students who don't have much mathematical background.\r\n2. Not suitable for students who haven't used python before.",
                "Professor Lafferty is a great teacher and the course is well-structured.  I think the course's greatest strength lies in the sheer volume of material it covers--you'll at least touch on most of the major ML models, and you'll become comfortable with many of the important concepts.  After taking this course, you should feel comfortable reading more advanced ML literature, or taking more advanced ML classes, on your own.   The course's greatest weakness, from my perspective, was the sloppy nature of many of the quiz and exam questions.  I don't believe I took a single exam in this course that didn't have at least one error\/ambiguity that completely changed the meaning of a question, and I know several students who lost points as a result of ambiguous\/faulty prompts.  Of course, this is still a relatively minor weakness in the grand scheme of things, which just goes to show how good this course is.",
                "I think this course was very strong. One weakness was that lectures were still up an an hour and 30 minutes long. Watching an online lecture is not the same as watching a recorded lecture. I wish professor lafferty broke up the lectures a little more, or did maybe inserted time for \"breaks\" in the middle of lecture.",
                "The lectures were generally clear and helped students understand topics with appropriate level of detail. It was accessible to a non-data science major.",
                "Change the professor.",
                "This course was very well-planned from the start, with a lot of attention being given to learning effectively despite the virtual circumstances. The integration of practice and theory at every point in the semester was very helpful in solidifying my understanding of the concepts covered.",
                "This course provided a great overview of a lot of the methods in ML. Sometimes it was a bit hard to find a balance between enough explanation for the way certain algorithms worked and confusion because of too much detail. Overall though it covered enough information for us to understand and then implement the methods.",
                "This was a really tough course, one of the toughest I've taken at Yale. I (and most of the other students I worked with on assignments and review sessions) barely absorbed any knowledge after the third week or so. The only students who seemed to understand what was going on were the students who already had experience in ML, in which case why call this an 'introductory' course. I get that ML is very dense, but I think the professor could do a lot better job at making the information accessible for students who may not have done an internship utilising ML, but still meet the course pre-req's. The coding assignments were pretty accessible (especially given that they were in Python). I know that it does get a lot more theoretical and harder than what we were exposed to in this course, but I do think that the course could be made more accessible (without just referring students to medium articles).",
                "We thought that the first assignment, was a little bit too much. It was actually the longest assignment throughout the semester.",
                "Strengths: Lafferty is a great lecturer, interesting problems on the psets, equal focus on theory and practice of ML\r\nWeaknesses: The testing cadence seemed like a bit much with 4 quizzes, two midterms, and a final on top of the psets. Feedback on psets also wasn't always the best",
                "At times I wish the course had been a little more thorough with the math, without being as workload-heavy as 365",
                "The strengths of this course include the well-written slides, example code, interesting assignments, and extremely helpful TA. I was able to ask questions at any time and receive quick and detailed replies, which greatly helped my understanding of the material and my completion of the assignments. However, the directions given on the assignments and exams were sometimes rather unclear, resulting in a lot of easy points being lost.",
                "Overall, I found the course to be well organized and well taught. I liked the format of the 24 hour take home exams, and I really appreciated the fact that the exams were open note as I feel like the format more closely reflected a real world situation. Professor Lafferty was clear and thorough in his teaching, and the problem sets were fair and covered material discussed in class. I wish that there had been more TAs or office hours to help specifically with debugging code.",
                "The TAs were incredibly helpful; the problem sets were interesting and relevant (although the problem sets were too hard at the beginning and rather easy by the end of the course); the course materials were pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nIf anything could be improved, perhaps the lecture slides could have used better graphics to communicate the concepts. I think some of the concepts were hard to grasp at first, but this was because the professor couldn't tell how well we understood them (due to the nature of online learning).",
                "This course was really strong. The one thing that could improve is more applied problem sets throughout the year. The first couple on Covid and Zillow were very interesting and applied and it would be great for more to be like that.",
                "I think the material was interesting. I think that the watering down of some of the concepts was actually a weakness. I think there needs to be more of the math involved in order to fully appreciate the topic. I know that 365 exists, but the course was a mess this semester and I really like professor Lafferty, so I took 355. Personally, I think that there should just be one class (combine 365 and 355), and meet in the middle.",
                "Strengths: Learned a ton - like a python and coding class combined. \r\nWeaknesses - Should focus more on teaching python, particularly in the beginning. The first couple of psets were very daunting because we had to learn the ML concept, apply it, and teach ourselves how to code. Another issue was that this was like a coding class in the beginning, but CS classes have soooo many more office hours and TAs than we did, so it was difficult for us to fix an error in our code when there were only couple of office hours and countless kids in the room with different questions. The one on one office hours helped a bit but those often filled up quickly. Wendy was a gem in answering our questions if we emailed her. She was amazing.",
                "This course is very demanding but also very rewarding. Professor Lafferty is a wonderful lecturer, and the TAs this semester (especially Wendy) were incredible. I believe that its emphasis on coding via problem sets and take-home midterms is a good, practical focus. I definitely learned a lot about coding in Python. \r\n\r\nHowever, the workload this semester was too demanding. The problem sets are difficult but reasonable. However, the take-home nature of the midterm exams, which included timed short answer and 24-hour coding questions, was difficult both in terms of their time demands and their content. I suggest that the professor rethink these midterms, because when combined with the constant problem sets, they were overwhelming.",
                "I think some group work could have been incorporated into the curriculum, since I just sat through most of the lectures without talking.",
                "Strengths: Super, super well organized. Lectures were straightforward and clear (and presented at an appropriate level for people without an extensive background in machine learning). The overall structure of the course was logical and it felt like topics built well on each other. Professor Lafferty is a gem, a kind soul, and a deep repository of knowledge about this topic; his enthusiasm for the material made the course that much better. This is a small thing, but I also really appreciated that the recorded lectures were trimmed to cut out extra time before\/after class. Also! The TAs! This of course varies year to year, but Wendy and Jerome were truly incredible, providing clear explanations, answering Piazza questions crazy fast, and hosting really valuable review sessions and office hours. They took the class from good to great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was mentioned in one of last year's reviews, but the difficulty of the psets felt like it varied wildly. This may just be because I hadn't had any exposure to Python prior to the course so the learning curve was necessarily steep, but the first one felt nearly impossible and the last few ended up testing our conceptual understanding more, so there was very little coding involved. I don't know if this format was just a function of the type of material we covered (e.g., for some of the later topics the code was pretty straightforward so it probably did make more sense for us to write out what each line was doing than to generate our own), but it would have been nice to have a little more support for learning Python at the beginning of the course. That said, I know that people come in with different coding backgrounds (I'd done stuff only in R before) and to some extent you do just have to dive in, so not sure there's an easy fix for this.",
                "Since the course was at 9 AM Eastern and everything was recorded, by Halloween I stopped attending live, and watched the lectures in large chunks at 2x speed before the exams. The starter code was vital for completing the problem sets.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, psets are challenging but really useful, and the stuff we learn is very practically relevant\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes exams and questions would focus on material we never really discussed in lecture",
                "Introduction topics like regression and stochastic gradient and descent are fundamental and feel vital when studying neural networks later in the course and are all taught well, but topic models and language models feel like they come up out of nowhere and unrelated to much else in the course, and were more difficult than they should have been.",
                "This course gives a fabulous overview of the dominant topics in machine learning, with statistical theory, coding, and examples of real-world applications. I loved how tangible the assignments were, as we got to manipulate real COVID, public transportation, weather, Shakespeare, and music data. I have recommended this course to many friends in the years below. My main objection to the class is that I think it is trying to cover too much ground as an Intro to ML course, especially as it focuses heavily on both the theory and the coding aspects. I think it should focus on one more than the other, and for students' general interests it should be coding. The theory was a little intense for students with rather low exposure.",
                "Strengths: the variety and breadth of topics, Professor Lafferty was also such a huge help and so willing to help with anything, he was very accommodating and receptive to student feedback and is a great lecturer and teacher! piazza and office hours were also very helpful and well set up and the psets were manageable even if you did not have extensive background in machine learning or coding in python",
                "A good course that does what it should. Help is there if you need it. It moves at a fast but not unmanageable pace.",
                "Strengths: Good, relevant, and engaging examples.  Great presentations and helpful walk through the code implementations.  \r\nWeakness: Sometimes it is hard to follow some of the heavier math lectures through powerpoint slides.",
                "Professor Lafferty delivers great, focused and easily understandable lectures even for a novice in machine learning like me. His psets were also great at reinforcing the ideas of the course, though they really are a considerable time sink. Make sure to have plenty of time set aside to finish assignments. I didn't like the format of the course too much when it came to testing. Apart from significant psets due every 10 days, there were also 2 midterm exams and a cumulative final. I think that if you're gonna have psets that are a majority of the grade and that involve significant coding, perhaps it would be better to only have 1 midterm and a final. Apart from this, I think the course was really well-organized and Professor Lafferty is very understanding."

They were utterly useless. I tried to go to a few of their office hours, and they had no idea what was going on in the class. They were of ZERO help with the assignments (and actually led me down the wrong path multiple times). You don't need the ULAs. You only need the TFs, Wendy and Jerome, who are absolute gems.",
                "I think the private office hours were crucial to my success, and should be kept in place as long as virtual learning continues.   I don't think anything could really be improved.",
                "Again, one weakness was that lectures were still up an an hour and 30 minutes long. Watching an online lecture is not the same as watching a recorded lecture. I wish professor lafferty broke up the lectures a little more, or did maybe inserted time for \"breaks\" in the middle of lecture.",
                "I thought that lectures were pretty well structured, and I appreciated the sample notebooks given to us that we went over during lecture together and could take notes on and run on our own.",
                "Par for the course",
                "I watched the recordings of lectures because of a timezone difference, and it worked out well I think. Lafferty encourages questions during lecture still, and the course overall seemed well adapted to pandemic times.",
                "This is a difficult course and COVID was not helping at all. Usually when I am struggling in a STEM course, I go to office hours, but the feeling of virtual office hours was completely different from in-person office hours, and I found them much less helpful. The benefit of office hours, in my opinion, is the opportunity to receive help from your classmates as well as the TA or ULA. You can be flexible and \"float around\" different groups of students to get the help you need. This feeling was completely lost in virtual office hours, since only one person can talk at a time.  \r\n\r\nRecorded lectures were actually pretty cool. I liked having the opportunity to fast forward or pause videos and watch them according to your needs. I wish I had been able to attend them live, but since I am in California, they would have been at 6 AM. I would have appreciated it if the class could have been at a more multiple timezone friendly time.",
                "The recorded lectures, detailed slides, and example code helped teach us the material during a time like this - given the nature of the material, it worked out wonderfully.",
                "I think that the online recorded lectures were a very good format for this class. It was really nice to be able to reference lectures before exams to re-watch and study. I think that having recorded lectures for programming classes is really helpful  even in non-pandemic times!",
                "The large number of office hours were extremely helpful; Piazza was another really helpful tool.",
                "This class was taught very well in a Covid semester.",
                "I think more in-class demos would have been helpful. In the second class, we had the covid data demo in breakout rooms and I think that would have been more useful. I think that you could focus more on applications. The first couple of homework assignments were a lot better because they were more challenging and useful. I think that you could also shorten the beginning of the course so that there can be more time spent on the more useful and challenging methods.",
                "I think the recorded lectures and extensive office hours provided by TAs, ULAs, and the professor were great. However, I wonder if more basic Python code could be provided in class, because the coding aspect of this course was overwhelming, especially for students with no Python experience. I also suggest that the professor minimize the coding burden of midterm exams",
                "I definitely support the lectures being recorded - it allowed me to take another course at the same time without sacrificing any flexibility. I thought that the professor and TA's were really adept at virtual teaching.",
                "The super active class Piazza was a huge boon! Professor Lafferty and the TAs were very responsive and helpful, making it a great forum to ask for clarification about lecture material, help on problem sets, etc. Notes being posted ahead of time and everything being recorded and nicely trimmed were also hugely helpful.",
                "I much prefer required synchronous with cameras on, and this course was neither.",
                "Quizzes were confusing.",
                "The lectures were great in a virtual setting, I would often have breakfast and coffee as I tuned in and took notes. Although that was a benefit of the mic-off & video-off model, I think it also made students more disconnected from others in the class, and made teaching difficult for the professor as well who lacked real-time feedback of students' understandings. In a virtual setting, I find there as also not enough support for assignments, especially for students learning Python for the first time. I'm sure that was different with in-person office hours, but it was more challenging to achieve over Zoom.",
                "There werent any particular practices that increased engagement",
                "Posting recorded lectures and python code to review was helpful. It was also very helpful when the professor shared his screen to walk through the Python code.",
                "I really loved the recorded lectures and the recorded review sessions. This tremendously helped my learning when time zones made it difficult to attend every class event."

                "Probably not if you've never coded in Python before (like me lol), but it's very doable if you put in the time and energy. This course will be a lot of work and demand a lot of your time, even if you know what's going on. Felt like 2.5 credits to me but for someone who's adept at coding and applications like these .... maybe 1.5 credit workload feel? \r\n\r\nThe things I learned were super insightful and Prof. Lafferty is super nice, understanding, and informative. I would recommend this over 365 for sure ... unlike you prefer heavy maths and derivations (then 365 is better for you).",

                "YES YES and YES. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. I never thought that I would learn so much of -- and understand so much of -- machine learning in one semester. The class strikes the perfect balance between theory, coding and applications. We never went too depth into the technicalities (so no hard math or complicated proofs), but still went deep enough to actually understand what is happening. The assignments, quizzes and exams might take up a lot of your time, but they come together beautifully to maximize the learning that you will do in the course. \r\n\r\nIf you want to know what machine learning really is, this is the class for you. And I think any Yalie should graduate knowing what machine learning is, because it is the future. The class is challenging, but so rewarding, and it will benefit you for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\nNote: I would only recommend this course if you have at least minimal background in coding and statistics.",

                "I would.  This is an excellent primer on ML: the material is interesting, the assignments (though sometimes long) are cool (you get to work with many interesting data sets), and the lectures are pretty good (though they could afford to spend less time on the easy topics and more time on the difficult ones).  A must-take for anyone interested in understanding core ML concepts without the math background\/inclination to take 365.",
                "I would recommend this class to any student with a solid math background who is interested in learning what machine learning looks like in the real world. Going into the class I had little to no idea of what machine learning was and now I feel like I know enough to explain it to others. I did need to dedicate more time to this class than I thought though.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course! Lafferty is a great lecturer, and it is clear he has a ton of knowledge on the subject. He always included lots of practical examples in lectures, and the psets were also interesting most of the time. People without much coding experience should be a bit wary though, because it seems easy to drown in the beginning without at least some knowledge of Python.",

Anyone with some Python and stats experience should take this course!",

                "Yes! This course was super interesting. I didn't know much Python to begin with, but you sort of are forced to learn it to complete the problem sets (with some help). Machine Learning is just a really useful topic to learn, so I would recommend it if you're even remotely interested in it. We covered a lot of material. The exams and psets were pretty fair as well.",
                "Yes, if they want to learn about ML I dont see a better class to take.",

                "Yes, overall it was a great course and I'm glad I stuck with it. The first couple of psets are very challenging and take a long time to complete just because it's hard to teach yourself all of the necessary code. I'm glad I stuck with it, though, because I learned so much valuable info and ML is a great topic to know. By the end of the class, the psets aren't as difficult, and the topics you learn about are unbelievably interesting - ie reconstructing pictures of past presidents' faces. Psets get more interesting too and code becomes less challenging. Midterms and final are very fair assessments.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student. But having a background in Python specifically and a good theoretical basis for statistics will be incredibly helpful!",

                "There are probably better ways to learn the basics of machine learning, but it counts toward the certificate.",
                "I would! It's a really interesting and relevant course, and the material is not too difficult even if you're not particularly well-versed in statistics. You'll come out of the class with a lot of practical knowledge about machine learning.",

                "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is looking to get a good foundation and background in machine learning and in python. Professor Lafferty does not go into extreme depth for some of the topics, so if you are looking for an extremely detailed introduction to machine learning you should probably take 365. The course I think was very well structured and carried out and manageable if you have some background in coding\/statistics. I would definitely recommend this course also because Professor Lafferty is a wonderful professor who knows what he's talking about and teaches well and is very kind and accommodating.",
                "I certainly would. With a little work, I think this course can be manageable for almost anyone at Yale.",

                "Yes, definitely. This course is an excellent intro to machine learning that is not too mathematically rigorous. If you want a rigorous treatment of Machine learning, consider the other ML course for S&DS majors. This course is very programming heavy, so be wary of that if you choose to sign up. Occasionally, there are unexpected problems with the setup for the programming psets so start early. Professor Lafferty is generally pretty understanding and answers questions really quickly so if you need help you'll be able to find it easily."
