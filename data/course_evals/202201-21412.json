                "The course was divided into 3 units: using tech, building tech, and troubleshooting tech. The readings\/assignments pertained to these units, and the readings taught me a lot about recent developments in these areas. We talked about a lot of well-known companies like Google and Amazon but also lesser-known entrepreneurs and their work. We also talked a lot about issues in the world of tech, such as implicit bias in automated hiring for jobs.",
                "I learned how to write better in different styles. We started with a personal essay tech review before using GPT-3 to write an essay. Another key skill that I developed through this course is the ability to write a \"pitch\" (outline) of what my essay is about and why I am writing it. This models how journalists pitch pieces to publications, and it is good practice to have a good roadmap of one's essay before writing the essay itself. \r\n\r\nNext, we looked at IPO letters. It was cool to see how readable these letters were. I had expected financial documents to be dry and dense, however, they were written in plain English and clearly laid out company goals.\r\n\r\nLastly, writing we wrote a cultural critique which forced me to carefully craft an argument about how technology intersects with contemporary culture. Although challenging at first, I was extremely proud of my final piece and learned a lot about weaving personal anecdotes and broader cultural arguments."

                "Strengths: Professor Gellman is highly engaged with the course, the readings are relevant and interesting, short readings mean students have more time to engage with the content rather than focusing on reading hundreds of pages, assignments are fun (especially GPT-3), guest speaker, Professor Gellman's journalistic experience is a huge plus\r\nWeaknesses: I felt the discussions were dictated by Professor Gellman and students wouldn't talk much to one another.",
                "Strengths: Well organized and planned--I could always refer to the syllabus and figure out when essays and reading were due. I also appreciated that the readings were short and targeted--we only read what we would discuss in class. I also enjoyed the three \"units\"--using, making, and troubleshooting technology."

                "Yes, the readings are both interesting and very manageable in terms of workload. You get a lot of opportunities to be creative and to write about topics you are interested in. The class is very accessible for all backgrounds. There were many CS majors this year.",
                "Absolutely. This is a fantastic class that covers a wide range of topics and writing modes. I especially liked the GPT-3 duet assignment.",
                "The readings assigned in this course are fascinating (and short, if that matters to you). Now, I feel encouraged to seek out such articles myself to continue learning. I recommend this course if you are interested in reading and having discussions about the world of technology. We also have some interesting assignments. One assignment involves writing a piece with GPT-3. In another assignment, we learn to write company founders' IPO letters. However, while I got writing practice, I don't think I learned a lot of writing skills in the course (as compared to introductory high school and Yale classes). If you want to polish your writing skills, one of Yale's introductory courses like ENGL 114 or 120 will be more suitable.",
                "Yes! Prof. Gellman is a very kind and helpful professor. She understands what it's like to be a Yale student (she's an alumn) and thus makes sure to assign reasonable amounts of work. The readings assigned for each class are extremely reasonable (two to three articles) and are interesting to read. Furthermore, there is a reasonable amount of time and length for each essay. Overall, an enjoyable course."
