The journal clubs and many breakout sessions made the class more engaging, and it was cool to read both new and notable scientific papers on air quality. Prof. Gentner always clearly explained concepts and was very helpful in answering any questions we had. This course could be improved if there was a bit more guidance on the homework, for example in the form of TF office hours."
