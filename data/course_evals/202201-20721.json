                "I learned Italian grammar, and practiced my oral and listening skills",

I learned more advanced grammar than in L1 and am now able to basically communicate in Italian and read/understand the language. I am surprised at how much I learned being that language is not my best natural skill. I also learned a bit about Italian culture.",

            "comments": [
                "I think that the course schedule could be more flexible. Otherwise, it was a very rigorous, well structured course.",
                "Strengths: active class discussions, clear explanations, every class was clear and everything was broken down appropriately, there were several opportunities to practice the skills we learned, received clear feedback and very shortly after exams.",
                "Such a good learning environment, class was always so much fun",
                "I think the course should have more reading comprehension involved.",
                "Strengths:\r\nSticks to syllabus, very clear outline of material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: limited group work or fun full class interaction / engagement",
                "The strengths are that this class is a very personal experience - you get to know the community of your language class and your professor very well. I thought it moved at a great pace and had a manageable workload. The weakness is that the tests were incredibly frequent at the beginning of the course and sometimes big assignments were close together/came out of the blue. I also wished we were able to use some English to explain some of the grammar rules in class.",
                "The one weakness was the lack of conversation and speaking practice. This increased as the semester went on, but we still didnt have that many opportunities to practice pronounciation and conversation. I feel like my writing, reading, and listening skills improved greatly but my speaking lagged behind a lot. It would be helpful to go around the room and each person read a sentence or a vocab word or whatever we were working on. Also submitting recordings of our voice for homework could give an opportunity to correct pronounciation and for us to practice speaking but still have an opportunity to prepare rather than bieng on the spot doing conversation practice with a partner who may or may not be engaged.\r\nOtherwise the course was great! I liked the taste of italian cinema and we covered a ton of material. There could have been a little more in class reinforcement of the vocab though."

                "Yes! Great progression in Italian learning sequence",
                "Yes, if you are looking for a language to take at Yale, Italian is an awesome option. I was really not looking forward to fulfilling my language requirement as I am not good at languages but I have had a really great experience with Italian. I have learned how to speak it much faster than I did with Spanish in high school and have had particularly positive experiences with the professors - who really care about the students. While I sometimes struggled with material/stressed about exams, the class itself was very fun and the grading was ultimately generous/reflected the effort students put into the course more than solely natural talent (a plus for me).",
                "I would absolutely recommend the Italian program to any students looking at it. I've enjoyed it a great deal, and have learned a lot. The program is also not terribly painful, and while there is often work for every day, it's rarely a struggle to complete, which is not the case in every language."
