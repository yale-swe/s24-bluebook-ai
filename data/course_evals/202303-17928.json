Don't get deterred by the end-of-class quizzes-- TOTALLY MANAGEABLE AND EASY if you pay attention to class.",

Some of the questions felt like we were trying to find a specific answer that the professor wants without her providing the sufficient background during lecture to make it reasonable. Also the regrading procedure for the exams felt overly harsh and punished the students for even attempting to get their exam regraded by deducting more points than the question was originally worth.",
                "strengths - slides and recorded lectures very helpful for review and following along, lectures engaging",
                "Strengths: interesting and engaging content. Weakness: lectures are fast paced with sometimes over 100 slides which makes it difficult to remember every single detail for the quiz at the end of each lecture.",
                "Professor Ahn is great and funny and the engaging lectures are really well taught.",
                "Strengths: No surprises on the exams; extremely organized.\r\nWeaknesses: The exams are heavily weighted; I did subpar on one exam and was unable to receive an A on the course just because of that one test; there are daily quizzes which can be good\/bad depending the student; the course is very much a memorization course (if you can memorize every detail of every study then you will do well; if not, it will be hard to receive a good grade)",
                "Strengths - quizzes every lecture and no day to day homework was an engaging way to retain information and stay focused.\r\nWeaknesses - Professor Ahn is not a supportive professor.",
                "Strengths: Engaging lectures. Weaknesses: NONE",
                "Strengths: low workload, very well-designed and intentional assignments (no homework, short quizzes after lectures to incentivize you to actively listen, review and discussion questions and sessions as the only prep you need for the exams), non-judgmental and supportive Professor and TAs. Weaknesses: none come to mind. There weren't a lot of office hours available, but you could always schedule a meeting with Professor Ahn.",
                "The course is very interesting and teaches you a lot about psychology related to how people think. The only downside is that there are daily quizzes after each lecture, though they ensure that you pay attention during the lecture.",
                "Professor Ahn is a gem!!! So funny, engaging, organized, and clear. Her lecture slides contained such a great mix of psychological phenomena and studies, relatable examples, and fun thought experiments\/games to really make concepts stick in our minds. I always looked forward to coming to class because of her incredible teaching ability. I also thought the daily quiz format worked well for the class, and I appreciated having 3 exams rather than a midterm and a final. However, sometimes I wish Professor Ahn cut off students that continued to interrupt her\/argue with her during class - people often seemed really combative (?) and it sometimes disrupted the flow of class, which made me sad!",

                "no homework, but there are quizzes every class and mandatory attendance.",
                "Strengths: the set up of this course is my favorite of the classes I have taken at Yale so far. It is organized so that you learn the material extremely well IN lecture, not through homework. I left every lecture feeling like I had learned so much. Its perhaps the only class where I feel this way after every single class. I truly think more yale classes should be organized this way (quiz at the end of the class, a discussion session every three classes, and an exam every 5-6 classes).",

All the lectures were very interesting, not only she explained the concepts clearly, she often provided engaging real-life applications of them. I couldn't think of any weakness of this course.",

                "I would recommend it to someone else because the content was very interesting and enjoyable to learn. However, I would warn the student that although there is a lower workload compared to many other classes, there is a quiz at the end of every lecture. Additionally, the strict grading of free responses on exams in addition to tricky multiple-choice questions make this class not an \"easy A\" despite the relatively low workload. Despite the difficult grading, it was still an interesting and worthwhile course that I enjoyed.",
                "Absolutely. Take this if you have any kind of interest in psychology, it is not overwhelmingly difficult and the content is really interesting.",
                "YESS!! If you're at all interested in psychology or just curious, this is the class you should take! I changed my major to psych after taking this class.",
                "Yes, as long as the student understands that the course is mainly based on recalling study details.",
                "No - the content was simplified significantly and felt like a freshman high school course. Feedback from the professor was lackluster and often discouraging students to ask for help, for instance saying students' tests grades could be further penalized for asking about grading.",
                "Yes, even as someone who doesn't plan to major in psychology it was really great",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it. It's not a necessarily easy to get an A in this course, but the workload is low, the material is extremely interesting and practical, and the community is very engaged and supportive. I don't regret taking the course at all.",
                "Yes, it is a very interesting course that is fun and useful.",
                "Yes! Low workload but high returns. I literally think about so many of the concepts and fallacies discussed in class whenever I'm making decisions in my day to day life now, and the ideas we discussed in lecture were really interesting to bring up in conversation during the semester (whether I was bringing up a fun fact or counseling my roommate through a breakup). 100% recommend!",
                "Things to know:\r\n1. It's a basic introduction to behavioral psychology. Ahn knows the content well.\r\n2. There is a (pretty easy) quiz at the end of each class, so attendance is mandatory. \r\n3. Grading can be a little frustrating. They'll sometimes release exam grades that aren't complete and are much lower than what you'll actually end up getting. And the re-grading policy is strangely harsh for a class with short-answer questions (if they still think your answer is wrong, they may give you negative points for that question). \r\n4. Workload is very low.",
                "I would recommend it because it is a fun and interesting class, however the exams were graded too harsh and you might not end up with the best grade.",
                "I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND, solely because of Professor Ahn. She is extremely strict, and has many poor policies (you should read the course policies before taking the course!). Honestly, you might be better off just reading \"thinking, fast and slow\" as it basically covers the key concepts of the class.",
                "This course is quite interesting, has practically no work, AND is super easy.  I absolutely recommend this course for a social science gut.",
                "YES! This will be my most recommended class. You learn so much in such a well-organized manner.",
                "Yesthe lectures are fascinating, useful, and applicable even for a non-psychology major, and involve real-world applications and exciting in-class demonstrations. I will warn that the lack of reading does not mean a lack of homework; the nightly assignments are essentially the review and discussion questions. In order to do well on the exams, you must become very familiar with the material.",
                "Yes. If you have never taken psychology course before, this course does an excellent job in introducing one to the field of psychology.",
                "Yes, it was a very fun course that taught useful topics in a way that means that if you pay attention you can do well.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Its a low course load but so informative and helpful to apply to everyday life regardless of major.",
                "Yes but only if you are going to credit d fail it or if you are ready to devote lots of time to it, its not really a gut. You will also be randomly called on on review and discussion days so be prepared for that."
