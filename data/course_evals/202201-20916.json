                "Difficult but interesting",
                "This course is very dense, full of technical insights that need time to digest.",
                "There is a situation that happened frequently in the course. Some topic would be taught in class. I might understand some of it, but not all of it, or I might forget some of it afterward. (I probably could have done a better job of asking questions, but I also think expecting to learn everything in one pass does not work well, especially for me). Then I'd have to make use of it on an assignment or project.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that I don't remember it perfectly, so I need to look at the teaching material again. However, the main teaching material available was the slides, and the slides themselves are not great as a reference material (though they were frequently adequate, it often required some guesswork).\r\n\r\nThe course does have solutions to this: listening to the recorded lectures, going to office hours or contacting the professor or TA. Furthermore, I can always look things up online. However, these solutions aren't always satisfactory:\r\n\r\n- The recorded lectures are probably the best solution; I didn't actually think about it until the very last homework, and I think it might have been helpful. However, there is still the possibility that I then discover the question I have wasn't addressed in lecture (especially if I didn't think to address it at the time, such as edge cases the homework makes you think about). In addition, I'm not sure I'd want to rely on it given technical issues like not always being able to follow along with slides, or if some crucial portion of class was accidentally not recorded.\r\n\r\n- Office hours and emails work, but emails can require waiting up to a day for a response and office hours can take most of a week if you have a question at the wrong time of week. If you run into a lot of questions, managing the turnaround time is problematic. In addition, there is the possibility OH might be busy and you have limited time to discuss.\r\n\r\n- Looking things up online might work, but it can be much more work. For instance, most explanations of Simplex I could find use some sort of tableaux for the presentation, and I would have had to invest in figuring out their system of explanation, when I'm not even sure the resource will answer my question in the first place.\r\n\r\nHere's where I'm going with this: At several points in the course I wish I had a textbook. Available at any time (unlike office hours and emails), likely to be relevant and similar to the lecture (unlike online research), intended to be a complete resource without someone on hand to answer questions (unlike slides), not at the mercy of technical errors (unlike recordings).\r\n\r\nThat being said, there are good reasons *not* to have a textbook. It might cost a lot of money. There probably not a lot of textbooks, maybe not even good ones, for this field. In particular, it could prevent you from choosing the mix of topics you think is best if they are not in the textbook, unless you want to assign multiple textbooks (more money) or have large portions of the class be not out of the textbook (goes back to the previous issues). In addition, the resources above *do* end up covering most of the situations I might have, albeit imperfectly. Especially video recordings; I wish I'd tried that earlier.\r\n\r\nOne potential solution might be explicitly distributing papers relevant to lecture. On the other hand, the paper might explain things in a method either different or more complicated than in class, or limit the ways you can present the material if you want to stay close to the paper's method.\r\n\r\nMore specific things:\r\n- could you have the official office hour schedule posted somewhere relatively easy to find instead of having me parse the announcements or guess the meaning of Zoom rooms?\r\n- Assignments are due on Tuesday. TA & prof office hours are clustered around Tuesday. If I want to go to office hours, I have to do that almost a week in advance of the deadline or not get my question answered until the last minute.",
