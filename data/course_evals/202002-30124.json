   "comments": [
    "This course gave me the vocabulary necessary to discuss social movements and civil unrest, analyzing the experiences I've noticed my whole life but couldn't articulate.",
    "I learned a ton about how social movements organize, operate, and build solidarity. It was very much a study of the logistics and actual structures of social movements, which was great.",
    "I read a number of good books that served as case studies for particular social movements, as well as some overarching sociological theory. I learned many historical details and timelines of major U.S. social movements.",
    "The course definitely added much more detail and insights onto my original understanding of the various protest movements during the five week's different case studies. Also, from the presentation, during interviews with authorities, I was more closely informed about different people's point of view about the topic, which is also helpful. The readings as well as films and short clips are selected elaborately, and I also learned a lot from those.",
    "Broad background on a range of social movements, general knowledge of different aspects of social movements generally",
    "This question is extremely broad, but Ill try to be concise. In this course, I was able to analyze how people act collectively to challenge the status quo of powerful political, social, economic, and cultural systems that resist change. To tackle such a comprehensive topic, the class analyzed case studies on a case by case basis. Through doing so, we were able to understanding the inner workings of movements, dilemmas movements face, etc.",
    "Thanks to this class, my writing skills definitely improved. And throughout this class, my reading speed is getting faster as well. More importantly, this class change how I view sociology which makes me decide to apply for Yale this upcoming fall.",
    "I developed greater writing skills and a better understanding of social movement mechanisms from this class.",
    "Knowledge of the terminology used to describe social movements. I also learned how to concisely write analyses of such movements in conversation with texts written by sociologists.",
    "I learned a framework for how social movements operate and the key elements in social movements. Very useful material.",
    "I have learned about concepts and specific examples of social movements, and how to analyze them using the concepts.",
    "a general overview of social movement studies"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is quick... I think it would have been more useful to focus on one movement or a theory using different movements as examples.",
    "Strengths: Lots of interesting material and tangible tools to use for analysis \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 5 case studies in 5 weeks was too fast, I think 2-3 would have been better",
    "Strengths: awesome selection of movies, really cool and interesting guest speakers, instructors were open to detours from planned schedule for important conversations, good setup of assignments, manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: in some cases, almost unbelievably surface-level skimming of material in lectures, lecture-heavy despite alleged focus on discussion, not particularly deep dive into anything, focus was often odd to me (40 min traumatic details of Black people's deaths at the hands of police, 20 min EVERYTHING else we talked about re: BLM), and the class would have benefited significantly from emphasizing scholarship by people of color and explicitly confronting the racist past and present of sociology, and what it means positionality-wise to be academics studying social movements at a moment of uprisings against injustice and state violence. sometimes presentations about Black people or LGBTQ people felt almost voyeuristic and not how I wish instructors talked about people who are actually sitting in their class and listening to them.",
    "The strengths of the course include its elaborately selected readings and films; its structure as it contains live lectures, group activities, and guest speakers; the contents, as well as the assignments. I find the assignments really helpful for reviewing the contents of the week and recapitulate the weekly book. The weekly presentations by the students are also a great highlight of the course because students could also bring whole new things about the topic and their personal interpretation or engagement with the issue. I could not find any weaknesses for the course, but in terms of improvements, I think we could also incorporate debates in the course during group activity times, so that it's helpful for us to learn different insights from others.",
    "Strengths: great readings and case studies, well-facilitated discussions, awesome guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: professor & TA didn't always approach material in the most respectful & thoughtful way, papers were pretty nitpicky and prompts didn't leave much room to be creative",
    "Strengths:\r\nThe structure of the course was to say the least impeccable. The format - lectures, break out rooms, supplemental materials - was conducive to the learning and comprehension of the course work. Overall, I found the course to be particularly interesting, as it is applicable to the status quo. \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nBeing online, it was at times hard to stay engaged with the class. However, this is something that can only be improved with the return of in person instruction.",
    "Since it'  summer course so that at some intro part it may not be as detailed as it supposed to be. I just wish this course can be a little bit longer than just a month, so that more materials can be included. But other than this, there's no other weakness of this class. I enjoyed it a lot!",
    "Strengths: the assignments reinforced learning, the guest speakers were great, the small group meetings fostered deeper conversations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class felt a little rushed (as I'm sure is the case with all summer classes)",
    "The course organization with a book per week was quite convenient for learning about a sociological approach to case studies. I think the course design would benefit greatly from an emphasis on intersectionality as well",
    "I think it would be great if the course were more solutions oriented; the discussions were very interesting and the students and instructors had valuable insights.",
    "This course offers a lot of information and give us opportunities to hear lectures from activists, which I really appreciate. The assignments also give us a lot of space to improvise ad develop our thoughts.",
    "strengths were a strong mastery of material by the instructors and good format for engagement. major weakness is that students obviously wanted to question a lot of the core assumptions of the course (why we focused only on America, why we studied some movements through the scope of identity and not others, and other general assumptions that have been central to sociology as a discipline) and it seemed like there wasn't a lot of flexibility to change the course material or how it was being taught and considered in light of those questions. The model of learning about a few American case studies with a relative lack of context just wasn't providing the kind of nuance these stories demand---suspect this might be more of a problem with the general methodology of sociology as a discipline rather than a course specific issue, but I think things could have been done to alleviate these problems (being more willing to interrogate the textbook and its assumptions, providing a wider global context, narrowing in on particular illustrative microstories rather than giving somewhat brief and unsatisfying summaries of massive movements)."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is new to the field of social movements and sociology. It provided a great framework and basis for learning about social movements and the ways they have evolved over time.",
    "I would recommend this course on the basis of its workload and perhaps for high school students and others who are not in the least familiar with social movements in a U.S. context. For people who have a background in social movements or have participated in them (including high schoolers who are on the front lines of many movements!), this class is probably too introductory and surface-level.",
    "Yes. I will highly recommend this course to other people even if they are not into sociology, because this course is very interesting with its readings and films, and the five topics taught in five weeks are the most significant ones in the course of US history, which I think are necessary to delve into and are helpful for anyone who's living in the country.",
    "Mostly yes, especially if the teaching staff reflects more about how they approach the material before teaching it again. The course gives a good background on a range of social movements and theoretical aspects of social movements, although it is pretty western-centric.",
    "Yes! It was a great experience, and I was able to explore the intricacies of social movements.",
    "I'll definity recommed thsi course to my peers! Because this class not only shows me how fantastic sociology is but also provide me an excellent opportunity to have a brief acknowledgment of class at Yale.",
    "Yes, I learned a great deal about social movements and how they become successful.",
    "If you would like a survey of social movements, Id recommend you take it but you should supplement with other courses to gain more insight into social movements",
    "Yes; great material for anyone working on social movements or interested in the field.",
    "Yes. I was able to engage fully without much background knowledge. The discussions were also relax and the peers were nice and open to any comments.",
    "Probably not, for reasons mentioned above."
