When I look back at how much we covered, I realize that the course completely changed the way I think about math. It was incredibly rewarding.",

Once you have the right intuition, which the professor is excellent in conveying, you can essentially build up the whole theory yourself.",

Is relatively lenient with homework extensions, and gives a solid (not too much, not too little) amount of homework.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Homework grading turnaround time is a little iffy - I often had to wait 3 weeks to get the grades for my psets back.",
