                "I learned a lot about the various methods and techniques of production, especially for faience, which I had heard about before but didn't understand very well previously. It could be improved by spending less time on copper smelting and more on stone techniques. I think it would also be helpful to have the readings available earlier to give more time to read them. More hands on experience with the materials would also be beneficial.",
                "There were just too many materials covered, and too much information on all of them, but this was the consensus when Professor Marouard asked everyone for feedback, so I'm sure the class will be more streamlined in future sessions. It's really cool that the class even exists, as the details of economic production and the lives of everyday people can often be relatively neglected in Egyptology relative to the language and monumental architecture.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the class was a trip to the Wurtele Center to look at and handle Egyptian artifacts. It would be improved by handling more of the materials in person rather than just reading about them.\r\n\r\nI think it would have been good to have some class time spent on what you are actually supposed to do when presenting your poster at a session, i.e. how much to talk versus let them read the poster.",
                "Great informative material and powerpoints and room for student article presentations at the beginning. Could have used to spend a little less time on some individual topics to keep the course moving."
