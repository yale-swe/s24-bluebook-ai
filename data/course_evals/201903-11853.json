    "I learned how to communicate efficiently and at a very high level in Spanish about legal and political issues.",
    "I developed a better ability to talk about world news in spanish along with law-related terms. I learned a lot of vocabulary relevant to discussing law in spanish.",
    "I became a better writer in Spanish and also developed my comprehension skills over the course of the semester.",
    "I learned about some concepts in the legal system and some legal spanish vocabulary",
    "I learned a lot about synthesizing information and the legal systems in many spanish speaking countries.",
    "I would say Ive probably learned and developed nothing from this course, and would venture that even my Spanish is poorer than when I started.",
    "I learned about many aspects of the Spanish judicial system!",
    "Comprehensive understanding of how legal systems are set up and how they look in the modern day.",
    "An understanding of the Spanish legal system and vocabulary for discussing law codes in Spanish",
    "I learned about Spanish legal systems and about international law.",
    "This course was singlehandedly the most informative law course I have taken at Yale. Widespread applications while referring to direct literature were great tools to understand the material. I gained insights into the world of jurisdiction and international legal organizations."

   "comments": [
    "The class was well organized and the selection of students all represented very high levels of proficiency and advanced knowledge in the language.",
    "Strength: We had weekly writing which helped to improve my spanish writing & we got a lot of feedback on them. \r\nWeaknesses: Early morning classes meant a relatively low engagement.",
    "Strengths: I found the content of this course to be very interesting. There were also a lot of great class discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the homework assignments were a little unclear.",
    "It was a good introductory course, but I think it would be nice if we had more debates or studied more actual cases rather than talking in hypotheticals (and learned about the concepts through real cases)",
    "The class discussions are very lively and I really enjoyed the presentations. There is a lot of short writing in this class thats interesting and fun to do. I wish we did more group work to get to know people better and thus make people more comfortable speaking in class.",
    "The professor and class are amazing! Worst part of the class is the time it is offered (9 am).",
    "Strengths: Mercedes is a great teacher. Assigned work is consistent and fair. Course material is interesting, broad in scope sometimes (which is a good thing) and narrow other times when dealing with the nuances of Spanish Law.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None",
    "No weaknesses.",
    "The writing assignments were a good opportunity to practice. Class could be dry at times",
    "Overall, the course was rather easy, but the writing requirements were long, did not connect to one another, and usually monotonous without any real purpose. Additionally, the midterm project and final paper were disconnected from the course and there was no overall structure for the class.",
    "This course was wonderful. The setup facilitated learning in an agreeable way, and usage of outside aids was very helpful. I would only ask, if possible, for the course not to be scheduled so early in the day. Otherwise, the course was lovely."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Wonderful course, interesting material, amazing professor.",
    "Yes, especially if youre a native spanish speaker because it helped me practice spanish & kearn relevant vocabulary.",
    "If you are looking for an interesting L5 Spanish class that is not too stressful, this is the class to take.",
    "Yes.  It is very low effort, and relatively engaging.",
    "I would only recommend it to them if they were looking for a relatively light class and more basic material.",
    "Generally yes. It is a relatively low-workload L5 Spanish if you're looking to knock off your requirement but I wouldn't describe it as a gut. Work includes significant weekly homework that was graded fairly and relatively but not extremely leniently. Also a ten page (!) final research paper. You can put in a widely varying range of effort and still succeed, but you have to do work and an A is not guaranteed. Mercedes is wonderful and clearly cares tremendously about her students.",
    "Yes! This is an excellent L5 class because youre engaging with the language in so many ways and learning cool topics just in Spanish. I really enjoyed it.",
    "If you want an easy language credit, then maybe take it. But if you want to learn literally anything this semester, I would urge you to reconsider.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to people who need an L5 language.",
    "The Best L5 Spanish class you can take!",
    "Highly",
    "Yes, the articles we read were really interesting",
    "It was okay for completing the L5 language requirement because it required very little reading, but I would not recommend this course if you are interested in some of these topics because you will likely not learn too much."
