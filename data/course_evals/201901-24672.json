    "As someone who did not know much about Nigeria, this was a great course that gives valuable insights into the country, its customs, and people.",

    "Overall just learned so many cool things about Nigeria",
    "I learned a lot about Nigeria before colonization",
    "I learned much about Nigeria and my own cultures history.",
    "I was hoping to understand Nigerian history and culture more.",
    "I gained writing skills and critical analysis skills in this course. It helped me have a more definitive understanding of Nigeria.",
    "I learned so much more about my own Nigerian heritage. This course really filled in the gaps, having grown up in the US instead of Nigeria. I learned so much about how my family functions and why.",
    "Learned more about Nigerian culture not only domestically and internationally."

   "comments": [
    "The course was taught well.",
    "strengths: small class size meant that we were all very engaged in the discussions and we had a chance to get any questions answered quickly.\r\nweaknesses: there was A LOT of required writing which didn't make sense since the class is not a writing credit.",
    "The course was very engaging but sometimes the readings were too long and repetitive.",
    "A lot of writing but engaging material. Emphasis on getting questions answered for students which was great.",
    "It was a good introductory course in the sense that I learned a lot about different aspects of Nigeria. The class was interesting and engaging and had a good atmosphere. I feel as if the class was a little bit writing heavy and could have been balanced out in different ways. I felt as if I spent too much time writing summary and was not able to deeply engage with some of the material.",
    "Either make it a WR credit (I wouldnt really mind an extra section?...) or cut down on the writing! Just one essay is fine, midterm. But thats it.",
    "Good overview of Nigerian cultures but there are generalizations made within that and the class discussions could be more guided\/productive.",
    "The course was strong in that the timing of reading responses meant that all students came to class ready to engage in seminars. I believe that the weaknesses of the class lay in an occasional lack of clarity about certain assignments."

    "Yes, I would. If you want to learn more about Nigeria in a great class setting this is the perfect course to take. The professor is great.",
    "I would. It is a great course to learn about Nigeria.",
    "I would definitely recommend. It's a lot of writing but its not difficult at all and the topics are very interesting.",
    "Yes! It is a great class, you learn a lot and it is super fun.",
    "Yes, its a very interesting class with good readings.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. The cultural aspects of the Nigerian diaspora are unique and are beneficial to learn about.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have a connection to or are really passionate about Nigeria. A lot of the class was based on previous assumptions about Nigeria and relating to personal experience. This format is beneficial for those who come from Nigerian families or have ties to similar lifestyles.",
    "Yes. Even non-Nigerians. It gives a lot of perspective about Africa through the lens of Nigeria, a continent people need to learn more about.",
    "I think for Nigerian students, the class was an interesting forum to engage intellectually with one's identity and roots."
