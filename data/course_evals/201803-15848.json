    "It is a lot of just writing and talking, maybe some more engaging activities. Overall great course, though!",
    "The readings were all very interesting and the topic was engaging, but the discussions were painful since it seemed that no one did the readings so there was no meaningful discussion about them. Having students lead the discussions was okay to a point, but it made it difficult to have meaningful discussions since many times the students were just reading from their notes instead of trying to facilitate discussion. Maybe having classes be split so that students lead the discussion for half the class and then the professor leads for the remainder would be a better balance.",
    "Strengths: So much fun, very interesting topics, great and understanding teacher\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Way too early in the morning",
    "The class was very writing intensive and was structured in a way that promoted good writing habits",
    "Strength: structured class, no surprises. Improved writing skills as a result of this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Content can get boring at times. Discussions can be lacking interesting topics.",
    "The flexibility in the way in which the course was taught allowed students to explore different concepts that may not have been explored before, however sometimes resulted in the unaccountability of students completing reading assignments."
