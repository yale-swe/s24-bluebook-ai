   "comments": [
    "I learned about how the US and Mexico have shared interests and how they have different leverages to use against each other. It's an interesting class that also covered the history of Mexico and how it affects the country today.",
    "I now understand Mexican history better than I ever have. I also better understand the domestic and international factors that shape the relationship between U.S. and Mexico, as well as the issues that require the two countries to work together.",
    "It was nice to study academically this international relationship since its a real issue at home that we feel repercussions from immediately",
    "I learned a great deal about Mexican history, and that was extremely important to this course. It is necessary to be able to understand Mexico's history in order to understand Mexico's interactions with the US. I also learned a lot about the Central American violence and migration crisis. I never really thought about before how this related to US-Mexico relations.",
    "I learned all about this current, former, and future of Mexico. At the end of the course, I can now consider myself somewhat of an expert on Mexico.",
    "I think about U.S.-Mexico relations in an entirely new way. I appreciated that we both learned about current events and broader academic theories. I learned how to apply political science to real world situations. I also gained a lot of insights into how the Mexican government works. I have found myself thinking a lot about what we learned in class since, and I know that the knowledge I learned will be helpful in the future.",
    "I learned a lot about the history and evolution of U.S.-Mexico Relations, the true impact of NAFTA on both economies, and the role that Central American countries play in issues pertaining to migration and security.",
    "The course focused on the relationship between the United States and Mexico, specifically considering the political and economic aspects connecting the two nations. The course spent a good amount of time discussing the historical and present parts of their relationship, from colonization to today.  I gained from especially having a strong background, by the time we arrived at present day issues between the countries, in their historical relationship from which to draw an understanding.",
    "I learned about the unique relationship that the U.S. and Mexico shares, opening my eyes to their unequal partnership.  I gained a great amount of knowledge of Mexico's history and how the formation of the country affects its status in contemporary times.",
    "This course covers the relationship between the United States and Mexico from shortly before the conception of the PRI to the recent election of AMLO in 2018. It covers political, social, and economic aspects of the bilateral relationship, with a political economy bent to the issues discussed.",
    "I learned so much from this class, especially about Mexican history and government , which I had never previously learned before. It was a really insightful and well organized class for learning and definitely my favorite this semester.",
    "You can gain a very comprehensive of Mexican history in this course, that covers almost everything you need to know to understand current Mexican politics. As a student who was very familiar with this history, I still got a lot out of the course. Specifically, I gained a lot of knowledge on the economic policies of Mexico and how those have hampered progress within it, as well as how the United States has intervened in Mexico's policies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: Sometimes the course touches on sensitive topics such as immigration and we did not actually have a discussion because people were guarded and wanted to be politically correct. Class seems like a regurgitation of the information we already read and doesn't expand enough into thought-provoking ideas. \r\n\r\nStrengths: It's a well-organized course in terms of topics for each week and I enjoyed the content we learned about.",
    "Strength: the class was thorough and well-structured. Memos were annoying but ultimately good, as they helped cement relevant concepts each week. \r\n\r\nWeakness: our discussions at times felt pointless, with no real direction. Sellars did a good job of keeping discussion moving in general, however.",
    "strength: in depth and historical narrative of how Central America became what it is today, relevant to today\r\n\r\nweakness: Large class where sentiments towards issues were generally agreed upon discouraged intellectual diversity",
    "I found Professor Sellars reading selections to be very insightful and helped to guide discussion. I also really appreciated doing reading response memos each week, as it kept me accountable for reading the material. The memos weren't difficult or stressful, but they helped me to structure my thoughts in class. One weakness is that in-class discussions would sometimes get off-track, but that isn't really unique to Professor Sellars' seminar, and she did a good job of redirecting discussion back on topic.",
    "the course was awesome - It was so interesting to go into class everyday and learn about a country I had never learned about before. I would have liked to talk more about current events, but laying the groundwork for the class by way of learning about the history of Mexico was very important for future context and discussion.",
    "This course is really interesting. The readings are good, the class is structured well, and Professor Sellars is a fantastic discussion leader. She knows when to speak up and stand down. I also really appreciated the reading response format of the class.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is that I didn't think the midterm benefited me in any way  I wasn't clear as to the goal. I think there may have been other ways to conclude our section on Mexican history.",
    "This course was very well thought out and encouraged student participation in its discussions. I am glad it had both a historical and present day focus, which prevented people inserting their own perspective without any basis in fact about why the US or Mexico would take certain actions today. I think the structure of the course allowed for a wholistic understanding of these two countries, but also the relationship between any two countries.",
    "This course was very interesting in how we focused on different aspects every week, keeping it interesting and engaging. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "I dont know that anything could be improved, Emily was a great seminar leader and organized the class well."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I learned a lot about Mexico history and how it affects Mexico and Mexican-US issues. At the time of this course, there was a lot of news relevant to the course so it was a nice way to dissect current events. However, the topics we discussed in class such as immigration can be a sensitive spot for many so people can be defensive or trying to be politically correct all the time. It depends on who you're taking it with I suppose.",
    "Yes, the class does what it's supposed to do, and I am confident that Sellars will be receptive to feedback and will make positive changes to the course.",
    "yes, extremely pertinent to events of right now",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as the topics discussed in this seminar as extremely timely. Yale also has a shortage of courses on Latin American politics, and I was glad that I was able to take this course as my first introduction into Latin American politics. Professor Sellars is a great instructor, and she is kind. Definitely a must take course for political science and global studies majors.",
    "Yes! if you do not know about Mexico and want to learn more, take it! Professor Sellars is a great teacher and loves having engaging discussions about class material. Workload is not too bad either. Open note midterm, reading responses each week (1 paragraph), and a final paper. So great!",
    "Good introductory seminar on the subject. Interesting and Professor Sellars is fantastic, constructive, and very knowledgeable. Probably depends on the type of people in your seminar (it's PLSC so there's always some randomness). Right now, it has one too many assignments, so I think something should be cut. Reading responses are low stakes and you can skip a few. There's also a midterm (easy but still a burden), presentation + policy memo (group project so you know how those go) and a final presentation. If the midterm is cut, this class would be an instant 5.",
    "Yes, highly! I think the material is crucial for anyone that is interested in politics or policy.",
    "If you have any interest in understanding the relationship between Mexico and the United States, or even understanding geopolitical connections, I would recommend this course. It is well developed and well taught and facilitates a strong foundation in the material.",
    "Absolutely.  Very interesting and very relevant information in today's political environment.",
    "Yes 100%! This was by far my favorite class I have taken at Yale. Maybe it was the topic itself, as it is one very close to my heart and my interests, but the class itself was the best organized and most engaging seminar I have taken. I love Emily she is an amazing and caring professor and hope to take more classes with her. The people in the class made for a great and thoughtful discussion.",
    "Yes, this a great course to be introduced to Mexican politics. Professor Sellars is incredible and is more than willing to help you get the most out of the course. Even if you know Mexican politics well, you can gain a lot from the great selection of readings or even others' perspectives from the seminar discussion."
