I developed my reading ability by learning and utilizing new vocabulary both in speaking and writing. The homework given helped me further develop this aspect of my ability since we were given passages to read from the textbook. New Kanji are introduced and practiced everyday, helping me learn the stroke order for certain Kanji. We also learned several Kanji which helped make the reading of certain texts easier. In terms of writing, I developed my writing skills due to the daily homework we had. Through these homework assignments I was able to practice the new sentence structures and vocabulary we had learned during and outside of class. Moreover, I was able to write about things related to Japanese culture and my everyday life. When it comes to speaking, the majority of the class is dedicated to this skill. I found this to be extremely helpful especially since I can now think and speak in the language based on what we have learned so far in the class. Furthermore, I am able to have a dialogue with my fellow classmates in Japanese to talk about school, and our daily lives. Many of the homework assignments as well as tests also helped us practice our listening abilities which further helped strengthen my understanding and use of the language. Furthermore, in each of these aspect the language, we learned a lot about Japanese culture, manners of speaking, values, and more.",

                "The strengths of this course is that it places a great emphasis on speaking during each class. The student is expected to study the vocabulary, sentence structure, Kanji, and writing during homework assignments or outside of the class. Once in the class, they put all of this into practice by speaking solely in Japanese during class to their peers and their teachers. The great part about the prompts is that they are relevant to everyday life. For example, we learned how to request a letter of recommendation from a teacher and what the formalities are in that context. Furthermore, the professors are attentive to the tone used during speaking and the vocabulary forms used so they support you in your learning. The course could be improved by providing a bit more practice in the use of tones. Apart from that, this class has done a great job at helping one develop their Japanese language abilities.",

The work is pretty doable if you don't get too behind.\r\n\r\nWeakness: No weakness regarding the teaching material or the way that it. was taught. The only improvement that I could think of is that sometimes homework would be posted somewhat later in the day, which might be a little annoying to people that have time to work on Japanese earlier in the day.",

The constant workload helps you practice and integrate the Japanese language into your everyday life, making it easier to learn the language. Moreover, there is an emphasis placed on each aspect of the language, being the writing, reading, speaking and listening, so that you are able to us each efficiently. The professors are also very focused on supporting students in the learning process. They are there to check your pronunciation, writing, and speaking to help you improve. Furthermore, the language offers clinics, which help you practice the language outside of the classroom as well. Because these are weekly meetings it helps you solidify what you have learned in class outside as well.",
