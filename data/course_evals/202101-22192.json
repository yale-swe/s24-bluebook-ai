Also Kant is IMPOSSIBLE it would be helpful to have some extra resources for understanding him.\r\n\r\nStrength: Professor Franks made amazing slideshows and really cared that we understood the material",
                "Although this is not the fault of Professor Franks at all, I would have appreciated if for the longer texts, there were instructions on which parts were important to focus on. Often I would get a bit bogged down with all the arguments, wondering which were most pivotal.",
                "This course covers a wide breadth of thinkers and places them conversation with each other very well. I felt that the bulk of reading, especially in the later weeks where we were reading entire books which were then boiled down to key passages or insights, inhibited my ability to get the most of the class.",
                "Two strengths were the works we studied in the course and Professor Frank's commitment to making sure we understood them. It could be improved by involving more student discussion in each class.",
                "The course had us read the most random of pages sometimes. There would be an entire paragraph outlining us to read like 4 pages in one chapter, under 3 in another, and so on. I feel as if there are better ways to teach similar material without having us read a glimpse of many sections. Then again, this is a super minor complaint.\r\n\r\nBeside that I think we read a good array of authors from different regions with different thoughts, so overall pretty good."
