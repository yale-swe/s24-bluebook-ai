From various readings of sports literature, I was able to take a deeper look at seemingly mundane things like the human body, what it is to watch a sport, and what the organization of sports in general might say about an individual or group of people."

                "Professor Creswell is a clear strength of the course. He's so well-spoken and is so good at guiding our discussions. It seems like he always knows what to say and how to say it. He also does prep work based on our discussion posts, making the classes all the more engaging.\r\n\r\nBeing able to talk with actual authors and ask questions about their works was also incredibly exciting.\r\n\r\nI wish we could engage with a work longer. It feels almost wasteful to read such a good book, discuss it for a class, then move on to the next one. But I don't think this is something that can/should be changed. I really enjoyed reading the wide array of works and you can't read such a wide array if you engage with a work longer."

                "Yes. If you're interested in sports in general, that's probably enough of a reason to take the class. If you're interested in reading and discussing some really good sports literature, that's a plus.",
                "Yes. The course offers an interesting variety of perspectives on different sports while stretching the idea of what counts as sport in the first place. Along with the content of the course, being in a seminar with classmates from different backgrounds and experiences with sports allows for engaging discussions, whether you approach things more from a literary perspective or from an athletic one-- not that they have to be completely separate things. Overall, it's a fun look at one of the biggest parts of human culture."
