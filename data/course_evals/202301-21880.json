You will learn to identify nearly a hundred minerals on sight, learn some nuts info about probably double that or more, hold a diamond, hold an asteroid, hold a chunk of gold, and cry during the midterm and final.

                "I really enjoyed being able to look at a lot of different mineral specimens each class.",
                "This course's integration of engaging lectures which covered content quickly, clearly, and in a way which aided recollection is almost unlike anything I've experienced at Yale, and the addition of hand samples, which allow for that content to feel real, was the icing on the cake. Though the lab component was fun and engaging, it felt in many cases as though it were an afterthought; activities were not designed for collaboration between students, and after the first few weeks lab slots were so unstructured as to basically be avenues for independent study, which did not pair well with the exacting grading standards. If the lab could be separated from the lecture, or at least its presence communicated more clearly, I feel the class would be greatly improved. I envision a separate half-credit lab course, with this class redesigned to include smaller quizzes throughout the semester to decrease emphasis on tests.",
                "Stellar class in all aspects. One of the best courses I have taken this far. Professor Ague is a fantastic lecturer; engaging and well paced with excellent powerpoints. \r\n\r\nThe lab is equally excellent. Very straightforward while being consistently interesting and fun. \r\n\r\nExams are appropriately challenging but fair, and curved adequately. Expectations of the class are clear.\r\n\r\nHighlight of the class is the absolutely spectacular specimens passed around in class of the minerals we discuss.",
                "I think the only weaknesses of this course were that crystallographic content was really only introduced in the beginning of the class, even though it was important for the whole semester, and that some of the more complicated geology behind the minerals was important to know but wasn't very explicitly elaborated upon. Other than that, this class was wonderful, well-taught, and very fun!",
                "Strengths: Jay Ague is like a PBS after school special come to life.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none. This is the best course at Yale. It's also a truckload of work. Do not take it lightly. This is not rocks for jocks. This is minerals for criminals. The crime you commit is against yourself when you have the hubris to think you can tell orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene apart. Be prepared to suffer.",
                "Honestly this class is amazing! I cant think of a single weakness.",
                "strengths: learned so much about minerals, got to pass around minerals in every class! no weaknesses",
                "I honestly have no complaints, Jay's a great lecturer, the workload was perfect, the material was engaging, and I loved coming to class. Maybe one unrealistic hope would be to have more field trips, but that's all I can think of.",
                "The course is fairly perfect for its content. No suggestions",
                "This course gives students a boatload of practical knowledge (i.e. by the end, you will more or less be able to identifying the mineral components of most common rocks, and understanding their physical/chemical properties). Just be warned, it is by nature fairly memorization-heavy. It also has a weekly 2-hour lab component that is not always listed on OCS."

I didn't have any geology background since I'm not an EPS major, so some of the more ~Earth science~ things were difficult for me to grasp and I ended up Credit/D/F-ing this class. It would have been totally doable if I had the time, though! Overall great class and wonderful professor.",
                "Yes! Super interesting class if you like minerals/earth science, super interesting specimens to look at each class.",
                "Everyone at Yale, including you, the person reading this, absolutely has to take this class! It sits at the crossroads of chemistry, geology, materials science, political economy, and Yale history, and Professor Ague is so knowledgeable that he can easily talk about all five as though he's studied them his entire life. His good humor, ability to perfectly balance entertaining tangents and serious content, and his judicious use of the Peabody collections to provide each student the chance to connect the lectures to real life make this easily the best class I've had at Yale. This is a high-level science class, so intense memorization is required, but the exams are extremely fair and the lab component, if a little boring, is more than compensated for by being the only real homework. This is quite literally the oppurtunity of a lifetime, don't pass it up under any circumstance!",
                "Absolutely. This class is slightly more challenging but completely feasible from a non geology background. Only basic knowledge of chemistry and geology required. If youre a geology major, the information you learn will be very useful in future solid earth studies. If youre not, years from now you can still pick up rocks and say, Oh, thats K-feldspar because its pink, and thats plagioclase next to it, and quartz for the more grayish ones and everybody will think youre really cool and knowledgeable.",
                "Absolutely recommend! This course is super fun and convinced me to start taking other classes in the EPS Department! It was honestly the best part of my day whenever I had it.",
                "Yes yes yes. It is incredibly interesting, and professor Ague is just cool.",
                "100% recommend, provided that you are ready to do the work. If you're not an EPS major already, this is gonna be an even harder lift, but if your TAs are gems (mineralogy pun!!) as ours were they will be there for you.",
                "Absolutely! This class is a gem. You get to see all sorts of awesome specimens in the yale peabody, and it is a really reasonable amount of work.",
                "Yes!! I loved this course -- the mineral samples were beautiful and Professor Ague was an engaging and hilarious lecturer. Additionally, the lab section that is part of this course was extremely helpful in teaching me the importance of truly learning the chemistry behind minerals, and I am more capable of mineral identification because of it.",
                "I recommend! Its challenging to memorize all the minerals, but you gain a new skill, and it is great to have the hands-on experience with so many rare minerals as well.",
                "Highly recommend, one of a kind experience",
                "Absolutely, this course is tons of fun and an excellent EPS learning experience. Jay makes class super enjoyable with his hilarious anecdotes and calm teaching demeanor",
                "Good for learning to identify/understand the properties of common minerals  as an EPS major, or as any student interested in the natural sciences and/or looking for a manageable science credit.",
                "YES! If you want to see some of the coolest minerals ever from the depths of the Peabody collection in your own hands take this course. Jay is amazing and you will learn a lot."
