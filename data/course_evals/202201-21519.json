                "I learned the process by which authors rewrite their story and rigorously edit it. I learned not to be afraid to excise whole characters and scenes, which is something I've struggled with in the past. I also learned how hard it is to respond to a workshop: people often perceive the same characters very differently. Which was an inspiring lesson in some ways, because it reminded me how personal the experience of reading a story is.",
                "I was challenged to really rethink and rewrite my story over the course of three revisions. Workshops always provided useful feedback about what was working in my story and what wasnt.",
                "Fiction writing and polishing a story three times to have it become the best version of itself.",
                "Throughout the revision and workshop process, I improved in pretty much every aspect of writing a short story. You learn how to give feedback, and receive and incorporate feedback over three revisions of the same story. The comments from the professor and other students is thoughtful and extensive.",
                "Amazing workshop that focuses on revision of a single story. I've taken both sections of Adv. Fiction and both have a lot to offer--in one section, you produce two stories, and in this one, you produce one but revise it twice. I think both skills are really important. I liked getting to focus on one work.",
                "How to write fiction.",
                "This workshop taught me the importance of drafting and revising. Previously I hadn't paid much attention to revising my stories beyond their initial drafts, but Professor Cunningham's emphasis on the importance of revision really changed how I look at the process of writing! And his feedback is very helpful to help you hone your story into the best version of itself.",

                "Strength - good people & feedback\r\nWeakness - repetitive structure and feedback",
                "Strengths: Professor Cunningham is a very good workshop facilitator. He also offers in depth comments both in workshop, office hours, and in writing. You can tell how much he cares about each student's story; he devotes a lot of time to reviewing our work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't really learn much about how to structure a story, develop characters, write dialogue, etc.; we were treated as if we already knew that (which is maybe part of the \"Advanced\" nature of the course?) But more guidance on this at the beginning of the semester, before we started crafting our own stories, would have been helpful.",
                "Both a strength and weakness of the course is that you spend the whole semester revising one story over three revisions. Three revisions was really useful in terms of coming out of the class with a story that I was proud of. Your classmates and prof also really know your story well and will give great feedback. The downside is that you might feel stuck if your initial idea that you came up with in the beginning of the semester ends up not being the story you want to write. That being said, this class encourages drastic revisions. Another downside is that it gets to feel a little repetitive as you have to read the same stories by your classmates over and over. But inspiring to see how they develop!",
                "I like how we need to write three drafts; it is very unique for a writing class, and it feels very satisfying to polish a story to its perfection. I do feel like the pace towards the end of the term can be made faster, and I wish we can have clearer guidelines on what to write when we line-edit and comment on each others' works. Because some of the comments are very detailed and useful, while some of the other comments are just check marks near underlined sentences (and makes me wonder if the two are graded the same way as long as they turn them in).",
                "The strength of this course is the professor and the quality of other students in the class -- their writing and their discussions in workshop. Every discussion was considerate and structured to help each writer improve.",
                "No weaknesses. Great course.",
                "Strengths: LOVED the classroom environment, all the students were so great and being in small groups from the start made us really close with one another and the classes really comfortable. It was super supportive, everyone was so great and offered respectful, kind feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Much higher workload than I expected- line edits and a page-long letter to three workshoppers every single week (must be completed between monday night and thursday morning) for 20 pg long stories. Reading the same story three times from everyone got a bit repetitive.",
                "Strengths: The workshop setting was immensely helpful, and Professor Cunningham is a superb asset.\r\nWeaknesses: Running through three drafts of the same twelve people's stories was quite exhausting, I felt at times like I couldn't think of much to say after the first two drafts.",

                "I wished that the course had a more generative structure. There were next to no readings or smaller exercises, which made me feel like I was trapped reading the 12 drafts in the class.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to a student looking to meet a gifted writer and write a polished piece! However, I do not think this is the right class for someone looking to learn the basics of fiction.",
                "Yes, it helped that I really liked the people in my class.",
                "Only if you're an experienced writer; but even then, consider if you want to learn new things about fiction writing from the class, or really work on one story of yours and spend the rest of the semester workshopping other people's works without any outside readings, because this class will be the latter.",
                "If you have the chance to take this course and are seriously interested in writing fiction, then look no further. This is a workshop class, though -- there's no real reading and deconstructing the work of published writers. It's all about the reading and feedback from peers. This is truly a valuable experience to receive criticism from the professor and fellow writers.",
                "Yes!! Professor Cunningham is a great teacher.",
                "Yes, if you like writing and are willing to put in the time. Also, if you're ok with being with one story for the whole semester.",
