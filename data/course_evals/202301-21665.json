                "I wish that the course was a more intensive engineering class with multiple weekly homework problems from the textbook that forced us to learn more intensely and intuitively basic skills in classical mechanism design. Even just design problems using graphical methods on paper would encourage greater understanding of the concepts than replicating them a single time in Solidworks. When Doc A picks up steam getting into the details of explaining the content, he speaks lucidly and makes concepts easy to understand, but not very much time is spent each week diving into new concepts. I wish he held us to a higher standard of understanding, so that we would be rewarded with more practical and conceptual knowledge. \r\n\r\nAlthough students are often busy with other projects, I also wish that the class emphasized classical mechanisms over arduino for the final project. Surely there are considerations and well-trodden solutions for transforming designs into functioning machines, but they are not taught at Yale, and this class (taught with Doc A's experience) would be the place to teach it.",

It is a fun and engaging advanced elective where a surprising amount is taught while keeping stress and workload relatively low. This is the most advanced design class taught here, so if you want design knowledge, this class is a solid springboard from which to launch yourself into the textbook (Norton, and Shigley from 325) and bring yourself to proficiency.",
