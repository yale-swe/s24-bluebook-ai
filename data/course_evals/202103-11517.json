                "I learned a ton in this class. I learned poker strategy, negotiation techniques, how the sports betting industry works, and so much more. Of all of the things I learned, the most useful is probably the negotiation skills through our weekly assignments and discussions. This is the most useful class I've taken at Yale in terms of skills and insights that I'll use beyond Yale.",

                "Negotiation, a bit of financial projection, game theory",
                "The class substantially increased my skills in negotiation. Through the negotiation simulations, I learned how to effectively bargain with my peers, set goals, and remain assertive under pressure. I also really benefitted from the exposure the class gave me to simulated business situations. As someone with little background in finance, this part of the class was interesting and informative.",

                "I loved this course. Only weakness is that it was very focused on sports betting towards the end and lots of people weren't very interested in that.",
                "The negotiations are great, unlike any other type of assignments i've had in other classes. One weakness is the amount of outside of class negotiation/time required. At times this can be difficult because its hard to find time to meet within everyones busy schedules.",
                "Strengths: The content was incredible, and I wish all my classes were so engaging. I also loved the guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Needs more than 2 hours per week. Separately, the homework quantity was heavy and it was difficult to find times during the week to meet in groups of four.",
                "Strengths: well-organized, fun and energetic lectures, some really interesting assignments and a lot of interaction with our classmates\r\nWeaknesses: might've been fun to mix up the type of cases we did, have clearer for each assignments (tighter negotiation parameters)",
                "I really liked how the negotiations made me work with my classmates on a personal level. I feel like I've never really gotten to know my classmates as well as I did in this class. However, I wish there was a little more flexibility with negotiations. Sometimes the turnaround was very quick, and finding a time to meet with your partner was pretty hard within 3-4 days. Also, sometimes the negotiations were just so deeply confusing or had too many caveats that weren't explained. Maybe this was intentional to show how not everything is answerable, but it was frustrating at times. Dan was super chill and cool to talk with.",
                "Strengths: Dan. He is extremely engaging and an excellent instructor. He clearly cares immensely about the students and our learning experience. The material and pace was excellent. The assignments were engaging and the right amount of challenging. The workload was challenging and time consuming but it all felt like meaningful and rewarding work. Weaknesses: The assignments were all really individualized, so it took a while to get some grades back at times (the price paid for having such unique assignments and individualized attention and feedback! I wouldn't change this but am just noting it)",
                "The strength of this class is Dan. He is so much fun and brings in snacks and incredible guest speakers every week. He challenges students in a respectful way and gives helpful feedback. The course was all over the place and the instructions for assignments were very limited,  but it was a ton of fun and the perfect choice for a college seminar.",
                "It makes you feel comfortable with competition. You will win and lose publicly. I think this is a great skill to develop because after the first game you stop feeling ashamed when you lose. Everything becomes constructive feedback. Honestly, one of the best character-building classes I have ever taken.",
                "Strengths: This seminar forces you to apply concepts from class in real-life negotiations with your peers.",
                "This course was a lot of fun. Professor Singer was a very engaging professor and I always looked forward to coming to class. I think in the future, having fewer or potentially just more targeted discussions with the guests speakers could be helpful.",
                "The course is taught in a non-traditional fashion which worked perfectly with the material. Our assignments were structured as negotiations, where we negotiated against our classmates to agree on mock deals. This meant that the class was extremely interactive, making class engaging and the perfect amount of competitive vs collaborative. On top of that, the bulk of the work went into negotiation reports, which were opportunities to reflect on the negotiations based on theoretical principles we learned in class. This made it really insightful to connect theory learned in the assigned books and lecture with the real world practical outcomes of the negotiations. It also boosted and reinforced our understanding of the material. Overall, the content of the course was perfectly paced and taught. One small weakness is that because Dan has other commitments as a visiting lecturer, it may be hard to schedule a consistent time to meet with him other than right before class. However, we were able to mitigate this through video conversations via Zoom."

                "Yes. Dan is absolutely fantastic. He has so much amazing business experience and all of the guest speakers that he invites are insanely cool. I will say, you should probably be interested in sports betting or iGaming if you take this class because that really dominates the end of the course, but I loved the real life applications. I learned so so much real world knowledge about how businesses work and we got into a little bit of financial modeling, and you really could make what you wanted of the course. Also, this is the first seminar that I really became true friends with people in the class -- all of the negotiations take place outside of class and you form insanely deep relationships with everybody. I truly LOVED this class!",

                "Yes. Especially uf you haven't really taken economics or finance-based courses during your time at Yale.",
                "Yes, I know a lot of people who tried to get into this course who did not. I would recommend they continue to try because it was awesome.",
                "ABSOLUTELY YES, this course was fantastic and one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, hands down. Dan is an excellent teacher and very committed to student learning, and goes out of his way to make the course super fun. I felt like I learned something from every class and a whole lot from the negotiations. It can be a very good intro to learning how to reach agreements with very different people.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student in any discipline. Dan is truly exceptional and the course is amazing. Truly the best class I've taken in 3 years of Yale classes.",
                "If you are interested in business negotiation, sports, poker and game theory, this will be your favourite class ever. If you only like one of those, it might not be a great choice.",
                "I DEFINITELY recommend this class. Especially, if you are a person that is not used to speaking up in class and feel uncomfortable with competition. I was one of those people and this class really changed my level of comfort with these types of things. Being comfortable with losing publicly and receiving constructive feedback is an incredible type of skill to have. The class also taught me a lot about people's motivations and strategies to become a good negotiator.",
                "Would definitely recommend this course! Dan is a great professor who makes an effort to connect with all students both in and outside of class. He's an expert on the material and brings in a ton of really interesting speakers from industry. Take this if given the opportunity!",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It was certainly less game theory and more business negotiation than I originally anticipated, but I really enjoyed the course. Professor Singer was wonderful. I had a lot of fun in the class but also learned how to be a stronger negotiator, something that is useful (if very different from the type of thing usually taught in Yale courses).",
                "Yes! It was unlike any other course I had taken at Yale and provides students with practical knowledge and experience to apply throughout their entire life in business settings.",
                "Yes! Take this course. It isn't very often that courses are taught in a way where the theory learned in class is fully realized just a few days later in assignments. The content isn't just problem sets or essays, but fun, insightful negotiations. There was never a dull moment in the class, and I believe this class is a must take if it is offered again."
