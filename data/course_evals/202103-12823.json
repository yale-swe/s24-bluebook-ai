                "I think the main strength of this course is how we were assessed. Exam questions would come from worksheets discussed in optional sections. I never went to the sections, but the worksheets were really helpful when studying for exams.",
                "Could have a weekly assignment so that grades are not depended solely on three tests and would better show how much the students are learning.",
                "I think the potential for this course is vast! The topics covered were awesome. Unfortunately, bribiescas is not a great lecturer and he really didnt engage with the 20 person class at all. He could have made it a bit more seminar style with so few of us but he really had no interest. On top of that, he doesnt seem perfectly capable of maintaining a train of thought and is more interested in talking about his own life and experiences than  evolution.",
                "This course was amazing.",
                "The course could be improved by better organizing the major themes and concepts and making these easier for students to digest. I found often that the takeaways presented at the end of lecture did more to say that the content is subtle and complex and it's hard to draw any real conclusions, which is fairly unhelpful (I don't want to walk away from a course saying it's hard to draw any real conclusions about the subject matter). I think adhering more to the structure of the textbook used in the course would be one way to remedy this.",
                "This course could have benefitted from further graded assignments than the exams.",
                "Strengths: I enjoyed the lectures and always felt like I could ask questions if I didn't understand. We were also able to look at hormones and behavior through many lenses and with many applications, which was nice because it exposed me to a lot of new ideas, and meant that there was something for everyone. I also appreciated how we looked at research in this class - directly looking at the figures from primary literature helped me get more familiar with interpreting research, and discussing the difficulties and limitations within research helped me learn to look at some of it with a more critical eye instead of believing anything I see about the subject. \r\n\r\nOne thing I think could be improved is that we could talk more about hypotheses on how certain human behaviors evolved. I feel like we talked a lot about how certain behaviors increase fitness, but going through how the behavior may have arisen in the population (/how the hormone interactions that caused it arose, or what genes they may be involved with) might help give a bigger picture about evolution of human behavior. I know from what we learned in the class that this is usually really complicated and hard to know, but I would have been interested in talking about it more.",
                "The course material itself was interesting to me in theory. However, the style of teaching made it very difficult to understand the material. The lectures were relatively disorganized and were difficult to follow. It was also difficult to distinguish between what was established science and what was the professor's opinion. He consistently interpreted papers in a way different from the original authors and presented opinions as fact, which meant that I didn't leave the course feeling that I learned that much. The course could be strengthened by adding science pre-requisites so that not as much time is spent going over very basic science/evolution content (or not require such an in depth understanding of that content). Additionally, more time could be spent on focusing on the link between hormones and behavior. It isn't difficult to get a good grade if that is what you are looking for, especially if you attend section. However, it was frustrating to have both sections scheduled during times I had other classes and not have any option for evening sections.",
                "I appreciated how exams covered material that we discussed in section, and generally found section to be really engaging. I also really liked that we were able to ask questions often in class to expand on our understanding of the material. However, I did find that all lectures were organized well and sometimes had trouble understanding what the main takeaway was when studies contradicted each other.",

                "Probably notour only grades were from our two midterms and finals; no homework, participation, essays, etc. The content of the tests was drawn directly from worksheets we were given the answers to during section. This meant that 100% of our grade in the class was determined by whether or not we could memorize what we were told the answers were to the questions. This didn't feel like the right way to learn. Also, there were only ~20 people in our class, but it was formatted totally as a lecture. We all could have benefitted from making this a more discussion-oriented class, especially given that the professor would always say that so much of our content is still open research.",
                "Yes! Professor Bribiescas is a great lecturer and always makes time for questions. You learn a lot about hormones in a variety of contexts, how to think about things through the lens of life history and evolution, and how research in Biological Anthropology works. \r\n\r\nDefinitely don't take the class if you don't plan on going to section though. They were extremely helpful in reinforcing the material and it was fun to take the extra time to discuss aspects of the class/ readings we were especially interested in. More than half of the material on the tests is directly covered in section, so if you go you can expect to do fairly well, but if you don't you will likely struggle.",
