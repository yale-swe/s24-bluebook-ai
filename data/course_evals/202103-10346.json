                "Professor Kreiner did a wonderful job of exposing us to different texts and social movements (with most emphasis going to the Black Liberation Movement). While it was eye-opening and informative in many respects, I will say that I wish the curriculum spent more time on learning how to write an essay thats appropriate for higher education. In addition to that, Im not sure The Salt Eaters was the right choice for an introductory English course. While it is a revolutionary book packed with vivid imagery and important themes, it is very confusing and generally hard to follow. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the content of the class as well as the professor.",
                "A strength is the topics which we covered. They were very interesting and had a lot of thought provoking context to them. A weakness was that for each class we could be given many readings as homework, some which I wouldn't even have time to read, and then we would only go through one or at most two during the session.",
                "This course could be improved by a more accurate schedule of the readings and homework, as well as provided copies of those in the course reserves. The course could also cover more diverse readings (rather than reading either only black writers or only women writers).",
                "The class was very heavy on reading and not on writing which caught me off guard. I initially took the class to learn how to write, but I felt as though that was not the focus of the class at all.",
                "The amount of reading we had per night was way too much, and I feel like our discussions never went anywhere. They were extremely generic and vague. Instead of diving into specific details of the book, we spoke in broad terms. Every class felt the same, and I didn't learn from the teacher as I did from the readings themselves. Another weakness is that it really isn't a social movements class. The majority of the time we spent analyzing the Civil Rights and Black Lives Matter Movement, which was great, but that is pretty much all we talked about. In other words, it shouldn't be advertised as a social movements course if we really aren't learning much about the other movements besides those. The professor talked most of the time so I felt like there was little time for the students to actually participate. The one good thing about the class was the poetry unit, which I loved."

                "I would recommend this class, but only if you already have reasonably strong English skills as well as a strong interest in the course topics. Professor Kreiners feedback is helpful, but his grading can be a bit harsh and the reading materials confusing.",
                "Yes, if they already had knowledge on social movements and know how to write properly, then I would recommend this course.",
                "I would not, simply because the readings are not as diverse as one would imagine and there is very little structure in the course.",
                "No. The amount of reading is insane, and every class feels the same in regards to subject matter. The prompt of all the essays is basically the same, and the feedback is extremely confusing and vague. We never got our papers back when we were promised, and the grading is tough even when you know your writing was done well. Take another English 115 class please!"
