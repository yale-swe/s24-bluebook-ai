                "Prof. Shankar is an excellent instructor, and there is something unique about his style of teaching that has just \"worked for me\" very well. As someone who made a habit of attending class, I think doing so was extremely beneficial to my understanding. The topics I struggled with the most were angular momentum (juggling dozens of properties of Jz, Lz, Sz, J^2, L^2, S^2 frequently got my wires crossed) and scattering theory (motivation for certain expressions, such as a differential cross section or a phase shift), both of which I was able to get some simpler intuition on from Griffith's textbook. I prefer Prof. Shankar's textbook at large (particularly his approach to introducing quantum theory), but I think other sources give more straightforward intuition in later chapters.",
                "Strengths: Professor Shankar is a skilled lecturer and has useful analogies in quantum mechanics. The problem sets were challenging and were very good practice. Weaknesses: The book contains too much information for it to be useful as a textbook; it is better as a reference. Sometimes Professor Shankars pacing is a bit strange. Hell often blow right through calculations that could use some more time, and sometimes hell belabor a point that doesnt seem to require as much emphasis.",
                "Strength: Professor Shankar did his best to be available and he clearly put a lot of work into the course from lectures, prerecorded lectures, learning goals, etc. Weakness: The problem sets weren't too representative on the exams and were also a bit erratic (i.e. one week there would be a 12 week problem set and the next week would only have 3 questions)",
                "It has executed very well given the circumstances, and I really enjoyed the course.",
                "The strengths of this course include the accessibility of the pre-recorded lectures and the learning goals for each lecture tailored to ensure students understood the core concepts. The main weakness of this course was the lack of timeliness in which problem sets were returned.",
                "This course was solid, I don't have any weaknesses for it. The set-up was a strength, as was the quality of the lectures and meetings.",
                "The flipped classroom format is very effective and conducive for learning. The lectures were pre-recorded and came with quizzes and we were required to watch them before class. During the class meeting times, Prof. Shankar went over learning goals he prepared for us and practice problems with us and answered questions. Although the course was conducted remotely, Prof. Shankar has put in a lot of efforts into helping us understand the concept and improving our problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that it took a long time for us to receive some of the pset grades. This happened more often during the second half of the semester."

I think initially the class time was meant for questions and a problem session, but why have a lecture before hand, only to say \"this is what's really important\" in class? why not just start with what's important, instead of double-teaching things with extra stuff that's not important.",

                "I found the flipped classroom style helpful for quantum mechanics, since I got exposed to the material twice, and I got to practice it twice (in class and on problem sets). I also got to slow down or speed up the lectures as necessary. The problem-solving in class made for high engagement.",
