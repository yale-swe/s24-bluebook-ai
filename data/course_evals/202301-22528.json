Overall, I gained greater insight on my strengths and weaknesses as a writer, and I feel capable of identifying those weaker areas by myself now.",

I was able to get to know my classmates as people and writers throughout the semester. Give or take a couple readings, I enjoyed our syllabus and was grateful to be introduced to new authors.",

                "I loved this class. You'll get a lot of different type of assignments and it'll be fun to see how you can make each work and which you like best. I think the course would be much stronger with more short field trip/creative nonfiction components, especially because we live in a city. I LOVED how there was an entire course about cities: as a much-loved interest of mine, it was SO FUN to get to talk about them every week and really get into the grits of cities.",
                "Strengths- Great readings, great speakers, and good class discussion",
                "This course is very engaging. The material is interesting and great examples of what the course is helping you to develop in regards to writing. Sometimes the readings felt redundant or unnecessarily too many, but the professor is very open to changing the well-crafted syllabus.",
                "This class was well-suited support wise. I came in with a relatively dated and poor understanding of writing skills, and was given lots of feedback to improve my work. The class fostered great conversation, and I came to enjoy the company of my professor and classmates."

I think it's natural that students will prefer some units over others, but I often learned the most about my strengths and weaknesses as a writer when I was pushed outside of my comfort zone.",
                "Yes! If you like creative nonfiction, then this course is great. The workload is very manageable, and the lack of a final paper due after reading week is amazing.",
