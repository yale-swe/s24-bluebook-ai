   "comments": [
    "My ability to read Latin poetry increased a lot. I also became better at analyzing, understanding, and discussing scholarly articles and how to use them to defend an argument. My understanding of Catullus and his poetry also improved.",
    "I learned a lot about doing academic research-- the paper topics seemed extremely complex and intimidating at the start but by the end I always felt as though I'd really learned a lot about the topic and I feel that I have a much greater confidence in my skills in writing, researching, and analyzing after taking this course. \r\n\r\nI'd never questioned so much about Catullus or ancient texts in general and usually just accepted the text and interpretations I was given and just translated-- but in this class we went so much deeper than that and at times I really struggled, but this course was extremely rewarding in terms of intellectual pay-off.",
    "Bolstered my Latin and learned to approach Latin lyric poetry with greater sensitivity and attention to the scale of corpus.",
    "I developed a familiarity with a large cross-section of the Catullan corpus -- there is much more to Catullus than I knew before! -- as well as an understanding of many of the key issues of modern scholarship on Catullus. We paid close attention to Catullus's position in ancient literary history, but also took time to examine his modern reception. As with any Latin course, my facility with the language improved over the course of the semester.",
    "How to analyze text for themes"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength is that we read a huge amount of the Catullan corpus over the course of the term. We were able to discuss and read many different types of Catullus' poetry, which was both interesting and enjoyable. We also had the opportunity to do a very interesting final paper topic by looking at manuscripts in the Beinecke. I only wish that we had a better classroom environment to better facilitate the class discussions we always had.",
    "Prof. Peirano led a really engaging seminar. I particularly liked how often we analyzed ancillary material, like other authors and even paintings, to further our understanding of the text.",
    "Strengths are in-class discussions and Professor Peirano's teaching, as well as a syllabus that was always very straightforward and updated. I sometimes struggled with finding the commentaries and assigned readings, however, and would have appreciated if there were links to an online source or scans of the books included in the syllabus.",
    "I appreciated the care with which Professor Peirano-Garrison has constructed the syllabus: the selection of poems is diverse, especially for a single-author course (of course, Catullus himself helps with this); the groupings well-designed to produce lively discussion; the secondary readings were always interesting and provocative. Despite the excellent syllabus, our discussion sometimes flagged -- an unfortunate development that I (and several classmates) felt was directly attributable to the lecture room in which we held our seminar. The ideal seminar is multi-lateral -- students and instructor in flowing conversation -- but a lecture setup immediately deadens this model into a series of bilateral conversations between professor and student, with occasional cross-referencing (which often requires talking at the back of someone's head). I wish we could redo a handful of discussions that grasped toward great ideas but fell short of developing them, in my view, because we couldn't really all see each other. (I know that room assignments are up to the registrar's office, and that they have zillions of courses to fit into rooms; still, I hope that they will help future iterations of the class realize the full potential of the syllabus around a seminar table.)",
    "Strengths were good material, reasonable assessments. Weaknesses were setup of class. Discussions could sometimes feel forced."

    "Yes, this was a great course to read so much of Catullus and get a real feel of him as a poet. You also get to discuss how other scholars are interpreting many of these poems, so there is this great split of the class between just reading Latin and discussing what the Latin is saying and doing.",
    "Yes, Prof. Peirano is a great teacher.",
    "Yes! I found it very difficult in terms of intellectual challenge and workload, but I feel like I learned a lot and despite being my most difficult it was also my most rewarding class this semester.",
    "If you are considering this course, you likely read some Catullus in high school: the sparrow poems; \"Vivamus, mea Lesbia\"; \"Odi et amo.\" As it turns out, there is so much more to Catullus than these heart-directly-on-sleeve lyrics. This course will let you see Catullus's many other sides and suggest new ways to see those well-worn love poems. Professor Peirano-Garrison is exceptionally knowledgeable, and the secondary readings offer views as diverse as the poems on the syllabus. One caveat: plead to have the class in a seminar room -- your discussions will surely be better without the lecture setup that dogged our semester.",
    "Maybe. It was fine. Nothing to write home about."
