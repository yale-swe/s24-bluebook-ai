                "I appreciated how structured the writing process was, but I think this course could be improved by allowing students to determine the structure for themselves. For instance, I found some of the internal assignments (ex. the annotated bibliography) as very extraneous and 'busy work'; devoting time to them felt like the opposite of helpful. Instead, I think it would be good to let students set their semester-long schedules for themselves, perhaps in the form of a calendar they turn into the DUS/their advisors at the start of the semester (alongside the initial project statement).",

                "The major strength of the Senior Essay is its self-directed nature -- you have a lot of freedom to decide which topic to pursue and how to approach it. My main recommendation is that it would be helpful for the HSAR department to provide more formal support in connecting students with advisors. While finding an advisor is a necessary part of the process, it can sometimes be excessively difficult (in my opinion). For students struggling to identify a thesis advisor, the HSAR department could provide one-on-one consultations to brainstorm potential advisors and back-up plans. The department could also host events where students in the major get to know faculty members who are open to advising. This would help students gauge their personality fit with potential advisors and get to know faculty members they may not have taken classes with."
