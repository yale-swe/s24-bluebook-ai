                "I learned about Russian politics and protest movements. I also learned a bit about human rights law more generally and about research methodologies.",
                "Learned a lot about Russian history and the legacies of communism in the country. The focus on socio-legal studies was absolutely fascinating.",

It was a very humanizing approach to what can be a diminishing area of study. Very good and informative historical introduction to this transition from soviet to contemporary Russia and why we see the issues we do today-- how they developed and so forth.",

                "Strengths: This was a really great course that covered a lot of material on the Russian legal system and Professor Mustafina was always very engaging. Weaknesses: It felt as though we fell into the same type of discussions over and over again at times, which may have just been a consequence of the interests of this particular class. Additionally, the session organization scheme sometimes was a bit confusing.",
                "This course offered a very nice overview of Russian human rights movements from the Soviet period to today. The readings were generally interesting. In terms of how the course could be improved, it might be helpful to go more in depth into a few of the topics, as it sometimes felt that the sessions were a bit disconnected even though they were enjoyable and I felt that I learned quite a bit.",
                "Maybe a bit more focus on comparative aspects with the American system, such as mass incarceration.",
                "The reading responses were quite demanding but as the semester progressed they became easier-- because the language was more normalized. Could have used more guidance when writing the paper because it was easy to procrastinate and the course carried the assumption that students had written long research papers before, would not recommend this course as an introductory political science course.",
                "I thought this course was excellent, it had the best reading assignments of any class I've ever taken-- always manageable in quantity and relevant in content. I thought our discussions were always informative and fun to participate in. There isn't anything I would change about this class."
