                "I developed a deeper understanding of the roles that several of our national institutions serve (or fail to serve) in protecting democratic rule, particularly in light of modern/novel challenges, and grappled with a number of considerations in strengthening them.",
                "Got better at gleaning key points from long and complex readings; analyzing other peoples' arguments and expressing my arguments in coherent and concise ways in class discussions; honed my research-paper-writing skills",
                "I learned about the institutions, interests, and controversies that shape the global struggle between democracy and its detractors.",
                "I learned a lot about the building blocks of democracy: the courts, democratic norms, the role of technology, etc. The course is excellent for honing your writing skills, and Dr. Young is an excellent professor."

                "Dr. Young is the absolute highlight of the course.  Her dedication to and investment in her students' learning and well-being is unmatched at Yale College.  She is a stellar mentor and a stellar person--a role model for me and my classmates.  If you are lucky to have the opportunity to learn from her, absolutely take it.",
                "Strengths: course themes were excellently chosen and dovetailed with each other; class discussions were riveting and got everyone to think at a higher level; readings were interesting, and paper topics pushed my writing\r\nWeaknesses: too much time spent on news items, discussions could sometimes lead far away from the class's topic (which was sometimes a strength, but a weakness when you wanted to discuss topics related to the readings)",
                "Strengths: Dr. Young is an amazing professor and it's a joy to be her student. The course is also made stronger by the way class is structured; it generally starts with a discussion of current events related to the course, and followed by a brief recap of the readings, after which there is usually a lively discussion. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None that I experienced. The only potential weakness is that the strength class (in my opinion) is heavily dependent on how much effort your classmates are willing to put in and how willing they are to engage constructively in what can at times turn into somewhat controversial conversations. My experience was great in this respect, though.",
                "This class is very practical and the professor makes you think deeply about applying theory to the real world. The class could benefit from expanding study and analysis to include non-European countries.",
                "I really loved that this class had a current events section. It allowed us to talk about the things we were learning in class in a real life context.",
                "Everything about this course is a strength: the material, and assignments, and above all else, Dr. Young herself. Dr. Young is without question the best part of the course. There are absolutely no weaknesses to this course."

                "Yes. This is a great way to learn more about democracy and all of the topics surrounding and interacting with it.",
                "Yes. If you're a PLSC, EPE, or GLBL major please take one (or both) of Dr. Young's classes before you graduate! There are some classes to take for the material, and others that are must-takes because of the professor. This class belongs to both categories.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Dr. Young is a wonderful, caring, and knowledgable professor that genuinely cares about her students in and outside of the classroom. Content aside, Dr. Young as an instructor is reason enough to enroll! This course and Dr. Young's other course (The Politics of Fascism) are two of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Dr. Young does grade candidly; however, she offers revisions and will work closely with you to ensure your revision is better than your original!"
