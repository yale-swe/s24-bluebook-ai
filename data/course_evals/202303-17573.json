Discussed implications of early American political culture on our politics and culture today (the last class about Hamilton the musical is awesome!).",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: Professor Freeman's contributions in class, Professor Freeman's writing feedback (it is incredible to have her line-edit; this class will improve your writing whether you want it to or not!), readings are great, and the course is structured for the production of a paper without the same stress you might run into in other history seminars. Since a rough draft is due before Thanksgiving Break, the second half of your semester is just revision! All in all, a well taught class with an amazing professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 1) I understand the course is going through the idea of the American politician thematically, but I think this class could benefit from a more chronological structure. While some folks in the course had a great grasp of early U.S. history, at times I felt a little lost when someone would bring up certain events.  If the course was structured as more of a history, it would be easier to know what was going on and to really trace the changes of the idea of the American politician. I think it would be great if Professor Freeman began each class with a ~15 minute summary of where we are in U.S. history so all students feel comfortable with what is being discussed. \r\n\r\n2) Professor Freeman is an amazing resource and great at explaining ideas\/events\/making theoretical claims. I wish she would have spoken more during discussions! While I was happy that she kept the whole class engaged and included in the discussion, at times I would have appreciated her just pausing and explaining a point for a while. When Professor Freeman did discuss a topic at length, it was very enjoyable\/helpful.",
                "The course is exceptional thanks in large part to Professor Freeman. She is truly one of Yale's finest. If you're considering the course, think about taking it just to have a class with her! A 20-page paper can seem daunting, but Prof. Freeman has designed the course to make the process easy and intuitive. There are a few small assignments (reading response, prospectus), but the paper itself is the main body of work for the course. The rough draft is due in November. In my opinion, this is a huge strength. Prof. Freeman generously line-edits the rough draft, meaning everyone has ~3 weeks to refine the rough draft into a solid final paper. The course is so well-designed and thought-out; you will not be frantically writing the paper during exam week, meaning everyone has time to churn out a quality piece of scholarship. Finally, the readings are diverse and pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are few weaknesses. I would have liked to have more primary source readings (the one day we read letters by Jefferson and Hamilton was AWESOME), but that's a minor complaint. I'm also biased in favor of the Age of Hamilton and Jefferson, which is a course featuring pretty much only primary source readings. Also, I think it would be helpful to have a little more guidance during class discussions. Prof. Freeman has such wonderful insights and questions, but sometimes the class would go off in another direction from the question she asked, and the discussion itself would bounce from one topic to another without much direction.",
                "Too much reading. also, discussions dont feel structured enough.",

                "Absolutely. This course will really push you to reconsider what \"politics\" meant in Early America, and it will also push you (indirectly) to think about how the development of America's political culture in the 1790s influences our politics now. It's also a fantastic opportunity to develop writing skills (in preparation for a senior thesis or a similar project), and Prof. Freeman is awesome!",
