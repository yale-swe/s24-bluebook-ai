                "I learned about the development of the early Spanish empire, and multiple different perspectives surrounding this history. Given that this is an area of history I am unfamiliar with, it was really interesting to learn about various facets and major events that occurred in the 15th and 16th century.",
                "Learned more about Spain",
                "Excellent overview of Spain and its empire building. Covered such a range of topics. Also, Profe Maria is FANTASTIC. I need to take another class with her because she is such an incredible, nice, and excellent professor.",
                "I gained a greater insight into the golden era of the Spanish Empire. This is one of the only classes that provides a fantastic opportunity to learn about the country at the forefront of colonization. This was the type of class I imagined I could take when I decided to go to college here.",
                "A general survey of the history of the Spanish Kingdom and colonial empire from about 1469 to around 1621. Read about interesting case studies such as Catalina de Erauso and works of literature like Fuente Ovejuna. For someone who came into the course with a very basic knowledge of Spanish history from high school, we were able to move beyond the reigns of the Catholic kings into other interesting events such as the Comunro revolts and the explusion of the Moriscos.",
                "I learned about the history of Early Modern Spain and important instances of dissidence and control in various societal, military, economic, and political settings. We approached the learning through interdisciplinary means which made my understanding of the class more well rounded."

                "Strengths -- Professor Jordan. She is a wonderful, considerate, and knowledgeable teacher. I really appreciate her interest in our individual topic choices, and her wide breadth of knowledge and passion for the subject. I think the course was at its best when we were discussing major figures or events, and looking at primary sources to evaluate these periods - they generated the most conversation and level of engagement. \r\n\r\nWeakness -- I think the initial introductory class could have been stronger. Given that many of us don't have much background knowledge on this time period, the readings were quite dense and I think we could have benefited from a more lecture-style first class where we covered the overall time period.",
                "Loved how the course was structured",
                "strengths: readings, PROFE MARIA (cannot emphasize this enough), and discussion led by students + interventions from Maria made the clas very enjoyable\r\nweaknesses: wish there was more guidance on the final project -- seemed rushed at the end",
                "The material was terrific, and the discussions were always engaging and open to all. However, the organization of the readings on canvas could be improved, which we discussed on the last day.",
                "Maria is an absolute gem here at Yale, and I am so glad that I got to take her course. She has a special insight into the course material and attempts to curate an environment where everyone can bring something to the table. I really enjoyed learning about the specific case studies like that of Catalina de Erauso and the influence of Pirates in the Spanish carribean. My only concern is that I think that the course is slightly disorganized and at times, I think announcements/instructions on assignments could have been a bit clearer. This class involves student presentations nearly every week, meaning that at some point, expect to curate a two and a half hour presentation on a specific topic, like the Comunro revolts. Other than that, I think that you need to take a course taught by Maria at least some point here at Yale. \r\nOn a side note, I think that having a basic understanding of Spanish may help you fit into the environment just a bit, because I think that many come into the class with that background.",
                "Strengths - Readings, especially primary sources, and topics are very interesting; student-led discussions and presentations are engaging and allow for students presenting to more deeply engage with material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Sometimes student presentations that did not contextualize the content made it more difficult to participate in class discussions"

            "comments": [
                "Yes, I would. It is important history that informs our understanding of early America as well as the Spanish empire. We touched on issues surrounding women in the 15th century, religious conflicts and expulsions, colonialism, and issues surrounding transgender and queer history, which was a great addition to the course. It was one of the stronger, more rounded history seminars that I have taken at Yale.",
                "Yes",
                "absolutely!! take it, history major or not, maria will be sure to provide a great and accessible working environment. Easy to email her and set up a meeting if you need to.",
                "Yes, Professor Jordan was always a delight to learn from. The readings were engaging, and they were often pieces that I would have never experienced outside of the class. Ultimately, the class was one of my favorites to take at Yale.",
                "Yes! Even if you feel like you aren't super well-spoken on the course material, Maria attempts to curate an inclusive and welcoming environment. Here's an anecdote that I think ought to convince you: on Valentine's Day, she brought us mini cupcakes that she baked herself! I really enjoyed the way our class discussions flowed, and Maria really wants to make sure that you can add something to every discussion. Keeping up on readings is essential to succeeding in this class, but I think that you'll find that it's quite worth it in the end. The issues that we discuss were also quite thought-provoking and I think they helped me see just how much more research needs to go into Early Modern Spanish history.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one who is interested in Latin American history, orneeds a pre-industrial History credit.",
                "Absolutely. The course provides a great overview of various societal, political, cultural, and economic aspects of early modern Spain. This time period was extremely influential and I was constantly surprised at how relevant many of the topics still are in modern-day discourse.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Early Modern Europe. Although it is focused on Spain, you learn a lot about the entire region, and I think it is a very important class for any students studying or interested in that time period."
