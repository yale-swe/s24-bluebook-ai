                "I developed skills in close reading, critical thinking, and communicating ideas. I also improved my historical analysis and writing skills. We read some of the most famous texts on criminology alongside specific case materials. I truly got a sense of both the theory and practice involved with crime and punishment. I gained insight into both the criminal mind and how society views the criminal.",
                "I learned about different forms of crime (e.g. organized crime, middle-class crime, & lynchings), aspects of criminal justice (trial by jury, trials without lawyers, trials that serve as public theater), and the role women play in crime. I also learned about specific court cases, like the Lizzie Borden trial. We also touched on what influences criminal behavior (such as biological factors and external factors). We read \"Crime and Punishment,\" which was a good book (although lengthy).",
                "I learned a lot about crime from various periods and various geographical areas which was very interesting! I also think I improved my writing and speaking skills through the various assignments and the mock trial.",
                "This class was very helpful in learning useful academic and writing habits for majors like History.",
                "An understanding of varying law and crime theories, trials, and court procedures.",
                "Where to even start. I was a STEM kid growing up, and this course was a great introduction to the humanities. I learned how to write history essays, how to do dense readings in a short period of time, and how college seminars operate. Alongside these, I learned a lot about law and the history of trials, law, criminality, and the study of criminality.",
                "How to evaluate history at a college level through the use of primary and secondary sources, the workings of the modern justice system of the United States and Russia, historical examples of less formalized justice from a wide variety of perspectives, and the philosophic grounding behind the justice system",

                "This course was a very good introduction to important issues in criminal law. We discussed crime and criminality as it existed during different time periods and in different regions. We also talked about these issues with the perspective of studying them as history, including a focus on the genesis and evolution of the criminal trial and particularly the use of show trials as tools."

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: engaging, balanced, well-chosen readings, equal consideration for all students, manageable workload, interesting subject matter. I like how the course utilizes cases, academic writings, and fictional pieces. The diversity of material enriched the course and made the readings enjoyable. Discussion-style seminar aids in furthering understanding and allowing students to fully interact with the texts. Overall, a great introduction into modern and historical criminal theory with political, sociological, psychological, anthropological, and scientific influences. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N\/A",
                "Strengths: engaging subject, good content covered, interesting readings\r\nWeaknesses: the readings could sometimes be lengthy and difficult to understand, in-class discussions would sometimes not be as engaging because there were some topics that I found to be less interesting\r\n\r\nThe class was mostly based on student participation. The professor would ask general questions at the beginning of class and we would answer and discuss them. However, I sometimes felt like students wouldn't engage with each others' comments but would just say something to get their participation grade. I would've liked more structure in terms of the class.",
                "I really liked the way discussion was run in this course. It was very engaging and felt like an actual discussion rather than individual comments which is something other classes struggled with in my opinion. A big weakness though was the lack of clarity in assignment instructions.",
                "The course is very interesting. It was sometimes difficult to speak in class however. It didn't feel so much a discussion, rather each student shared their insight and the professor responded to us. It didn't feel like I was really engaging with other students.",
                "The greatest weakness of this course were the assignments. We never had a prompt and the instructions provided by the professor were vague and unhelpful. Moreover, his feedback for assignments were generally scant and super general. The strength of this course were the discussions and readings.",
                "Strengths of this course include the fact that it encouraged first-years to learn and think about crime and criminality in a variety of ways, forcing us to take into account different time periods, different cultures, and different perspectives. We touched on science (a little) and morality and politics and social issues, touching a lot of sectors of academia while remaining in the realm of the history of crime and punishment. The only weakness I can think of is just the lack of guidelines for some of the papers. For a couple of the papers, I felt like I didn't really understand what was wanted, although I could very easily email and ask the professor, and he would swiftly answer my questions. It would have just been helpful to have written guidelines, but I'm not sure if most college seminars are similarly vague in their prompts or not, so this may be a void suggestion.",
                "I think the largest strength of this course was the seminar format. It provides a wonderful way to interact with other students and Professor Antonov, who was superb at facilitating discussion and providing more context and explanation whenever needed. I do think that it could have been a bit more structured, though, as much of the class was people waiting a long queue to address topics that the class had very often moved on from already. This is doubtlessly a product of the online setting, and Professor Antonov adjusted to facilitate more open and conversational discussion towards the end of the semester, but there is still some work to be done to ensure the seminar is engaging.",
                "The reading was sometimes excessive. But the material was interesting and insightful.",
                "The strengths were learning how to analyze many historical reading. There was not many weaknesses.",
                "It was a really conducive environment to discuss various perspectives. However, most students shared the same opinions about the topics discussed, so it was often one-sided.",
                "This course was interesting and engaging. The class was interactive (discussion-based), so that likely helped keep interest high. The assigned readings could have been parsed through more carefully, as some of them seemed unnecessarily long. They were interesting to read, but sections could have been chosen more carefully."

I can't imagine any area of improvement for COVID-19 practices; it was a seminar, so we really just needed the discussion aspect, which was provided.",

                "It can be difficult to have fluid discussions over Zoom. Professor Antonov would take down lists of who would like to talk, and we could jump in with a certain hand signal. This was a very productive way to have discussions where students could speak when they needed to without talking over one another. Sometimes a students comment would not be heard until that topic of conversation had been passed, but this was usually fine, as the instructor was open to hearing them and integrating them into the discussion. I hope this continues."

Those interested in the social sciences\/law specifically will love this course. This was one of my favorite classes to attend and I gained something from each discussion. The workload is not overwhelming, and Professor Antonov provides materials with clear instructions on how to structure your paper. The readings are really interesting and push you to think about crime through a variety of lenses. It is an amazing course that I wish I could take every year.",
                "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the subject. If not, I would probably not take it because the readings and class in general might be dull. The readings can be lengthy and difficult to understand, so if you don't want a reading-heavy class, don't take this class. However, the topics we covered were very interesting and insightful. I also enjoyed the mock trial that we held at the end of the semester. The writing assignments were fairly easy, but the professor doesn't explain the assignments too well.",
