The work felt very front loaded (most writing, reading, and discussion for the first meeting, the second weekly meetings didnt feel as productive as the first weekly meetings). But other than this minor point, no real weaknesses.",

The class format was also helpful; the weekly reading reflections\/responses were great for learning to analyze literary sources.\r\nWeaknesses: the comments of the professor can be insensitive at times."
