                "I now understand the fundamentals of microeconomic theory after taking this class, and I have learned how to think like an economist.",
                "Intro Econ course so marginal utility, cost minimization, firm theory, interest rates, etc.",
                "Having never studied economics before, this course was a wonderful introduction into the main components in microeconomics: from supply and demand curves to utility functions; from labor to capital; from consumer surplus to the efficient market hypothesis. I appreciated how Professor Koker often gave amusing real life examples to help us better learn the terms and their meanings- this helped me see the relevance of economics in our daily lives and also made the class very engaging.",
                "Knowledge of basic economic principles, Critical thinking, Mathematical and analytical skills.",
                "I learned the skills necessary to understand economic agents and decisions, and to make calculations for utility and other concepts. I also learned to think in economic terms, which has affected the way I approach decisions and resources.",
                "I learnt how to learn rapidly and follow professors that tend to move very quickly through content. I learnt a lot of contextual knowledge about economics beyond what is explored in the syllabus to give me better understanding of concepts as a whole. I also learnt the more quantitative side of economics which I had never explored before",
                "I learned about consumers, firms, markets, and all the equations & theory underlying them. This was practically my first exposure to economics.",
                "Microeconomic principles, what drives producers and consumers to act in a market, how to understand applicable models and graphs."

            "comments": [
                "I believe that the course moves dwells on topics for too long or for too short, but it covered all topics well enough for me to understand them.",
                "Strengths of the course is its size. It allowed us to ask questions and engage with the professor more often. The weaknesses are the lack of grades. So much of your grade is determined by the final and midterm and if you do mediocre on one of the exams then this could set you back tremendously in the class without much opportunity for recovery.",
                "I feel that the TAs could have been slightly better in providing help and engaging more with the class. \r\nThis course covers an immense amount of information and Tolga does a very nice job of organizing the class to make sense in a sort of cumulative order. \r\nThe vocabulary terms for each chapter could be better emphasized and taught through the lessons, rather than trying to make sense of some new vocabulary words at the end of the section of chapters for the midterm and final.",
                "I think that this course was extremely enjoyable and allowed me to learn both the detailed aspects of certain concepts in Microeconomics as well as the broader societal applications.",
                "The strengths of this course is that Tolga is very clear in his expectations, is very funny, and provides office hours. A potential weakness is that there are a limited number of exercises for practice.",
                "The course is good depending on how engaged you are with the content. You need to do the necessary to immerse yourself into the course content outside of class. The course as \"introductory\" may be a bit misleading as it does go quite fast and take you quite far in covering the basics of microeconomics.",
                "It was entertaining which was a strength because it kept everyone engaged in the concepts. I think it could be improved by having more PSETs, even if that means smaller but more frequent ones.",
                "I believe if you have a short attention span and enjoy Tolga's teaching class, the class is definitely very beneficial. It is also very focused and you can ask questions unlike in bigger lectures.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you lose focus or dont understand something, the class moves so fast paced that you could get left behind.",
                "Tolga's lectures are very good, if a bit fast. He always provides examples for every concept and he makes it clear that understanding application is essential to understanding economic theory. However, lectures are not available online (complications with copyright??) and he also does not post lecture notes, so you have to be very attentive during class & read the textbook. I wish psets counted for more (4 psets worth 40 pts total, midterm & final worth 160 pts total).",
                "Not a fan of the grading curve, making people sweat over a course that is relatively not that intellectually engaging\/challenging\/interesting.",
                "Strengths: Tolga is incredibly engaging, always offering examples so that we can better understand principles and their applications.\r\nWeaknesses: Tests account for the majority of your grade"

                "I would. I believe that this course set the foundation for my future economic learning well.",
                "Yes, if you are interested in intro econ I think this is a good starting point but be aware that the curve is much harsher than in the lecture course which makes it more difficult. The material Tolga focuses on is also slightly different than ECON 115 and other intro econ professors.",
                "Yes, I would most certainly recommend this course to any student. If they are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to be taught by Tolga Koker, they should absolutely take it. Tolga makes the class what it is.",
                "Yes, I definitely would because this course allows you to learn Microeconomics in a smaller setting and ask questions along the way during lectures. In addition, the smaller setting allows for group discussion and collaboration.",
                "Yes, Tolga is the best economics professor I could have wished for! I am so sad that he does not teach more advanced courses because I would love to have him again.",
                "I think anyone who hasn't done economics in high school may struggle with economic line of thought in the beginning. Most people in the class have taken economics before, so in consideration of the curve I would suggest taking 115 instead. Similarly, if you have a weak math background, I would suggest taking 108. Otherwise, I would recommend this course.",
                "Yes, because the smaller setting allowed for more questions to be asked and Tolga was a very good professor.",
                "Yes, I will. It covers everything you need to know about introductory microeconomics and I would say its dependent on the teaching style you prefer. If you like smaller classes, go for it!",
                "Yes; you learn essential concepts & Tolga is a fun guy.",
                "Yes absolutely! Tolga is a great professor. He always offers related stories or examples to help you understand the importance of what you are learning and its implications"
