   "comments": [
    "I was able to practice a wide variety of writing in this class. I read a lot of scholarly essays and gained practice discussing them in a seminar.",
    "English 114 was valuable in that it helped me transition from high school writing to college writing. I learned the value of word choice, structure, and developed my own writers voice.",
    "I learned how to use the lens of ideas and writings to analyze seemingly disparate parts of society. I enjoyed the in class discussions!",
    "Throughout the course, I learned about baseballs omnipresent influence in not just American society, but the world. I learned how to read a variety of mediums, including academic journal articles of all types. Lastly, through the four papers, I developed writing skills by responding to new types of prompts.",
    "I developed better writing skills and critical thinking skills as a result of this class. I learned to better formulate thesis statements or claims in my essays.",
    "Learned how to write an academic essay using sources. Learned how to many different types of academic writing including a research paper, close reading analysis, and prose essay.",
    "I learned how to write college essays. I also learned how to take a reading or prompt and develop a strong thesis supported with evidence.",
    "I learned how to analyze writing and formulate my own creative writing voice. All of the readings were interesting and allowed me to notice other writing styles that I used to compliment my own style."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings tended to be engaging, especially because most people in the class were interested in baseball. The class was not stressful. As for weaknesses, discussions were very unstructured and often dragged as a result.",
    "I feel as if the class worked less on my writing abilities and instead focused a lot on reading and response. While this is valuable, I felt more time could have been spent on improving writing during class. Other than that, the class was very well taught.",
    "Strengths:\r\nDiscussions\r\nProfessor\r\nBaseball!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nLess focused on content, more focused on format in papers",
    "Overall, I think the syllabus was very strong. If it were to be improved, I would extend the fourth unit (cultural critique) and cut down a couple of the academic papers we read in the third unit. I also wish we had watched at least one more baseball film and somehow incorporated the World Series that happened during our class. I think an interesting exercise would be to do creative writing at the beginning of some classes based off of a given baseball clip\/highlight.",
    "Strengths: discussions very prevalent; very engaging; professor always had valuable feedback for papers. Weaknesses: only few office hours, but they were very helpful",
    "very good course for learning how to write at a college level.",
    "The class time was not related to the essays we were writing, so going to class at times seemed pointless. The course did help develop my writing because there was constant feedback from our professor.",
    "I found no weaknesses in this course, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved all of the readings and found all of the learning material interesting and interconnected. It was an awesome class."

   "comments": [
    "This course is not all that intellectually stimulating and class could be quite dry some days. However, if you're looking for a non-stressful course and you like baseball, it could be a class worth taking. Also, you get a lot of practice writing, as well as frequent and clear feedback.",
    "I feel this course is very valuable to any first year who does not excel in writing. I also found the topic very interesting and would suggest it for any sports lovers.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to work on the fundamentals of writing and is interested in baseball!",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the intersection of sports and society AND are looking for a writing credit. However, given the introductory nature of the class, I think you could probably find a more comprehensive class about the history\/influence of sport.",
    "Yes! Professor Reider is excellent, very understanding, and caring for each student!",
    "Yes, if you need a writing credit and enjoy baseball this course was very fun to be a part of. Dr. Reider had a great course plan and was amazing with giving feedback on writing.",
    "I would recommend this course because of the consistent feedback I received on my writing. This feedback helped me develop my writing skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even though this English 114 course is related to baseball, anyone can take it and enjoy the content. Obviously, if you have a baseball background and can connect personally to the course it would be a positive, but everyone can find enjoyment in this course."
