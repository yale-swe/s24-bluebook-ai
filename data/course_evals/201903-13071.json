    "I greatly improved my French written and speaking skills. I hadn't taken French in a year, so I felt really behind coming into the class. With Mme Skorupa's amazing teaching and help, I was able to refresh the French I had already learned and get to where I feel confident going into L3.",
    "I learned more about the fundamentals of french grammar and speaking.",
    "I believe I grew immensely in my reading, writing, and speaking French skills throughout this semester. This course was very helpful for strengthening my foundational French knowledge while still introducing me to new vocabulary and culture.",
    "I studied French for years prior to college, yet I still managed to learn more in one semesters than 6 years in public school. This is a great high-intensity course; Skorupa is challenging but an amazing professor and she provides lots of resources to study and revise material. My French reading and listening comprehension has largely improved but most significantly this course nails home grammar study.",
    "Solid basic understanding of all areas of the French language. Ability to read and speak French comfortably with friends and family members .",
    "I learned french grammar, pronunciation, and culture in great detail.",
    "I learned how to rigorously take French, and apply new vocabulary and grammar each and every day."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: Mme. Skorupa made the class very enjoyable and extremely interactive, the variety of homework assignments help improve all aspects of your French skills (speaking, vocabulary, grammar, reading, etc), overall the immersive experience is a great way to learn French; weaknesses: the homework assignments take a long time to do because you have to listen to all of the audio clips and you can't skip past them",
    "I thought this course was very engaging and informative!",
    "Strengths:\r\n- great activities and exercises to keep students engaged and challenged\r\n- loved the daily speaking and listening exercises\r\n- so well organized\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- the time :(\r\n- workload felt unnecessary at some points \r\n- corrections on my compositions didn't always leave me feeling like I understood what I was doing wrong\/why I had to change my original words",
    "Strengths: enjoyable! lovely professor, organized material, ample resources, overall effective in teaching the language\r\nWeaknesses: difficult, heavy daily workload, frequent exams",
    "This course was very well organized, and although very involved and difficult at times, it was effective in getting my French to another level. The group dynamic of the class was incredible and Mme. Skorupa is an amazing teacher.",
    "It is a great course that teaches a lot about the French language.",
    "The strength of this course is how often it isit truly allows the student to become immersed in the French language. The weakness of this course is the homeworksome of it could be perceived as busy work."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I had such a fun time in this class. Although the workload may seem daunting at first, you learn how to manage it pretty quickly and it becomes routine. Mme. Skorupa is so helpful and does an amazing job of providing the immersive learning experience. She also really cares about her students.",
    "I absolutely would, I feel like I learned a lot about french and have seen tangible improvement in my abilities throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, this course was a perfect way to test and challenge my basic French skills and reinforce years of mediocre high school language classes. Take this class if you want to feel assured in speaking moderate French even outside of class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. This course may be the most intensive French level because it really nails in grammar. However, if you put in the work you will significantly improve your French. It's admittedly quite difficult and will suck up the majority of your time if you are not already somehow magically gifted in language learning. I would recommend if your course load already has one or two high workloads, to take this course at a later time when your work load will be lighter.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a student who cares about learning french enough to make the time commitment. I think learning a language is one of the most valuable skills, but it does require a significant allotment of time and a willingness (with this class at least) to proceed to take the following L3 and L4 classes to become proficient in the language. This class, however, will make you want to keep learning French!",
    "I would because I have learned better French in one course then I have in seven years.",
    "I would recommend to a student who was serious about learning French."
