                "This course helped me to understand the major similarities and differences between thinkers whose works were monumental in the intersection of morality and politics. It was also conducive to forming a more-nuanced perspective on the historical development of morally motivated political violence.",

                "I learned how to think about topics of morality in the realm of politics. I learned about distinctions between morality and expediency, and how to begin to think about violences role in politics. I also, in a broader sense, learned how to pick out key parts of texts and developed my skills discussing complex texts with my seminar.",

Studied a variety of thinkers with different perspectives on the role of violence in politics, civil disobedience, and utopian thinking. Class discussions allowed us to supplement our own readings of the text with the perspectives and takeaways of our classmates and professor.",

                "Strengths: Prof. Kapustins passion and enthusiasm when lecturinghe provides context to each reading prior to discussion which is helpful! Discussion is also centered on questions he asked based on readings, which checks comprehension. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings are often heavy.",
                "This class had fantastic discussions, it did not feel like we were just regurgitating the readings. The readings were also very interesting, especially for the first half of class. One weakness of this course is that it only has 2 assignments, so the stakes were very high for those.",
                "The course's biggest strength is its professor. Professor Kapustin is an incredible teacher: passionate, knowledgeable beyond belief, and deeply caring. His insight and intellectual curiosity bring such life to the classroom. The readings are hard, but Prof. Kapustin helps you work through them. I left every seminar feeling like I had actually learned something about what we had read.",
                "One strength of this course was the way in which Prof. Kapustin facilitated course discussions. He was always highly respectful of students' contributions and managed to keep discussions highly organized. The only aspect which I would suggest is perhaps a weakness is that it sometimes felt two course discussions should be allotted to a single thinker. This is by no means Prof. Kapustin's fault, as it was mostly driven by the fact that the students found themselves more compelled by some thinkers than others, and there is no way to sufficiently gauge students' interest in particular thinkers prior to that specific class. All in all, this seminar was rigorous, compelling, respectful, and engaging.",
                "Lots of reading but it was all interesting",
                "Strengths: a wonderful professor and engaging seminar environment. One that made you desire to be engaged. Well curated readings. Very organized discussions and a schedule that stuck right to the syllabus. Wonderful feedback from writing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the only one I can think of is that the room was too small. One person was always forced to sit away from the table.",
                "Strengths: the readings are great and they are not too long, Professor Kapustin does a great job of giving an introduction to the discussion, providing relevant background on the readings, asking good questions, and really giving students the room to share what they think.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would maybe suggest adding questions\/points that students should think about before doing the readings. This can be posed as questions at the end of the previous class or written on the syllabus.",

                "Yes! Prof. Kapustin is such a great and passionate lecturer who teaches the fundamentals.",
                "Yes, I would. I am not very comfortable with political philosophy but I still enjoyed it and learned a lot.",
                "I would absolutely recommend it to any EP&E students. If you are not an EP&E major, you would do yourself a great service to take a class with Professor Kapustin anyway, but probably his other ones are better suited. A fair warning: I would not recommend the course to first year students or maybe sophomores especially if you have not had experience with harder readings. You will get so much more out of the class if you have taken a philosophy or other introductory classics class before it.",
                "If you are interested in learning more about the application of morality to politics, then this course provides a prime opportunity to do so. It also helped become a better reader and writer, and I am confident that it may have this effect on others too.",
                "Yes. This class is one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I have taken at Yale so far. Professor Kapustin is amazinghe is passionate, knowledgable, and extremely adept at asking good questions to steer class discussion. I loved talking to him, and the selected readings were excellent as well. I got to read authors like Fanon, Gueverra, Gandhi, and much more who normally I would've never read, but found their political philosophy interesting and worth thinking about. Overall, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Even since I couldn't do most of the readings for one class, I left every class fascinated and intellectually fulfilled.",
                "Yes!",

                "Definitely. Professor Kapustin is fantastic and truly passionate about what he teaches. The readings are interesting as are the class discussions.",
