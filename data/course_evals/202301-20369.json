Professor Griffel has an image and plan for the entire semester and then carefully executes it to give his students an actual experience of building up knowledge and connecting dots. (in this way, definitely on the more structured side, so might want to consider if that's your thing). He gives a lot of personal feedback and has open office hours and is always happy to chat."
