                "I learned what makes creative writing good on a craft level, which is something new to me. In depth analysis of essays helped me understand what techniques are used in the best literary pieces.",
                "I learned so much: how to talk about writing, write and edit quickly, and cultivate a unique voice. I feel now that my ideas and identity can be important to other people if I write about them well; I feel empowered. I was exposed to so many styles and genres of writing that I loved (and some that I did not, which was just as informative). The class was also so fun. I looked forward to discussing readings every week. Pam created such a great class dynamic while still covering material. I love the people I met in Engl 120 and consider them friends as well as classmates.",

                "I developed the ability to critically view texts as a combination of specific writing techniques and tactics. Identifying these in class discussions allowed me to experiment more with my own writing and authorial voice. Before this course, I viewed writing as more of an organic, intuitive process; while this is important, I learned that some of the most natural-sounding writing is extremely intentioned and strategically presented to the reader. On a very specific level, I was also pushed to become more clear with my writing, ensuring that every word was serving its intended purpose."

I appreciated the ability to skip one of the five essays this made a big difference in the workload of the class and gave me a bit more autonomy. I cannot currently think of any improvements.",
                "I think this course is great -- it's just the right amount of work without being overwhelming. Super reasonable and nice to be able to pick one essay to skip when the semester gets busy. Also you get feedback on every essay which is so helpful for improving.",
                "I really enjoyed the \"rough\" drafts that we turned in before our essays, so we had an idea of where we were and what we could improve on so that our final draft was better.",
                "There are few things I would change about this class. The pace of essays was daunting at first (I am a first year), but they really are paced well and for your benefit. You'll learn how to produce writing that you're proud of with a limited amount of time. Not ever essay was a masterpiece when I submitted it, but that was ok, because Pam's feedback was helpful and unjudgmental.",
                "I overall loved the assignments and the readings. The lectures were interactive and immensely helpful for my writing.",
                "While every part of this class was strong, I believe that its largest assets are the assigned readings and writing feedback. I took a very reading and writing intensive course load and completing the readings for this class never felt like work. Every essay was engaging in both content and form, offering new insights into writing choices. In class discussions, we were able to further explore why each essay works and how we could add the featured tactics to our writing toolbox. This critical approach to professional, published pieces was also applied to our essays: while Professor Newton gave very clear and thorough feedback on every essay, we each had the opportunity to have one essay workshopped by the entire class."

The readings are fascinating and intellectually stimulated, the format of small seminar discussions is wonderful and you get to build a tight community with your class, and the feedback received on essays is super helpful in developing your writing skills.",

                "Yes! Please please take this class. It's like no other course in it's breadth of style and genre and depth of learning and feedback. And please take it with Pam. I had experience with another very highly-rated English 120 teacher, and they did not even compare to Pam. She's warm, supportive, funny, and experienced.",
                "Absolutely! I think it is a great first step for those hoping to improve and refine their writing.",
                "I would definitely recommend it, and especially with Professor Newton! This course pushed me to become a better writer in ways that I had not before encountered. Professor Newton is incredibly kind and considerate, encouraging you to expand your writing skills while also maintaining high expectations. It is clear that she genuinely cares about the students and is always willing to help through office hours. The readings are always interesting/fun and you develop your writing in many different essay genres. Even if you are not interested in the humanities/English as a major, I genuinely think that the writing skills developed in this class are unmatched. The course does an amazing job of fusing creativity and functionality in a way that is applicable to any field."
