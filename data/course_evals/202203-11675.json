                "You read and learn about a lot of different environmental economic papers, and in the later half of the course go through more international environmental papers. It is a lot of reading and developing or learning models various authors used and then trying to create conclusions or takeaways from their models.",
                "I learned about a variety of topics at the intersection of international policy, trade, and the environment. I also developed skills in reading economic publications and performing my own research.",
                "Learned about resource consumption, sustainability, trade policy, public goods, climate clubs, and econometric evaluation techniques to understand the effects of pollution and policy",
                "This class walked us through an interesting mix of environmental and climate-policy economics papers. We got very in the weeds on some (one about the explosion in buffalo-hide hunting in the late 1800s and another about unilateral country carbon policies at the end of the course). The class focused on breaking down how these economist authors created models to analyze environment\/climate issues. Improved intuition around what it means to form an economic model to investigate a real-life question and refreshed a lot of intermediate micro and macro (and some econometric) concepts that popped up in the papers. Also improved some Excel modeling skills based on problem sets. I dont know if I have clear, big takeaways from the course, the class was really about the details of papers."

                "The course was interesting but definitely very specific. More clarity on the psets would be helpful: I found them interesting and engaging as you get to work with and play with the models from various papers, but I think they would have been more effective if the psets had been more formalized.",
                "This is exactly the kind of course I was looking for in a senior seminar -- it builds upon knowledge from other courses in a subfield of economics that is really interesting to me without a heavy workload. I do wish we had a bit more guidance on the final project; while it was open-ended, I had never performed original economic research before and felt a bit lost completing it.",
                "Strengths: Koetum did a great job processing and walking through complicated papers which allowed me to be better at reading economics papers. The material was also very interesting and taught at a very good pace\r\n\r\nWeakness: honestly didn't really have any complaints. Would have maybe liked more opportunities for student involvement",
                "Strengths: Interesting range and variety of papers discussed in class; I thought Professor Kortum was very good at walking us through papers on the board and breaking down complicated concepts. Very good explanations; enjoyed doing the final paper and felt like a good, relatively low-stakes way to explore an economic idea I was curious about. Weaknesses: It was the first time Professor Kortum was teaching the course, and while he was very good at breaking down papers and helping us through them during lectures, I think the class might benefit from a clearer overall structure\/more context in between papers in the future  more big picture to help us understand the papers and how\/whether they fit together. There were definitely themes and topics that recurred, but I thought the overall road map for the course could have been clearer. We also didnt get feedback on the second two problem sets."

                "If you're very interested in the topics yes. Look through the papers you will discuss in class and see if they sound interesting; if so go for it, but if not do not take the course. It is a great way to get into the literature on environmental economics from someone who knows the topic well and clearly, is very intelligent, and cares a lot, but if you're initially interested in environmental economics and models and want to create theory-based models to examine these issues you will not enjoy the class.",
                "Yes! We only had three problem sets (which he gave everyone As on if you corrected mistakes) and a 6-page final paper, and got to read and dissect some really interesting papers on a bunch international environmental topics, from palm oil to buffalo.",
                "Absolutely. I took five senior seminars and this was the best. Sustainability is such an important topic, but also the most interesting because dealing with public goods is so challenging. In this course you learn game theory, trade policy, econometrics, and more that made this course so informative and fun",
                "Yes, I thought the class was solid, covered interesting & relevant issues, and I was very impressed with Professor Kortums ability to structure lectures and take us inside the economic papers on our syllabus. Youll get out as much as you put in. Especially in the second half of the course once problem sets are done and we start thinking about final papers, theres no penalty for not understanding or being totally lost in class when we talk about papers. Some of the papers are super difficult, so I was happy that removed some stress from class but it also diminished the reward. Occasionally something big would click and I felt like I was following along well and making connections with past courses and other papers (there was one paper where we essentially were talking about intermediate micro, intermediate macro, and econometrics all at once and that was cool to see them in action together), but occasionally I felt sort of confused\/resigned too. If you have some environmental or climate idea youre interested in exploring in an econ paper, this class gives you great opportunity to write an open-ended paper, find your own data if you want, and that can be a cool process."
