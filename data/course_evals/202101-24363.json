The course included a diverse range of assignments, including making a video on a new form of clean energy technology, writing a speech for the CEO of a company on their climate footprint mitigation efforts, and a simulation of an international climate negotiation.

Classtime itself is more lecture-oriented with small pockets of student discussion. The professor has a lot of experience himself and brings in guest speakers almost every week, making each class unique and full of information.",

The class was timed well and the visiting guests fit perfectly. One way that the class could improve is to increase the amount of student to student discussion and debate to make use of the wide perspectives and experiences of students.",

                "Strengths: Great speakers from the IEA and also a very well-structured curriculum. I liked the weekly updates that Professor Simons gave and also the transparency in midterm report and upcoming assignments.\r\nWeaknesses: most readings were not necessarily referenced in class. I wish the breakout room - small group discussion was replicated in the in-person setting because that was really nice.",
