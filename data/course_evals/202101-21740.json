They are very good at guiding people to their strengths and making painters more confident. They also give helpful feedback. Also, the classroom atmosphere was very welcoming and encouraging.\r\nWeakness: Perhaps the class could be even better if it were in person.",
                "This course was great because it gave students time to get comfortable with oil paint. The projects were great because there was a lot of variety. The course was challenging to complete from my dorm room because oil paint smells and is messy. Additionally, I would be interested in a painting course that explored watercolor and acrylic as well. Having only oil as the medium did allow a lot of time to practice with it, which is great.",

                "This course is difficult to teach over zoom, but I thought considering that it was very successful. I am grateful for the long time allotted for the final project and the feedback Matt  provided throughout the course. The one suggestion I have would be to start with the still life project as a monochrome and then do the collage assignment."

Painting in my small room in Trumbull was very difficult and I had to have the window opened due to the toxic fumes of oil painting. I am not sure why science students were granted access to labs but art students did not have access to any studio space or resources such as easels or basin sinks."

Matt and Kate made all of us non-art-majors feel super comfortable from the get-go, and I was shocked by how much my painting skills improved over time. I also didn't realize how important it would be for me to have a creative outlet every week, and I wish I'd taken it sooner!",
