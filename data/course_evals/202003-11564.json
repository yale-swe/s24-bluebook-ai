Because the rough drafts were due after the first week, I was given a lot of time to revise and change my essay for the second week. Aside from this, my grammar was improved significantly by reading the works of famous authors and their essays.",

                "Professor Deli was an absolute delight to take English 120 with.  She is extremely friendly and made a thorough effort to get to know each of us personally.  While it is generally hard to get anything above an A- in the class, Professor Deli was fair and transparent with grading as well. The course itself was structured quite nicely. We covered four units, each pertaining to a particular type of creative nonfiction essay. One of the strengths of the class was being able to workshop our peers' essays. This allowed for us to have plenty of feedback when writing our own essays, and led to some very thought-provoking classes. \r\n\r\nWhile we did engage with some very interesting readings, it often felt like our discussions were a bit tangential, and did not address how we could implement the writing techniques used in these readings. It would have been helpful to spend more time discussing principles of writing, as I felt that our engagement with the assigned readings was a bit disjointed from the writing we did.",
                "The strengths of this course are that there is a lot of room to improve your essay writing. My professor gave me many opportunities to improve. Another strength is that my professor was willing to meet with me outside of the class times in a 1 on 1 session. These sessions gave me a lot of help because I was able to ask her questions the essays, the reading material, and the in-class discussions.",
                "The strengths included the open discussion and the fact that there were not pre-planned questions. This allowed the discussion to focus on those points which the students and professor found to be most useful. I do not believe there to be any weaknesses of it."

This class allows for students to exercise writing skills that most English classes do not spend time developing. While it can be a bit challenging at first, especially for students accustomed to academic writing, I did significantly improve in my ability to write creative nonfiction essays. The course workload is evenly distributed throughout the semester, which is quite nice during finals period.",

The professor is very kind and the material that I learnt was very interesting. Most importantly, I became a much better writer which was one of my major goals for the course in the beginning of the year.",
