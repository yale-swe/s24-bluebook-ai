We also learned how to pin insects, how to spread the wings of butterflies and similar insects, and how to store and label insect collections.",
                "Bugs are AMAZING!!\r\nI learned how to build a collection (including specimen capture, identification, and display)\r\nI also learned a lot about the amazing diversity of the arthropod world (memorizing families, orders, etc.)",

Each week we touch on a specific group (e.g. Hymenoptera) and go through the various subdivisions of the group, how to identify each, how to catch each, etc. You also learn skills in collecting and preserving arthropods.",

                "This course was fantastic. The collecting trips for insects were a great strength, and I wish we could have done more of them. Time spent in lab pinning and organizing insects was also really nice and relaxing. The only weak part was the weekly quizzes, which frequently caused us to memorize frantically the names of families in Latin. I understand why they were necessary but it sometimes felt as if we were learning things that we would just forget again because the volume of taxonomic information was so high.",
                "A strength is that Haysun, Petra, and Dr. Wells are all very supportive and enthusiasticit was a joy to spend time with them. Another strength was that a good community was built among the students. \r\nPerhaps a weakness of the course would be that much of the work was in the final 2 weeks. If there were intermediate deadlines with the collections, or even guidelines (ex. have _____ specimens ID'd by ____ date), that would be helpful.\r\nAlso, I wonder if there could be an option to take pictures of the specimens and ID those so that we didn't have to kill them? That is something I meant to ask but had forgotten (that is my bad).",
                "This is a wonderful course all around. The field trips at the beginning of the semester were amazing for providing a sense of community within the class which carried forward for the rest of the semester. Some of the people I met in this class have become some of my best friends over just one semester. Dr. Wells and the TFs were amazing and very passionate, and they made it clear that they cared about your learning, answering any question with respect and care. The class was a lot of work for half a credit, but I think that thats more of a problem with Yales lab policy than it is with the course itself, because I honestly wouldnt change anything about the course. While the first of the weekly quizzes caught me off guard, after that I felt that they were a good way to keep me in practice, and helped me learn to study more effectively. I wouldnt change much of anything about the lab- it was easily my favorite class this semester, and perhaps my favorite class at Yale so far.",
                "It would be more ideal to know something about what you need to catch before having to catch them (all the collecting is at the beginning of the semester before you know anything), but I realize that's a limitation of seasonality. Otherwise, helping us to spread the workload through the semester could be helpful. It kinda felt like we collected, then there was a pause in work intensity before we ground out the end of the semester. Just helping guide workload could be useful.",
                "Strengths: wonderful professor and TAs, wonderful lab community, wonderful field trips across CT (and hopefully Florida next year), wonderful project (bug collection, identified and labeled). Not a weakness, but do note that you 100% should take stock of the classes' requirements: demanding criteria of collection, weekly memorization (ID) quizzes (not that bad if you study), frequent field trips.",
                "Strengths: Professor Wells and the TA's, particularly Petra. They were heavily involved in the course at all times, so we worked very closely with them! The camping trips/bug-catching trips were also incredible-- it was my first time going to such places so this was an amazing experience. \r\nWeaknesses: The workload was heavily concentrated towards the end of the semester-- my friends and I would oftentimes stay in the lab into very late hours to finish up our bug collection, even though we had also put extra hours in the weekends throughout the semester."

                "This was an amazing course. Even though the time commitment was incredibly high for a lab, it was a relaxed learning environment so I never felt overly stressed. That being said, don't take the course if you have a heavy courseload since it will occupy much of your time.",
                "I absolutely recommend this course! It was fantastic and one of the best courses I've taken. The field trips for collecting insects were incredible and the class ended up forming a really close community. The professors and TA were great. This course is a lot of work for a lab, and you should be prepared to come in on non-lab days and weekends to work on your insect collections, particularly towards the end of the semester. However, the subject material was really cool and if you even remotely like insects or spiders this class would be great for you.",
                "Yes! It opened my eyes to the world of bugs!",
                "This is an amazing course. Youll laugh, youll cry, youll grow, youll spend late nights in the lab, youll be amazed by Dr. Wells. It is a lot of work- I didnt really know how much work it would be. If you have the time in your semester, this is 100% worth it. Especially towards the end of the semester, youll spend a lot of time in the lab, but it becomes very fun and relaxing pinning bugs.",
                "If you're interested in the material. The course is a lot of work, and you're expected to come in and spent many hours working on the collection outside of class. The weekly quizzes can be kinda intense and require a good amount of studying throughout each week. But, it's an interesting class and developing a collection is really rewarding.",
                "If you are ready to bend your jointed legs, spread your veined wings, fully open wide your compound eyes, stridulate your textured hind muscles in excitement, and finally spring your whole exoskeleton into the beautifully complex world of bugs... then WHAT THE WEEVIL ARE YOU WAITING, FOR THE LOVE OF MIDGES!!!! This class is so wonderful, it should be a requirement for every Family Studentidae in the Order Yaleoptera. Poor jokes aside, please take this class. There are no risks in taking this class, yet do note that you turn into a bug upon its conclusion. Metamorphosis isn't so bad, though.",
                "YES, this is an amazing, once-in-a-lifetime class. I define a good class by how much my worldview changes due to the class-- this was an excellent class. I will never look at the world in the same way again (or, at least, I hope I won't!), there is so much untapped beauty and intricacy I had not seen before. Because it is a small class with a lot of collaboration, our lab class also got very close to one another, so I gained 12 new amazing friends from taking this course!"
