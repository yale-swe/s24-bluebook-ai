                "Strengths: amazing professor with a significant presence in her research field. It was an amazing opportunity to be her student as only a first-year. Her online lectures were detailed and highly informational. Not to mention, the course was designed to promote student learning as opposed to just getting a good grade.",
                "I really appreciated the amount of time given to ask questions and the fact that no prior knowledge of astronomy or advanced math/science was required to understand the course material. However, I didn't feel that we were always given full freedom to discuss the more interesting topics of the course during class time, since our synchronous meetings were heavily structured most of the time. I was also unsure of the exact expectations for our writing assignments a lot of the time, so I think it would be helpful to clarify the style and length of writing expected for the blog posts.",
                "One top Strength is Dr. Fischer and their extraordinary experience, passion, and knowledge (and willingness to share that). In addition, Dr. Fischer has been very thoughtful and mindful on how they organized each week's lectures, resources, and reading materials.\r\nAnother Strength is the course material itself. Throughout this course, I learned so much about the universe and its history, and the ongoing search for signs of life on other planets or other solar systems (coming from one of the astronomers who discovered the first multi-planet system of exoplanets)!\r\nSince this course is fascinating, engaging, and challenging, the only suggestion I can think of is having a little fewer non-lecture videos to watch each week (which might allow for deeper discussion)."

                "Yes! Professor Fischer did such an amazing job focusing on both her STEM and non STEM major students. Its very accessible to all. Not to mention, being the student of a highly regarded researcher was an amazing opportunity.",
                "I would recommend it if you're very interested in astronomy and the possibility of extraterrestrial life, because it does explore those topics thoroughly and give a good understanding of them. The course does have a relatively heavy workload, with weekly recorded lectures, synchronous seminar meetings, weekly readings, quizzes, blog posts (essays), and problem sets, so you should go into the course aware of this. It's a solid science credit that genuinely taught me a lot about astronomy without too much hard science, and there is a lot of writing instead of much math.",
                "Definitely! If you want to understand more about the universe and its history, and the ongoing search for signs of life on other planets or other solar systems (while also improving your writing and learning to think like a scientist), then I'd take this course!"
