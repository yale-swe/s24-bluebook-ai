                "This has been one of the best courses Ive taken at Yale. It completely changed my perspective of what I understood to be trafficking. Ive learned the importance of understanding the issue through a public health perspective and implement a trauma-informed approach. We had incredible guest speakers that taught us about their experiences, perspectives and work. It was a very intellectually enriching experience.",
                "By taking this course I was able to have a deeper understanding of the human trafficking field. It was able to give me a holistic view of what the field is like.",
                "This class is probably the most eye-opening class I've taken at Yale. I've managed to clear up all of my misconceptions about what human trafficking looks like and I've learned about why misconceptions continue to be perpetuated. Not only did we learn about the public health aspect of human trafficking, but we also learned to look at it from different angles, like a criminal justice lens, law enforcement, community lens, immigration lens, human rights lens, and so much more. I also really enjoyed the infographic assignment! It taught me how to be mindful about research that has been done in the field since it's not always reliable.",
                "If you think you know about human trafficking, chances are you don't. I learned so, so much about how the common perceptions of human trafficking are often misleading and leave many vulnerable groups without support or protection. The sub-topic of the course about how immigration status and culture impact trafficking scenarios was particularly fascinating. The course encourages you to constantly question the veracity of the sources you're reading and think critically about societal institutions and assumptions.",
                "This class was incredibly insightful in terms of understanding human trafficking beyond a criminal justice standpoint, which is a perspective I find most people have, making the subject incredibly misunderstood.",
                "We learned about the nuances, the systematic issues, and the vulnerabilities that occur that allow for human trafficking to occur. Through our discussions and readings, we were always better able to understand what to look at and factors to consider that would cause exploitation or for greater inequity. We learned about the many forms of human trafficking and how they can occur. We also also learned to look at human trafficking through a human-rights approach and through multiple different lenses (ie. criminal justice approach and public health approach).",
                "This course was very useful in reforming the way I thought about human trafficking. The class is a journey of defamiliarization with stereotypes surrounding the topic. I was able to learn a lot about how the criminal justice system handles cases, as well as the current movement in the public health sector that is innovating new strategies to help victims reinstate themselves into society.",

            "comments": [
                "Strengths: readings were interesting, a lot of engaging material, meaningful discussions during class. Dra. Torres listened to us and helped us learn in different ways.  The midterm and the final assignments where manageable and very insightful. The bi-weekly reflections were helpful to  ask questions and have interesting conversations with the classmates.",
                "This course was designed by the learning styles of the students which was amazing and created an enjoyable work environment.",
                "Strengths: There were different opportunities presented to be involved with human trafficking work because Dr. Torres connected us with so many speakers. I also really enjoyed all the lectures and liked how classes were structured so we would discuss the readings and delve deeper into everything. Dr. Torres is also an extremely understanding professor and easy to talk to. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were repetitive of each other, but this makes considering that the research in human trafficking isn't extensive and they all use similar data.",
                "The course was super accommodating to people who don't know much about human trafficking and set up a good theoretical framework before we got into specifics. There were a good amount of videos to supplement the readings so that the information was easier to digest. I think sometimes there was almost too much theoretical framework and not enough tangible examples, but I definitely get why Dra. Torres prioritizes the theory as it is super important to how policy is implemented. Because of the subject, the course can feel a little heavy emotionally, but Dra. Torres does a good job of keeping it light.",
                "The strengths of this course were that the seminar consisted both of presentations and seminar discussion, which I found made it easier to have fulfilling academic conversations in class.",
                "I truly felt as if the class was structured very well and designed to engage and facilitate the best student learning. The strength is 100% Dra Torres and how genuinely caring she was toward the whole class. I liked how she approached the class with the point of learning, and not long and hard assignments. If we felt that there were any weaknesses (which there wasn't any), we were allowed to voice them in class and she would actively try to address our concern.",
                "I truly do not see any weaknesses in the course. At the beginning of the semester, we were paired into small groups of three, and every two weeks we would discuss the texts and the class so far and turn in response papers. I think this was very helpful and kept us engaged with the course because we knew we had to have deeper discussions about the texts. I also really liked that we had guest speakers who are working in the field.",
                "The workload of the course was great, I never felt overwhelmed by the work or even the class time since it was longer than most others."

It felt like a brave space to speak up and share our points of view. I enjoyed every minute of this class.",
                "I would 100% recommend this class to another student and wish this class could be offered again. If you are interested in human rights, learning about the human trafficking field, or anything along those line this is the perfect course to start with. This is a class I wish I could take over and over again.",
                "If this class were to be offered again, I would hands down recommend this course. Dr. Torres is such a sweetheart and really cares about her kids. She gave us candy every day and even gave us a gift at the end of the course. This is one of those classes that you'll still remember after you graduate from Yale.",
                "I would absolutely recommend this class to everyone. Human trafficking is extremely prevalent in our lives, yet it is something that is often forgotten as it is a hidden crime.",
                "Yes, 100! Dra Torres is truly amazing and I would take any class taught by her. Additionally, the topic of human trafficking should be made much more well-known, as there is so much misguided and misinformed information out there. Human trafficking is also quite prevalent and people should be more aware of how to recognize and help.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is such a niche subject and the only class at Yale of its kind.",
                "I would recommend this class because of the many takeaways I received in both the subject and class as a whole."
