                "Strengths: often ended early, experiments were kind of fun and definitely interesting, there was a decent variety in the experiments done, trust in the students to do the lab; Weaknesses: somewhat disorganized toward the end of the course (quizzes not being published or no lab report rubrics), instructions were sometimes unclear",
                "Strengths: The content and course was very straightforward. Everything was laid out neatly to learn and come prepared. Also, Dr. Hartman and the TFs were always there to help.",
                "I thought this was a really cool lab overall and I have no weaknesses for it.",
                "The course is extremely well-constructed and taught. We covered a lot of ground over the semester, and the lab sessions were very fun and engaging.",
                "Strength: The course and material was awesome and presented in a great and engaging way. Allowing students to pick their own bacteria to investigate was awesome.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish there was more emphasis on reading the pre-lab. The quizzes allow you to skim it but I feel as though the pre-lab gets skipped."

                "Yes, it was a relatively easygoing lab",
                "Yeah. It was a good lab course that was not too stressful or workload heavy. There were only one or two labs that ran a little overtime. The experiments are pretty fun and Professor Hartman is a great professor. Maybe not the best first biology lab course though since knowing how to perform certain techniques (quickly) is sometimes assumed.",
                "Yes! Very chill lab course especially if taken with Dr. Hartman.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you are also taking the Microbiology lecture. I liked this lab a lot and although we had minor problems occasionally (e.g. the bacteria did not grow properly on one occasion) we still did a lot of fun stuff.",
                "Professor Hartman is one of the best professors in the MCDB department and at Yale. She is not only passionate and knowledgeable about the subject matter, but she is genuinely invested in her students' success and well-being (which, sadly, is not always true of STEM professors in my experience here and many students' experience unfortunately). It was very telling in speaking with classmates that the sentiment would be, \"is this class actually real?\" because we were all so used to the other STEM classes as unrelenting and unforgiving--and overall just not very conducive to learning. The way the lab was structured really made it possible for us to learn the techniques and the concepts instead of just having a long checklist of things we needed to get done, which we then has to painstakingly rehash into lab reports, exams, and/or quizzes. There are some really effective pedagogical practices at play here, and it has been a wonderful experience to be able to take this course and learn from Professor Hartman. We can really tell how much effort and time she puts into the lab. Professor Hartman makes the course accessible and adapts to her students' needs. Additionally, the lab itself is very fun, and you will get a great introduction to microbiology lab techniques! Take this lab!!!",
