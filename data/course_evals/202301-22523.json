To its credit, the teachers and teaching fellows help a lot with moving progress along and keeping students on their toes. I do think the class could use far more dialogue between the students and the teachers. More opportunities to ask questions, clarify personal interests, and get advice on how to move forward according to their personal vision would be useful.",

While Gavin is having private conferences, at least one TA could stay in the studio to help students advance their projects technically.   I have this criticism of all the architecture studios -- there are 6 required hours in the studio, but only about 30 minutes of instruction/input."
