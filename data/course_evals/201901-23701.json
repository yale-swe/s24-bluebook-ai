    "This course has considerably strengthened my skills in arabic reading and speaking. This was the first opportunity I had to read a novel written completely in Arabic with no voweling, and while it was intimidating and challenging at first, I noticed how much progress I was making in such short time.",

    "I wish we could have finished all of Choukri's novels, but due to time constraints, we had to leave out a few. We were still able to cover most of them. This class doesn't meet for too long, so try to make the most of each class session by participating as much as possible and practicing your speaking skills! You get from this class what you put in!",
    "The class is structured in a way that really facilitates learning for student. Professor El Bousty does a really good job of explaining literary concepts in class and spends extra time assisting us with any questions we have."

Your Arabic will become more fluent and you will be able to read Arabic with much greater ease, and your conversation skills will improve.",
    "Absolutely!"
