The course is able to move quickly through a lot of history but also with a good amount of depth into each week's theme/era. Perhaps the only weakness is that the class didn't get to go to Cuba as some past years have done \\_()_/",
                "I really enjoyed the different readings and multimedia that we were able to analyze. I hope that in future years we can get more guest speakers and a trip to Cuba!",
                "strengths: guest speakers, Professor Laguna is so kind and engaging, midterm builds towards final which is very useful, balance of history and culture\r\nweaknesses: we don't go to Cuba anymore over spring break",
                "Laguna is amazing! The readings are super fun and informative. I wish we had more class time and got to go to Cuba",
                "Well-organized and facilitated very well.",
                "I loved the course and its structure, I would just try to leave more space for student discussion",
                "Strengths: The various source materials from this course were one of its main strengths, particularly the weekly readings which complemented the central history text by Gott. Professor Laguna also did an excellent job; he made this course very engaging and made himself available to give feedback and provide assistance to ensure students' success.\r\nWeaknesses: My only complaint is that we weren't able to go to Cuba this year :( Otherwise a terrific class!"

Cuba is a country with an incredibly rich history and culture that is very interesting to learn about. Prof Laguna is a great professor and this class was always so much fun to go to. I will just note that because of the long history covered in a relatively short amount of time, the class functions as a survey course and classes could sometimes feel lecture-y rather than an opportunity for students to have seminar-style discussions. But this isn't necessarily a weakness in my eyes, though it might be for other students!",
                "Yes! If you have even a passing interest in learning more deeply about Cuba, this is the perfect opportunity. Professor Laguna is phenomenal, and I especially enjoyed being able to learn via the contributions of other students to seminar.",
                "Absolutely!",
                "Yes! Especially if you come from a Cuban background, this course is a great way to learn more about Cuban history from a more nuanced perspective than the traditional story told by our parents/grandparents. Professor Laguna is also great and covers the material in a fun and engaging way."
