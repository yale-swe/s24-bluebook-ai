   "comments": [
    "I learned how to think critically about a singular historical figure and how complex history is. I learned a lot from the professor as well as my classmates during each class. I learned how to take apart certain texts and how to apply them to our understanding.",
    "So much knowledge about Frederick Douglass. If you are interested in learning about Frederick Douglass there is no other course to take (this goes without saying!!) I also learned a lot about research   this was far from my first junior history seminar, but one interesting thing about this course is that you develop a base of knowledge over the course of the semester in a really narrow subject area, so your research paper is really starting from a different place than papers in other seminars tend to (in many other junior seminars, you need to acquire that base knowledge yourself, because the course is broader). That was something I wasn't expecting, and it was great to write a research paper within this context.",
    "This was an absolutely fantastic course. I learned so much about Frederick Douglass, the period, and the practice of writing American history.",
    "An understanding of this era of American history through the lens of Frederick Douglass's writings, speeches, etc. A valuable historical and academic exercise.",
    "I learned about Frederick Douglass's life in very great detail. We read all of Prof. Blight's biography of Douglass, Leigh Fought's book about women in Douglass's life, James Oakes's book about Douglass and Lincoln, parts of a book about Douglass and photography, Douglass's three autobiographies, his novella, and several of his speeches and editorials. We discussed Douglass as an abolitionist, political actor, journalist, and autobiographer, in addition to his personal life and things that are harder to know. This class is more structured than Prof. Blight's seminar on historical memory in the spring because it takes you through Douglass's life chronologically. Since he lived through most of the nineteenth century, I also felt like I learned a lot about northern abolitionism before the Civil War, nineteenth century politics, and the Civil War that I didn't know before coming into the course (I haven't taken Prof. Blight's lecture on the Civil War and Reconstruction). That's not to say that this course gives a comprehensive treatment of nineteenth century American history, it definitely doesn't, but I do think that taking this class can teach you a lot about it if you don't already have a great deal of knowledge about that time period, and it's interesting to learn history by studying one person. There was also a 20-25 page final paper, so that was a pretty open-ended opportunity to dig into something or someone related to Douglass's life in more detail while learning more about historical research.",
    "In this class, we learned all about Frederick Douglass that a person could hope to know. I feel like one of the skills this class really helped me develop was critical reading. There is so much material in this class that it was impossible for me to read everything as meticulously as I would have liked to, so I had to learn how to read more quickly and in a more economical way.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about Frederick Douglass, who is just an incredible figure in American history. I also learned a great deal about biography and autobiography and how use a wide range of resources to understand one person.",
    "An incredible opportunity to delve deeply into the life of one of the greatest Americans, guided by perhaps his greatest biographer. Every history student should at some point take a class on a single individual - it is an incredible prism through which to understand a historical period and helps to humanize the political, social, and economic forces you are trying to grapple with as a historian.",
    "This class was a deep dive into the life of Frederick Douglass. I came away with a much better understanding of Douglass and the history of his time.",
    "I learned not only a ton about Frederick Douglass but about the attitudes and debates raging during the 1800s surrounding slavery and American governance, especially during the Civil War. This class was also analyzed the prose, style, message, and evolution of Frederick Douglass's autobiographies in depth while giving us the opportunity to engage critically with Douglass's ideas and language. Having the chance to study David Blight's biography while asking questions and engaging in debates along the way was a phenomenal experience. Hearing other peoples' term paper topics and discussing those various aspects of Douglass's public and private life really gave me the opportunity to study this time period holistically as we tried to build a clearer picture of Douglass as an abolitionist, politician, intellectual, husband, and father.",
    "I learned about the biography of Frederick Douglass and his relevance to the 19th century and beyond. But beyond that, I learned how to read the voice of one of America's most important and best writers. This class taught me much about primary historical research for long writing projects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I did not enjoy when we spent entire classes going around and each answering a singular question. I enjoyed much more when we had free flowing discussion. I thought that there was a good ratio in the class between the professor and students speaking.",
    "Strengths: Professor Blight, of course. His insight\/research stories are invaluable and fascinating, and its such a privilege to study with him. He's incredibly helpful in office hours (he gave a few people access to incredible primary sources for their papers, for instance). This is a really special experience, and I'm so glad to have taken this course. \r\nWeaknesses: It's pretty much impossible to do ALL the reading; because there is so much reading, it sometimes felt like conversation was a little all over the place, although sometimes we had really good, focused, discussions. Also, the class was very, very male (probably about five or six women total?) I have been in classes that were heavily male before, but in this course in particular the discussion tended to be dominated by men. I'm not sure exactly what happened with the dynamic, but it was off.",
    "Strengths: Professor Blight is brilliant, and a wonderful and present seminar leader. His feedback on essays was remarkably helpful, the class was well structured, and discussions were always interesting. Just a joy to be in his presence!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think we took a little too much class time for discussion, especially the last two weeks of student presentations. I would have preferred to hear a bit more from Prof. Blight. We would have also benefitted from a slightly reduced class size.",
    "Prof. Blight really cares about what his students think--he always seemed to be honestly interested in our opinions on different aspects of Douglass's life and excited about our final paper topics. He was always happy to meet with students outside of class to talk about papers or other aspects of the course, and it seems like he thinks of himself as a teacher in a way that not all professors do. I think these are all true strengths of a seminar like this, since seminars can be very dependent on the professor. Prof. Blight definitely leads the discussions during class and he can sometimes talk for a while, but he has really interesting things to say and the class is still definitely oriented towards student discussion rather than lecturing. I found the course material for this class really interesting, but I know that may come down to personal preference. Another strength of the course was that the secondary books we read were all written in different styles, and it was cool to see how different historians approached writing about the same person in different ways. \r\n\r\nI liked that we had two mini papers in addition to the long final paper, and I thought it was good that the first mini paper had a specific prompt and deadline. I think that setting a hard deadline for the second mini paper may be helpful, since I worked on mine incrementally for a while and I think it would have been better to just get it done. I also really liked that everyone had the chance to present some of what they'd been doing on their final paper at the end of the course, but I think it could be good to move those presentations up a little earlier. I took another seminar this semester where we talked about our final papers in class several weeks before they were due, and I think this was helpful for getting us to think about the paper topics seriously and get feedback from our peers earlier on in the writing process. I also think this would have spurred us to start writing a lot earlier than many of us did (you don't want to try to write 20 pages during reading period!!). One other thing is that this course had a very heavy reading load. I understand why that needed to be the case in order for us to be able to carefully discuss Douglass's life and the challenges he faced, but I think there were a few weeks where it probably could have been pared down a bit to be more manageable for students.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is Professor Blight's boundless knowledge of everything Frederick Douglass related. It is an incredible experience to be able to learn from such an expert. I can't think of any weaknesses, though I sometimes felt that the very heavy reading load made it difficult for me to dive as deeply into some of the texts as I would have liked.",
    "The biggest strength was just the depth that the course went into. It is so rare to have the opportunity to really delve into one person for an entire semester and understand them through so many different ways. Professor Blight makes the course - his knowledge allows the class to study Douglass in a way that could never be done without him. There is a heavy amount of reading and work, but there's not really a way to have the course be as good as it is without it.",
    "Strengths: a structured way to read Professor Blight's Douglass biography. The chance to listen to Professor Blight speak once a week. Being exposed to Professor Blight's erudition and his  deeply human and felt approach to history is literally life-changing and may change the way you understand the past. Also, the degree of feedback you receive on your papers is virtually unparalleled - Prof. Blight really takes his job as an instructor seriously and you can tell he really cares about his students.",
    "I loved this course. I loved that we were engaging with Douglasss life through such a wide range of sources.",
    "Professor Blight was the biggest strength of this class, the discussion he prodded and insights he provided us with made this class undoubtedly one of the best I have taken at Yale. Professor Blight provoked interesting questions and encouraged every student to take his\/her analysis of Douglass to the point where we can only conjure about the truth due to lack of information. This was not a very acute problem with Douglass, as he provided us with tons of writing to engage with. I would take this class again if I could. There were no weaknesses I can think of, I was excited to come to class every day despite it being at 9:25. Professor Blight also offers great feedback on writing and the process of putting together a research paper which is understandable considering he isn't too shabby in either of these departments. He's also funny and entertaining. My whole review might seem like a review of Professor Blight rather than a class on Frederick Douglass, but learning about such an important man through him was more than special. Reading his biography on Douglass was great but knowing Blight and hearing him every day made his commentary really come alive: an opportunity that should not be passed up.",
    "Excellent course. My only suggestion would be that at times the class discussion got a bit off topic, and sometimes I felt that people who were quieter were not contributing as much because there wasn't as much space for them to contribute. On the whole, though, this is a fabulous seminar with a phenomenal teacher."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely would. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with Professor Blight. He is brilliant and will give you an entirely new understanding about a man you thought you knew. I think it is important who is in class with you since you spend a great deal of time with them and listening to them. Our class was made up almost entirely of men. I found at times that this ruined the atmosphere and made it harder to talk. There were only five girls in a class of almost twenty and that changed things.",
    "Yes! If you want to know everything there is to know about FD and are taking this in a semester where you have space to handle the workload.",
    "Yes, absolutely! One of the best courses I have taken in the history department. A total and absolute joy.",
    "Yes, take any seminar Prof. Blight teaches. If he's teaching \"The Year 1861\" or something else weirdly specific, I would still recommend taking it if you think you could be at all interested in the material. He's an extremely knowledgeable and capable historian, but also really attentive to his students, and it's great to have access to professors like him at Yale. Reading his biography of Douglass and getting to hear a bit more about how he conducted his research was also really interesting, so I think that if you're interested in biography or archival research then taking this class could help you learn more about those kinds of historical research. \r\n\r\nI think I was reasonably interested in Frederick Douglass before taking this class, but not exactly *passionate* about learning about him the way that Prof. Blight is. Once the semester started, though, I started to find Douglass's life really interesting, and I thought that learning about him and his work was a pretty cool way to learn about nineteenth century reform movements, the Civil War, and American political history. One of my friends in the class found it kind of tough to spend so much time learning about one person, and I can definitely see how it could be grating after a few weeks if you're not really interested in Douglass. Another thing to think about is that this course has a really heavy reading load. There were a lot of weeks where I didn't finish the reading even though I really wanted to, so I'd keep that in mind when you're thinking about what else you'd be taking the same semester. \r\n\r\nI also think that writing a final research paper of this length can be a really helpful writing experience because it requires a lot of time and thought, so I think that if you're up for it then you can get a lot out of it. Prof. Blight is also great to work with when writing a paper like this because he always has good sourcing suggestions and is open to talking about ideas. If you're deciding whether to take this class, the final paper is something that you should see coming in advance. \r\n\r\nOverall, I would definitely recommend taking this class if you're at all interested in Douglass!!",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone. Taking a class from Professor Blight is a must and something students should not pass up during their time here. There is a very heavy workload and tons of readings, so I might not take this class at the same time as another history seminar or other time-consuming class. Other than that, I would definitely insist on this class to anyone considering it.",
    "Absolutely, if Blight teaches it again. If anything take it to spend a semester with Professor Blight - he is just remarkable and is extraordinarily kind and thoughtful. The readings and discussions are fascinating.",
    "Yes. It's a no-brainer to take anything Professor Blight offers.",
    "Yes! I thought having such a narrow focus made me come away feeling like a learned much more and engaged more critically with the material. Professor Blight is amazing and if you can take a course with him I would.",
    "I definitely would. If you're not interested in Frederick Douglass at all at least come to the class to hear Professor Blight talk about him. If he doesn't change your mind then I don't know what will. It might be a little intimidating at times writing for him since he is the expert and so many topics surrounding Douglass's life are so delicate, but his feedback and transparency along with his warm and disarming personality make the class smooth and rewarding if you engage and put in the effort.",
    "Absolutely. Douglass is a worthy subject, and Blight is a caring, thoughtful, generous, and committed teacher. Spending a semester reading Douglass with Blight is the essence of what a liberal arts college education should be."
