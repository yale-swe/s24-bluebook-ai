It is also a very low workload class, with the project being the main assessment of the class.",
                "Yes! This course is engaging, not overwhelming workload, lots of important information whether or not you're planning to work in tech.",
                "Really did not like this class despite my interest in the material. I expected much more of a seminar format given the nature of the topics, but instead, each class was nearly two hours of Professor Vishnoi with little to no student interaction. I also was really disappointed in the nature of assignments for the course. Students are expected to form groups for a final project on the first day of class, with very unclear expectations as to what examples of final deliverables should be and how the project will be graded. Throughout the semester, Professor Vishnoi's feedback was bizarre and unhelpful: it felt as if the goal posts were constantly changing, and each time we addressed his issues he would come up with a new critique. The lack of an actual rubric for this assignment definitely fed into this uncertainty and it was impossible to tell what we were being evaluated on. Professor Vishnoi also clearly demonstrated he was not actually reading our submitted reports, as he frequently came to meetings and asked us to include content that was already in the material we submitted. He also never once provided written feedback or line edits despite his insistence that we submit both written reports and give oral presentations. Instead, we would receive a 30 second (at most) oral blurb of feedback and be expected to come see him outside of class for additional notes. Overall, the feedback on the project felt subjective and unhelpful, which was disappointing given the central nature of this assignment to the course. I would stay away: student engagement in the course was low and I felt instruction was poor overall.",
                "Yes only to people interested in this area.",
                "It is a great class for the right person. It is a mix of computer science and social science/politics."
