The material of this class combined multiple fields; it mixed archaeology, environmental studies, history, and some anthropology into a very cool and unique learning experience.",

                "The biggest strength is professor Harvey Weiss. His passion for the subject makes every lecture extremely engaging. Because he knows the subject so well, is able to assign relevant readings and movies that don't even feel like homework. The structure of only a midterm and a final also allows the student to not have to worry about other assignments, and simply absorb the knowledge from the lectures and readings at their own pace.",
                "I enjoyed the supplemental readings and movies. The only thing I would change is I wish we had more discussions in class.",
                "The strengths of this class are that the material for the most part is interesting and, also, the teacher is extremely interested in the material. The class takes a very interesting approach to history viewing it a archeological lens rather than straight facts. This allows for the class to explore more theories rather than straight fact which is very interesting. The weaknesses of this class are that the class can get caught up on one point for too long which can get a little boring at times.",
                "Professor Weiss was very interesting and passionate in lecturing. However, I wish there was more open discussion in class.",
                "The syllabus was excellent and really aided learning. The selections of readings were excellent too.",
                "The content of the course was very interesting, though increased opportunity for class participation would have been nice.",
                "A big strength of this course is the material and the vast knowledge that Professor Weiss has from working in the Middle East for years. We read many articles that he had written (and even more which cited him) and got to learn about many of the sites which he excavated. My favorite parts of the course were Professor Weiss's anecdotes about his time excavating. The only critique I have is that this class was not really a seminar, but more of a small lecture. I didn't mind it, and given the material I don't know exactly how much there is to discuss, but there is a bit of an issue with false advertising.",
                "Professor Weiss is a phenomenal teacher. it is very interesting subject and using modern movies to make connections works very well",
                "This course is really informative and has a highly organized syllabus.",
                "I would have preferred more discussion than lecture. The lecture was very engaging but it would have been nice to have some more engagement and discussion as well."

Also, the exam format worked well as it was straightforward and easy to understand how to study for. I also appreciated that the lectures were all posted online which made it easy to follow along during the zoom class.",

All of our lectures were basically just Powerpoint lectures via Zoom, and I imagine that they were not too different from how they would have been in person. Sometimes towards the end of the class it would seem to drag on a bit, but I think that's just a symptom of online learning in general, not of this class.",

Every lecture was engaging, the concepts discussed were exciting and still hold relevance to todays world. This is the best first year seminar offered, taught by one of Yale's best Professors. Not to mention, the subjects discussed in this course came from the research of the actual professor.",

                "Yes I would but on the condition that the student does not mind reading as there is a good amount of reading for most homework assignments. If they are ok with the reading than the class is very interesting and the material is for the most part understandable and straightforward.",

                "I would, but it would have to be someone with interest in the subject area. We read a lot of academic papers, and the material was pretty specialized, so I imagine that not everyone would be interested in the course. However, for students who like history, are interested in archaeology, or want to learn more about how society came to be, I would highly recommend this course.",
