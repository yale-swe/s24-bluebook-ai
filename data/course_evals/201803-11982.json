    "I improved my speaking, reading, writing, and listening comprehension skills.",
    "I learned about subtle grammar hints that I would never have learned before. Also, I learned a lot about what it means to immerse oneself in the language they are learning.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Spanish language, I also learned a lot about Mexican culture, as well as some good Spanish short movies and long films. I also learned a lot about Gael Garcia Bernal.",
    "I learned a ton of grammar.",
    "Advanced grammar.\r\nVocabulary.\r\nConfidence speaking without notes.\r\nIncreased knowledge of history of the Spanish-speaking world. \r\nWriting, debate, and reading experience.",
    "improved command of the past tenses and narrative tenses in Spanish; improved vocabulary; further exposure to Spanish language media and literature",
    "I learned about Spanish in the context of culture and views of the Hispanic world. It was a first taste at having to coordinate with other students at Yale, let alone students in other grades.",
    "This class is designed to enhance reading and writing abilities in Spanish.  There was less focus on listening comprehension and even less on speaking.  I also developed insights into Latin American politics in the 20th century.",
    "This class is very grammar intensive. I feel my spanish developed a lot in vocabulary and fluency.",
    "I improved my grasp on written and spoken Spanish. I also was exposed to literature and cinema in Spanish.",
    "Perseverance, language development, diligence and time management."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: engaging, structured well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the course work was repetitive and seemed like busy work, especially the supersite material.",
    "Strengths: The material is very interesting, and the activities are fun and engaging. I learned a lot, especially by watching the movies assigned in class. \"No\" was my favorite part of the year.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It meets every day, and I do not consider myself to be fluent in Spanish after taking the class.",
    "Amazing course that offers really intensive Spanish grammar, and also provides ample opportunity to practice speaking and reading.",
    "I hate that it meets everyday. It just makes the class so unenjoyable.",
    "Strengths:\r\nMaria Carolina Baffi.\r\nGrammar was excellent \r\nThe workbook and our use of it was extremely good. Well organized and useful for the course and discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nVHL assignments are too easy for L4 Spanish. We're past the point where they're in any way useful. The hard part at this point is not following the rules but rather practicing their application, and Vistas really isn't that good at that. \r\nAlso, that I had to pay for the textbook when we only used it for about 4 chapters is ridiculous. It's not in any way the good part of the class, so we should just use the workbook.",
    "very well-structured, organized and transparent course; many sections available with different instructors offers a variety of options; variety of course materials and avenues for engagement",
    "The course certainly felt rushed. Even though it met everyday, it seemed like there was so much content that we barely finished everything in the time allotted. It was useful knowledge that geared us towards mastery of the language, but still a lot.",
    "I believe there should be less emphasis put on obscure vocabulary units and more emphasis on learning the complex verbs that are applied in the readings.  I could not read any of the stories without extensive help from a translator.",
    "Everything was great except the grammar would be very briefly taught in class. Could be improved if lessons were taught a bit longer.",
    "I liked the variety of activities that we did throughout the semester and the variety of literature we worked with. However, I wish that the semester was less packed. Revising the syllabus to include less passages and assignments would be beneficial.",
    "The course is extremely demanding and the course syllabus is outlined to have the students check multiple portals for their homework each night. It becomes very overwhelming at times, especially with so much at homework expected along with studying for assessments at the end of every week."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, especially with Carolina Baffi.  She is incredible.  The texts are interesting and the field trips are fun.",
    "Yes. L4 seemed like the best level of Spanish class to take, according to what I have heard from my friends. I met some really good friends in that class, and I am very glad I took it. I would only encourage people not to take it if they don't want to meet every day.",
    "Definitely. I think my Spanish abilities improved tenfold, and it was always fun to come to class.",
    "No, I hate going everyday.",
    "Definitely. This class helped solidify my Spanish speaking skills. It has a variety of assessments so regardless of your area of skill you'll feel fairly assessed. Maria Baffi is a gem and was incredibly helpful and understanding throughout the course.",
    "yes",
    "This course was fun and taught a lot. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with a good knowledge of Spanish and a desire to fine tune some grammar concepts. Especially with Sra. Baffi.",
    "I would not recommend this course.  It was a significant amount of work and did not advance my skills toward conversational fluency hardly at all.",
    "Yes, take this class for fine tuning of your Spanish grammar and vocabulary. You will see change by the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students seeking to take a more advanced Spanish class, especially if you take it with Carolina Baffi.",
    "Not if you are simply taking it to fulfill a language requirement. I would recommend a class with a slower pace."
