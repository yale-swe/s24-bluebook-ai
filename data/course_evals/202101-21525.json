                "Strengths: Kind, understanding, and helpful professor and TFs. Easy concepts to understand \r\nWeaknesses: The in-class exercises were kinda annoying as they were given every lecture and sometimes we didn't have enough time or knowledge to answer the questions.",
                "Strengths- insightful lectures and excellent professor\r\nWeakness- some of the exercises did not seem important to the material\/were a little overwhelming and hard to complete in time frame",
                "I was not a fan of the many group exercises on Canvas because I have not found Zoom breakout rooms to be productive for learning. In addition, the frequency of them meant that if you missed even a single lecture, you were probably going to lose points towards the final grade with no way of making up for them. However, I did appreciate the way the exams were organized - they were spaced out well throughout the semester, and the fact that they were not cumulative allowed me to give full focus to the set of modules in question.",
                "I think the class could meet 3 times a week instead of 2. This would allow the classes to be shorter and give students more opportunities to learn the material on a more steady pace.",
                "Professor Yan and the teaching staff were all very wonderful, engaging, and helpful.",
                "It is perfect!!",
                "Strengths: pretty interesting material at the food parts, people present personal recipes that enables you to get to know your classmates better\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of dense chemistry, a lot more chemistry than I expected coming in, lectures are 75 minutes twice a week and there's a discussion section as well",
                "Strengths: Great grading scale\r\nWeaknesses: Hard to stay in engaged in long drawn out lectures",
                "Lot of practice helped learn the material. Also the material wasnt to extensive so was not to hard to comprehend for non-stem majors",
                "Strengths are allowing us to team up with our classmates almost every class to complete questions about what we are learning.",
                "The class was really strong overall (great prof, great TAs, clear expectations and simple content), so I'll just note a few weaknesses here. We had to write a bunch of blog posts over the course of the semester  after the first one, I wasn't really learning that much so it felt just like busy work. Some of the in-class exercises were rushed and less relevant to what we were doing. Also, I think we may have spent a bit too long in breakout rooms debating the merits of Pringles vs. Lays, for instance.",
                "I thought the course was really well organized. The slides used to present the information were extremely clear, and the way in which the information was presented was also very clear.",
                "It was advertised as a science credit for non-STEM majors but after reading week ended, we kind of kept on the theme of food but it just turned more into a gen-chem course which bombards you with psets (that aren't too bad) and course blog commenting that doesn't take too long. However, the assignments due in class were quite a bit during COVID times and due dates and alerts that we even had assignments were not discusses in class. After we preface the chemistry and science with food -- and shopping period ends -- the level of content and topics we cover are a bit in depth and overwhelming!",
                "The broad introduction to chemistry made it accessible to non-stem students, which was a big strength of the course. Maybe because of the virtual format, but I do think the course could have benefited from less breakout rooms or activities in class, as we ended up losing some considerable lecture time. These smaller discussion based activities could ideally be done during the TA discussion sections instead. \r\nDuring TA sections, we also had to cover a lot of material not covered in lecture, and I believe changing this to have the material in lecture and activities in section would greatly benefit the learning process.",
                "Strengths: The material was very easy to understand and concepts were clarified very kindly and supportively! I always felt like I was supported or cared for, and I thought Professor Yan was an amazing instructor that genuinely wanted to spread her love for chemistry with others. Weaknesses: PSET questions were hard to complete because some needed to be looked up online, but they weren't denoted as such, so I wasn't sure if I was expected to know the material or not."
