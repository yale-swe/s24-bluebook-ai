                "An amazing course which really helped me to explore the intersection between medicine and the humanities and how each relates to the other.",
                "I learned a lot about medicine in a humanity perspective.",
                "I learned more about the medical profession in the sense that I thought more critically about how physicians think and how they should think, and about what it means to practice medicine in a holistic and philosophical sense. I learned about Russian literature and various authors and philosophers. More importantly, I learned more about how to think critically about life and about happiness. The most valuable insights I had in this class came when the assigned readings or Dr. Morrison's presentations in class inspired me to think deeply about what I wanted from my life and what would fulfill me."

            "comments": [
                "I liked the readings and thought they brought a lot of interesting perspectives the medicine and the concepts of life/death and success/failure. The only thing I would improve on is the in-class discussions. I would've preferred them to be more student-to-student discussion as well, rather than purely student-professor discussion. For example, posing a more general question and having different perspectives from multiple people be shared at once.",
                "Weaknesses: The lectures were really boring; the discussions were really dry because one student would make a comment and then Dr. Morrison would respond with his ideas and then we would move on to a completely different topic.\r\nStrengths: Very low workload; Dr. Morrison a really interesting person.",
                "This course simply has no weaknesses.  It has been the most interesting, most well taught, and overall wonderful class I have ever taken in my time at Yale.",
                "I really like the course. It was very interesting. The philosophy lectures tended to get a bit long but the content was interesting.",
                "At first, the class doesn't seem that organized: the readings come from a wide variety of sources, you don't stay with a particular text for that long, and the theme jumps all over the place. Then, as the class progresses, you realize that much of the content boils down to the same set of core questions, realizations, and truths. This is one of those classes where you may not walk away with new knowledge about some specific fact or event, per se, but you will walk away with a better sense of yourself and a better way to consider the world around you. I think that if you engage fully with this class, it will change how you see your life and how you choose which path you want to take. The only real weaknesses were that the papers were a little too unguided and there wasn't much opportunity for discussion among the class. I wish there had been more opportunities to speak and engage with my peers and their thoughts, because discussions always proceeded like this: someone would speak, Dr. Morrison would respond, and someone else would speak about something entirely different."

                "Only if youre passionate about medicine and philosophy. Otherwise, itll be really boring. If youre just taking it for a humanities guy then I would something else.",
                "Yes.  I simply cannot say enough good things about this class.  It encapsulates Yale's spirit of embracing and, pushing all who take it to explore themselves and their beliefs about medicine more deeply.  It is also great if you are a pre-med student to really inspire and motivate you on what is a very long road.",
                "Yes, it was so fun and I learned a lot.",
                "Yes, but don't take it just because you're premed and you want an easy humanities credit, because that's a waste of your time. Take it if you are genuinely curious about how to pursue a career in medicine without losing your connection to the arts and to the people around you. Take it if you want to think critically about all the philosophical and humanities-based components that go into a medical career. Take it if you want to think about happiness and how to find meaning in your life."
