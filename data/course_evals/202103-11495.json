                "Asynchronous classes on Wednesday were a huge strength, but there were too many presentations.",
                "I loved how this course integrated different forms of media; from reading Spanish literature, watching engaging Spanish videos, and having fun presentations, this course was well rounded in terms of content. However, I wish the course integrated even more experiential learning activities throughout the semester (instead of solely 3) as it is through immersing oneself in different form of Spanish media that enables one to become more fluent.",
