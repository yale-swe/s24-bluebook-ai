I learned how to incorporate grammar structures according to the nuanced meanings that I intended to express. Moreover, this course pushed me to not only memorize new vocabulary words, but also incorporate them in sentences and essays.",

Fridays were off which was nice but this could surely be a 3/week class. Grading was very slow, did not get grades back until several weeks after. Course-wide organization by the course head was not great. The syllabus was very loosely followed.",

                "In terms of strengths, the course material and format are highly engaging and interactive. For example, we participated in debates with each other, created podcasts/videos, and spent time free-writing. Professor Glenski is an excellent discussion facilitator, and I improved my grammar while speaking in Spanish because she effectively corrected me when I made mistakes. I cannot identify any weaknesses!",
                "I enjoyed the in-class activities. The only weakness I can think of is that almost all of our major assessments were graded right at the end of the term."

                "Yes. Sarah Glenski is an amazing person, very sweet, kind, and considerate, but the course sometimes felt pretty unorganized and all over the place. She's pretty lenient and understanding though. I would only consider taking the course with another professor if you feel you require someone with a lot of technical understanding of the language or someone who is very thorough and organized in their teaching.",
