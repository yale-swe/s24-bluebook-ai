                "Great introduction to the Russian language and improved ability in language-learning overall",

                "A great introduction to the Russian language! A strong focus on speaking, understanding grammar concepts, and audio comprehension.",
                "I developed proficiency in the Russian language that I have found to be very useful, interesting, and applicable to real life situations.  I learned how to read and write in Cyrillic, Cyrillic cursive, and Russian vocabulary, grammar, and language conventions."

            "comments": [
                "The workload is very predictable and constant. You never really feel overwhelmed. Professor Titus is also very good, she teaches well and keeps a fast pace.",
                "The focus on grammar in this course is fantastic as well as the standardized daily homework, weekly quiz, and bimonthly unit tests. My one suggestion would be potentially more oral practice besides the midterm and the final, perhaps ungraded or offering office hours one on ones once a month per student? Also, there were a few weeks in the term where because of a break we were thrown a bit off sequence so we had an oral, quiz, and a test in one week after a week with nothing. I know that this was rare and more of a school schedule issue, and this course is 1.5 credits, but these weeks often also coincided with other course's midterm\/final exams or papers. Potentially spreading out the time, offering a shorter quiz on an earlier section of the unit, or forgoing the quiz for that unit might be another option? Overall though this course was absolutely amazing!",
                "Strengths: lots of study material provided, engaging lessons, clear expectations\r\nWeaknesses: very fast pace, but that was necessary to cover all the material",
                "Strengths: excellent instructor, clear daily lessons (assisted by the textbook), consistent rigorous homework schedule, straightforward exams, almost everything was great. Weaknesses: After the first few weeks, two of your five days a week will be taught by a TA, and the very distinct teaching styles between Julia and our TA were sometimes kind of jarring.",
                "This course was really good at keeping me engaged the whole time. Because we had homework every night, I never felt rusty or out of practice the next day in class. It forced me to stay up to speed and practice regularly which was really good for me personally. The class can move a bit fast at times, especially when you have to learn 2 cases back to back, and that can get a bit overwhelming. But the professor and TF always gave great feedback and were willing to help whenever I needed, so even when I felt behind or confused I knew I could always go to them",
                "Manageable and consistent practice, with short daily classes and homeworks. One huge strength is that the course slowly builds and maintains previous knowledge. Class is drill based, and feels very well paced. One weakness of the course was the TA taught days. I felt like I got much less learning out of those two days of the week, and occasionally struggled with concepts that were only taught on TA days.",
                "I loved the structured format of the course that made it easy to stay on track and learn incrementally.  The material built off of former material so there was a true advancement of skill throughout the course."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with even a remote interest in Russian. The course was enjoyable, informative, and engaging. Professor Titus really helps you wake up in morning classes from her enthusiasm and teaching style.",
                "Absolutely! An engaging and supportive environment fostering education in a language so different from English is a phenomenal place to get those language credits!",
                "Yes, interesting language and well-taught. Definitely not an easy class for a language requirement, and the workload was high, but it was manageable.",
                "Absolutely yes. The work is a bit more than continuing your high school Spanish or whatever, but it's definitely worth it - the quality of the instructors and students is outstanding.",
                "100%! Russian is a difficult language but theres something about it thats just really fun and rewarding. The workload is daily but rarely overwhelming, the tests and quizzes are very fair, the professor and TFs are super sweet and engaging, and the language itself really is something special! Class every day would be a little nerve wracking just because Im a bit self conscious about my pronunciation, but I always looked forward to it.",
                "Yes! If you are interested in learning Russian I absolutely recommend this course. It is well-paced, well taught, and leaves you with a great foundational understanding of the language. Although it does get progressively more challenging, it's never too overwhelming, and as long as you keep up with the daily work it shouldn't be too stressful. Very fun class!",
                "Absolutely!  I have heard from other students that in some of the other language courses offered at Yale, students don't leave feeling like they have a grasp on the language that applies to real life.  That is not the case with Russian!  The class was super fun and engaging as well as very educational!"
