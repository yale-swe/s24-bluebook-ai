I learned how to differentiate between academic and Pyrrhonian skepticism, how cultural relativity fits within a philosophical framework, and what to make out of self reflection. More broadly, this class helped bolster my confidence in spoken French and exposed me to an unfamiliar style of written French."

                "The strengths of this course are the deep knowledge of the professor. She is such an expert on Montaigne's life and work! It's amazing. It could be improved by being shortened, as 2 hours felt too long to focus.",
                "Strengths: the course was very relaxed, and didn't require a lot of engagement besides the required assignments to do well in the class. The assessments built off each other as we had the option to develop the same topic from a presentation, short paper and final paper. Weaknesses: this relaxed nature meant that I found myself pretty disengaged with the course. Montaigne is a difficult read, and I think to really love this class you have to really love Montaigne. I closely read the Essai that I did my assignments on, but as for the rest it was much more variable. The course could be improved by starting with a bit more background about Montaigne, and about philosophy in general. I think it was assumed that we knew the theories of the ancient Greek schools of thought, and they were integrated into the course around nine weeks in. It would have been better to introduce these theories, and how Montaigne developed and contradicted this tradition, much earlier in the course.",
                "The course was well structured and engaging. Montaigne is a fascinating author and Mme. Brancher provided the necessary tools for us to understand his text. One comment that I would make is that I would have liked to look at more Essais during the course.",
                "Strengths: Madame Brancher is a wonderful professor, whom you can tell is fiercely dedicated to the course's topic; the class is well-structured and accessible to a diversity of French levels\r\nWeaknesses: we often went over class time, but it always happened when Madame was really immersed in a particular lecture"

                "I would! The class appears daunting on paper, but the coursework is not overwhelming and the topic is really interesting. I couldn't say I had any particular desire to learn about skepticism, but this course managed to explore complicated philosophical stances in a manageable manner. I can now say I actually understand skepticism and a good deal of what Montaigne wished to accomplish in publishing his personal accounts of subjects ranging between God, gender, reasoning, and politics."
