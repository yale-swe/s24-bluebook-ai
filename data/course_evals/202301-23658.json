I think the Spanish department makes a good effort to focus lessons on Spanish and Latin American culture too.\r\nWeakness is how quickly the class moves; I wish there was more time for review. I ended up requesting a Spanish tutor, which ultimately was really useful and something I would recommend for any language learner at Yale.",

I thought the environment for the class really fostered learning, but one weakness was that we were learning a lot of new vocabulary and tenses, but not having a ton of time to practice them in class with all of the in class projects. Youll need to put in a good amount of time to practice or its easy to fall behind",
                "Strengths of this course include learning the content on our own and coming to class to ask questions or do activities with what we learned."

Its almost as if were being expected to major in Spanish. The workload is a bit much. I did learn a lot but I some work just felt like busy work and I couldve learned just as much without doing it"
