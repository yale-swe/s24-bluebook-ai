I think the Spanish department makes a good effort to focus lessons on Spanish and Latin American culture too.\r\nWeakness is how quickly the class moves; I wish there was more time for review. I ended up requesting a Spanish tutor, which ultimately was really useful and something I would recommend for any language learner at Yale.",

I thought the environment for the class really fostered learning, but one weakness was that we were learning a lot of new vocabulary and tenses, but not having a ton of time to practice them in class with all of the in class projects. Youll need to put in a good amount of time to practice or its easy to fall behind",
