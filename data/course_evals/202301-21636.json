                "Strengths: Covers the most fundamental topics in signal processing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too much abstract math and formula derivations during lecture. No need to get deep into the weeds with mathematical derivation during lecture; students won't be able to make sense of the derivation anyways and will lose concentration. More emphasis should have been placed on the intuition behind operations like the Fourier Transform or sampling with delta functions.",
                "I would prefer if that class had fewer proofs",
                "Course is amazing. The professor's slides are great to keep track of the material, plus he really puts in the time and effort to understand. I must say it is a chill class, the prof doesn't host office hours but is very open at answering questions and setting up meetings. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness I would say is the length of the homeworks. They were excessively long, and sometimes without real need. However, they did help understand the material.",
                "Lectures are extremely boring and near impossible to follow. Psets are way too long and repetitive, and the midterm was difficult and also too long",
                "Didnt really get much from this class",
                "Strengths: the coverage of the topics was very thorough and detailed. Professor Kalogerias really aimed to have us conceptually and intuitively understand the content (which is quite difficult given the topics covered!) although this was not necessary for success. The lecture slides were very detailed and a great resource for studying and completing problem sets. Weaknesses: I wish that the problem sets and lectures aligned more in their approach. Also, it would have been great if Professor Kalogerias had held office hours for students to get help.",
                "Strengths: \r\nCourse is very well organized in terms of the canvas page, lecture slides, and homeworks. Students were able to navigate the logistics of coursework with ease allowing them to focus entirely on the content. The professor / TA was very responsive and transparent as students significant input about when exams would take place and whether or not they needed more time to complete certain assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe biggest weakness is how dry yet complicated the course content is, making it difficult to retain information and develop an intuitive understanding on the material. I appreciated that Prof Kalogerias went very indepth into the content and tried to cover many different topics, however much of the content can be cut and should be made more concise. Specifically, there was a lot of extra information included that, since it was difficult to follow, provided no practical benefits other than checking a box on the syllabus. Much of the content before the midterm building up to the laplace and fourier transforms should be streamlined to help with student engagement. \r\n\r\nIn the end, students need not attend the lecture itself as most of the slides are copied straight from the textbook anyway and the homeworks are completely textbook based as well. \r\n\r\nThe entire course just felt like jumping through hoops to get the grade, which is not necessarily a fault of Prof. Kalogerias but rather a symptom of the complete neglect toward undergraduate pedagogy on behalf of the Yale EE department.",
                "Very rigorously based on math, lectures give proofs of concepts covered in the homework and textbook. I do wish the homework was more aligned with the class material so more could be gained/explored on the math side of things."

                "Really gets in the weeds. Helpful to understand the limits and mathematical rigor of subjects like Fourier, Laplace, etc.- but also a bit pendantic and hard to understand at times. Slides were great and thorough, but simply reading through them made class a snooze, and also hard to extract actual understanding out of the dense notation. If youre an EE, I would recommend taking after ENAS 194, EENG 203, and even MENG 390L - all of which treat the Fourier and Laplace transform from an applied perspective. Then, learning the abstract will be much more meaningful.",
                "Nope",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to any student who has interest in signal and system theory. This is an important subject to learn for any work in the physical sciences or engineering. However, it would be quite uninteresting and tedious to those not particularly interested in this topic.",
                "Unless you are an ABET EE major or well-versed enough in calculus / signal analysis to understand the jargon and nuance, you should stay away from this course. \r\n\r\nIf you were coming into the course to develop a qualitative understanding of how fundamentally work (ie in things like music production and electronic testing / validation), this is NOT the course for you. You will end up simply chugging through calculus problems ad nauseam with no real idea as to how it affects signals beyond the most basic signal modulation."
