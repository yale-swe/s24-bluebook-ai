I think the only weakness was that it took a long time for problem sets to be returned with comments and grades.",
                "Overall, a really interestring and well-taught class. I enjoyed it a lot. It is challenging and yet very beautiful in its own way. You learn a new mathematical language basically. I would just note that at times having more examples would be helpful and being super careful about each and every step would help too. Also, I feel like at times Prof. Dhillon tried to give sort of intuition of what's happening and I have to admit that I did not always undertood him at first, but once I got more familiar with the ideas, everthing came in place and it was beautiful. Maybe being a bit slow at the beginning would be my advice and just state things as they are before talking about why they came to be and why they matter.",
                "The strengths of this course are definitely Gurbir and his office hours. He is an extremely kind professor who genuinely cares about our development as mathematicians. Several times throughout the semester he went past his office hours time allotment to continue answering our questions and he always had his email open for us to ask him questions. It was obvious that he really cared and wanted us to succeed! A weakness was sometimes we got really really abstract and I sometimes was unable to concretely understand what we were talking about until much much later. I think having reminders about what we were talking about with examples would have been better although towards the end Gurbir started doing this since he is very open to feedback!",
                "The strength of the course is the dedication of Professor Dhillon! Professor Dhillon did not simply teach us the concepts, he made sure to inspire us with the lectures and especially the design of the psets. Each problem on the pests are all logically related and by the end of each pset you will have proven a complex result with each question as a step in the process. Without a TA, Professor Dhillon holds 2-3 1.5 hour office hours each week, which really shows the dedication. Professor Dhillon is truly passionate about the material and is very patient as he shows us the difficult but inspiring concepts.",
                "It was a hard leap in the beginning to rethink most linear algebra ideas as commutative diagrams, but it was very rewarding towards the end, as the theory of canonical, universal property constructions proved to be the most effective in working with multi-linear algebra."

                "Yes, absolutely I would!",
                "This course is a LOT. This has been the hardest math course I have taken here at Yale. The material is highly abstract and requires a significant of mathematical maturity to do the homework assignments. That being said, if you have the necessary time to invest into this course and a strong foundation of linear algebra already then I can recommend this course to you as it will formalize a lot of these ideas in a coordinate-less way which is super cool. Almost every single pset (of which we have one a week) took me more than 20 pages of handwritten work to complete and I needed to go to office hours constantly to make sure I was understanding what was going on. That being said, Gurbir is fantastic at office hours answering questions and making sure we aren't completely on our own when we go to try and solve the psets. I never really had a free weekend this semester because I would spend all of my weekends and some of weekdays grinding the psets as they took more than 15 hours on average for me at least. However, at the end of the semester, looking back I feel like I have grown so much as a proof writer and mathematician from taking this class. I don't think I can feel intimidated when people use big words in math because I know how to think about concepts and how to approach unapproachable problems! Quick note however is that lots of people I think got intimidated out of this class and lots of people dropped it but those who persevered gained a lot so when shopping this class keep that in mind I guess.",
                "I would strongly recommend this course to another student, although I suspect the material might differ based on the instructor. I suppose my recommendation is not so much for the course as for Professor Dhillon. Professor Dhillon did not simply teach us the concepts, he made sure to inspire us with the lectures and especially the design of the psets. Each problem on the pests are all logically related and by the end of each pset you will have proven a complex result with each question as a step in the process. Without a TA, Professor Dhillon holds 2-3 1.5 hour office hours each week, which really shows the dedication.
