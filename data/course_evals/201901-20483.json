   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Super valuable info, just kinda boring style. Class energy was frequently low and it was hard to pay attention.",
    "This class is pretty dry - I'd prefer if we had several projects to work on. Lectures and guest speakers were interesting, problem sets were relatively dry, and exams were straightforward. If you have to take it for the energy studies certificate, take it.",
    "This course is disorganized, as you will read in previous reviews. There doesn't seem to have been any improvement on this front. Psets seemed random and midterm was a complete crapshoot. Tough to know what to study and what the professors want you to know.",
    "The professors were very passionate and there were a lot of help from professors and TAs",
    "Strengths: Guest lectures were interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lacked in substance.",
    "I enjoyed the field trips the class went on: it significantly added to what we were learning in class.",
    "Lectures could be more engaging, the project is fun, and the breakdown of assignments and tests is very fair.",
    "Good class",
    "Strengths: Some of the guest lecturers were very interesting, including the New Haven sustainability officer, and Yale Carbon Charge manager. I also enjoyed the lectures by Julie Paquette on Yale buildings, tours of the power plant and Kroon Hall, and ample time to work on the final project (your choice).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This class could do so so much more for helping us realize the urgency of the energy debate and challenging us to engage in a more rigorous debate about solutions. The class wastes so much time with lectures on topics such as energy conversion units, or tables and charts we could look up on the internet. The two main professors, Oristaglio and Prober, simply read off the slides at an insanely slow pace making it very difficult to stay engaged. The p-sets after very very poorly written, they will take far more time than necessary. Also, the final exam was pointless after we completed our final project-- I think it should be cut.",
    "The biggest strength of this course was the guest lectures because they provided real insight into various aspects of energy in the world today. Another strength was the final poster presentation because it allowed students to dive into a topic of interest. However, most of the actual lectures were either confusing because the professors went on so many tangents, or they were uninteresting because the professors got bogged down in basic information or read every statistic on giant tables or charts. Additionally, I felt that it was difficult to feel fully prepared for the exams when the practice exams only came with hints and suggestions rather than real answers. Some of the psets were poorly worded and difficult to follow, but more importantly they focused way too much on unit conversions instead of more practical material."

   "comments": [
    "Sort of. It's valuable, but I feel like I couldve learned many of the same things in just a few hours on wikipedia.",
    "No, unless you must for Energy Studies. It is a true shame because the topic and textbook are fantastic, just too disorganized.",
    "Yeh very good and interesting class",
    "Probably not really, unless you are looking for a very easy STEM credit.",
    "No.",
    "This is a gateway class for energy studies, and much of what Oristaglio talk about is related to the program. If youre not in energy studies, you might feel left out, but its still an easy class with useful information.",
    "Yes, I am glad I learned about energy and this is a good class for an introduction to Energy Studies.",
    "No",
    "No. I would avoid this class if possible. Much of the material felt like common knowledge. You could read everything relevant in a book or an article without having to suffer through tremendously boring lectures, the advantages of the course-- the interesting guest lectures and filed trips-- might be enough to sway the occasional student to take this course, but this was not the case for me. However, I did enjoy having the time to work on a self-guided independent project which I made the most out of. The class was mostly just disappointing, it's such an important topic and it could do so much more with more creative professors.",
    "While this course may cover a lot of interesting topics, each topic is treated at a basic level and the material only scratches the surface of what could be discussed. Most of the problem sets focus on unit conversion math, which makes them feel like busy work rather than a way to learn. The lectures are often confusing or uninteresting, and they do very little to really address important issues about energy, technology, or society. Another important note is that as of Spring 2019, this class is technically not required for energy studies students (it is only recommended as a gateway course) so it is still very much possible to do energy studies if you decide not to take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is looking into infrastructure and engineering and has a heavy interest in the energy studies program. To do well in the course, the student should have strong math and moderate basic chemistry background because much of the math explanations that are heavily assessed in the Problem Set graded portion of the class are rarely ever discussed in lecture. Lectures are mostly energy in relation to the world and how these different processes work at a basic level. Class involvement is not extremely intense, however, class interaction is encouraged and at some points required to do well in the course. Overall, this class is a good QR to take for energy studies prospects to get a basic foundation of energy concepts while keeping up academically with the course."
