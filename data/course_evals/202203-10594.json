                "It was overall a really good survey of Islamic theology.",
                "very informative but a lot of work and lectures got boring",
                "It's a really comprehensive course and the professor clearly knows a lot!",
                "Strengths: combination of lecture, primary sources, and secondary sources; Professor Griffel is a great lecturer; the TFs were super helpful and supportive; covers so much ground in a short time; a great \"intellectual history\" class where you learn a lot about the history of the Muslim world in general via its prominent thinkers \r\nWeaknesses: almost 70% of the grade was determined by the last few days of the course, with the final exam and final paper. The only other assignment we had had before then was the midterm exam, so we hadn't had many other chances to engage with the course material ourselves (nor receive feedback on our work) up until the very end. Also, the material was at times a little bit specific\/technical, although I understand that is sometimes the nature of philosophy. Other than that, it was definitely a high workload, but it was worth it.",
                "Strengths: Incredible lectures, excellent sessions in section, and very helpful readings; the breadth and depth of knowledge covered is immense and mostly well-explained\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was so much information, and sometimes what we learned in class wouldn't map on exactly to what was on the review sheet, so I wish there was a little bit more clarity on certain terms that we may not have seen before, as well as certain debates and larger themes that might be covered in the exams"

            "comments": [
                "Take it if you want an overview of early Islamic theology. It really breaks down a priori conceptions of that era in the Muslim world. Also, great response to Orientalist narratives that cloud our vision of the Muslim World.",
                "if you will do the readings and pay attention and find it interesting. otherwise its gonna be really hard",
                "If you're interested in learning something new I'd definitely recommend! If you're looking to learn about Islamic history particularly the history of different theologies\/philosophies, then I'd take this course. However, if you're a student with Muslim family or a Muslim yourself know that this is not an Islam class it is an Islamic History class and that makes a big difference. Prof Griffel is respectful in all ways but he will not be preaching Islam or teaching you what you've learned in Sunday School. Regardless, I'd still recommend because it's a cool way to learn more about Islamic history.",
                "100%. If you think the course is going to be dry and boring, it's not. Sure, there may be moments where the material is more technical than you'd like. However, the class as a whole is so interesting and very relevant if you study anything related to religion, philosophy, or the MENA region. The things I learned in this class constantly came up in other situations. \r\n\r\nHowever, before you sign up for the course, do know that it is a high workload. I'm glad I took the class during a lighter semester for me when I could give this class the time I wanted to. If I had been busier, it would have been quite hard to keep up with readings and synthesize all of the information for the exam.",
                "100% yes. It was an incredible combination of intellectual history and theological\/philosophical discussion\/debate that touched on perennial arguments about religion, all expertly curated. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
                "If you are truly interested in the material, absolutely! Professor Griffel is truly one of the best professors I have had a Yale and is fantastic at explaining complicated material in an intelligible way. Having taken both this course and his other course on modern Islamic theology and jihad, I would note that they are very different in tenor, with this course delving deeper into philosophy and medieval history and the other focusing more on contemporary history and the rise of Islamic extremism. \r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to take a course with Professor Griffel before you graduate, because he is truly cant-miss. If you are more philosophically oriented, take this class. If you are more historically or current-events inclined, I would recommend starting with his other class (currently known as Islam Today)."
