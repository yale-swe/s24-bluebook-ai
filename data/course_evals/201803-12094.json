   "comments": [
    "Ease in speaking, build strong vocabulary, reestablish grammatical foundations",
    "more speaking skills, historical lessons",
    "Deeper understanding of certain concepts and some more vocabulary.",
    "I learned more specific grammar such as participles and numerals and verb types. The course used Russian history for oral exams so Im addition to grammar, I had an opportnity to learn about culture.",
    "More advanced Russian grammar and academic vocab",
    "I developed my written and speaking skills in the Russian language.",
    "Gained knowledge of 17th and 18th century Russia as well as many vocabulary words used in historical texts.",
    "Overview of 19th century Russia, review of participles, imperatives, time expressions, numbers. Interesting range of vocabulary. Some seemed very specific to 19th century Russia but others can be applied in any era. Also learned a bit through the student presentations which was definitely an enjoyable part of the class.",
    "This course goes away from the textbook used in the first two years of Russian and focuses on the development of more complex grammatical topics, such as gerunds and participles, in addition to building a more sophisticated, wider vocabulary. Most reading consists of (relatively) short texts about Russian history in the 19th Century, which is very interesting.",
    "Good insight on political & historical Russia - well rounded for vocab"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength-Constantin \r\nWeakness-need more writing assignments",
    "Strengths: Constantine's textbook is very very good and is the first text I've used in my russian learning that treats the reader as a smart person (i.e. doesn't try to hide anything until your more advanced). Also if you're in the smaller section you get a lot of practice\r\nWeakness: Lessons based on readings in history, so depending how interested you are in russia like around 1800 will really affect how much you enjoy doing the homework",
    "I like the mix of grammar and history. Perhaps more class time could be spent on more supplementary information like videos and things which cannot be gotten from the textbook itself.",
    "The professor was always willing to explain things and help, but the lack of a structure sometimes led to us rushing through material or having deadlines imposed randomly for assignments.",
    "Love the emphasis on historic content but sometimes it was hard to tell when thin ha were due",
    "The small class size was a great strength, as well as the pace of the grammar.  However, the historical vocabulary seemed less useful than prior vocabulary.",
    "Strengths: \r\nProfessor Muravnik. Professor Muravnik is very knowledgeable and puts a lot into this class. He's always willing to answer questions (even if they're a bit off track) and does a great job of explaining the nuances in Russian words and constructions beyond just giving a standard definition that only halfway fits. His feedback is useful and timely. He is more than willing to meet with you for office hours if needed. He did a great job of breaking down the readings so that they were manageable and simpler to understand. The emphasis on grammar was great and definitely needed.\r\n\r\nThe presentations and compositions. These were great ways to practice speaking and writing. I really enjoyed being able to present on anything that I wanted and it was great to be able to speak for an extended period of time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nVery little time is dedicated to casual speaking. We have the presentations (which are great) and there are opportunities to discuss the reading sometimes, but I would appreciate more time to just speak freely about opinions or things that have happened just so that we can keep a basic conversational level of Russian. Maybe more presentations but for a shorter length of time? Or maybe have a student bring in a current event and talk about it for 5 minutes at the beginning of class?\r\n\r\nClass size. It seemed too big to me, even after the split at the beginning of the year. I'm not sure if this is possible to fix, but just want to note it.",
    "Professor Muravnik is a very wonderful professor, who always provides interesting insights into the language which were often glossed over in the first two years. I found the course very good overall, although I felt like the presentations we had to do should have been more evenly distributed throughout the semester, as many people found themselves doing presentations quite late in the semester, giving us less time to review for the written and oral finals."

   "comments": [
    "Need to take if you want to continue learning Russian, otherwise your skill will be lost.",
    "yes. Constantine's textbook is really good and and is the first text I've used in my russian learning that treats the reader as a smart person (i.e. doesn't try to hide anything until your more advanced). Also if the decision is between this and stopping at L4, just think of all the cool things you could do after two semesters of L5!",
    "Yes, it is definitely important to keep up your Russian.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to improve your speaking skills and learn about Russian history. This course really excellerated my abilities.",
    "Yes! Constantine is wonderful",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if the student is looking to keep improving their language skills.  However, it does take a lot of effort, so don't take it if you aren't committed.",
    "Yes. Great teacher, good course materials to facilitate learning Russian.",
    "Yes. If you've got to take L5 Russian, then this is the only option. Besides that, however, Professor Muravnik really knows his stuff. You'll definitely have a better grasp of grammar and 19th century Russia after taking this course. You should probably find some way to practice speaking on your own time though. The Russian table is a great way to do that!",
    "Absolutely. Professor Muravnik is wonderful, and this is a great course overall if you're looking to expand your functional knowledge of Russian beyond elementary grammar and vocabulary.",
    "Yes- wonderful professor and interesting course"
