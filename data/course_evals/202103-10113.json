                "My drawing improved immensely, but I love how it was kind of with my own guidance. We were not told specifically what to draw we got to learn through the things we are naturally drawn to. I had never read as much theory as in this class, and I also really enjoyed that. I also feel like I got more of a grasp on how to talk about architecture.",

The brunt of the skills gained were in drawing and problem-solving, thoughsection is a great opportunity to learn to draw, even if you've never really done it before. It was really beautiful seeing how far we all came from the first week, and everyone has your back the whole way through.",

                "Strengths: lots of help during section.\r\nWeaknesses: no guidance with sketchingexpected to know how to draw right away.",
                "This course is very engaging and Professor Purves is a great lecturer. I enjoyed the section meetings and looking at others work to improve my own. It would be VERY beneficial if some idea of grades was given throughout the semester and students were not just left in the dark.",
                "The strengths of this course were the sections to present our projects. I got the best criticisms and made the most improvements week to week from the sections. There were very few weak points in the course. I thoroughly enjoyed almost every aspect of this course and was highly engaged with all aspects of the class. The guest lecturers at the end were not expected and I wasn't too sure about some of the messages that were trying to be conveyed.",
                "Strengths are the lectures and weekly assignments. The lecture content was fascinating and truly taught me a new way to look at the world around me. Weekly assignments were a great way to add variation to my more stem heavy coursework and take time to really analyze the spaces and buildings around me. A weakness of the course is grade transparency. Not once over the entirety of the course did I know what my grade was in the class, I was only given subjective midterm feedback that detailed what I was doing well at and how I could challenge myself more. I understand that grades in an architecture class may not be the most important thing ever, but for students exploring the topic or taking the course for their own enjoyment, it can be anxiety inducing to not have a single clue where you stand grade wise when you are required to submit for credit/D/fail designation. Though this was a weakness, I would not say the grading factor really took away at all from the course experience and content to a significant extent, just something I wish were different.",
                "Weakness: A lot of the reading can be highly theoretical, and while this is fine, it can be difficult to tie the reading in to the more meat and potatoes aspect of the class (lectures, drawings).\r\n\r\nStrength: the degree to which creativity is encouraged within the requirements of the assignments. I think the creative aspect which is so focused on in the beginning of the semester could be in fact carried through more strongly through some of the later, more technical, assignments.",
                "Since I'm interested in architecture, I appreciated the amount of readings from traditional architects about design and space. However, I think the course would have been more engaging if we discussed these readings and if we learned about architects from more diverse racial and cultural backgrounds. Sometimes in section, we would run out of time and students wouldn't be able to get feedback. I think that was resolved with TAs offering feedback during office hours.",
                "I liked the structure and the interaction level with the lecture and seminar portion combination",
                "I think the readings could be more integrated into the course. I also feel like section time management was not always great we often ran out of time and could not discuss everyone's work. We also didn't really get much feedback outside of the midterm.\r\n\r\nI love the sketchbook prompts, all of them. I loved being able to spend time on other people's work, across sections. Lectures were also very engaging, which is rare.",
                "Drawing assignments and section was enjoyable, wish the assignment expectations were more clear though.",
                "I loved that lecture was like a glimpse into the way Prof. Purves thinks about architecture and that we weren't tested on the material covered -- it really enabled us to enjoy lectures and think about the content without stress. I also got really good feedback on my sketches from the TAs and felt like I gained some ideas on how to approach my art moving forward. I think the TAs also did a good job critiquing to the level of the student and focused on idea and improvement with some pointers on technical ability. I wish we had a longer section time or smaller sections so that students could be more involved in the critiques instead of just the TAs offering feedback.",
                "Fun projects but wish there was more incentive to do the readings",
                "Strengths are the assignments and TFs; downside is that its a 9 am and the assignments can be very time consuming occasionally. I would say the final was the most difficult assignment.",
                "weakness: lecture had little connection to drawing assignments",
                "I thought this course was phenomenal top to bottom. Section was great.",
                "Loved drawing for work. Good change from the psets and essays.",
                "Professor Purves is fantastic--his lectures are engaging and insightful. The TAs are amazing as well. They are knowledgeable, engaged, and fun.",
                "Great lectures all semester long! I especially enjoyed the guest lecturers we had at the end and would have been happy to have more throughout the semester. That said, Purves was also phenomenal so I'm not mad. Lecture could run a little long sometimes, and section often ran long.",
                "Lot of readings, however,  there is wide range of room to explore the assignments and offer personal interpretations.",
                "Lectures could have been more engaging for intro students, practical experience in section with drawing and building assignments was incredibly fun and where I learned the most",
                "Strength: Engaging lectures, helpful feedback from TAs who are Arch madters students\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt get a single grade back on any assignment for the whole semester so I have no clue where I stand.",
                "I loved this course - I really enjoyed the weekly sketching homework (they were a nice break from psets and other more traditional assignments) and both the midterm and final were super fun to create.",
                "Lecture and note taking format (drawing in notebook) is good and conducive to memorization. Sections should be more structured so each person has the chance to talk about their art.",
                "Excellent Course!",
                "Alecs lectures are great. He is endlessly knowledgeable and passionate, and the narrative structure of the course (where a class is organized around a given architectural element like form or surface) is smart and compelling. He incorporates examples of these elements being used effectively in many different contexts, cultures, and eras. By contrast, its hard not to notice the Eurocentrism of the assigned readings. Youre going to read a lot more by Le Corbusier than by any people of color combined. I recognize the value of the canon, and I think an introductory architecture class would be incomplete without Corbu et al, but it would be really nice to experience these texts in dialogue with more contemporary and more diverse perspectives and methodologies. Our sections spent absolutely no time talking about the readings, either - we only reviewed our sketchbook assignments. I think a lot of people just stopped doing the readings as a result - you definitely can get away with that easily. \r\n\r\nThe assignment prompts are great, but we received no technical instruction. Its an intro class! Some of us turned in intro-level work! But the feedback for those of us who were super new to architectural drawing often felt condescending rather than constructive (that doorframe looks distorted is a lot less helpful than exercises that help you develop the very technical skill of rendering perspective!). In general I wish section meetings had been organized in such a way that we talked and got to know one another (including our TFs) more.\r\n\r\nA tiny quibble - the requirement that we buy GIANT sketchbooks actually made it really hard to practice in them regularly. They dont fit in a lot of regular bags. \r\n\r\nAlso, I wished we had a little more naming of architectural elements - a brief, standard review of stylistic vocabulary and structural terminology would have been really helpful. \r\n\r\nThe guest lectures felt tacked-on, too - none of them felt like they added a unique perspective and they interrupted the flow of the course. It seemed a little bit lazy. \r\n\r\n A more substantive source of potential frustration was that the grading criteria and breakdown were never disclosed. Filling out this eval right now and truly have no idea what awaits me",
                "The only weakness of this course is that it is early in the morning.",
                "The readings were very interesting and complemented the lectures, but they were difficult to keep up with. I think it would have been nice to have some time to discuss the readings in section, and maybe we could have looked at our drawings more often in office hours. Section also ways felt too short for what we had to get through. Lectures were really interesting, although it would have been really nice for them to be recorded. I was really sad when I had to miss class for holidays at the beginning of the semester because the lectures were really good and I knew there would be no real way to get that back without recordings. The main thing that could be improved is communicating about grading. It was really stressful to not know our grades at any point during the semester and to not even really understand how we were going to be graded on assignments.",
                "Lectures were very engaging and the drawing assignments were fun and really pushed me to improve! the only one i didn't enjoy was the group drawing, as it was cumbersome and awkward to have 4 people drawing on one page. I feel like there could have been some other group project to allow us to experience working on architecture in groups in a different way. I also would have appreciated having some sense of my grade before the end of the course.",
                "The strengths of this course are that all the assignments that we are given allow us to draw things in our own style and be original in our drawings. The originality that many people have in their drawings is something that I greatly appreciate. Not many weaknesses in this course, it was a great overall experience.",
                "Lectures did not teach drawing principles though our assignments were drawings",
                "The final guest lectures were mediocre, but aside from that the class was great. The readings were also sometimes head-scratchers as to why they were relevant.",
                "There is no concrete feedback before the midterm outside of section, it is really hard to have an idea of what one's grade will be until you receive a final grade.",
                "No really. Everyone was great.",
                "I enjoyed the weekly assignments and critiques we received. The TAs gave insightful comments on our work and how we could improve, and I believe that everyone in my section grew a lot in their skills. Professor Purves lectures very well. He described everything like a story, and the connections he made between topics gave me a better understanding of why things are built the way they are. While the point of lectures was not necessarily to memorize buildings or architects, I wish he put in the names of buildings and architects on the slides so we could reference them in the future. I also wish there was a stronger focus on non American and Western work. Most of the non-Western architecture we looked at was Japanese architecture, but there was not a consistent narrative, like we sort of had with looking at Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright's works all semester. Other than that, I really liked the class.",
                "I liked how everyone would critique your work",
                "Strengths: lecture course was extremely well organized and thoroughly engaging. The topics are genuinely interesting not just for architecture majors but everyone as we all live within and react to the built world. \r\nWeaknesses: I found the readings to be dense at times and not particularly engaging with the course itself. (I would spend hours reading the assigned readings but they were never directly discussed in lecture or section).",
                "Strengths: manageable lecture times, great TFs, not much homework, really fun topics (for me)\r\nWeaknesses: barely ever talk to the actual professor and rarely ever interacting with other students of the class except those in our actual discussion group",

Even if you don't have experience sketching, this is a wonderful opportunity to improve and the TAs definitely did not assume that people had prior experience in drawing. Easily one of my favorite classes at Yale!",
                "I would! A wonderful introduction to architecture and Professor Purves is incredibly knowledgeable.",
                "Yes  it teaches you a new approach to viewing space and understand your place within it.",
                "yes if you like to draw/want to develop your drawing skills",
                "Yes 100% because it changes how you view the world and physically making models and sketches is very rewarding.",
                "Yes I would because it was a good different type of work.",
                "Yes, definitely. I was taking the class as a senior non-architecture major and could not have had a better experience.",
                "I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about architecture, even if you don't plan to major in it! I'm a physics major but really enjoyed it.",
                "yes possibly",
                "If you are a student within any other major, this course is perfect as an introduction to basic architecture while allowing you to explore what the major is like. I would recommend this course as it was quite simple and interesting. However, there are a lot of readings and if a 9:20 am class isn't your style be cautious.",
                "Yes!!! Youll learn to appreciate the application of imagination in human buildings and cities around you. Plus drawing and making your own structures is very satisfying",
                "Yes, whether they are planning on majoring in arch or just curious about it, the class caters to all levels of beginners.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student unless you are an architecture major and need it as a requirement. The lectures were dry and the information itself focused more on the history of architecture rather than its actual practice. The sections were extremely awkward and tough to get through and it was clear that the majority of the students were just skating by. The drawing elements of this class can be fun but it is not pushed enough to be something that can grow as a skill.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course! It's a great break from more traditional classes and a nice introduction to architecture (i.e. you don't need to know anything and you will learn a lot if you put in the time).",
                "Yes, it's a great introduction to truly seeing the built environment. Drawing assignments are fun and no previous art experience is necessary. Discussion sections are fun and it's great to see your classmates' works.",
                "YES! YES! YES! Even if you are not an architecture major.",
                "Im conflicted - I think yes, so long as you really have time and enthusiasm to dedicate to your sketchbook and to drawing outside of the immediate scope of the assignments. I would also want to be taking a class (or doing work on my own) that supplemented this with more radical pedagogies and readings.",
                "Absolutely. Even if you're not an architecture major or artor any humanities, it was a wonderful way to look at the world differently.",
                "Absolutely. This course was a fantastic mix of creativity and analysis. Anyone who even considers taking this course should take.",
                "Yes.",
                "I would. I think architecture is something worth learning about for people in any discipline. And perspective arch majors have to take it. I think it is a good taste of a lot of different aspects of architecture as a field and a major so it is good to have as a way of figuring out what to do.",
                "Yes! A lot of fun- very different form your other work if you aren't an arts/architecture major. The TAs were supportive and constructive in their feedback, and it was very accessible and fun for those with no background in the subject. Highly recommend as a class to take out of your comfort zone",
                "I would recommend this course to any student because this is a course where you don't need prior drawing knowledge and a place where growth is the thing that matters most. Also, it allows you to explore a new field in a fun way, which is drawing buildings in different types of ways.",
                "yes!",
                "Yes, it was interesting",
                "If you are interested in the architecture or computing & the arts majors you might have to take this class as a requirement. But for everyone else, I would highly recommend taking this class if you're looking for something very low workload. All you have is weekly drawing assignments and two very low-key design projects. You will never be directly tested on any material covered in lectures, but it is still worth going because it's interesting! Also, I came into this class thinking I was going to do a lot of hands-on things. This could not have been further from the truth. Lectures are almost entirely theory based, and the weekly drawing assignments did not really live up to the authentic architecture studio experience that I was imagining.  Lastly, I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you're really worried about getting straight As. We did not get a single grade all semester, and I have no idea how I'll do in the class. Wish me luck!",
                "Yes! Great opportunity to draw, understand the choices that go into making buildings, and meet great people.",
                "Yes - Alexander Purves is a legend and the class is exceptional. So much to learn and know, and Professor Purves puts so much of himself into his instruction. I highly recommend.",
                "Yes. It teaches us how architecture is very much related to our everyday day.",
                "Yes! If you want to learn more about architecture and practice looking at the world a little differently, I would definitely recommend this course. You will have a newfound appreciation of the amazing buildings on campus and smaller details. The workload was not very heavy, but I would say it is a greater time commitment/more difficult if you have not practiced drawing before. But, don't let that stop you from taking this course and working on your observational drawing skills.",
                "Yes. The class is low-stress and the assignments are kind of fun. The one annoying part of this class is that you don't receive a single grade the entire semester, so it's almost impossible to have a clear sense of how you're doing in the class. But if you take this class Cr/D/F, it's low-stress and a great 5th class.",
                "Definitely take this if you want to see yourself grow",
                "I would recommend this course because the content is presented in an interesting way and the assignments force you to think in new ways.",
                "Absolutely. And not just for architecture majors. I really think this is one of the best intro courses at Yale that everyone should take. You get to learn how to view design from different angles and develop a more critical, intentional, and creative approach to problem-solving.",
                "YES! Great introductory class to all of what architecture is, and honestly isn't even bad at all for people not interested in architecture. A lot of what I learned in this class tied into my other classes on colonial history urban design as well as urban planning today. So, there are definitely a lot of useful and applicable fields that I got out from this class.",
                "Yes! Lectures were always enjoyable and changed the way I look and experience buildings. I really appreciated having a class I was able to be creative in - homework assignments mostly consist of drawing or designing small structures. It was always fun to see how others approached assignments in section."
