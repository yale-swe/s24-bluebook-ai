                "A strength is that most of this class was a discussion. A weakness was the Friday writing lab because everyone did not want to be writing on a Friday afternoon and I was not productive at all.",
                "I loved the workshop format of the class and the writing labs. That said, the timing of the writing labs was a bit inconvenient (1-4 every Friday). Also, the course could have been more organized at times. All in all, I loved the course and loved the texts we had the opportunity to explore.",
                "Strengths: the content (Gilgamesh, Antigone, Ramayana, Woman at War, Of the Coming of John, the parts of the Bible we read), all really interesting texts and mostly new to me (except Odyssey, which was the least fun but still makes sense in the course), reading load was very manageable with only a few crunch weeks.  I really liked the times where we broke out into small groups and then shared in seminar and wished we had done that more earlier in the year. \r\nWeaknesses: assignments not being posted on time was really the biggest issue. The seminar environment was tense at times, and it's hard to say how to address this given that every group dynamic will be different. \r\n\r\n*Note about Woman at War: I liked having the screening at the end, it was a nice way to tie together the course.",
                "This course could be improved if we had miniature writing assignments due throughout the semester to hone our academic essay-writing skills even further.",
                "The class was extremely engaging and proactive. However, I felt like sometimes some voices overpowered others in class discussions."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because you receive so much feedback on your writing and you will become a better writer by taking the class.",
                "If you like writing and reading, yes.",
                "I would recommend this course to another student, mostly because I liked the majority of works we read and I think it is a good introduction to humanities at the college level. However, I would warn them about the writing lab. It is long (though the snack break provided by profs is weekly and nice), and often it's more about Yale's different resources (Beineke, Art Gallery) than it is about writing. This is fine and helpful for a first year, but not that fun in the moment, and if you are really looking to just write a ton, this is not going to give you that. The lab usually ends up being time to work on an essay either alone or with a TF or Professor, which is useful when we have an essay due, but there are only two essays the whole semester! This means you get a lot of time for each one, which is a blessing and a curse; it's easy to get bored of it and burn out or to procrastinate. For a writing credit it honestly didn't feel like that much writing. This course definitely encourages you to break away from a high school writing style, which is great if you really take on that challenge; you get out what you put in.",
                "Yes, specifically the lab was very helpful."
