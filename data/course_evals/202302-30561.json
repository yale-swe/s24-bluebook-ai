It is necessary for one to take their muscles towards, or to the point of failure, in order to achieve respectable strength and hypertrophic gains. I utilize the same principle for language: one has to place themselves in situations where their language skills are stretched to the limit to alert the brain that neurological adjustments are necessary.\r\n-Weaknesses: Structured Conversations; One thing that I did not enjoy as much was that our discussions of the books often turned into mere summaries of the text; there were many times where my class started to talk more philosophically about the texts, but many of these discussions were somewhat ended by our professor in order to talk about what happened next in the book. I think that these freeform discussions could have helped our spoken French a lot if they were facilitated more often."

I now feel very comfortable with conversation with most anyone in French, and I think that I should be able to achieve fluency in around 6 months with consistent work, and L5. With this class, the immersive environment of host families and Paris, and a bit of extra effort (try audiobooks of books you already love in English\/your native language, and paper books as well), and you should grow a lot in your French abilities. I have taken French for 11 months, and I feel close to fluent, the French program at Yale is superb.",
