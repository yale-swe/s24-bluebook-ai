            "comments": [
                "A quick review of basic topics would be helpful in the beginning of the course.",
                "The lectures were a clear weakness of the course. A lot of the topics felt random and disjointed. For example, we learned about neurogenesis before gastrulation, so it was not in chronological or thematic order. It was also unclear the concepts we were expected to know. There seemed to be little conceptual organization of the slides, and they often used experiments to illustrate a concept without actually explaining it. It was also unclear when we needed to know details for quizzes and when it was more a general idea, for example, the specific protein residues modified is very specific. Also, we usually did not get to the last slides, forcing us to learn them on our own. It also felt that the concepts covered in class had little to do with what was discussed in section, and section did not provide a space to go over questions from class. The research proposal homework also felt like it had nothing to do with what was discussed in lecture.",
                "Strength: quizzes every week forced me to study and stay more engaged. Dropping 2 quizzes and 1 homework was a big plus as well. I liked how the hw all built up to one project, too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the course felt very disorganized. The sequence in which topics were taught was confusing to me, particularly with development. Lecture slides were nearly incomprehensible, and it would take me hours just to understand the general ideas from the slides even after attending class. Very very specific details from neuroscience were used as examples for broader ideas in development, which made it harder to understand rather than easier. We were consistently told not to focus on the minute (neuroscientific) details, but were consistently quizzed on them and expected to know them. We were told that the slides and quizzes weren't to trick us, but again, the lecture slides were very disorganized and difficult to interpret, and quizzes were nearly impossible to complete in time.",
                "This is a difficult course whose concepts are hard to grasp, and so I wish we had more opportunities to ask questions during lecture or do interactive activities (talk with a partner, discuss problems, etc.).",
                "I think the quizzes are unnecessarily difficult considering the 15 minute time allotment given to take them. I think a longer time of 25 mins, or a shorter quiz would be better. I also think there was misleading language in the course where the professor would say things were about the bigger picture, and didn't require memorization of the specifics, and would then proceed to quiz us on the specific function of something like BMP4 or the AER, making it hard to prepare for specificity for quizzes and exams. I also think the key concepts are not very illustrative of what should be the main takeaway of lecture. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, I really enjoyed section with Liqun. I liked the structure of discussion, and enjoyed doing the homework and getting to produce a proposal as a final product in the course.",
                "This class was simply too much-- it was about 70% of my workload, and I am taking orgo and the human brain. The original research assignment is a terrible thing to give, since there is barely any guidance. What details are needed is unclear (especially for the final exam) and the quizzes need to be less time constrained-- 15 minutes for original thinking is simply too short.",
                "Course is well planned but lecture are unclear",
                "Strengths: The slides Prof. Zhong prepares are thorough and detailed. They're consistently organized and easy to sort through. I appreciate that he made them available to us.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is organized into lectures with weekly quizzes, psets, and discussion sections. These three have nearly no overlap in content outside of being related to genetics and development. This makes BIOL 103 feel like three mini-classes, all of which you need to stay on top of and prepare for. I think a great improvement would be to homogenize the content between the three so that the class feels more cohesive. The quizzes were also very difficult to prepare for, as they were often confusingly worded and many questions required students to remember minute details from the very long lectures. I thought the short-answer questions on the quizzes were a great way to assess our deeper understanding of the content, and would like more of the minute-detail oriented questions to be replaced with questions similar to the short-answer questions. A simple, but very helpful change, would be to have someone go through the quizzes, carefully read each question, and then rephrase the confusing questions to be more clear. Lastly, I wish that Prof. Zhong would go back through the slides, decide what the most important concepts are, and then focus on teaching only those concepts and slowing down the lectures. We were often pressed for time due to the many extraneous details he elected to teach us about, which were fun and insightful, but ultimately took away from the fundamental concepts that were at the core of the class. Often times, it felt like he would wave away questions and clarification so that they could be posted EdDiscussion. Although EdDiscussion is a valuable tool, I feel like it should not be relied on in place of the professor themself clarifying a concept. Lastly, students should have more time on the quizzes, so they may actually demonstrate their higher understanding of the material without being too stressed by the 15 minute time limit.",
                "A strength of the course was that it used actual experiments to teach the concepts which helped me to conceptualize how they actually apply to biology. A weakness of the course is that it was taught very poorly. Another weakness of the course is that the weekly homework assignments barely relate to the concepts we are learning in class at all. I understand that writing a research proposal is an important skill to have, I just think that it should be taught separately, in a lab class perhaps, and the homework should have been problem sets that would help us to understand the material we were being tested on. It felt as though I was going into each quiz blind with no idea of what I was actually expected to be able to do.",
                "I would say a strength of the course was Professor Loreng, as his enrichment sessions and office hours were quite helpful. I also felt that my TF did a good job leading/sustaining class discussions about scientific papers that we read for discussion sections. Other than that, I felt that this course could be improved in many ways. Lectures were taught poorly and did not start from the basics, but rather gave super-specific examples without providing students with definitions or general explanations of those concepts in the first place. Also, I thought that the assignments for this class could be improved. Specifically, the weekly writing assignments culminating in a research proposal did not seem relevant to the actual course content. It was good practice searching existing literature and writing in a scientific voice, but I think for an intro biology class (especially one that is not taught very clearly) it would be much more helpful to have homeworks that reinforce actual class concepts and  ask us to apply our knowledge in a way similar to what we are asked to do on quizzes.",
                "The strength was that is covered a tremendous amount of material. The weakness was that many concepts were brushed over.",
                "Strengths: My TF was an amazing lecturer. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The 15 minutes quizzes making learning stressful. The format of the class where students ask for clarification but get a response of \"we will get to it later\" and then not getting to the material. The lack of office hours by the principal lecturer.",
                "A weakness of this course was the lectures and quizzes. The lecture slides were not concise and was very difficult to understand outside of the classroom. During lectures, the professor would rush through the slides and would skip over many. The quizzes were not helpful since these types of questions would not be presented during lecture.",
                "A major weakness is that the structure of the course leaves little room for improvement. You get the results for quiz 1 back right around the time you're taking quiz 3 or after you've taken it, and it's hard to improve and understand the structure of the course when everything moves so fast. The extended homework assignment also has this pace. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness is that lectures aren't recorded. All lectures should be recorded or easily accessible for accessibility purposes.",
                "I thought the content of the course is very relevant. However, the lectures were often disengaging, and some of the more difficult concepts were not well explained. I had to often self-study some of the concepts that were rushed at the end of lecture. Repeating the words on the slides was not very helpful to my understanding of the concepts. I wish there were more concrete examples to supplement the concepts.",
                "The strengths are that it provides several useful resources for students, and the weaknesses are that it could definitely be structured better in that students who were sick do not have to just simply drop the quiz they missed, but instead get a fair chance of taking that quiz.",
                "The strength of this course was the fact that it was only half a semester. The weaknesses of this course were numerous: poor teaching by the professor, poorly-written and harshly graded quizzes, little TF support, and tedious homework assignments. The professor had very high expectations of students who may have been taking a course in development and genetics for the first time. Instead of having patience, the professor was quickly frustrated with student inability and fervently defended his teaching style. He accused students of writing bad evaluations for their own lack of understanding and made everyone in the lecture feel uncomfortable. The quizzes he gave had questions (particularly the T/F ones) that were poorly-worded such that it was always ambiguous, leading students to lose points not because they did not know the answer but because they did not understand the question. They also couldnt ask for help because the quizzes were only 15 minutes long. The quizzes should be at least 25 minutes long or be shorter in length as it takes time to read through and understand the experimental design questions. Also, much of the lecture content was marked as only for information, not tested on but then still appeared in vocabulary questions and throughout other quiz questions, causing students to spend an exorbitant amount of time memorizing details of experiments that were poorly explained during lecture. Additionally, TFs for the class were essentially absent; only one TF ran the Review Session. Lastly, the homework assignments on writing a research proposal were ridiculous. It was set up like a Gingerbread House in which students build a premade proposal. Each step was delineated in a way that restricted student freedom and made it very difficult to meet all their criteria. This is also unrealistic as, in reality, it takes a very long time to review literature, design experiments, and craft an eloquent research proposal.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Loreng is helpful and well-organized. Material is generally interesting. The project was pretty interesting, since we were allowed to choose a disease and gene that interested us.\r\nWeaknesses: Everything else. Graders were awful taking off random points with little explanation, which reflects very poorly on the course and its instructors. Prof. Zhong's quizzes and final exam were quite difficult and seemed to often have focus on small details despite continuous emphasis on the \"larger themes\" in class. The slides are outdated, often confusing, and the prof. doesn't get through most of the slides and assigns them as \"homework to go over on your own.\"",
                "It could be hard to improve grades on the weekly quizzes since we did not receive feedback on the previous one until after the next quiz. It would be helpful if the key terms for the course were clearly written somewhere as it could get confusing with the slides which information we were responsible for.",
                "This course is incredibly interesting. It teaches you not only the scientific basis for a lot of development/genetics, but also the ways in which scientists discovered many of the underlying mechanisms/processes involved in these larger themes. However, the class is much too fast-paced. The lectures regularly bounce from topic to topic in a manner that is illogical and incredibly hard to follow. Examples are seldom explained and the students are more often than not left confused and without guidance. The homework involving a research proposal should come with much more instruction and explanation. The quizzes are very difficult and I believe students would fare much better if they were provided with practice exams or problem sets. Overall, the class is very interesting and I really did enjoy it, but it is unnecessarily stressful and I believe it should be significantly restructured in order for students to have a more positive learning experience in the class.",
                "Strengths: I liked having the homework be a project instead of traditional problem sets. It requires the same amount, if not more effort and time, but is way less scary than problem sets and easier to get a good grade if you put in the time.\r\nWeaknesses: There is just so much material, it was hard to feel like I was really learning as opposed to just memorizing.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.",
                "The lectures are packed with content, some of which does not appear on exams/quizzes. These lectures are fast paced and difficult to understand without the background knowledge developed in BIOL101 and 102. I felt the problem sets for the course were fair but quite unrelated to the actual topics discussed in lecture.",
                "There was a lot of memorization and less connection of concepts to each other.",
                "One of the main strengths of the course was the chance to learn more about concepts in discussion sessions and peer tutoring. I benefited greatly from these opportunities to have concepts and ideas reexplained to me by a different person. This course also had many weaknesses. One of the biggest ones was the fast paced nature of the lectures. The lectures were often timed filled with too much information that wasn't even tested for. I think it would really help students if the information in the lectures that was actually on quizzes would be prioritized instead of the non-tested material. Spending even a few more minutes on these key concepts would help students fully comprehend the core material of the class. Another weakness would be how slow the quizzes would get back to us. Based on the grading system of the class, knowing how I've done on quizzes not only helped me understand if I was getting better at answering the question format but also helped me see how I stood in the class overall.",
                "Strengths - Professor Loreng. he is a king. he deserves to be teaching this entire sequence if it wasn't too much work for him because he makes everything make so much more sense and is a literal gem!!!! i am forever a loreng stan.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - everything else. I was literally going through a breakup and attending BIOL 103 was still the worst part of my week. Professor Zhong is such a nice man, but lecturing is not something he should be doing. The material is already difficult enough, however Professor Zhong would not answer questions in class with anything other than \"that's a good question, what do you think?\" like we don't know, that's why we're asking because we're clueless, or \"we'll get to that in a future lecture\" when it is was a question on a topic that would be on a quiz before said future lecture. Also, the structure of the course was ridiculous. Quizzes would be held on Wednesdays based on material from the previous Wednesday (awesome, a week to study this material) and Monday, with literally 2 days to study it. It would be better if quizzes were held on Mondays with material from the previous week.",
                "the professor simply reads off of the slides and doesn't do the best job with pacing so we would often have to cram in several slides worth of content with in the last few minutes. That being said, the actual content of the class was very engaging and interesting, and taught students about a lot of real world techniques you can implement and use in the lab- which made it even more upsetting that we weren't able to fully digest the content.",
                "strengths- enrichment and professor Loreng\r\n\r\nweaknesses- everything else",
                "The strengths of this course are the amount of resources. From enrichment sessions to an army of TA's and TF's to an anonymous discussion board, it's pretty easy to have a question answered. Some weaknesses to the course are structural preparedness for exams. Without study guides or something of that nature, it's difficult to prepare adequately for parts of the class that matter most.",
                "The slides are very information heavy and the teacher often uses jargon that is unnecessarily complex for the point he is trying to get across. The information is interesting if presented in the right manner.",
                "The lectures were not helpful. The explanation of the material was not good and I spent hours having to review every single lecture because I had to teach myself everything.",
                "Could be taught at a slightly slower pace I think? I thought the weekly quizzes made it more necessary to study",
                "The strengh of this class was that it was very in depth. However, I think we spent too much time going over niche examples about neurons that were not conducive to understanding the concept with such a complicated framework.",
                "The strengths of this course is that it follows an extremely unique aspect of biology that I have never learned before. I've never taken a class that delves this deep into embryo development. However, a few weaknesses are that the curriculum is a little difficult to follow in a chronological sense and at times it feels like we are either repeating or skipping over information. I think it would better to start from the beginning of development and incorporate genetics throughout and go through simpler vocabulary and work our way up to advanced levels rather than showing varied embryonic development stages and overanalyzing these stages.",
                "The slides were sparse and oftentimes, difficult concepts were not explained. The weekly quizzes were also hard to prepare for.",
                "i dont think the research assignments every week were very beneficial. studying for a quiz every week already took up a lot of my time, and i felt like the writing assignments didnt help me engage with the material any better and actually sometimes took time away from studying for the quizzes, which were already hard to study for.",

                "The lectures were very dense and not very well explained.",
                "I thought the lectures were somewhat disjointed from the material, as in I found myself doing a lot of learning on my own.  Slides were dense with information and some things he would test on, and others he wouldn't. I felt like I was memorizing more than learning at times.",
                "A strength of the course was the detailed and interesting slide presentations. I enjoyed going through Professor Zhong's slides and felt like they were presented well. \r\nA weakness of the course were the weekly quizzes. I never fully understood how to do well on the weekly quizzes. They felt as though there was some disconnect between what I was being taught vs. what I was expected to answer questions on. Some quiz questions would be based on the slide presentations, while others would require making clever connections between a concept and a potential experiment to test the concept. I didn't feel like there was enough to help us prepare for these quizzes.",
                "Strength: I learned to apply research topics.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course tried to stuff too much content into a half-semester class, making it incredibly hard to get clarity of course material. Moreover, the professor often rushed the last 12 slides at the end of class, so it was incredibly hard to understand the material. I feel that the lectures could have been clearer. The quizzes were also difficult to complete in 15 minutes, which left very little time to think and fully process the problems.",
                "terrible professor/ incomprehensible/ incredibly unorganized",
                "Strengths: course was organized well and allowed for methodical planning and delegation of work (weekly quizzes on 2 content from two lectures, reading/annotating a scientific paper, and working towards the final grant proposal project. Felt manageable. \r\nWeaknesses: dense in terms of information (felt fast paced), lecture slides did not provide sufficient information when reviewing to supplement learning/fill-in points missed in class, instructor did not have office hours and instead used an online Q&A platform.",

                "I liked the content, so it was interesting to me. However, it was very hard to study for the class because the slides were not helpful post lecture.",
                "Although this course was difficult because of the packed schedule (weekly quizzes and writing assignments), I thought that I gained a good general understanding of genetics and developmental biology. I thought that some of the topics were a little bit rushed (we rarely got through all the slides on Wednesdays when we had quizzes), and at times I felt that my engagement in the class was mostly driven by my intrinsic interest in the topics rather than also by the way they were presented. The professor did improve my general insight into biology, but I felt at times that they were too quick in dismissing questions (sometimes interrupting the question and as a result misunderstanding it). I did appreciate the weekly quizzes as they kept me on track with the class's content, but again, they often cut the lecture short. I like that the professor highlighted specific information on the slide, but sometimes it could be extremely confusing as sometimes the main points were expressed too briefly/out of context. So, this course could be improved by addressing the points above."

                "Not unless you need to take it for your major. I don't think this would really inspire me to explore genetics- though to be honest as a pre-med, I think concern over my standing in the course took precedence over trying to enjoy the material.",
                "Yes it opens up a lot of higher level biology classes and provides a good foundation",
                "No, unless you must take it. It's a lot of work, frustrating, and stressful. I dreaded coming to lectures because I knew that I was going to have to teach all of the content to myself later that night anyway. The quizzes are stressful because they cover both last Wednesday's and Monday's lecture content in only 15 minutes, and are often confusingly worded to the point where I wonder if they were intentionally designed to be frustrating. \r\n\r\nA few genuinely good points of this course were that the discussion sections were fun, my TA was great, and the psets will eat up a lot of your time, but  come with clear instructions and guidance.",
                "Not really. It was extremely difficult and I think that it just because of how poorly it was taught. I suppose I might recommend it to another student just because it is a prerequisite to so many majors and I had to take it. But in terms of how much I learned and enjoyed it, I would not take it again otherwise.",

                "If this student were truly passionate about Biology and would want to go in depth, then yes.",
                "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. I understand that nearly all students who take this course are doing so to fulfill a major prerequisite. That being said, this is hands-down the worst course I have taken thus far at Yale. This institution should be embarrassed that this is their introductory biology course. For a school that is aiming to bolster their STEM department and attract more STEM-focused students, the impression is that the faculty dont seem to care about effective teaching in biology. The course was a set of lectures heavily skewed towards development, even more so towards neurodevelopment with a few key concepts at the beginning and end of lectures, and a jumble of incomprehensible experiments sandwiched in the middle. Students were always confused. Peer tutors tried their best to help. The strictly-timed quizzes didnt match the content taught and the professor was in a world of his own. Everyone couldnt wait for it to be over.",
                "No. But you're probably taking this course because you have to. The prof has terribly confusing and outdated slides and does not explain concepts well in lecture. The grading varies by TA but some TAs are awful at their jobs. TA Raghav had a massive ego and continuously flexed how many publications he had in large journals while neglecting to teach us anything. Ed Discussion was also provided as a resource but the instructors and TAs had very slow or no responses. While this course was terrible in pretty much every way, I don't entirely blame the teaching staff, as I think the half-semester length of the bio sequences courses is set up to fail. It is simply impossible to teach such a broad scope of information in such a short amount of time. Hopefully, Yale can fix the bio sequence soon.",
                "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who wasn't required to take it.",
                "Yes and no. I believe it is a class that teachers you a lot of valuable skills in terms of working under a lot of pressure and absorbing a large amount of information. However, this class is incredibly difficult and I would not have made it through if I did not have a strong passion for biology. If you need to take this class, of course take it, but if its not a requirement I would not recommend this course. There are plenty of other biology courses that would be less stressful and would be a lot easier to succeed in.",

I'm not taking it, but my friend is, and I've begun to attend the lectures. I find it much more interesting and informative than BIOL 103. I was hoping to understand the underlying systems that facilitate the process of development, how certain genes work and interact with others, and we rarely ever learned about the function of a gene, but rather we had to take the test/quiz writer's word for it.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student reluctantly, as I believe it should only be taken if required as a pre-requisite. The material was demanding and required a significant amount of investment outside of class time to comprehend/understand (with often little additional guidance or support). If you are looking for a general science-credit or exposure to genetics, seek out another course that is paced over a longer period of time and lower stakes.",

                "This course being a prereq for many majors makes it unavoidable which is very unfortunate as it is incredibly lacking in its goal of preparation for future courses. I walked out of this course having learned a random assortment of concepts and experimental evidence for those concepts, yet I feel that I did not receive a general education of the principles of genetics and development. Instead, everything seemed poorly planned and taught while being sold as a course that is supposed to teach broad concepts.",
                "Most student who take it need to take it, so for those I would say good luck. It takes up a lot of time studying for the quizzes, and they are a combination of application but also memorization of a lot information, and it is essential to understand the initial concepts because it builds up so fast.",
                "Yesif you are a life-sciences-related major/pre-med student, you need to take this class anyway. Regardless of major or path, this class provided some important insights into understanding your own biology and a greater appreciation for life."
