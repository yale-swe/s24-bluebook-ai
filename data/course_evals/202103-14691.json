Also, since assignments are spread all throughout the semester, there was never any point in the semester where you feel overwhelmed, and that definitely was a plus.",

The content we covered and discussions we had in class really put many things into perspective, and I always left the class feeling more relaxed.

Dr. Fitzgerald is a great professor that emphasizes class discussion, and I feel like I got a lot out of the course and am now much more interested in diving deeper into Buddhist topics.",
