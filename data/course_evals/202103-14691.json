I also learned how to think critically about Buddhism and express what I have learned in both writing and creative outlets. I have gained a better understand of my own life and goals, and have a different perspective on stress, happiness, and permanence.",

Dr. Fitzgerald is also an awesome professor and provides insightful feedback on assignments. Also, since assignments are spread all throughout the semester, there was never any point in the semester where you feel overwhelmed, and that definitely was a plus.",

                "Very engaging content, loved the videos (documentary, YouTube, etc) It would be great if there was less reading. Would have preferred more discussion based classroom instead of lecture based.",

The content we covered and discussions we had in class really put many things into perspective, and I always left the class feeling more relaxed. I also learned a lot about Tibetan Buddhism and various Tibetan artists, and I'm leaving the class with a better cultural understanding of Tibet and new songs I enjoy!",
                "Most definitely! It's a great course to get introduced to Buddhist principles and ideals (of which I was totally unfamiliar with before the semester). Dr. Fitzgerald is a great professor that emphasizes class discussion, and I feel like I got a lot out of the course and am now much more interested in diving deeper into Buddhist topics.",
