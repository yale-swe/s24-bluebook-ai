                "Strengths: The topic is really interesting, and Professor Kaliambou is very knowledgeable about it and enthusiastic about it. She is also very supportive when students are interested in certain topics and is responsive to emails. The reading load is reasonable as well. Weaknesses: I didn't like the group-aspect of the presentation assignment. Professor Kaliambou can be intimidating at times.",
                "The content of the course was informative and engaging, however style of teaching left much to be desired.",
                "I think this is a very strong course with engaging material. The professor gives good feedback on student writing.",
                "I think this course could be improved by making it more seminar/discussion based. I feel like there was a lot of review of knowledge, but it wasn't overall that much covered. It was a bit of a weird mix of seminar/lecture. I really enjoyed when we as a class would talk about things and just let the conversation go."
