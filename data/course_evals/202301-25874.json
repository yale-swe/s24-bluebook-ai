            "comments": [
                "Strengths: I really liked how the paper prompts were pretty open ended--allowed us to really focus on something we found interesting. I thought class time was effectively used to help interpret specific poems and learn about certain linguistic aspects that would have been difficult to pick up on for non-Japanese speakers like me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes lectures were a bit disorganized and weekly readings were often hard to access. I would have liked to do a general overview at the very beginning of the semester of different Japanese poetic time periods (Heian, Buddhist Era, Meiji, etc) to help us contextualize all the content.",
                "Faster grading wouldve been helpful (maybe it needs a TA next time?)  but it was overall a great course. Discussions \/ readings were always interesting and I found the essays satisfying to write.",
                "Strengths: the content of the course is super interesting! It's something that I hadn't known anything about before taking the course, and I don't think anyone else in the class did either. The professor is super nice, and the classroom environment was really chill and comfortable and discussions were fun. The professor was really accommodating when we needed to ask for extensions. Weaknesses: We didn't get any feedback on any of our essays before the end of the semester (nor any grades at all), so it was hard\/impossible to know if we were meeting the professor's expectations in the essays.",
                "This class is very interesting and clear organized. The readings are well selected to keep up with the classs progress and are interesting to learn about. The workload is manageable, and Professor Scanlon-Canegata creates a comfortable class atmosphere that facilitates discussion.",
                "The discussions were very enjoyable; the class had a great vibe. I also felt like everyones opinions were welcome. One thing that could be worked on is smoother accessibility to course content: it would be nice if every week was clearly outlined, perhaps in the modules folder on canvas. This is likely just due to the novelty of the course, though, so I have no doubts it will be resolved in future years.",
                "Strengths: good teacher, good at lecturing, very interesting material.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the reading assignments were confusingly laid out or difficult to find.",
                "The strengths of this course was how quickly my professor responded to questions and how interactive the course was. He truly understood the difficulty of being a student at such an institution and provided words of comfort and encouragement. Many of his lessons were well thought out and captivating. The only weakness was the areas to find homework in which he improved the moment we addressed the issue!"

I had never read Japanese poetry or literature before, and this course definitely made me want to explore it more in my free time.",

                "Yes. This class is suitable for people who wants to learn about the basics of Japanese poetry , even if they have no experience with the language. The class is well-taught and people can bring any thoughts about Japanese poetry, no matter if sophisticated, to the class discussion.",
