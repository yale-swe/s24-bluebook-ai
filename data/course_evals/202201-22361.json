                "I really improved my understanding of spanish, particularly reading and writing. I can now critique movies, short stories, and other media in spanish and I wrote a critical essay in spanish. I can confidently say I am conversational in spanish now.",
                "Through the prompt and applicable feedback of my professor, I learned to apply critical thinking skills while writing essays\/responses in Spanish, rather than simply focusing on conveying what I wanted to say in English. The complexity of my responses was stretched, which challenged me to be even more clear in Spanish than I had been when I focused primarily on grammar.",
                "I developed a better understanding of the Spanish grammar and have learned to write, read, and speak better.",
                "I developed a more thorough understanding of the Spanish language. Speaking, grammar, and writing were all emphasized as well as a lot of reading Spanish texts. These texts and the book at the end were very helpful in practicing deep analysis as well as speaking in another language.",
                "I improved my Spanish, learned how to engage with harder readings\/video content, and present better in Spanish",
                "My Spanish speaking, reading and writing skills are all greatly improved. My Spanish is now proficient. I also gained greater understanding of Latin American culturen and society.",
                "In this class, I learned how to communicate my thoughts in the Spanish language and transfer these thoughts onto paper. I improved on my overall Spanish verbal and reading skills."

                "Strengths: Some activities and projects were really enjoyable and not graded too harshly. \r\nWeaknesses: Some assignments don't have too much purpose and students just kind of complete them to complete them.",
                "Maria Jos was amazing and so nice and supportive. I really enjoyed her way of teaching. A weakness would be that the homework wasn't posted until late in the day.",
                "I think sometimes the work can feel like busy work and the course moves too fast. Particularly when reading Relato de un nufrago I wouldve liked to spend more time on a chapter to really absorb it and take the time to look up words. Those days homework would take 3+ hours for this class and thats too much to balance with other classes.",
                "The pace was difficult to adjust to, and I would have preferred more opportunities for conversational language practice, rather than projects\/presentations. However, I loved the focus on literature and art from Spanish-speaking authors which undergirded every unit.",
                "Strengths would be the variety of different assignments in the course and the level of engagement. Weaknesses are none for me.",
                "Great teacher and good communication on how to improve between the teacher and student. To be improved, maybe develop grammar points more in classes.",
                "It's a pretty standard Spanish course. I liked the different materials we used mostly (with a few exceptions for some that just didn't seem to make much sense or tried too hard to be related to the theme). I liked that the main focus wasn't on grammar but I still found myself improving over the semester. Professor Gutierrez Barajas helped with that a lot.",
                "This course is very organized so our skills can be developed progressively and gradually throughout the term. It doesn't have a weakness because I think this is probably the best Spanish class I have ever taken.",
                "This class offers various forms of literature, movies, and short-clips that keep the class fully engaged. I don't believe there to be any weaknesses considering that the course was very well-organized."

                "I would recommend this course for anyone who wants an extra push to continue learning Spanish language after high school; this course made me want to stick with and add to the growth I've had learning Spanish in the past.",
                "Yes, if they would like to learn more Spanish culture",
                "Anyone wishing to explore Spanish, specifically in terms of expanding reading skills, analysis, and becoming more comfortable with speaking in public should take this course.",
                "If you take the class, take it with Professor Gutierrez Barajas. The class is usually required, but I didn't mind it compared to other language courses. The curriculum isn't up to the individual professors so the content will be the same no matter what professor is teaching.",
                "Yes!",
                "I would absolutely recommend it to any student who wishes to study Spanish at Yale as a foreign language. This will help the student improve their Spanish very quickly and the good design of the course means that it would not be overwhelming for anyone."
