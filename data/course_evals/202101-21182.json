                "This course was nice in that there was both a lecture component in which we were able to learn about the background and uses for the techniques, and also a more practical component in which we were coding and applying the techniques ourselves. It was also nice that the course facilitated student discussion and collaboration on psets.",
                "This class was very informative and fun! I don't see anything that wrong with it.",
                "breakout rooms didnt really foster much collaboration, i think this course is probably a lot more doable in an in-person setting. final project was cool, and had a lot of options to work with different datasets.",
                "The lecture was very engaging, and I really appreciated the fact that the professor paused at each step to make sure everyone understood the material. As a minor weakness, the notebook sometimes contained error or misinstruction.",
                "Strengths: engaging lectures, fair homework assignments, useful material, fantastic TFs\r\nWeaknesses: only having 1 day to do the homework - Wednesdays tend to be the busiest day of the week for most students (I for example had 4 lectures on Wednesdays) so even just 1 more day to do the homework every week (which would also make sense since students likely won't be as busy on Thursdays if they're taking a 3hr Tuesday lab) would have alleviated a lot of stress. I basically couldn't do anything other than this class on Wednesdays after my lectures, which wasn't always fair to the other courses I had quizzes\/tests in on Wednesdays. It's also kind of hard to really remember the material from prior weeks when the whole course is crammed into less than a day and a half of each week. I understand the sentiment of not wanting students to spend a long time on the assignments, but I think 2 days to do the homework instead of just 1 would be a lot more fair. Otherwise, great course though.",
                "Incredibly well organized, clear + constructive feedback. Grading scheme was clear from the start. Turk-Browne and Tristan (TA) were both incredibly responsive, accommodating, and overwhelmingly wonderful. Best class I've taken at Yale!",
                "Perhaps it can be improved with posting the solutions of the notebook after its due? It can be helpful to look at another of doing things, especially when just starting out and when youre trying to learn how to gain better coding practices.",
                "The weekly notebook due the next day after class was very helpful. I think I did most of my learning for this class while working on this project. While it is a very quick turnaround, it is enough time to work on it if you budget well. They were very rewarding!"

                "Yes! This course was a pretty deep dive into fMRI-related analysis techniques, and provides a solid foundation for thinking about why and how researchers address problems and questions they're interested in. It also introduced us to various recent papers and research using the methods we learned, which was cool.",

                "yes take it if you want to learn cutting edge techniques in fmri analysis. like its actually so relevant and really cool. but dont expect much help with python (unless you have a TA as great as Tristan) so be prepared to take a little longer on psets if youre not as familiar with coding. really fast turnaround on psets so youll be busy on the day of and after class but then its not bad the other days. linear might also be helpful in better understanding some of the methods.",
                "If you're interested in computational neuroscience, this course is definitely worth it, but otherwise, the work may just feel too much.",
