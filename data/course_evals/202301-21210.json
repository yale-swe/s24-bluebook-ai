                "Strength: great reading list, great professor, comprehensive curriculums\r\nWeakness: There was limited time for student to ask questions and have dialogues",
                "STRONG: course material, student interest, professor's wealth of knowledge and ability to speak ad nauseum about certain topics. WEAK: wayyy too much focus on South China. The class doesn't touch Northern or Western China at all, and a student dropped the class very early on because of that. Siu just is not familiar with that realm of anthropology, even though the class is called \"Unity and Diversity in Chinese Culture.\" I think there should be an addendum to the title that says \"in South Chinese Culture\" because very article is about southern villages, southern economics, southern trade, and Hong Kong, which is where Siu is from. It could also use some updates to the material, since a lot of it is recycled from other classes Siu has taught - notably, there is very little different with about half of this syllabus and with that of her Hubs class. Siu could also benefit from using powerpoints to stimulate our brains. She's a great speaker, but it is oftentimes exhausting to have to listen for two hours straight. And that's the biggest weakness. It's never \"discussion,\" if we even make it to that point in the \"seminar.\" Siu lectures for an hour to sometimes even two hours (the entire class length) and then asks if we \"have any questions\" for her. There's no independent thought, because all questions are directed toward her, and there's never any intra-student communication, and it is almost as if that is not even encouraged. We didn't even go around and introduce ourselves on the first day of class, so we effectively did not know each other's names. There wasn't really a class community.",
                "For the last few weeks, I wish to hear more about the reading material, yet the presentation takes too long.",
                "The strength is that the course is rich with both empirical and theoretical knowledge. Weakness is perhaps limited discussion in class but I do not mind it at all."

                "Eh, depends. If you like seminar that really should be called lectures where the professor's words are the Word of God and you may not depart from her POV, then sure. It is one of the very few Chinese anthro classes offered here and the most comprehensive, but it is definitely lacking in its scope. It was mostly enjoyable, even though sometimes dry, and could really use an update to the syllabus.",
