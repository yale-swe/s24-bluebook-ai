Intriguing lectures about numerous different Chinese philosophies as well as tropes in Chinese art. Some topics include Peach Blossom Spring, Immortal Mountains, Antiquarianism in Bronze Vessels, and Funerary Art. The theme of Time in Chinese Art was very effectively used to provide a diverse learning experience.",

                "Strengths: Each week centered around a different facet of time in Chinese art, so a very diverse and interesting array of topics were introduced. Professor Ngan also provided many fascinating readings and showed numerous artworks, including pieces from the YUAG. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This was definitely due to the nature of online lectures, but class participation in lecture discussions was often limited. Also, as an undergrad I felt self-conscious about speaking especially surrounded by upperclassmen and graduate students. But this was rectified in the weekly discussion sections.",
                "We learned a lot from the corse, but it can be better if we have more time for discussion in every class.",
                "The theme of this class was unique and provided a good framework for discussions as well as essay topics. Professor Ngan's lectures were organized and engaging, each provided a unique perspective on the concept of time. The topics discussed in the course were broad, yet the professor was able to bring out key concepts that appeared throughout the course.",
                "I think that the strength lies in the teaching and the care of the professor and the TF. I think a way this course could be improved is to have more suggested additional readings."

You are given the opportunity to explore a variety of mediums from ancient paintings to cinema to contemporary art. You also learn about systems that shaped Chinese art, including but not limited to Daoism, Confucianism, dynastic time, and Communism. If you are Chinese, I think this class is very valuable as it will teach you a lot about your cultural heritage, from the first August Emperor all the way to modern-day.",
