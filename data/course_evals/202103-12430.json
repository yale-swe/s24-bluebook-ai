                "The course teaches a ton of information which is a strength and a weakness. It is often hard to keep up but if you're able to, you will learn more than in most other classes. The course could probably remove one block of information and use that to move slightly slower.",
                "I generally liked the structure and the lectures. More guidance for the writing assignment would have helped.",
                "Professor was great. Problem sets maybe a bit too easy compared to exams. Would have been nice to receive feedback on our papers.",
                "strengths: Eduardo is absolutely amazing\r\nweaknesses: he goes a bit fast paced. needs more examples in lectures",
                "The lectures were set up in a very clear way, and it was usually easy for me to learn the concepts from them and then apply them to problem sets. The copious amount of practice questions were also very helpful for preparing for exams. The one thing I think could be improved about the class is the writing assignment. I don't think it added much to my personal learning, and it took a surprising amount of work for a Pass\/Fail assignment, given that we also had to take exams and do problem sets in the class.",
                "Strengths: lectures were good , hw graded reasonably \r\nWeaknesses: I never understood why we couldn't digitally submit homework, sometimes Prof Davila's pace was a little quick on the lectures",
                "Strengths: Very interesting and intellectually challenging material, lectures were easy to follow and assignments and exams were fair\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could provide more real-life examples related to finance concepts",
                "Professor knows the material super well, and he clearly cares about his students, but a couple things can be improved. First, I wish he made the assignments a bit harder and keeps in pace with the topics of the class. Because of the super short biweekly psets - the workload of the class is extremely low except for the week before midterm\/final when everyone needs to watch many lectures and do a lot of practice problems (which Eduardo does provide us). I also wish that sections were more involved since I stopped going to them after the third meeting.",
                "I think the main strength is Professor Dvila, who is a great professor and super knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. The course is extremely organized (ie all expectations and assignments are very clear and posted way ahead of time).",
                "The course was taught well, the workload was manageable, and lectures were pretty enjoyable. My only complaint is that the final exam seemed a bit unexpected in its level of difficulty -- I felt unprepared despite having gone through nearly all of the practice materials.",
                "The class moves SO FAST, but I think that's how he designs it. You will need to look back through the slides and study a lot for the exams. But, you will learn so much and it will be rewarding. It's a good class, the problem sets are hard but not too hard. It was probably my favorite class, but also my hardest class",
                "Lectures are quite dense and fast. However, the class has a lot of support. It doesn't teach personal finance but gives a general sense of some finance concepts. The class is not easy, it takes a bit of time and effort but the TFs were super helpful.",
                "Very well organized",
                "Strength: great stuff\r\nWeakness: I wish we have more real-world examples",
                "Even though I learned all these financial models, it's still difficult to see how I can apply them in real life. I wish that he made more explicit the real life applications of the material. I also found that his slides often over-complicated material and could have been more intuitive. It didn't help that there was no Ed discussion page or piazza to answer questions. Sections and the problems posted online were the best source for learning material and practice.",
                "I thought the professor was very engaging, but sections depend on the TF",
                "Very heavy towards the second half.",
                "strength: professors and TAs are great and I truly learned a lot, despite the class being really challenging. \r\nweakness: tries to cover too much. The final was way too hard.",
                "Strengths - covers a broad swath of topics in a single trimester, lots of maturity built, great professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - course content moves a bit fast",
                "The course was developed to establish fundamental knowledge and did just that. Allowing for slightly more time on each individual topic might help, however.",
                "Pace a bit fast at times",
                "There was good content, engaging lectures, and a very reasonable workload",
                "Some of the lecture topics were definitely rather challenging and I was not sure that the lectures conclusively explained the concepts, such as the Black Scholes Model, which we definitely only saw a limited version of.",
                "The course is very well-organized. Materials are divided into different modules and the transitions in between are smooth and understandable.",
                "Course was very well structured and very well taught, without any background though some of the material was a bit difficult.",
                "Lecture slides are always put up in advance and the professors\/TAs always endeavor to make themselves available if you have questions.",
                "Strengths - Prof Davila, he was such a caring professor whose students deeply mattered to him\r\nWeaknesses - the class could be fast-paced at times and we could brush over some subtle concepts",
                "Strength: Prof. Davila is amazing. It's extremely challenging to cover all the interesting materials in such a concise and enlightening way. The TFs are super helpful as well. Overall, great teaching team!\r\nWeakness: A lot of material was a bit rushed at the end. Totally understandable but that's the only complaint I had.",
                "The topics covered in the course were very interesting, but I felt like having a bit more knowledge of application could have been useful. I really enjoyed the guest lecture.",
                "good teaching staff. i wish there was a textbook for a more structured curriculum",
                "The information covered is at a very high level. It really challenges you to think about problems because they are not straightforward. The exams were very challenging and I felt like too much material was tested. Eduardo is a great teacher but he goes very fast.",
                "Strengths: The course is well organized because the content naturally builds upon itself. The early content provides a solid foundation and initial foreshadowing about advanced concepts. This is especially the case for arbitrage, which is discussed early in the course and becomes a central tenant of the post-midterm material. The lecture notes are very detailed, which significantly aids review for the exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course can feel fast-paced at times, especially around the middle and end of the semester, when content is rapidly introduced. Furthermore, the transition between different areas of finance can feel a bit disconnected between lectures.",
                "Strengths: Eduardo is clearly very passionate about teaching the class, and his lectures and slides are always very clear to follow along. He provides a lot of \"out of class\" material, including reading recommendations, quantitative R notebooks, and deep dive documents on subjects covered. TAs are also very helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt that it was very easy to get through the class without understanding how theory applied to real world situations. Would have preferred some case studies or other assignments that stressed this part of learning.",
                "Prof Davila is pure class - very knowledgeable and clear during lectures. The class is organized and structured very clearly.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I think was putting lectures online. Students then take lectures as optional and make it less engaging.",
                "This course was great because it had clear, concise, and useful lecture slides as well as an abundance of helpful practice materials. It had a good structure which was weakened by the amount of topics that were covered in the course. There are many important topics covered and at times it felt like we were rushing to get through topics so that we could cover them all. Topics in the second half of the course felt especially rushed."

                "Yes! This is a very interesting course that helps with understanding the basics of finance, options, markets, and risks.",
                "Absolutely. I learned some basic theories and intuitions of finance that will be useful in everyday life regardless of what profession I go into. Professor Davila was also fantastic-- great lecturer!",

                "Yes, it is a great introduction to finance, although it might be a little more theoretical than your typical intro finance class. Nonetheless, you walk away with a broad knowledge base of important finance concepts that can be applied in any finance job or internship.",
                "Would definitely recommend for those who are interested in finance, just be aware that it's very theoretical (which I mostly enjoyed).",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. If you study Econ this is definitely a course you should take, even if you do not want to work in finance, which I don't. It gives a good idea of why things in finance have value and why they exist. If you study more Econ, a lot of these ideas will definitely pop up all over the place.",
                "I think you can learn a lot from the course if you put in the work. In my experience, watching the lectures and doing the homework are not enough to do well on exams, but Prof Davila provides a lot of additional materials for practice. The material in the 2nd half of the semester is significantly more difficult than the 1st half.",
                "I would, although be prepared for a very tough curve due to the types of the students taking the course (90%+ sophomores and juniors going into finance). Lots of students seem to have some fundamental knowledge of course topics already, but this course helps bolster this knowledge a lot.",
                "If you're interested in finance, this course seems worthwhile. Prof. Davila is a great lecturer, and the lecture slides were clear and easy to follow. The workload is also pretty manageable, but don't expect to be able to do well on the final without a significant amount of preparation in advance -- there is a non-trivial amount of memorization required.",
                "Absolutely, if you're interested at all in finance. This class is a perfect walkthrough of the basics of finance and you will get so much out of it. You will need to go to lectures and do the problem sets to learn, though. He moves very quickly, so I don't recommend taking notes during class, just sit and listen and take notes after. If you can commit to this being your hardest or second hardest class, definitely go for it",

This course would be invaluable as an introduction before the higher-level finance courses.

It is definitely a course that emphasizes breadth over depth, but ultimately serves as a great introduction to many different quantitative and qualitative topics in financial markets. For those majoring in economics or related fields, the course provides a good mathematical foundation to approaching calculating returns, risk, etc. Even if you're not pursuing a further education in economics, it is a very valuable course to Credit\/D\/F if you plan to ever invest in securities.",

                "I would recommend this course to any student that is interested in learning about finance and what quantitative skills are needed in that field."
