                "The strengths of the course were the commitment of Professor Moreno and the TFs. I appreciated how they tried to include skills that we can take away with and use after this semester is over, such as GraphPad Prism, EndNote, Miro, and ArcGIS. These skills along with writing skills in the lab reports can be used translationally. The effort of Dr. Moreno to create videos of the laboratory techniques and explain them was very useful and informational. With that said, I wish that more feedback could be provided in the assignments. I felt very lost about what was expected, especially for the lab report, and the feedback was not very specific, making me confused. I would have appreciated a sample lab report, even if we are supposed to develop our own writing style. For the GIS workshops, I thought some of them were not useful, and even then, I think we were confused what we were supposed to do each week and how to continue. Some of the activities felt like busy work. I think overall, this could be improved with more clear expectations and specific feedback along with more clear organization. Still, this course was extremely helpful."
