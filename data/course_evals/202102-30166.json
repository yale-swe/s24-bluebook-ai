                "The course spends a lot of time on different audio effects and tools that can be used within Ableton. These are usually pretty dry and feel a bit unnecessary. It would be better if the slides of the effects were left out of the lectures becauses most of them can be easily found online or just accessed as a resource when you're stuck. The teaching of music fundamentals are great, and I finished the class with a much better understanding of chord progressions. The class includes several projects which allow you to apply the concepts learned, and these can be a lot of fun. It would be great if the class spent more time analyzing different genres of EDM. We went over about 6 of them, and this was very interesting.",

                "Very interesting class with great assignments, manageable workload, and great professor/ TA. No weaknesses.",
                "Great professor, I think the only weakness is not a fault of the professor but just a sign of the times. It was difficult to get things with an online course at times, and felt like it wouldve been easier in person."
