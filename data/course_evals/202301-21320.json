                "The multi-vocality of the Bible. We learned about the Documentary Hypothesis for the Hebrew Bible and the Synoptic Gospels for the New Testament. Content-wise, the key knowledge takeaway is to read the Bible bearing the awareness that the Bible is not a single work of literature but a collection of works written by many different authors (with different religious inclinations and interpretations). Methodology-wise, we have learned how to write essays that consider various viewpoints on the same issue, and how to do so objectively.",
                "Knowledge: a basic understanding of the content of most of the books of the Bible (the Old and New Testaments) and an idea of how the many books and authors included in the Bible relate to one another. I also learned about the history and authorship of the Pentateuch, and the literary dependence of the Synoptic Gospels.\r\nSkills: how to read the Bible (as a literature). If I tried to read the Bible before taking this class, I would have been very confused, and drawn many false conclusions about what the biblical authors meant the text to say. Now, I have a better idea of how to go about reading a Bible passage I don't understand (it likely involves seeking out other people's opinions). Also, Professor Brisman asks students to write a particular kind of essay, problem-driven rather than thesis-driven, which I think is a useful kind of essay to be able to write.\r\nInsights: the Bible is a very complicated and interesting text (possibly also beautiful, but this is harder to see in translation). There are a lot of different perspectives in it, with radically different ideas, styles, and beliefs.",

            "comments": [
                "The main strength of the class was Professor Brismans sheer knowledge. However, the class could have been more collaborative. The class was a seminar, but I still could not name half of the class by the end (and I dont think Im the only one).",
                "I liked the seminar format and that we would often discuss different ideas about a single passage as a class",
                "There were too many students for a seminar class  I felt like we all missed out on valuable conversation and conversational skill building.",
                "Strengths: Passage selection and in-class discussion and essay feedback.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we cannot take more radical approaches to the Bible because of an aura we still hold for the work (also because of the presence of students with Christian beliefs). Sometimes I hope we can have sections where Christians / Atheists / students with different religious beliefs can express ideas more freely.",
                "Strengths: classes are generally engaging and interesting. Professor Brisman really knows the material, and I think does a good job balancing letting students come up with their own ideas with telling students when their ideas are unsupported by the text. He also actively encourages asking questions and meeting outside of class time, which is helpful, especially for the essays. The kind of essay Professor Brisman asks students to write is a good fit for the class - considering many perspectives is a useful thing to do for a text which has been interpreted in so many different ways, by even the Biblical authors themselves.\r\nWeaknesses: the first few weeks of the course are difficult because we're reading a very complicated text, far removed from our cultural context (and in translation!) without any of the infrastructure we build up over the semester. At times I felt like the only way I could evaluate an idea about the text was to ask Professor Brisman about it, and the answer was almost always \"no.\" This didn't mean I wasn't enjoying the class, but there were a few weeks where it felt more like a lecture than a seminar. This diminished as the class went on, but never completely went away - there's just so much I don't know about the time periods when the Bible was written.\r\nThis said, I think the difficulties mostly stem from the Bible being a difficult text, and I can't really imagine a better way to learn about the Old and New Testaments in one semester.",
                "Strengths-- The Bible itself is super interesting and worth reading in a structured setting with other people. The essay assignments were well spaced and useful in helping us thoroughly examine different passages. The secondary source readings were excellent to get a basic understanding of the composition of the Pentateuch and the Synoptic problem. \r\nWeaknesses-- The class period itself was not highly engaging. This should have been a lecture course instead of a seminarbesides students reading passages, Professor Brisman did basically all the talking. When he asked questions of us he generally had a desired answer in mind as opposed to truly encouraging students to interpret the text for themselves. This class would have worked as a fine lecture; the seminar format is not ideal given Professor Brisman's teaching style."

                "Yes! Prof. Brisman is an amazing and caring instructor. He genuinely wants students to learn the material and is willing to guide them through their thinking on papers and in lectures. You will learn a lot and love learning about the Bible.",
                "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject matter.",
                "Do not take this course to vindicate your past experiences with religious bible study.",
                "Yes and No. Yes to those wanting to improve their essay writing skills and to those who want to devote a certain period time into reading the Bible from a relatively intuitive perspectives. No to students who are dedicated literary theorists, because you can do the job on your own given the methodology for the course.",
                "Yes, if the student is interested in learning about the Bible. I came into the course with very little exposure to the text of the Bible, so I can't speak to what the course is like for someone more religious, but I learned a lot. If you do take the class, I would recommend asking questions in office hours/after class, and writing at least one essay early enough to submit a draft to the professor - I think the course works best as a conversation between you and Professor Brisman.\r\n\r\nOne caveat is that since the Bible is so old and so complicated that the course needs to spend a good amount of time just trying to figure out what's going on. There aren't many other English classes where you're consistently unsure what's real and what's just a trope/metaphor. If you're only going to take one literature course at Yale, I might take something more accessible.",
                "This is not a course on learning or dissecting the material in the Bible. This is a course on how to read the Bible and how to understand how it was written. As a secular person that is what I thought I wanted, but I actually found it a lot less interesting to just talk about which author might have written which part than learning about the actual material itself. I would not take this class if it continues to be taught as a seminar. Professor Brisman's style (unless he changes it) does not leave a lot of room for genuine student discussion."
