It was a thorough summary of zero-, one-, and two-dimensional materials followed by a unit on different kinds of microscopy. Some pset problems as well as the presentation and term paper required reading scientific literature on nanomaterials, so I believe I got better at reading scientific papers through this class.",

                "It's pretty much all strengths. Students have opportunities to investigate unexplored content in both the presentation and term paper. I like how the grading is spread evenly across homework, exam, presentation, and paper so as not to favor one type of learner in particular.\r\n\r\nI guess occasionally I didn't quite know what was going on in lecture. This is partly because the course is co-listed as a grad school course so Prof. Cha had to keep it interesting for more knowledgeable people. But as long as I knew what questions to ask, she was ready with a clarification.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness is that Judy Cha is leaving for Cornell at the end of this school year and future students won't get a chance to take this course with her.",
                "If you're an undergraduate student, this course may be a bit more challenging. Many grad students had the advantage of performing research in the field, and so had a much better understanding of the topics. A lot of it was difficult to grasp without practical application",
                "One strength was the ability for students to take classes remotely or in person. This ensured that one can get the material of the course."

                "I would recommend the course because there is a lot of material covered in the course in a digestible way."
