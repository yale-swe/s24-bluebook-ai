                "This class made me more aware of my specific behaviors when giving speeches. I didn't really think about upspeak, the placement of my hands, or my posture when speaking. We also learned how to give more effective constructive feedback that's objective while still being framed in a positive manner.",
                "I learned about how embodied public speaking is, and how much of communication is influenced by voice/tone, facial expressions, and body language -- not just the words and content of your speech. I learned about different rhetorical techniques, the use of ethos/pathos/logos, and approaches to persuasion for different audiences and contexts. Most importantly, I learned about my own personal speaking styles and quirks (both from delivering my own speeches and giving feedback to others), and worked on the areas that were most relevant to me.",
                "This class taught me to be more confident, slow down my pace, feel more comfortable in front of an audience and adjust my gestures and presence to a zoom screen. It was also a good review of persuasive strategies that we applied to our speeches but also work in other areas of life. And the people were so great."

                "Loved it!!!",
                "strengths: incredibly committed professor and teaching assistants, interesting readings, helpful feedback on your speeches. it's fun doing the warm up exercises in the beginning and listening to your peers give speeches on various topics. weaknesses: obviously this year everything happened online so actual public speaking would feel a bit different.",
                "This class was really great at facilitating growth for those of all levels. Even though most people had different things they wanted to work on, and various aspects of public speaking that scared them, everyone was able to develop at their own pace and focus on their own goals. Also, a very generous atmosphere was built within the class, and the support of peers really propelled everyone's growth.",
                "It can be improved by letting us see the grades and feedback we get on our assignments.",
                "Marvelous class. Highly recommend! Daily stretching and regular feedback kept me engaged. Weaknesses were that that feedback from students was often long and unhelpful, and I wish more time could have been spent on interviews (probably one of the most relevant types of public speaking for us college students at the moment).",
                "Strengths: Professor Morrison. She's an extremely engaging and understanding professor. Before each round of speeches, we did warm-ups as a class, and these always made my day. They ranged from tongue-twisters to full-body dances--not matter what, they were always fun and allowed us to relax and be goofy for a moment. Also, Professor Morrison's feedback was always quite detailed. Weaknesses: at times, the speeches felt overwhelming. It might just be because I didn't manage my time correctly, but it felt like as soon as we gave one speech, we were already having to work on the next one (I think once she was already giving out the next speech assignment before we even finished making/delivering the one we were on). I always ended up stressed and not sleeping the night before because I had to prepare what I was going to say, so I feel I could've gotten more out of the class if there was more time to focus on polishing individual speeches.",
                "This is one of the most useful courses I've taken at Yale and I'll definitely remember and use the material constantly. I've already found myself using a ton of the techniques, since as they say, \"all speaking is public speaking\". I learned a lot about myself as a speaker: both what I do well and didn't realize, and things that I can improve upon.\r\n\r\nThe feedback we got from Professor Morrison was *extremely* helpful. She is clearly an expert at the topic and picks up on every nuance of how you communicate, particularly in the nonverbal side of things. This was SO insightful. We also got a lot of great feedback from our peers. My suggestion is to find out how feedback could be a bit more direct from our peers, though. Our class was able to be really vulnerable with each other and super supportive but simultaneously less willing to comment on points for improvement. One the one hand, I think it's really important to gain confidence and knowing your speaking strengths is often overlooked, but maybe adding anonymous comments or cultivating a culture of directness would help here.",
                "A strength is the community developed within the class. This was probably my favorite aspect and made me want to go to class! Another strength is the structure of the class that intentionally incorporates moments of joy into the curriculum such as the energizers, and the announcements. A weakness is that a lot of your experience depends on your TA, and mine wasn't great."

                "it can be challenging to focus on zoom, but the instructors did a phenomenal job of incorporating student participation and feedback. speeches were mostly really interesting so focusing on them wasn't hard, and the lectures were pretty practical and meant to help us with our own speeches, so they were also engaging.",

                "Because of Zoom, the class was also broken into smaller groups that we stuck with throughout the semester in breakout rooms. Having this smaller team within the class helped feel a more tight-knit connection and helped within the class as we knew each other's speaking habits and could give more detailed feedback as we progressed.",
                "Overall it went smoothly, and Professor Morrison did a great job! The nuances of speaking over Zoom were especially relevant and learning to deal with those issues is just as much of a valid medium to investigate. Breakout rooms and little exercises are pretty useful.\r\n\r\nBut I think some parts were hard to replicate virtually from our end, particularly in a class where most of it is \"student run\". It's hard to deliver speeches standing and walking around, and dealing with recording and asking questions over Zoom just adds a layer of annoyance."

Professor Morrison was not at all there to bash people if they didn't deliver the perfect speech every time, and she wasn't knit picking behaviors such as filler words. She was really there to give the best constructive criticism possible in hopes of really helping you become a better communicator. I always felt supported and encouraged, and I always looked forwards to our class warm-ups. I'd take it again if I could.",
