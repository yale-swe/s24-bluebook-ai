   "comments": [
    "I learned how to present scientifically",
    "I learned how to prepare an oral presentation on scientific research as well as how to write strong, academic research paper. I feel that the biggest academic component of this course was focused on the development of necessary skills to present and defend your academic research, and this was an invaluable skill I gained.",
    "I learned how to develop a scientific presentation and write a scientific paper. I took AP Research in high school and though that class prepared me for college, this course is what will prepare me for a thesis by the end of college. I am grateful for learning about the structure of a paper and how to organize\/interpret data.",
    "Learned a lot about presenting scientific data to others - powerpoint making and speaking skills improved dramatically.",
    "How to present research",
    "I definitely learned how to read papers and got better at catching myself when using long sentences (my TA really helped with this by calling me out on it a bunch). I also feel a lot more confident presenting in front of people, making eye contact with an audience, and creating presentations that get straight to the point.",
    "I learned how to write and orally present the results of my scientific research in an academically acceptable, publication-quality format.",
    "Learned how to read and write scientific papers",
    "None; it was a grotesque waste of my time and makes me seriously reconsider going into academia.",
    "Reading\/writing scientific papers, oral presentation skills, creating scientific powerpoints, concisely explaining high level concepts, research skills.",
    "I learned how to present research effectively to the scientific community.",
    "Learned how to read scientific papers and present my individual research.",
    "How to present scientific research",
    "I developed a lot of skills in regard to how to perform scientific research and set up experiments as well as how to present that information properly. Additionally, I feel the course helped me to become a better public speaker and writer in other academic areas.",
    "Skills on writing a research paper and presenting a scientific presentation on our project.",
    "I learned how to read scientific papers and wrote my own.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that I really valued that number of resources that this course connected me with. I learned a lot about how to successful document and transcribe lab procedures as well as analyze scientific articles.",
    "The professors and TAs were amazing! For the initial assignments when we were learning about the research process, I wish there was more guidance or a release of the rubrics.",
    "Immediate feedback",
    "Strengths: My professor (Maria Moreno) and TA (Mac Crite). I definitely felt like they knew what they were doing when leading class. Also, they weren't afraid to voice their criticism, which at the time can often be intimidating, but is always actually really helpful. In that respect, I guess another strength of the course was learning how to take blunt criticism to be something not against you\/something meanspirited, but instead something to help you improve as a presenter.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The homeworks at the beginning of the program were tedious beyond belief. Additionally, it could be frustrating at times because I would feel like I worked super hard on an assignment only to receive a C grade. This gets better over time though...the professors got wind of the fact that many people were anxious about their grade, and took steps to reduce stress in this area.",
    "The central weakness of this course is its foggy expectations and grading system. It was often unclear what we were supposed to do, when it was due by, and how we would be assessed on it. Some students even failed assignments but were not really given feedback on how to improve or how it would affect their overall grade. It seemed like by the end we had just stopped receiving grades because the instructors knew we would put up a fight about them, but that was also not the solution.",
    "Strengths: learned to read scientific papers \r\n\r\nWeakness: the first couple of assignments were kind of pointless and I feel that the class would have been fine just being 2-3 days per week",
    "Horrible combative argumentative professors who showed no signs of respecting their students.",
    "Strengths: helps a lot with oral presentation skills and how to explain complex research so that it is understandable to others.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: organization, clarity in assignment instructions",
    "The first half of the class could be improved, because it is a lot of busy work.",
    "I learned how to speak about scientific topics. A weakness would be trying to balance the rigorous homework with independent research.",
    "The constant practice and build up of our presentations was definitely a plus. By the end of the course, presenting our research seemed almost second nature from all the practice.",
    "Strengths were the presentation rehearsals that really helped me polish my presentation and focus on my weaknesses that helped shape my presentation into an easy-to-understand and enjoyable presentation. Weakness was that there were sometimes miscommunications between the professors and the TA's and students.",
    "Strengths lie in the amount of support.",
    "The journal clubs and the assignments were instructive.\r\nWe received useful feedback for our presentations and the staff were also responsive to our complaints during the start of the program."

   "comments": [
    "Yes as it is a requirement to be in the stars program.",
    "Yes! It helped me decide whether I truly wanted to be a researcher or not.",
    "I would. This course definitely helps you improve as a presenter of scientific work.",
    "I think that what you get out of this course is actually very valuable, and being able to write\/present my research is a skill that will help me throughout my career. I just wish that the process hadn't been so painful, and that I had been more supported and encouraged instead of criticized and brought down.",
    "I would definitely recommend the STARS program, so yes this course is great especially for those looking for a writing credit",
    "Avoid at all costs.",
    "Yes!",
    "If they are doing the STARS program, then it is a requirement.",
    "Only if youre doing STARS or want to learn how to read\/write\/speak about scientific topics during the summer.",
    "Yes, the STARS Summer Program overall was a great experience and the course was definitely worth the hard work it took.",
    "Yes I would. I don't think you can learn any of these scientific research paper writing and presentation skills in a classroom from such devoted professors through any other course at Yale. It was really helpful and will continue to help me in my scientific research career at Yale and on.",
    "The beginning was a little stressful because there was a lack of communication between professors and students.",
    "Yes. \r\nIt's pretty great for anyone who is going into research but still needs to learn about scientific writing and presenting."
