Also how to synthesize many different viewpoints into one original argument. How to condense hard-to-read concepts into something more palatable.",
    "Writing skills, analytical skills, and grammar techniques were the main focus.",
    "I learned about other aspects of climate change beyond the impact on sea levels and the economy.",
    "This course taught me how to wite; that is, to translate the ideas in my head to cogent arguments on paper. it also taught me how to have those difficult conversations about issues like climate change",
    "How to think about the climate crisis in relation to the logistics revolution."

    "Strengths: Professor Kreiner is a really nice professor and tries to make the class really fun and chill. The readings are SO manageable as compared to other writing\/English courses, we also spent a week watching a movie, and basically finished the course before reading period started. \r\nWeaknesses: Not really any.",
    "Strengths: This course got a lot easier towards the end, as the P3 project I largely completed over spring break and the P4 project was very laid-back \r\nWeaknesses: This course started off hard, as the first paper was written in two weeks without much instruction about writing mechanics. I mean, I don't think there is anything that can be done about this, really, because of the scheduling of the class. Also, I found that some of the readings were interesting but did not have any real importance if you weren't going to use that source in your paper.",
    "Strengths: Interesting readings, thoughtful discussions, peer-reviewed essays\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe more emphasis on how to write well",
    "No space between assignments. We would submit one the night before class and the next day be given a new assignment. Relentless."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! A great course for not only being informed about some of the causes and consequences of climate change, but also for improving your reading\/writing.",
    "This course really grew on me as the semester went along. Would recommend for students who are seeking a writing course and would like to learn how to write. The student need not lot of background knowledge to succeed and find this course engaging.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course because it brings to light one of the most pressing issues in human history and has allowed me to truly understand the logistics of climate change from multiple angles and perspectives. My writing skills have also improved immensely during this course.",
    "Professor Kreiner is really funny and kind. His feedback is also very straightforward and objective, which I appreciated a lot. He also has a lot of really funny witticisms like \"neither here nor there\" and \"it's all to the good\". I think his selection of reading materials was also well chosen and helped complement the course.",
    "Yes if you want a foundation in thinking about environmental crises. No if you really want to improve your writing or if you want to think about climate solutions or the science behind climate change."
