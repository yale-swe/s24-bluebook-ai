The TF, Saurabh, was also likewise excellent and generous with his time for students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none. At times, it felt a little intimidating to speak up in class discussion, but I think this was more a product of my internal fears than the actual dynamics of the class itself.",
                "Great texts",
                "Prof. Wetters is an engaged and very knowledgeable seminar leader. He is very kind and capable in discussion, and he is always eager to offer help outside of class. The materials were interesting, and Prof. Wetters was usually very good about posting some historical background and intellectual context for the readings each week on Canvas. I think the Canvas discussions were quite nice as wellProf. Wetters was very enthusiastic about replying to our posts on there, which made posting feel more engaging and \"worth it,\" so to speak. Sometimes I felt like the seminar discussion was a bit unstructured and could have benefited from more intervention from Prof. Wetters about the topic of discussion, or at least a round-up at the beginning of class of topics that people brought up in Canvas posts, which could serve as a more defined basis of discussion to start from."

                "Yes",

                "Yes, but only if you're pretty sure you're interested in the topic, and/or if you like and have a lot of patience for doing readings and talking about intellectual history and a diverse range of philosophical+theoretical concepts anyways."
