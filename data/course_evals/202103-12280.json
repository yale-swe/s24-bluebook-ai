                "I learned to read and write a couple hundred Chinese characters and gained enough comfort with the language to write simple essays and give extensive oral presentations.",
                "Learned an honestly surprising amount of practical vocabulary even if it didn't really seem so in class. I was watching the news in Chinese the other day and quite a few of the characters we learned this semester showed up. The professor also included a few extracurricular videos and tidbits about culture in China as a whole and beijing especially.",
                "From daily practice in reading, speaking, and writing Chinese, I saw noticeable improvement when talking to my Chinese parents/grandparents!",
                "I learned a ton of new grammar structures, hanzi, and vocabulary. We learned a total of maybe 500-700 new vocab words, and about 4-6 new grammar structures per lesson (there were about 15 lessons total). I also learned to make better presentations, and create sentences that flowed better in a more formal, expressive way."

            "comments": [
                "I think that this course was extremely good at the beginning, when we were learning one lesson weekly. However, when we started to rush and learn two lessons per week it was quite frustrating as it seemed as if we were just rushing through the material. Chen laoshi was quite understanding however and aided students whenever they felt stressed. I think that its also annoying that we have to meet five days a week!",
                "The course aids in reading and writing, but not enough practice with speaking the language regularly.",
                "I think the everyday nature of this course is one of its greatest strengths, as language learning has to be on a consistent basis in order to be properly reinforced in the mind. The tutoring system is also very well thought out.",
                "I thought the course was excellent. My professor was engaging and really knew how to teach the material well. I was impressed by how she knew how to teach Chinese so well, because teaching a language is not necessarily the same as simply knowing the language.\r\n\r\nA major strength was the close-knit community we had in class, which made it a safe space to make mistakes and learn. The interactive nature of the instruction helped our class become close enough that we organized a class dinner at the end of the semester. The grading system also helped me learn without fear of making mistakes, which are essential to learning a language. I liked that mistakes in homework and written assignments didn't actually lower my grade very much. I think the grading accurately rewards students for effort and does not punish too severely for inaccuracy, which means I wasn't afraid to try writing more difficult sentences and as a result I learned more. I also liked how the course gave us flexibility to focus on whatever aspects of the Chinese language we wanted to improve the most. \r\n\r\nI thought a weakness was that for students that want to lean traditional, there was little material and exposure in the class. I had to spend extra time looking up the equivalent traditional characters because we exclusively used materials in simplified Chinese.",
                "Strengths was the teacher was great. Super personable and kind. Weaknesses were that class focused too much on rote memorization of vocab, rather than usage in context with grammar.",
                "I generally felt like I learned a lot during the course and improved my Chinese, but toward the end of the semester when we started learning double the amount of characters each week I definitely started to feel like I was just memorizing them for the daily quizzes and then mostly forgetting them after. I also felt like grammatical structures were taught too quickly, and I didn't get much chance to practice them consistently or practice integrating them into my speaking, so I overall don't feel like my Chinese speaking was improved a whole lot. In general, the homework was helpful (although time-consuming) for learning, class time was generally not.",
                "Towards the second half of the semester we switched from a 1 chapter per week curriculum to a 2 chapter per week basis. While I thought it was a bit slow before, the new speed made it harder to retain information for sure since we rushed through grammar. On grammar, I also wished we spent a bit more time analyzing why the structures were the way they were.",
                "strength - The workload was rather reasonable, and my instructor for this course was quite flexible and understanding with lessening the workload based on student feedback. \r\nweakness - This is not the fault of my instructor by any means, but I did feel that it was difficult getting to make meaningful connections with my classmates since most of the homework is independent work and students rarely got together outside of class to study for exams.",
                "While not light, the workload is fairly consistent and more manageable: daily vocab and vocab quiz, weekly textbook homework, short essay and presentation based on essay every other week, a unit exam every 3-4 weeks. Soon, I knew what to expect in terms of daily/weekly workload! I thought it was a great dynamic with my classmates and Ms. Chen, even with a slightly larger-sized class. Some of the highlights for me were the student presentations about themselves/their interests. Perhaps having some group projects/presentations would make the class even more interactive?",
                "Strength: the professors are amazing, smart, and very caring! Ours was always understanding if we needed an extension because we had a busy week, and would often side with the students when we felt that a week's assessments/homeworks were too difficult, and would go to the head professor to see if we could lighten our load. She was also super engaging in class, even if it was a monday morning and all the students were groggy.\r\n\r\nWeakness: around midterm, the course of the pace picked up rapidly. We went through new lessons at around double the pace, and had to learn the new hanzi much more quickly due to a change in the daily quiz structure. We mostly found this confusing and stressful, and over the course of the last half-semester, our professor worked with us to drop certain daily-quizzes and homeworks that we were not prepared for. Overall, the course required at least 90 minutes of studying/work each night, and often in the mornings before class as well. While that wasn't too great, what made it worse for me personally was the daily assessments and homeworks, which felt like a large load on my shoulders. I probably could have tried to schedule better, but with an already busy schedule otherwise, it seemed pretty difficult."

                "Yes, I would recommend this course, provided that the student has time and is willing to dedicate an hour of work outside of class each day because it was very well taught and I think I improved a lot.",
                "Yes, fun course but demanding in terms of time.",
                "Yes, if you're a heritage speaker who genuinely wants to improve your Chinese skills. But I would definitely try to take it in a semester where most of your other courses are on the easier side, since there are a lot of assignments and pretty much all of them are graded. You're also largely expected to do the learning yourself, rather than having much support from the teacher with reading new lessons and learning grammatical structures.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has had exposure to chinese at home at least a little. While I speak cantonese at home, learning with heritage speakers increased immersion and helped me learn faster in spite of the difficulty spike.",
                "I would recommend if you're aiming to improve your writing and reading skills. If you're more interested in learning Chinese terminology that's particular to a specific industry (eg. business), it might be a better idea to look into an L5 class since this course doesn't really do that.",
                "Yes! Chen Lao Shi is a great professor. She is very kind and reasonable but also makes sure students try to be diligent: quizzes are at the beginning of class on the dot, so nobody wanted to be late!"
