   "comments": [
    "I learned how to apply my personal people skills to my passion for medicine and academia, thinking deeper about aspects of interaction and purpose to define what I want to do for the rest of my life, and how I want to do it. Every student was so engaged, thoughtful, articulate, and genuinely happy to be part of this wonderful class. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of learning, reading, presenting, writing, and communicating with classmates and Dr. Morrison.",
    "This course was incredibly insightful. We had the opportunity to learn about Karl Popper, ancient philosophers, and modern authors to discuss course topics. The tours were very insightful as well. Large emphasis on reading and critical thinking skills development.",
    "I learned about uncertainty in medicine and the importance of acknowledging fallibility.",
    "In this class I learned about philosophy, medicine and the ways in which they overlap. Beyond those topics, i think my biggest insights into this class we on dehumanization - how it pertains to medicine and in the rest of our lives.  I thought that the learning i did in this class was absolutely fantastic and exceeded almost every other class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I learned to develop a sense of expository writing as well as honing my skills in oral communication and discussion",
    "I learned an incredible amount about medicine, literature, philosophy, and other topics. This class always challenged me and was consistently engaging.",
    "This class taught me how to embrace the profession of medicine and learning about the complexity of it. We did everything from reading Russian Literature to learning how musicians can train doctors to hear a heartbeat abnormality. The classroom discussions were rich and compelling and provided a level of engagement not often scene in STEM classes.",
    "I learned about the intersection of medicine and the humanities.",
    "I am a senior and have never taken the time to review a course. This one deserves my time. Amazing. Life changing. Unbelievable. Dr. Morrison isnt staffed as a professor at Yale and somehow embodies the values and virtues of higher education that i expected but did not find when chosing to come to Yale. In a secular, egotistical, individualistic environment that is ivy league higher education filled with fake liberalism and social justice warriors, Dr. Morrison is a true man of the people. Someone who cares so deeply and passionately and someone who makes real change everyday i have learned so much for this man and am forever grateful.",
    "I learned how to integrate personal experience with literature and philosophy about medicine and illness. We focused on the human side of medicine, dealing with uncertainty, and the myriad ways that science fails to tell us what suffering people need.",
    "SO MUCH about the medical profession and the medical experience. The class taught us to be curious about our futures and ask the difficult questions, which almost never have the easy answers.",
    "This course was a broad survey in the many facets of the medical humanities. The main topics covered were pseudoscience, science and romanticism, soul\/spirit\/end-of-life care, philosophy of science and medicine\/epistemology, art history, and numerous works of fiction and non-fiction by physician-writers. Some of the big texts we read were Do No Harm, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Every Patients Tells a Story, How Doctors Think, A Young Doctor's Notebook, and Gray's Anatomy, with some additional articles and journals from various authors (including Gawande) and snippets from other works (like War & Peace, Faust, etc.). We also had many field trips and guest speakers. Trips included guided tours and classes in the YCBA and the Cushing Center at SHM. Guest speakers included Dr. Honan, who spoke on the integration of art in clinical training at Yale, Dr. Duffee, who spoke on the integration of music and clinical training at Yale, and Dr. Sanders, a physician at YNHH, the author of one of our books, and an advisor to many medical dramas like House MD. Dr. Morrison is also an ER physician who both offers the opportunity to shadow him in NY and also frequently shares stories and perspectives from the clinic (which are very cool!). I took this course as a senior bio major with limited humanities exposure and found the course intellectually challenging but in a fun, relevant, and very accessible way. Dr. Morrison is a very kind person and excellent teacher and I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I do feel like I've become a better reader and writer of the humanities after the course and have learned of many of the non-scientific aspects of medicine that are not usually taught in a pre-med curriculum.",
    "I learned a lot about the physician-patient interaction. I learned about major issues in healthcare today, such as how to talk to people about death, how to communicate uncertainty and hope, the physicians role in conversations, the weaknesses of statistics in medical decision making, cognitive biases in medical decision making, and important considerations when facing uncertainty.",
    "I learned so much in this class. The most important thing I learned from this class was about how uncertainty manifests itself in the medical profession, and how important humanities are to medicine. I also loved the readings, the guest speakers (especially Lisa Sanders), reading about doctors' internal struggles, cognitive biases, pseudoscience, Russian Literature, the trip to the Center for British Art, and discussing end of life care."

   "comments": [
    "There are no weaknesses at all to this course (except that it may not be taught again). The strengths are so plentiful. Every reading, every class, and every conversation within and about this class was wonderful and worth every minute. Dr. Morrison has such great insights on life and how to care about people and purposes in such a genuine manner. We read such interesting stories about medicine, people, and philosophy, and had even more interesting conversations about the topics and related personal anecdotes. The two partner presentations throughout the semester were engaging, interesting, and allowed us to become better acquainted with other students. Such an incredible class.",
    "Strengths: very well organized, great professor, supportive learning environment, great insight from peers, valuable readings \r\n\r\nWeakness: none",
    "The readings could be more thematic and applicable to the class and diversified in terms of authors.",
    "I loved the topics - particularly the books we read and our discussions on them. I also really enlisted the open endedness of the essays; we could pick any subject that we talked about in class to explore further. Dr Morrison was also invested in the class and its students, which was refreshing and great. \r\n\r\nHonestly I wouldnt say this class had any weaknesses. I look forward to everything about it each week.",
    "Truly incredible course. No weaknesses. I wish I could take it again! A student in the class reads everything from english, history, philosophy, ethics, fiction and more. Perfect class for anyone tangentially interested in medicine.",
    "This course was very strong and engaging. It was a very unique course that I believe any student would find interesting. We also had many fascinating guest speakers.",
    "This class was amazing. It had the perfect amount of readings each week. the student presentations were fascinating and fun and the guest lectures were awesome. Morrison did an unreal job with his lectures and he brought the material to life in a real way. My only criticism is that next time the discussion could flow more with people responding to others. Too often I felt like we all spoke about something and then the next spoke about something new. Perhaps more responses would help",
    "Great discussions, passionate professor.",
    "This class was just absolutely incredible. Every week we had engaging discussions about anything related to our readings: from end of life care to the ethics of the medical system to philosophical debates. Every week was an absolute joy to attend. It was well organized and well liked by all of the students, with a reasonable amount of work but extremely high intellectual necessity.",
    "This class taught me how to think about medicine beyond science. We covered death, religion, human fallibility, the philosophy of science, uncertainty, the patient-doctor relationship, psuedoscience, and romanticism. I used my brain in ways my Yale education had not yet challenged me to do.",
    "Dr. Morrison is the goat.",
    "The reading list was excellent. We read a broad variety of pieces, from medical journalism to canonical literature and philosophy. I enjoyed the blend of lecture, discussion, speakers, and student presentations. The variety and teaching were excellent. I think we could've done one presentation instead of two (they took a lot of class time), and it would have been nice to have some guiding questions for discussion (it felt a bit like popcorn).",
    "Strengths - AMAZING professor who cares so deeply about humanities and their impact on the medical profession and a career in medicine, material is though provoking and conversation sparking, get to read an abundance of diverse works, from philosophy to nonfiction experiences \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - A bit of uncertainty of the grading scale in the class, could have been more clear on where we stood in the class",
    "The strengths of the course are the instructor (Dr. Morrison), the syllabus, and the supplemental speakers\/trips. Dr. Morrison was a fantastic instructor and I hope he gets the chance to teach a college seminar again. He very clearly cared deeply about the course and you could tell how much time he put into planning each class. He was so kind and encouraged great discussion each week. Also, because he is a full-time physician, he had a lot of great perspectives to share on how the course material actually was relevant to the life and practice of a physician (and also served as a wonderful mentor for a class full of premeds). I really liked him and hope we keep in touch after the class ends. The syllabus he designed was also wonderful. Each week covered a different topic and area in the medical humanities ranging from literature to history to philosphy to art history to music and so much more. Although I was a biology major with limited exposure to the humanities, I found the material very accessible while still challenging my humanities brain. I feel like I grew a lot as a reader, thinker, and writer because of the syllabus. I loved almost everything that we read and am actually looking forward to reading some of the suggestions or full texts of things suggested by Dr. Morrison in class. In addition to the class syllabus, Dr. Morrison also organized guided tours of the YCBA and the Cushing Center at SHM. These were great learning opportunities and it was cool to see some of things authors and artists we were learning about in class in real life. The guest speakers were also a great addition and I loved learning from them! The only weakness of the course was the reading load. Although I greatly enjoyed what we read, some weeks were pretty reading heavy and I struggled to finish it all in time.",
    "Strengths: the readings are incredibly interesting, the guest lecturers are eye-opening, and Dr. Morrison provides a wonderful first-hand perspective on many of the issues we discussed; Weaknesses: discussion on the readings could have been facilitated better by starting with discussion questions. Often times the discussion was superficial, repeating what was in the reading and\/or repeating what others had already said multiple times.",
    "Strengths:  Dr. Morrison was the most inspiring person ever. This class was so important for me as a premed to take: this class introduced me to the uncertainty present in medicine and as a STEM premed I might've never realized this existed if I didn't take this class. I hope classes like this can continue to be offered at Yale, especially if Dr. Morrison is teaching. Also, I learned a lot about how uncertainty manifests itself in medicine and about a breadth of other humanities topics-- literature, art history, music, etc. and how these relate to medicine. \r\nWeaknesses: none. I hope Dr. Morrison can teach a class like this again!"

   "comments": [
    "YES - if Yale has the pleasure of seeing this class again, everyone, interested in medicine or not, would be honored to take this class. It attracted such wonderful people and allowed for a truly engaging and life-changing experience.",
    "Yes! This course should be taken by any pre-medical student.",
    "Yes if theyre interesting in philosophy and art in medicine.",
    "Yes. This class may have been my favorite I have taken at Yale. Dr. Morrison is an incredible teacher and truly cares about each one of his students. The subject matter was also fascinating.",
    "YES. Everyone should take this course!",
    "Yes, so strongly. Incredible course with an incredible professor.",
    "Yes, any pre-med must take this class. It is crucial for anyone thinking of going into any field of medicine to take. You learn about what it means to care for others and how to deal with the stresses of the profession.",
    "Yes, it was a wonderful course and I was exposed to a diversity of fascinating readings and perspectives.",
    "YES!!!!",
    "Yes!! This course was the best course I have taken at Yale. I felt constantly inspired, loved doing the readings, and really enjoyed writing the papers. If you are interested in medicine, this course will push you to think about medicine and life in thought-provoking ways.",
    "You would be stupid to not take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Dr. Morrison was an absolute joy to learn from, and the lessons in the class are lessons to live by, no matter your eventual profession.",
    "Absolutely. Especially to any students interested in medicine or anything medicine-adjacent. This course really helps student develop a full picture of the medical experience, and allows us to realize that it can be \"Medicine AND...\" Humanities are not only interesting, but also helpful for even the most scientific of fields, and this course helped to show that.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I would especially recommend it to anyone in the sciences or who is premed who is looking to expand upon the humanities side of science and medicine. We covered a wide array of medical humanities areas (literature, history, art, philosophy, music, media, etc.) so there was something for everyone. As a biology major with very limited exposure to these kinds of topics, I was a bit nervous going into the course. However, I found the content very accessible and had a great time exploring these topics. Dr. Morrison is such a kind, cheerful, and caring professor and I loved learning from him this semester. You can tell he puts a lot of time into the course and he really does want to get to know you and is invested in your success in the course. The reading load can be a little high each week (especially for a science-y person who isn't used to having 1 week to read a book + some) but thankfully the course only has a few assignments (a midterm paper, a final paper, and 2 chill in-class presentations) so overall I think the workload rounded itself out. Plus, he organized a great series of field trips and guest speakers that were awesome! Overall I had a great time and learned to appreciate the value and relevance of the humanities in the sciences and especially in medicine and will take many of these lessons with me in my future studies.",
    "I would recommend this course everyone who may ever interact with a physician or who may have a loved one interact with a physician. So I recommend this course to everyone. Though there are improvements in how the course is structured and how discussion is lead, the aim and content of this course make it a great course to explore a very relevant side of healthcare.",
    "Yes this class was incredible-- in my top three my favorite classes I've ever taken and I'm a senior."
