                "This class taught us information that is extremely relevant to anyone who wants to do research in the biological sciences. However, it was often very long and somewhat disorganized, which honestly made it hard to stay awake at points. On the bright side, the TAs were very helpful in giving feedback, and Dr. Moreno always answered any questions we had.",
                "Dr. Moreno is the strength of this course. She is great. Even with online class, she found an interesting project with the tomato genome that taught us all so much in a hands-on way. I've never taken a class that left me this prepared for the real-world, and it was perfect for anyone looking to do research especially in genetics. I don't want this to be a bad reflection on the teaching staff, but this class was also hugely stressful. It felt like we were learning how to do piece by piece as they came and as a class, we weren't really let in on the full picture of what we were doing until the very end. \r\n\r\nI hate to be the student who brings up grading, but we did not receive a single piece of graded work until May 5th. My canvas grades page said 'N\/A' until the very last week of classes. After that, the staff provided great feedback that was incredibly helpful for writing the final draft. They made themselves available to meet and answer questions, but I would be remiss to not mention that for most of the semester we all felt like we were in some kind of limbo not knowing where we stood grade-wise.",
                "The course was very well-structured. The lectures were helpful and the office hours, alongside emails were helpful in clarifying the assignments. One small weakness would be that sometimes the assignments were slightly confusing, but usually an email to Professor Moreno would clear up the confusion.",
                "I think Dr. Moreno did an incredible job of creating a course experience that replicated the in-person experience as much as possible. Organization, clarity, and availability were certainly strengths.",
