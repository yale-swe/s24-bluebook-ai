The course is conducted entirely in English but a good grasp on reading in French is obviously necessary (good English writing skills are probably more important). How to use dictionaries and thesauruses well, how to analyze context and move from transcribing to interpretation, etc. Nice course!!",

                "Each week, there is a new short piece to be translated, which is workshopped in class. The final draft is then due the following week. I really liked this format because I was new to translation and it allowed me to ask questions and gain insight from my peers and from Prof. Waters.",

                "The strength of this course was how closely everyone worked together as we revised our work in small groups. We all learned from each other and grew to be both more critical of our choices and more confident in our instincts, if that makes sense. The pieces were also well-chosen, and I was surprised by how valuable I found the translation analysis assignment to be.",
                "I thought that this was an excellent course.",
                "A little more clarity with respect to grades would have been good along the way. Besides that, all excellent!",
                "I really appreciated how much hands-on translation experience we got.",
                "I only wish we had more opportunities to practice speaking French in this class, while I read a lot of French I didn't use oral skills as much as I would have liked. However, this is understandable for a translation course I think this actually more reflective of the unfortunate fact that a lot of upper level French courses don't seem to be taught in French, aside from a weekly section.",
                "I loved being able to break up in groups abs review a translated work together. It helps to see how differently others could translate a similar piece. I also liked the larger group discussions which afforded us huge opportunities to ask the professor clarifying questions. The variety of the assigned readings was also super helpful and allowed us to work different translation muscles.",
                "I know this isnt within the syllabus of this course, but I wouldve loved to speak a bit of French and maybe even attempt to translate in English piece into French."

                "I think if you are studying literature or French and are on the translation track this is obviously a necessary course, but even if you are not pursuing this field but have a knowledge and interest in French I highly recommend the course. Translation, for those who want to pursue the subject,  becomes like a creative writing class and an exploration of different author styles, and for those who  don't want to necessarily pursue this field, translation is like a fun brain exercise.",
                "Yes, even if youre not interested in translating work, it can still be helpful in understanding translated work. This course also offers insight on what really goes on in the course of translating works and makes you look at such work with deeper appreciation."
