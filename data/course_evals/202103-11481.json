                "In-person class conversations were very engaging and helpful.  The small class size and organization of the course encourages collaboration and a space where it's okay to make mistakes and learn.  Pretty consistent amount of work every week.  Linguameetings (that we had to pay for) were not very helpful and didn't really fit with the course.",
