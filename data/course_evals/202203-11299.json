                "The course is well-paced and well-organized and the problem sets reflect what is taught in class. There are also plenty of peer tutor/instructor office hours to attend if needed. No weaknesses!",
                "Strengths: Content was well taught, depending on instructor. Class is fairly well-paced and problem sets do not take a long time, but still give you enough practice. Weaknesses: The organization of the class was terrible. There was no course schedule so there is no way to know what would be covered by the course. Midterm and final exam information was totally inadequate and was not provided by the course manager. If it was, it would be a couple days before the day of the exam. Project had almost no guideline. When asked how long it should be, the course manager's response was \"I don't know, but I am guessing it would be 5-10 pages.\"",
                "I found the content to be pretty boring. Some classes we would spend recapping previous lectures, and other classes were quickly running through new topics.",
                "Considering the course is about applications, it would have been nice to see a few more examples of real world applications as we learned about the concepts. Otherwise, it was a good amount of content for a one semester course.",
                "I honestly think for what it teaches the course is designed perfectly.",
                "Strengths: Brett is an amazing professor. He explains concepts very clearly, and he deeply cares about his students to the point that he tries to learn everyones names in the lecture. He is also very helpful if you go to his office hours, and he would do his own section review sessions before tests.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the PSET problems just did not feel very well picked-out based on what we had learned in class. I also didnt feel like office hours with the TAs were that helpful or frequent enough. Also, the final project was very poorly explained in terms of what was expected and not very well organized. There was supposed to be an Ed discussion board for the class, but they never answered it.",
                "The course material was fine, but the course director was clueless when it came to the project specifications",
                "Brett is a great teacher and someone who can explain complex topics in very digestable ways.",
                "Strengths: The workload was reasonable and the textbook explained all the concepts in more detail. Weaknesses: The lectures could include more examples.",
                "This was by far the best math course Ive taken at Yale. All the lectures were pretty interesting, the homeworks were reasonable lengths, and the exams were pretty straightforward. The textbook was great, explained concepts clearly and helped make the homework quick and easy. I learned a lot in this class and really enjoyed it.",
                "The content is quite easy and straight forward, I think my teacher organized the course well. The weakness comes in the project that was very vague and we were not quite sure what the teachers wanted.",
                "Strengths: Brett Smith is an amazing professor. The content was actually rather interesting and engaging for a Math class.\r\nWeaknesses: The written project was a good idea but we were provided very poor guidance for it by James Barnes, the other instructor.",
                "taught very well, well paced and structured.",
                "Biggest Strength - Brett Smith. Please take this class with him, even if it's 9 AM. His teaching is S-tier. Best STEM Prof at Yale, no joke. If I had the ability to give Nobel Prizes to people, I'd give one to Brett for his ability to keep you engaged and understand the material the first time around. I don't even like math that much. Brett also held review sessions, and AFIAK was the only professor to send study guides to students before exams. So, take this class with Brett, and you will thank yourself.\r\nStrengths - Easier than calc, grading scheme benefits students. \r\nWeaknesses - The umbrella organization of this class wasn't great. There were no real practice exams for the midterm or final, and those provided to us were not really representative of the final and didn't even have answers. To quote Prof Barnes (the course head), \"I don't have solutions so don't ask.\"",
                "The best part of this course were the peer tutors. They were all so kind and helped us understand topics better than in class by working through the psets. The course could be improved if it had better organization and less ambiguity surrounding exams and the project.",
                "Strength: Smith is a hidden gem in the Math Department\r\nWeakness: The 3 sections that made up all of 222 was a little unorganized at times",
                "The course was well structured, especially compared to what Ive heard about previous years. I dont think having a project made much sense, as the project was not really related to course material.",

Smith (I do not have experience with the other instructors and from talking to other students in different sections, it seemed like the learning outcomes were very instructor-dependent). He is great at explaining higher-level concepts in simple terms using examples from textbooks, while also elaborating where necessary. Definitely a better choice than MATH 225 if you do not care for the proofs and rather learn how to use linear algebra (to be clear: it is good understanding the proofs that explain how certain formulas and equations work, but that was nowhere as important as actually applying said formulas and equations in this course).",
                "I probably would not recommend this course to others. If you are like me and are scared of a fully proof based course like 225 but enjoy math, this class will not be fulfilling at all. As for satisfying a credit, this course is completely manageable and understandable.",

                "Yes, if Brett is teaching",
                "Yes, I would recommend the course especially if the student doesn't bother too much about proofs. Also the workload for MATH 222 is far less than the one for MATH 225 or 226.",
                "Absolutely. Different instructors were teaching this semester than usual, but it worked out for the best. If Brett is teaching this again in the future, you should really consider taking it with him, even if it is at 9 am. I really liked the applied aspect of this class, and how little we focused on proofs.",
                "Yep my favorite class this semester.",

                "yes, very well structured and taught",
                "Yes!",
