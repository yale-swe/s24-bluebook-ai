                "This course was extremely informative and helpful for a number of reasons. The syllabus is designed to give you a very full breadth of knowledge about the EU; its structure, its problems, its individual nations, its history. Each week is a new, well-chosen reading that contributes to this deep understanding. Professor Cameron is wonderful and structures the week around page-long, memo-like reflections on the assigned reading, points around which he will base the weeks discussion. \r\n\r\nSitting in class is the most informative part though of course, and Professor Cameron always starts with an application of the reading to the current EUs happenings, cross-applying the theoretical and historical approach of the reading to the real life events.",

                "The courses strengths are in its structure. It is well-thought and the readings have a purpose. They are not randomly jiggsawed together, they have a real order and meaning. Professor Cameron is a strength of the course. His knowledge of the EU is endless and he facilitates discussion very well.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course are few- perhaps one being the monotony of a seminar-style class on Zoom. There were no visuals, no hands on experiences, of course, so from that standpoint, the experience was a bit monotonous, and yet still very interesting.",
                "Strengths: The organization of this course is really conducive to building a great understanding of the European Union. Additionally, Professor Cameron is super great. Weaknesses: This course has a lot of required reading (roughly a book a week) and while the reading was very helpful in teaching concepts, I wonder if it could have been cut down a bit.",
                "One strength of this course is its organization; I liked the discussion of a different theme each week. I also thought the workload was fair and evenly distributed; just a weekly response, and a research prospectus due at the end of the semester. \r\nOne weakness of the course is that the discussion is really shaped by the other students' familiarity with the topics being discussed and willingness to engage. There were times when the discussion was slow.",
                "Seminar was pretty good, though Professor Cameron did go off on tangents sometimes. I think I would have benefitted from some more discussion in the beginning of the semester of the basic governance structure of the EU. It's pretty complicated, and some discussion in class that reinforced the readings on the topic would have been helpful.",
                "Discussion in each seminar was very informational and helpful in my understanding, but the reading load can be a lot most of the time. It is very easy for the discussion to become dominated by one or two students.",
                "Strengths: information is comprehensive\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only two forms of informational input, books and articles. Could benefit from other modes of learning such as podcasts"

It was also very easy to have zoom burn-out from simply looking at everyone's screens for two hours without anything else like a slide\/video, or even screen share to look at. Also we ran into technical difficulties a few times simply because the professor was not very technologically adept but there was not TA to provide assistance whenever those issues arrived. We sometimes had to emailing our professor in the zoom call if their volume was shut off or interrupting them to let them know students were in the waiting room because the professor could not always see our screens if we were raising our hands.",

                "If you are interested in the European Union and love reading a new book every week and are the type to heavily participate in discussion then yes. If you do not think you can commit to the reading load and are generally shy in seminars, then no.",
