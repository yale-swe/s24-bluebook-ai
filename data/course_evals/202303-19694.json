I also learned basic Japanese grammar, listening and speaking  in Japanese, and aspects of Japanese culture. I learned basic vocabulary involving greetings, introducing myself, basic descriptions, common activities, and more.",
                "Basic Japanese reading, writing, speaking, and listening. You actually go pretty far with the language in the course",
                "Reading and writing hiragana, katakana and some kanji. Basic grammar structures and vocabulary. Proper Japanese pronunciation. Basic etiquette and social norms in Japan. The final project was a good opportunity to learn more about Japan by planning and presenting a 3-day trip itinerary.",

                "The amount of HW every day is understandable but I'd benefit more from less frequency of the class and time. e.g. 120 minutes for 2-3 days a week with HW due on those days. Attendance can be difficult for graduate students with all the events and scheduling issues.",
                "The class is well paced and we get a lot of practice with the material.",
                "Strengths: Quick feedback on tests and homework (often returned the day after turning in), learned A LOT, large emphasis on speaking in class, everything felt really approachable and understandable, I didn't have to put too much work in outside of class beyond what was required because we learned so much from in-class activities and the homework. Nozaki-sensei is incredibly supportive navigating us through what is a really difficult language and class was really fun and engaging. There were also cool activities during the semester like calligraphy and the final project, which let us plan out our own trip to Japan entirely in Japanese. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None. Just be aware of the workload (although I think it's a bit overexaggerated) and that there is a somewhat hidden extra time commitment in the form of Japanese clinic, a 1 hour tutoring session each week that you're required to attend.",
                "It's a fantastic course. While I understand that it is important to study a language every day, the homework and self study every single day can be a little difficult to manage time-wise. However it is still easy studying and very effective.",
                "Strengths: very organized (given a weeks notice for tests\/quizzes), reliable and quick to respond faculty, close connection with classmates.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is quite a bit of homework, but that is inevitable for learning language skills."

                "Absolutely. I'm not sure about the other Japanese professors, but I would definitely recommend taking Japanese with Nozaki-sensei. Even though it was her first semester at Yale, she was incredibly well-prepared. She's incredibly kind and supportive and cares a lot about student success. Just know that Japanese isn't an easy language credit; it will require a good amount of passion and drive, but it's really motivating to see my classmates as well as Nozaki-sensei share that passion for the language. I feel like our class was pretty tight-knit, and we shared a lot of laughs just flailing around in this language we just started learning. It's really incredible how much you learn by the end of this class. If you put in the work (which there is quite a lot, but it's not that demanding or difficult), a good grade is very obtainable.",
                "If you want to learn Japanese, YES! It's amazing how far you can go just through this one course. By the end of the semester you can speak, read, and write a lot.",
                "If you have the slightest interest in learning Japanese, take this course",
                "Absolutely. While the course is challenging in the amount of out of class work and discipline to self-study, learning Japanese through this course is highly rewarding. It is unbelievable how much you can learn in one semester through this course."
