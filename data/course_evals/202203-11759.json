                "This course was very well organized. Each week was devoted to a group of ideas, movements, artists, thinkers, etc. The course was designed so that it was very easy for students to make connections between ideas in different weeks. It also exposed me to many new ideas (I had never taken any course similar to this). Sometimes the course devolved into a \"Leminar,\" where the 10 of us were sitting in a classroom listening to the professor lecture. I think, perhaps, it may be easier to design this course as a lecture, but then you would lose some of the collaborative elements."

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you are interested in any humanities discipline, this course will be intriguing. It spans so many disciplines, from history to literature to art history to film studies to theatre studies, etc. Further, the study of Modernism is crucial to understanding Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Every class was exciting, which I cannot say for most of my classes."
