                "I learned a lot more about the language of Spanish, especially when it comes to learning how to have conversations in Spanish that are accurate to what you are feeling and the tense you are trying to speak in. I learning about the many past tenses in Spanish, the future tense, the subjunctive form that you use with emotions and other matters, etc. I also learned much more vocabulary like about nature, careers, and technology, and much more.",
                "Helped with communicating in Spanish",
                "This course was extremely helpful in building a strong foundation for speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish. Throughout the semester, the heavy emphasis on class participation greatly improved my ability to understand Spanish in conversation. Having to constantly figure out what was happening for the whole 50 minutes of class encouraged a lot of learning from context clues, which I think is really important in the real world. Moreover, having to only speak in Spanish during class made speaking the language easier and more comfortable. In addition, the range of topics of covered from holidays to healthcare systems in Spanish-speaking countries taught me a lot about the cultures of the different countries."

                "It is part of the language grindso you gotta work through it. It is a lot of work and not all of it is super enjoyable. However, Sabe tried really hard to make it fun. Class itself is entertaining and engaging, even if the work is not.",
                "VHL was quite tedious at times and it feels like there have to be better ways to learn with homework",
                "I felt like towards the beginning there was a lot of busy work, VHL included. I feel like VHL should be a supplemental thing instead of mandatory as it is a great study tool, but I found that if I didnt have time I would not actually do the work enough to learn",
                "I think this course should have a lower grade percentage for A. And also that the vhl Supersite should give more than just one or two tries because realistically teachers can say its all about making mistakes but when you make the course centered around penalizing mistakes and making it difficult to achieve a top score that discourages students and encourages cheating to be honest. \r\nI think they shouldve done more actually grammar lessons in class because its just ridiculous to expect students to teach themselves correctly a foundational part of a new language like isnt that why you are teaching this course? Its ridiculous. If it cant be fit in the time of the class, and we have class five days a week, you are doing something wrong because every other teacher can manage it with only two days per week. \r\nAlso these teachers need to know that we have other classes, like Spanish isnt the most important thing on our schedule when making projects and assignments.",
                "The strengths of this course are the small class sizes because it ensures that everyone has the chance to engage properly with the material and ask any questions that they have. The strength is also meeting everyday because there is so much material to go over so it makes sure everything is fresh in your mind. A weakness I think is the grading just because it could be a little strict sometimes, which puts a lot of pressure onto people who are still new to a language. This could be improved by focusing grading on how hard you tried and your effort moreso than on accuracy.",
                "The course starts out farther out than SPAN 110 ends, but the teacher was available to help and the class was engaging.",
                "I think the strengths of this course are its emphasis on in-class participation and the wide range of cultural topics it covers. Together, they made learning in class really engaging and gave students the opportunity to really experience the language in a way that was more personal than just lectures. The emphasis on in-class participation especially made learning speaking and comprehension a much faster process and also a much more interesting process. Having to constantly stay on the same page as the teacher was challenging but also exciting. And the wide range of cultural topics covered was something that made class always very interesting. In my opinion, it gave students an idea of how what they were learning could be applied in the real world. But on the flip side, I think the weaknesses of this course are its pace at the beginning of the semester and its spacing of tests. The class was almost completely conducted in Spanish beginning on the first day, and while later on that was extremely fun, for the first one to two weeks, it made keeping up really difficult for students with only Spanish 110 background. I think one thing that could be changed is slowing down the classes for those first weeks just until everyone feels more comfortable with their comprehension before picking it up. As for the spacing of tests, there was not a lot of time to practice the material in class for the last two tests, and I think it would be helpful to maybe add a week in between the tests."

Also, you can become more confident in your speaking abilities, which can help with communicating with native speakers.",

This course builds a strong foundation in the language and does so in a fun manner. The homework workload is pretty heavy, but the classes are fully focused on engagement and participation which makes the learning really interesting. In addition, the professor gives a lot of feedback and returns assignments quickly, making it really easy to review and learn from mistakes. All in all, the course is organized really well and class is always engaging."
