   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- great intro to Egyptian history and analysis of themes\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- I felt like we went through some periods of Egyptian history too quickly and I'm still fuzzy on those eras.",
    "Great survey course of Ancient Egypt. Having known almost nothing about the period and initially believing it constituted a static history, this course presented a fascinating look at the Ancient Egyptian world. Would absolutely recommend for those seeking a captivating history lecture!",
    "Good course",
    "A little bit disorganized but v interesting and informative if you keep up with the readings",
    "This course was very interesting and covered a topic that I knew nearly nothing about. However, the 4000 year time period covered, as well as the nature of the sources, meant that it was very difficult to actually feel that I went beyond surface level engagement with any particular facet of the subject covered in the course. There was so much material over so much time that I felt that I couldn't actually learn or synthesize it to an acceptable degree.",
    "Great lectures, but readings are often too dense.  Sections tend to vary immensely in content.",
    "This course was very interesting and I also thought it was well-structured."

    "If you are a history major, interested in Ancient Egypt, or like reading ancient writing\/stories, this is a great class.",
    "Yes, great professor, great material, great class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, but I would tell them to focus more on the readings than the lectures",
    "Yes, but you must have an interest in both history and archaeology.  This is not a purely historical course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students because it explores many aspects of ancient Egyptian life. It is also very interesting material.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student.  Ancient Egypt is an underrepresented field in the History Department, and Professor Manning's lecture is an excellent introduction to the subject."
