                "The structure of the class allows for students to easily comprehend the material.",
                "Extremely relevant content and assignments. The problem sets cover the topics of speculating in individual stocks, borrowing to invest, market timing, human capital and portfolio choice, saving early in life vs. late in life, income forecasting, determining likelihood of running out of money in retirement before death, Social Security benefit planning, 401k tax considerations, buy vs rent. Some additional clarity about undergraduate grading would be helpful.",
                "Strength is that it is engaging and Professor Choi gets the students involved with the class often. One weakness is that the quizzes at the beginning of each class start exactly at the beginning of class so even if you are a minute late, you are already behind and have significantly less time. Given I was coming from a previous class, it made doing well on the quizzes (which are 30% of the final grade) relatively hard."
