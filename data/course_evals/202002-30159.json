   "comments": [
    "I was able to developed better writing skills through the reading responses. I learned how to engage more deeply with readings and then think about and write thoughtful reading responses because I learned about to think about a reading, not simply memorize the information.",
    "- Brief and basic overview of some philosophical ethic frameworks\r\n- Foundations of moral psychology \r\n- Experiments in babies, primates, and adults\r\n- Effective altruist movement",
    "Critical thinking and moral analysis",
    "I learned a lot about morality and the different views, perceptions, and theories of morality. Applications to religion, politics, racism, global society and more.",
    "I feel much more confident answering moral questions.",
    "I learned how to question research and look at the findings of papers more cautiously. I also learned a lot about different moral psychological phenomena and how it connected with aspects of philosophy.",
    "A deeper insight into how the concept of morality manifests itself in our lives",
    "What morality is and how it impacts our everday thoughts, behavior and actions. Gained new perspective on major issues and why people tend to disagree on them",
    "I learned how to be critical of literally everything which is honestly super important. We tend to view our take on morality as true which is definitely not the reality. I also learned how to not take academic papers at face value and really think about their arguments and try to push back!",
    "I learned a lot during MOEL. The course covered many contemporary issues in the world and about the morality of everyday life. The course presented us with different aspects of morality: philosophical beliefs on morality ,driving functions of morality, and the evolution of morality. The course intuitively brings together moral arguments from all sides and psychological studies to help us understand how we can be better people. I truly believe that the course has changed my thought process about certain moral issues and has allowed me to see the world much, much differently than prior to taking the course.",
    "Don't fall prey to your biases and be open to listening to all aspects of the discussion topic at hand.",
    "I had a ton of insights about myself in this course. It was super interesting getting these views on morality from such a multidisciplinary course.",
    "various insights of morality from different fields (psychology, philosophy, economics, and neuroscience), applications to religions and politics",
    "A better understanding of general topics of morality around the world.",
    "- Major insights into many aspects of morality that we take for granted, such as empathy\r\n- Critical thinking about what leads to different systems of morality\r\n- Optimism for moral progress and how we get there",
    "I gained a great amount of knowledge about the subject of morality--how to approach moral questions, societal views and debates, and moral theories.",
    "This class taught me how to analyze psychological research and discuss its implications. I learned about several theories of human morality and how they're placed in context of psychology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A strength was our two hour sections on Thursdays with our TF. I found the most compelling discussions come from our sections and i was always left thinking deeper about the topics we learned. The course didnt have any glaring weaknesses. I would say the one thing I wanted a little more of was group work. I think our break out room discussions were fascinating and I think it could have been interesting to have a small group project stem from one of those break out room discussions where I would get to work with my classmates.",
    "This course was very well done given that it took an online format. It was well organized both in terms of the macro course structure and the day-to-day structure of discussion sections and class. The readings were diverse and engaging, and the weekly essays required thoughtful responses. One weakness might be that during discussion with Prof. Bloom, it was difficult to participate since there were 20 people all trying to say something.",
    "I thought the course was excellently designed and taught.",
    "The discussions with the TA were much more open and allowed for more student interaction than the lectures with the professor, which was one of the best parts of the class.",
    "Even for a summer course, there was a high reading load (which is a strength for some and weakness for others)",
    "The discussion sections were awesome. I thought it really helped me get more out of the material.",
    "The material was very engaging and the discussions we had in class were very interesting. Sometimes it felt that there was too much reading\/lecture material that we couldn't cover in discussion",
    "Interesting topics, class discussions were very engaging",
    "There could have been clearer guidelines on how our assignments would be graded",
    "Strengths:\r\n- this course was as objective as can be in terms of teaching morality, even though many of the topics were politically charged. Both sides to every issue were considered and discussed in good faith. I applaud the people who put this course together.\r\n- the course meeting structure was very conducive to class discussion.\r\n- Paul bloom is a great professor, and Julia Marshall is an amazing TF\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- NONE!",
    "I thought the strength of the class was that it encompassed so many different arguments on all of the topics covered. This provided so much information to dwell on that was very clearly explored with Professor Bloom and the super knowledgable TFs. My only issue with the course is that the lectures were prerecorded, but other than that I think that this was the most fun class I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "The lectures were digestible, the readings were interesting, the discussions were eye-opening, but the final exam was cruel.",
    "Strengths: Great readings, great professor and TA. Weaknesses: I am still a bit confused with how my grade will be turned out, no clue currently about what I should expect.",
    "The methods of participation were a bit awkward, but the topics and teaching were very engaging. Just allow people to freely speak to participate.",
    "-Strengths: lectures and discussion sections were engaging and interesting\r\n-Weaknesses: Discussion sections were a bit large, so not everyone got to speak for a long time",
    "This course is great.  It probably helps that it has been taught in the online and condensed summer format for quite some time now, but Prof. Bloom and TF Julia Marshall run the class like a well-oiled machine.  The discussion section-heavy format is perfect for the class and getting time to discuss topics with Prof. Bloom in a small group setting after taking large lectures with him in the past is awesome.\r\n\r\nThe lecture portion was easy to forget about at times, but still nicely laid out.",
    "The TAs led fantastic discussion and were able to challenge our views to help us arrive at firm conclusions, or provoke more questions for us to analzye. The group setting was really conducive to the discussion of morality. The reading responses were easily managed and thought-provoking. The final paper could've had more guidance, as it was graded by the professor instead of the TAs, whom we were used to writing for."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. I think it is a very engaging course that allows you to think a lot about morality in general and also examine aspects of your own morality which I thought gave me new insights into how I navigate the world.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to experiment with a psychology seminar. It is not really a philosophy course, as our papers and argument structures don't really focus on philosophical arguments so much as scientific papers.",
    "Absolutely. Interesting topic, fantastic Professor and TA. Good workload.",
    "I would recommend to anyone that wants to understand why people have different perceptions and moral views, and think about how we could make the world better.",
    "Absolutelyyou learn how to definitively answer the question \"what is moral\" while doing justice to the diversity of opinions on the subject.",
    "I would. It's a really interesting course that really helps improve your critical thinking skills when looking at papers.",
    "Yes, this class really makes you think and is very engaging. Morality is such an important factor that affects how we see the world and its very important to understand this.",
    "Yes definitely",
    "Yes, a must-take course before you graduate from Yale!",
    "Definitely. This class should be taken by everyone. You don't need to have any prior experience with psychology to follow everything going on. The class may or may not change your morals, but it will most certainly give you a completely new perspective on the world. The course is taught with experts in the field and allows, even encourages, you to challenge anything you disagree with. It is a conversation on morality that is applicable in everyday life: our everyday interactions with people, our career, our interaction with the world itself, etc. This was the most interesting and practical class I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Yes! This class was jaw-dropping and eye-opening; I didn't know that I could possibly support an argument against empathy, but this class changed my mind.",
    "Yes! Bloom is a great and super interesting character. The content is super interesting and you will think about it beyond the classroom.",
    "Yes, very interesting topics and discussions",
    "Yes, it a relaxing yet intellectually stimulating course that engages in a very niched topic.",
    "Yes, it overturns preexisting conceptions of morality and leads to greater understanding of people different than us. It also reminds us of the realities of human nature and how we make the best out of it. Definitely one of the best and most unique classes at Yale.",
    "Yes- this course is enjoyable just for the conversations it brings up.  As with many classes, this one is more enjoyable the more effort you put into it.",
    "This course is a fun and easy way to get a glimpse into how morality works and a little snippet of psychology. However, if you're looking for a very detailed dive into either subject, consider taking a course specifically in the PSYC or PHIL departments, because this course seems to be more for beginners.",
    "Yes. Great material that makes you rethink every decision you make. Professor Bloom is a wonderful lecturer."
