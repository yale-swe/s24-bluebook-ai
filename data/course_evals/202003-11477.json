                "Pak Indriyo made the course really fun and engaging with his enthusiasm and patience. The weekly mini-culture lectures and weekly speaking practice sessions also really helped support our language study. I think I would hope to have more small scale assignments to keep up with retention and memorization of vocabulary\/grammar. Not necessarily for a big grade but small assignments like make five sentences using this week's unit would help just to know if we are learning\/applying our materials correctly and consistently.",
                "A strength of this course was how slow the instructor went to make sure everyone understands the course work. A weakness of this course is that the work wasn't graded for a while.",
                "The class schedule and structure changed constantly. It would have been nice for the schedule of practice conversations to remain constant so we didn't have to take time to re-schedule each student's practice conversations each week. That said, the instructor took immense effort to incorporate student feedback into the course design throughout the semester, even at the very end. When I suggested that one-on-one discussions with native Indonesian speakers was the best way to learn the language, he found several former Indonesian instructors residing in Indonesia and organized longer discussion opportunities for students. The course also introduced us to many exciting aspects of Indonesian culture. We learned about coffee, dance, sites to travel to, traditional music, food, and much more.",
                "This course was an overall gem in my opionion. I thought the format with ngobrols and constant opportunity to speak freely really helped my learning of the language",
                "I was strong at understanding and writing the language. However, I struggled with formulating sentences and speaking the language.",
                "Virtually, Pak Indriyo provided a spark for myself especially since the class is early in the morning. He makes the class exciting and not a total dread.",
                "Phenomenal teaching and lectures were very interesting.",
                "Great course",
                "The strengths of this class was it was very entertaining and I always wanted to go to class today",
                "The strengths of this course was the willingness of both the professor and TA to help their students learn. One weakness however could be the slight lack of organization in terms of assigning coursework, receiving feedback on homework or assignments, but this was somewhat alleviated by the weekly discussion sections.",
                "I wouldve liked to have more group conversation in Indonesian, as opposed to one on one."

                "The instructor's internet wasn't always the best quality, and his screen was often blurry. So we had to download materials ourselves and keep multiple screens open simultaneously to clearly read the notes he was going over with us in class. Otherwise, the Zoom sessions were smooth and effective. Except for the difficulty of having the class synchronously repeat phrases after the teacher--a common practice in language instruction. This never worked with Zoom! I thought the TA's use of Jamboard and dropbox was helpful for arranging class activities.",
                "I felt it was easier to engage because the class was so small and I had my camera on. He had us engage by having sentences translated or something along those lines. He also put us in breakout rooms which I thought was beneficial. The course itself was run very well, but the only complaint I have is that we never received a grade for the course until the final grade so I couldn't see how I was doing or what I could improve on.",

This was one of my favorite classes at Yale without a doubt. I also really appreciated Pak Indriyo's and Kak Ganis' kindness and patience with students as we slowly picked up the language. Also Pak Indriyo takes student suggestions and feedback really well; his responsiveness is unique to my experience at Yale when it comes to tailoring the classroom and learning objectives to student interests and learning speeds.",
