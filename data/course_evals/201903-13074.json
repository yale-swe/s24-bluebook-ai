   "comments": [
    "My French improved greatly.",
    "The amount of grammar and vocab I learnt in this course was tremendous. I learnt grammar in much more depth than I had ever before and Mme. Koizim ensured that we learnt vocab in french rather than by the English translation. Furthermore, my speaking improved as well as my ability to think of things to say on the spot while using more interesting vocab than basic french students usually use.",
    "French grammar, vocabulary, phrases, writing. Definite emphasis on \"muscle memory,\" with lots of practice and aural repetition of concepts. Read and watched some great French literature and filmsL'tranger, Franois Truffaut movies, Le Petit Nicolas...",
    "I now have proficient knowledge of french grammar. I speak with greater fluency than I did before taking this course. My media literacy has vastly improved.",
    "I learned so much French this semester. Coming into the class I wasn't confident in speaking and writing, and I had a relatively weak foundation in grammar. Now I feel much more confident to express my thoughts and I have a much clearer grasp of grammar.",
    "I learned the fundamental French grammar concepts and practiced reading comprehension through the various stories we covered in class.",
    "Writing, grammar, speaking and listening in French.",
    "My French grammar, reading, and listening skills greatly improved to the point where I found myself forming phrases not by translating from English, but by thinking in French.",
    "I improved my French grammar and vocabulary.",
    "Through this course i was able to truly fortify my grammar skills and vocabulary.",
    "This course introduced me to the rigor of French grammar. I learned to adeptly handle different French tenses, moods, and sentence structures. And with every unit I practiced a new set of applicable vocabulary relating to our texts\/cinema.",
    "Improved my French way more than I ever thought was possible in a single semester",
    "I learned to think about the language more structurally, using grammar and spelling as tools to further my proficiency. I became able to construct more complex sentences and thoughts in the language and use them to explain ideas coherently. My approach to French improved in that I think more about the phrase as a whole rather than going word for word, which helps with verb\/noun agreements and genders.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount of grammatical rules and structures that apply to the French language, and how to use them in writing (as well as how not to use them in writing). I also learned many new vocabulary words that are useful in conversation and writing, and further developed my reading comprehension skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We covered a lot of material in a short amount of time, but sometimes it felt too fast.",
    "The strengths of the course were the speed at which material was covered and the depth it was covered. I found the homework useful. But, to improve the course, I would recommend fixing the long pauses in the audio files which make listening to a 30 minutes audio file that is really 20 minutes worth of material very difficult with our busy schedules. Furthermore, I feel as though an in-class exercise I feel would benefit everyone tremendously is speaking through situations where we lack the proper words to answer a question or giving pointers to things we could say in situations when we lack the words to answer directly.",
    "I have taken several other language courses at Yale, and they honestly pale in comparison to this one. I learned so much French! Mme. Koizim truly might be the best instructor I've had at Yale so far (be warned, while she's fabulous, she is no easy grader). Lots of strengths: very, very organized. Mme. Koizim brought boundless energy to class each morning, which is a must if you're showing up everyday at 9:25. Every aspect of the syllabus was thoughtfully constructed to facilitate the most learning possible in a semester period. Our homework always matched what we covered in class the next day. Yes, the class is a ton of work, as you can probably tell from the other course evals, but the professors seem to manage expectations pretty well, I never got hit with a surprise assignment.",
    "The structure of this course is fantastic, a very consistent workload throughout the semester. I loved the way that we analyzed movies in such depth and how we progressed from Petit Nicolas to Jules et Jim.",
    "Strengths: everything about the class. The reading materials are interesting, the immersive French-speaking environment really helped, and Mme Koizim makes the class very engaging. I can't think of any real weaknesses. Yes the workload is high but I felt that it was manageable and it was all worth it considering how much my French has improved.",
    "The workload is a lot but this also means that you learn a lot of French and are constantly practicing.",
    "strengths would be the practice and repetition of certain things. weakness is that students that took French 120 are not as prepared as though that tested into the class and it is very clear making class participation and feeling comfortable difficult in the classroom.",
    "Madame Koizim is definitely the greatest strength of this course - while she can be strict,  she keeps the class engaging and entertaining.\r\n\r\nThis course's greatest weakness is the lack of oral production. Although we have a minute or so of speaking on each evaluation, they are by no means enough to encourage significant speaking development.",
    "A lot of the audio programs felt too long especially since it was hard skipping to a specific section within it. Overall, the main strength is Madame Koizim as she is an excellent professor who is really passionate about teaching french",
    "Strengths: you are able to reinforce grammar skills and become more proficient in the language.\r\nWeakness: it requires a lot of work every night. Professor says you should be spending about 2hrs every night on French and that is about how much time you have to dedicate to the class to be doing alright. Quizzes on grammar learned night before for homework.",
    "This course demands a high level of classroom participation and engagement. French reading, writing, and listening will become much easier. Speaking will as well but to a lesser degree as this intermediate course emphasizes French fundamentals.",
    "It is built upon grammar and vocabulary, which is great, but I feel there should be a larger speaking component to the class. The strengths are that the homework audio programs are incredibly well done and the time in class is used to its fullest capability. No time is wasted in class. A weakness would be that it feels like way too much information is crammed into one semester. Because we are steam rolling through all this material, responses to questions in class were rushed. It often felt like we would cover a topic one day and if you didn't master it that night for homework, then too bad because we're on to the next one.",
    "Strengths: Consistent homework from the Course Packet, constant practice of new grammar and vocabulary. Successful use of texts to supplement other course work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough in-class speaking, whether to the teacher or in groups\/pairs. I felt that even though I learned a lot more French in terms of grammar and vocabulary, my speaking skills declined and I had a harder time expressing myself orally from lack of consistent practice."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this course truly pushes you to learn and breath french. Having class every day can be a burden, but it is the closest thing you can get to studying abroad while staying on yale's campus. I truly think the course is valuable, but you must be ready to work every day.",
    "In this class, you will not just learn French. You will experience French. This class will test you. The two hours a night slog is real. All your fears, struggles, joys, and successes will become related to French 130, and by the end of the semester, you'll have learned so much that it's worth it. Like the French language itself, this class is exacting, but so rewarding if you're willing to put in the work. Madame Koizim is hilarious and so dedicated to undergraduate learning, she literally designed this course and has taught it for years. Take her section!",
    "Absolutely! Like I previously mentioned, this course truly helped me understand french grammar and become much more comfortable with speaking french. Also, the books and movies that we discussed were such a pleasure to read and watch.",
    "DEFINITELY. And especially with Mme Koizim. This class forces you (in a good way) to put in the work and do constant revisions, and by the end of the term you'll have a solid basis of French langauge skills. Also it's just cool to analyze French texts and films in French!",
    "I recommend this course if you are willing to put in work to get good at French. The level isnt difficult but you have to work to do well.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you took AP French or you tested into French 130.",
    "Absolutely! Do not hesitate to take this course if you want to improve your French speaking ability. If you are just looking to fufill a language credit, however, there are courses better suited for that with much less work.",
    "Yes if you can handle the heavy workload",
    "I would recommend this course so long as you can handle the workload and are already pretty confident in your french skills.",
    "If the student is serious about appreciating the intricacies of the language, ready to commit an hour and a half of work daily on average, this course is superb. The student will end the semester with a noticeably improved range of vocabulary and comfort with French reading, listening, and writing. French learning will no longer be mere translation from one language to another but exploration into a rich language.",
    "Yes, fantastic teacher and a clear improvement from beginning to end",
    "Yes. It is difficult and time consuming, but necessary to further your ability to speak the language.",
    "I would recommend this course to those wishing to improve their understanding of French and trying to build a good base for being proficient or fluent in the language."
