You will definitely learn a lot, as it is very well-taught and well-organized, and it is designed so that you will get a lot out of the experience without some of the heavy workload that comes with other classes. You will see many amazing things that you may never get to in the future - so make sure to put this down as one of your top choices in preference selection!"
