It could be improved by having more concrete slides/notes to supplement Prof. Skowronek's entirely oral lectures. The readings also could be decreased since they are very long and not all of them were discussed in class.",

I think that sometimes the essay prompts asked more questions than I thought could be effectively explored in the length of the midterm papers.",
