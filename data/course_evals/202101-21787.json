                "our class vibes were immaculate and hal cares a lot about students, but for a FYS, i'd say the class was a lot more DRAMA than i expected, so while like he's not grading you like you're an amazing drama person, he has pretty particular tastes for essays and plays sometimes so its not like you'll fail but also it's by no means a gut class. making those plays can be like a part time job but also rewarding when you see the final project. i'd love to see more diversity in the class's guests and readings and conversations.",

                "I would highly recommend this course to everyone! I am by no means a theatre/performance studies major, but this class was definitely something that I looked forward to every week. I think that Hal is a wonderful professor and cares deeply about each of his students. I would also do it again just for the shenanigans. I learned a lot about my creative process this year and what it means to work with other people. Also you get to see shows (irl, once this pandemic is over), and that is exciting. I also really loved all the guest artists we met this year!",

                "No, unless you really want to take a class in devising in theater (group-made original works) and this is the only course offered during that term. This class was way too stressful, especially for a first-year seminar. It was neither a great introduction to theater for newcomers nor was it an opportunity for experienced theatermakers to grow.",
                "Although I did learn a lot in regards to creativity and collaboration in the theater space, I would not recommend this course for people who engage in theater just for fun (like me). This course takes theater on a more serious note and it requires constant analysis.",
                "Yes! Hal's classes are always organized and fun!",
                "I would! It was a wonderful way to meet students in a remote semester, and learning about the creative process was exactly what I was looking for in this class. Morning pages could be a bit of a handful at times, but ok as long as you don't save them for the last week before they're due."
