                "I learned how to view and think about films in conjunction with the time period they were made in. Often it is easy to see what you want to see in a film, but this class really helped me think about what the purpose of film was in the time that it was made. I also learned different ways to analyze films and different relevant film techniques",
                "This was the first class I had taken with a \"cultural history\" approach, which was very valuable. I also learned skills pertaining to film analysis, a welcome addition to my toolbox coming from a more traditional historical background.",
                "I reviewed several topics of American history and learned more in-depth about a couple of events and films through assignments discussions, etc",
                "I get to know how American cinema developed in different periods of history and read a certain historical context in various representative movies. Moreover, Carolyn has given us many sources to look for the information we need and taught me how to use citations correctly.",
                "Film analysis tools, American history overview, and key American films.",

                "strength - super understanding and nice professor, interesting classes and discussions",
                "Strengths: Carolyn and M were amazing teachers. They structured the course well, facilitated student discussion, provided helpful feedback, returned assignments in a timely fashion, were funny and friendly...\r\nWeaknesses: Can we get off Zoom already? I've had it with this pandemic. Apart from that no big problems. The course doesn't go super in-depth with of any particular historical period or event, but I expected that so wasn't disappointedthe focus is more on how film and media connect to and reflect the historical period.",
                "Getting to \"choose your own adventure\" in terms of assignment topics and format was excellent. While I won't say I enjoyed doing work, the work was interesting and allowed me to learn more about history I'm personally interested in. Ample time was provided in class to discuss assignments and ask questions which was also beneficial. At times it was hard to choose what to write about for the weekly movie responses and while I think having it open to talk about whatever you want is great and should stay, including a question or two to help guide those who are unsure might be helpful.",
                "Strengths: This course gives students many opportunities to watch and discuss movies, which is more attractive than ordinary subject courses for students who love culture and art. At the same time, because the teacher can provide very rich resources for movies, this course is suitable to online teaching and thus can attract more international students.\r\n\r\nWeakness:  Sometimes the enthusiasm of group discussion is not high\r\n\r\nHow to improve: Teachers can use more PPT and upload it on Canvas for students to review after class",
                "No major weaknesses other than noting that I did not feel spending classtime working on projects was productive and the reception assignment was difficult because it was a group assignment but the course was virtual."

                "Definitely, I will.\r\nFirst of all, the teachers are really great and you can learn a lot through their guidance.\r\nSecond, you can gain a good understanding of how to interpret movies in a historical context, which will open up a new dimension for you to watch them.",
