                "This might not be unique to multivariable calculus at Yale, but the pacing of the course is just so, so fast. Calculus is also generally not taught in a way that is particularly engaging. This was a very difficult course that consumed a lot of my time, without much satisfaction in what I learned. Again, this seems common to multivariable calculus classes in undergrad generally, but nevertheless it was not an enjoyable experience.",
                "It was not taught well and the tests and problem sets were tough",
                "I think this course is well taught if you have a talented instructor. However, it is sometimes hard to see the purpose of some of the concepts, and it would be more interesting if I really understood why I was learning whatever I learned throughout the course.",
                "The concepts taught in this course should not have been terribly challenging, yet the teaching and student support systems were subpar to say the least. I struggled in a way I was not expecting to, and there was not a lot of help available. All of my friends in the class chose to credit/D/fail or drop it, expressing similar concerns. The only reason I did not do the same was because it is a major prereq.",
                "A strength of the course was the access to out of classroom resources, including peer hours and review sessions. These organized events were beneficial when preparing for exams. A significant weakness of the course is the variance in the quality of teaching between sections. A student's experience entirely depends on their section leader, with some teachers not covering material that others addressed. I spent the majority of my time reviewing class content from the textbook to supplement in-person instruction."

Any student entering the course should be aware that they will need to donate time outside of class to absorb the material.
