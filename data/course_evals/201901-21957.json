    "Very organized. I would have appreciated if there was a teaching fellow to ask questions to outside of class",
    "There are few if any weaknesses! It's just a difficult course, as would any language course be, to become proficient. I think the sadness stems from the Japanese department shrinking in size. We need more Japanese professors! It's ridiculous to think 5 teachers are leaving, some without the desire to.",
    "well planned syllabus with a lot of thought, well chosen assignments.\r\nThe TA part should be improved. Better fix the frequency of clinics, say, once a week, or twice. The current pattern is hard to predict, and sometimes you just forget there is a clinic."

    "Yes, best way to learn Japanese in a practical way."
