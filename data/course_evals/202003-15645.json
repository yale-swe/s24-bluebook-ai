                "I not only learned about the Tale of Genji itself, but I was exposed to a whole new world and culture of Japan from 1000 years ago. It was fascinating to learn how the social customs and currents of the time impacted the writing of the Tale, and I really enjoyed discussing the lasting effects\/impacts the text had on Japanese society and the world more broadly. We also had a lot of practice with textual analysis, both for the prose and poetry portions of the Talein and of itself I didn't really take this class to learn how to analyze a text, but some of the concepts we discussed (such as recursion, textual memory, and mono no aware) were new and interesting to learn about.",

                "I thought this course was very well-paced and had a good balance overall, which helped a lot during remote learning. Reading the text took up the majority of the semester (as it should for a 1300 page book!) and even though the readings sometimes got a little lengthy, they were never overwhelming. I also thought that Professor Kamens is an incredible asset to this class, as he is incredibly knowledgeable about the Tale and kept exploring new topics in lectures right to the very end of the course.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that I would have loved to see a little more involvement from the classwe had a small enough group that seminar discussions were feasible, but they often ended up being squished into the final 10 or 15 minutes of lecture. I wonder if there is some way to keep providing the great content that is in the lectures themselves while still allowing for some more engagement during class time.",
                "They gave us clear and detailed feedback to our every assignment, by which I was able to greatly improve my writing. In that sense, the 1 on 1 office hours were really helpful. Also, when I had a family emergency and had to skip a few classes, they were very flexible about it, and I cannot thank them enough."

                "Absolutely! The Tale of Genji was something entirely out of my area of expertise, and I came in with zero knowledge of what I was going to be learning about. This course did a really great job of bringing everyone into the world of Genji regardless of prior knowledge, and I learned so many interesting things even though the class didn't have too heavy a workload. I also loved that we were able to spend the entire semester on one textI was able to read the Tale cover to cover (which was my main goal coming in) and de-prioritize some of the secondary sources we also read without losing much content from the class. For anybody looking to explore something new and really immerse yourself in one topic\/period in history for a semester, this is the course for you!",
