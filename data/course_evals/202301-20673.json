I thought this was pretty cool because there are a lot of nice intuitive\/beautiful ideas and results. For example, we talked a lot about what curvature on surfaces means, and how curvature relates to minimizing surface area (!). Later in the course we also talked about relating topology and geometry (Gauss-Bonnet theorem), and also about curves that minimize distance on surfaces (and how to define 'distance' on a surface). Overall, I think this course was cool because it covered a lot of geometric ideas that I had some intuition for from day-to-day life and made them rigorous. Part of the skills we learned were a lot of computations for things like curvature, distance, etc.",

                "The prof nicely developed the material so everything connected. It was helpful to have a textbook that aligned well with the course.",
                "Grader (not prof) was incredibly tough on partial credits, leading to very low numerical grades. It distracted from my enjoyment of the course material itself.",
                "The content was very interesting and moved at the right pace, although the lectures could have been a bit more engaging. Some of the problem set grading was also unnecessarily harsh.",
                "Strengths: very visual, covered a lot of content, and fun applications to machine learning and physics. Only five psets throughout the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: we covered a lot of content very quickly, and it was difficult to internalise some concepts in the time given. More importantly, the grader was a nightmare and was overly petty with deductions. Also, the only office hours were given by the instructor once a week.",
                "Strengths: I think the content is a huge strength, because I think up to this class there aren't many classes (or at least, I haven't seen\/taken many classes) whose focus is solely on geometry, and a lot of the content is grounded in visual\/real-life intuition which helped me understand concepts in a way that, say, I haven't gotten as much from algebra classes. (You draw a lot of nice pictures! And shapes! Those were strengths in my book.) In my instance of this course; I really appreciated professor Park for always giving new directions to think about, always giving references for future reading, and just being very willing to answer questions with depth. I also really appreciated the 2-week psets (again, particular to my instance), since I really got to dive deeply into a few problems rather than scramble to finish a problem set every week. Weaknesses: this is again particular to my instance of the course; but the only real downside was that I felt that the grading was often pedantic and punitive. Just to give a sense of the vibe: the grader one time went back and took off points from everyone else's problem sets because someone had made a regrade request and the grader for some reason deemed it worthy to punish them for it (at least, this seemed to be my sense of the situation). You also had to know and use Latex because the grader basically wouldn't accept written solutions. Again, this is particular to my year, so probably something that'll change in the future, but the grader practices seemed not well defined\/founded."

If youre just merely curious, save yourself the headache of dealing with the grader and covering all topics at lightning speed by just reading the textbook. It is relatively well written and very visual (do Carmo differential geometry).",
                "Yes! This course really made me fall in love with geometry. I have heard that the content\/direction of the course does vary somewhat based on the prof teaching it, but still would recommend since my sense is that there aren't many other geometry courses targeted towards undergrads at Yale. (Of course, if geometry isn't your thing, then maybe not, but still.)",
                "I would recommend this class! The results in differential geometry are very interesting, and I enjoyed the psets. It's pretty low-workload compared to other math classes at a comparable level -- we had five psets, a midterm, and a final exam.",
