    "Ethical ways to conduct research.",
    "I learned a lot of the history of ethical breaches\/violations in scientific research.",

    "There is no question of recommendation because the only people allowed to take this course are those who are required to. That said, this course will teach you all of the ethics you need to know to conduct research, in a very low-stakes and low-stress environment. There is minimal work, and Parr is a great instructor.",
    "Yes. Its required but youll learn a lot and as long as you choose something interesting, youll enjoy the work.",
    "Yes! if you like chemistry research this is the class to be in. Experiences will vary greatly based on your PI and grad-student\/post-doc mentor so make sure to get into a good lab with a nice\/caring PI and a nice\/caring mentor. (My PI didn't make ppl write end-of-semester reports but there were some other PI who seemed to enjoy giving students stress with end-of-semester reports that they got a B on RIP). You will do lots of research, fail in lots of your experiments and succeed in some, and learn a TON.",
    "It's a great way to learn about ethical research.",
    "Yes, and its required.",
    "This is the chemsitry senior thesis. If you are a BS\/Int.\/BSMS, you have to take it. Why else would you otherwise?"
