                "The class had great lectures and I was lucky enough to take it with some wonderful classmates. I feel like the lectures and textbook were at a higher level than the problem sets and exams.",
                "Challenging class",
                "Professor Shankar is an excellent lecturer, and the materials he posts on Canvas are very useful in reinforcing the concepts. This class works best when you have a lot of time to dedicate to working through practice problems.",
                "The last couple of topics were a bit confusing and we couldve spent a bit more time on them, but overall the course was quite good. Professor Shankars learning goals and recorded lectures were very useful.",
                "Strengths: Prof. Shankar does care about you understanding the material, and he acknowledges that this subject is very difficult. Weaknesses: The organization of this course could be vastly improved to facilitate student learning. For both our midterm and our final exam, we had one or multiple problem sets that had not yet been graded. Notes were provided for lectures, which was helpful for reviewing, but the notes also had practice problems that sometimes didn't have any solutions or sometimes had unhelpful solutions, such as one solution that just said \"Read the book.\" Prof. Shankar wants you to ask him questions, and you definitely should ask him all the questions you have, but he doesn't create an environment where you feel particularly comfortable asking questions. He would sometimes make comments that basically said that we should already know or well understand the topic that he was talking about, which made it difficult for me to feel comfortable asking questions about those topics. I would have asked many more questions and understood the material better if this hadn't been the case.",
                "The course goes over a lot of material very quickly and generally does a good job of providing enough materials\/explanations, but it could really benefit from better organization of the information. Theres a lot of overlap between topics of course, but it would be helpful to have more places to go for structuring your thoughts.",
                "Strengths: This course covers material in 3 ways: lectures, learning goals, and in the textbook. This gives you the opportunity to see the same material at varying intensities\/review at the level of rigor you need.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is poorly paced and spends too much time on easy material in the beginning and exponentially picks up by the end of the semester. This course would be better organized by spending less time on mathematical review and going a little slower during the final 3rd of the semester. Additionally, Shankar's philosophy towards lecturing can sometimes be very difficult to follow. He teaches with the idea of following big concepts during lecture and learning details on your own time afterwards; however, in practice this ends up with lectures being fully of incorrect equations and derivations that are difficult to follow.",
                "Lectures could be a little more organized. Learning goal documents and exercises were very helpful both as review and to reinforce understanding.",
                "Strength: the professor really cares about students doing well in the class and understanding the material. Weaknesses: not a lot of communication, final was insanely difficult."

                "I would recommend the course with Shankar if one has the right motivation for learning the material. I believe Shankar provided me with a good understanding of the quantum mechanics we covered this semester.",

                "I would definitely recommend this to someone choosing between 439 and 440, the situation many non-intensive physics majors face. I feel like it is a much more thorough and rigorous view of quantum, and I now have a solid basis for continuing in the subject.",
                "Yes, the course was one of the most interesting Ive taken here at Yale. The material was fascinating.",
                "I'd say that you can take it, but it requires a whole lot of time and effort, and some lectures will just leave you completely confused. The final exam is worth half of the course grade, which is difficult, because I struggled a lot on the final exam and did very well in the rest of the course. I haven't seen my grade yet, but I'm hoping that I've at least passed. I feel like the main benefit of this course was that it solidified the topics that I learned in earlier physics courses. Take the course, but you'll have to put a whole lot of time into it, and it really helps to be enthusiastic about the topic. It's difficult to take just as a major requirement.",
                "Highly recommend to anyone with an interest in learning about quantum! Class is very accessible l, even for non-majors (as long as you have a decent mechanics and math background)",
                "Yes, but I would be prepared to learn a lot of the material on your own. Shankar provides a good starting point for you to really engage with the material outside of class, but if you are hoping to just learn by going to lecture, you will likely be out of luck.",
                "Yes, but some physics and linear algebra background helps!",
                "If quantum is a requirement, yesthe workload was really high (14 psets total) but necessary to understand the material and the professor genuinely cares about helping out the students (you just need to speak up)."
