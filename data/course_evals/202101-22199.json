                "Great overview of modern philosophy, better sense for how to write philosophy papers, better ability to break down arguments.",

I think the class has also really helped me to understand the structure of an argument in a methodical way. I genuinely believe that this class has altered the way I look at and think about the world; it opened my eyes to certain things that\r\nI had never even considered before.",
                "Learned a lot about philosophy! Learned how to write essays.",
                "In this course, we read the most influential figures of the modern Western philosophical tradition. The chronological order of the readings allowed me to see how each thinker both built upon and challenged the writings which came before them. I was particularly fascinated by the different attempts to resolve the mind-body problem, as well as works that tackled fundamental metaphysical questions, like Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, which has altered my view of the intelligibility of the world. My ability to absorb dense philosophical texts and produce analytical essays on them improved. I also became better at critical thinking and systematically interrogating the validity of an argument.",
                "I learned about philosophers from Descartes to Mill to Kant and more. I also became better at writing papers analyzing philosophy over the course of the semester. The hardest part of the semester for me was learning about Kant's metaphysics so I turned to additional resources to help. The most rewarding part of the class for me was reviewing at the end and being able to compare the different philosophers and their ideas on morality\/ethics."

                "I think the class gives a great range of philosophical texts, and teaches you how to put them in conversation with each other well.",
                "DS Philosophy is great! I feel like I have a solid foundation for any further philosophy courses I might want to take.",
                "Professor Szabo struck a nice balance between direct teaching from slides and discussion, but I found that discussions were best when there was a specific and thought out question (e.g. ship of Theseus) as opposed to when our responses to the slides were solicited.",
                "The course helped me solidify my understanding of texts that were otherwise very difficult, and the in-class discussions were very helpful and engaging. At times I did experience Zoom fatigue due to the online format, though.",
                "I cant think of any weaknesses per se. I think that in general, the class does a good job or teaching a wide range of thinkers in the given time. Perhaps I found it difficult to find some philosophers  mainly Leibniz and Conway  as relevant as others. Other than that, I thought the class was extremely strong.",
                "Very interesting content, very good reading list.",
                "The syllabus is both a strength and weakness of this course. I found all the texts to be interesting and worth reading, but the reading load in conjunction with the other DS courses, particularly when an entire text is assigned instead of sections, can make it difficult to slow down and read more closely, which is of particular importance in philosophy. The recorded lectures are an effective way of introducing a text, while the small seminars are the perfect format for discussing it more in-depth.",
                "Strengths: in my section having very clear presentations helped me comprehend the readings, the lectures were also all very informative and helpful in understanding the readings (the lectures for DS philosophy are the most important to watch out of all the tracks in DS). Additionally, my section's discussions often helped illuminate and explain the nuances and complexities of different authors so I wish I had spoken up more. \r\nWeaknesses: The readings can get fairly dense and heavy and despite the amount of time we spent with Kant I still felt unsure about some of his writings and ideas. This also may have been on my end or related to the difficulties of the semester, but sometimes I did feel a bit disengaged from understanding the importance behind certain readings or how they could be juxtaposed with other philosophers. Some distinctions were very clearly made (e.g. Conway, Leibniz, and Elizabeth compared to Descartes and the readings on morality\/ethics at the end were easily comparable) but I think doing more in class comparison of different philosophers would help with gaining a deeper understanding and memory of the many philosophers we read."

In fact, I would probably be more likely to recommend the philosophy track of DS to just about anyone, just because I feel like it teaches such interesting and important skills, and I feel like, of all the tracks, its the one that felt both the most universally essential as well as the most difficult to learn without guidance from a structured class.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course (and all the DS courses) to any student who is interested in receiving a rigorous liberal arts education. I enjoyed philosophy in particular because of how abstract the ideas can be, which I find more intellectually stimulating. Seminars are the ideal format for discussing philosophy, as it allows students to work through their thinking with each other and their professor.",
                "I would recommend this course to a student who is planning to take Directed Studies. Professor Szabo includes fun Calvin and Hobbes sketches and class is well structured.
