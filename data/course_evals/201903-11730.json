    "Read a LOT of work by prominent existentialists, and even some contemporary novels\/memoirs\/poems that aligned with the more overtly philosophical readings",
    "Learned a bunch about the existentialist tradition, and the way that movement -- the kinds of concepts it employs, the way these authors think about freedom and choice -- has served as the conceptual ground for a lot of contemporary conversations about oppression and liberation. And I learned how to read better, to think more clearly, and have a lot of patience with texts that seem at first opaque. P. Khawaja, if anyone, can give you the faith that with enough patience and hard work, they'll start to make some sense -- and really push you to think differently about the world.",
    "Became a better reader and thinker of beautiful and difficult texts.",
    "I learned a lot about how to parse a dense philosophical text for the meat behind their ideas. I learned how to take an idea or a nagging question and turn it into philosophical analysis. I learned how to analyze a text with charity, and not reduce the ideas and nuances for the sake of a clean-cut argument",
    "This course was a great opportunity to be surrounded by brilliant people and immersed in difficult philosophical texts and forced to try to understand things I might have otherwise shied away from. It greatly improved my writing, thinking, and ability to understand obscure authors.",
    "I read better, learned about the existentialist tradition\/thought, think better, and write better.",
    "An overview of major existentialist thinkers, including Kierkegaard, Sartre, De Beauvoir, and Camus.",
    "A brilliant introduction to the philosophical tradition of Existentialism. Perhaps the most profound thing I learned was how deeply this tradition has impacted almost all of our contemporary socio-political schools of thought, including and especially gender and race theory. Having a rigorous philosophical grounding for the assertions of these theoretical schools is extremely valuable."

   "comments": [
    "There was so much reading each week that we never really got to delve into it all, and were often working against the clock. But I love the texts we read, and the reading responses were a great way to get discussion going\/see what the rest of the class was thinking about before seminar. (A stricter word limit on these might also have been a good idea)",
    "Strengths: basically everything. Best class I've taken at Yale. I opined more in the \"recommended?\" section.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I still have about a 15% understanding of why Lukacs was on the syllabus and a 0% understanding of why Georges Bataille was. There were a couple of weeks in the middle there where I felt like I was losing the thread of the conversation that was happening between these texts -- not sure if that was a syllabus issue or a synthesis issue. Could have been a bit of both. I personally would have liked more time on Heidegger, De Beauvoir and potentially Fanon too, and think it might have been more helpful than either Lukacs or Bataille (at least more helpful than Bataille).",
    "The course readings are fantastic. You get a range of the most canonical existentialist texts to stuff written by women (!) and people of color (!!!). The course is arranged such that the themes naturally unfold and build upon one another, and it's really an exciting ride. Occasionally there was simply so much reading that most students couldn't get through it all and even those who did, were unable to address most of it in class. Would have preferred fewer pages so I could have read slower and dug in deeper.",
    "This class was really, really good. At the beginning of the semester the seminars were almost entirely driven by student discussion, but after receiving midsemester feedback asking for a little bit more lecturing, professor Khawaja became a bit more heavy handed in leading the conversation. I think the course worked much better that way, as many of the readings were so dense it was difficult to know if class discussion was moving in the right direction without some more substantial opening thoughts.",
    "Phenomenal class, I really, truly enjoyed it. The readings were so interesting, only thing is they sometimes were slightly longer than was productive for a class discussion. Discussion in general was extremely helpful, unlike some other philosophy classes I've been in, discussion clarified the text for me way more than it left me more confused - and for the parts that i was still confused about, those would be the issues that were inherently controversial - I guess what I'm trying to say is I'd leave class confused about the right things, instead of grinding my teeth over a basic foundational concern",
    "This course was awesome! The only flaw was a bit of chaos, but that was just part of the awesome ride that this class was. Im glad to have had the chance to take it, and it was the intellectual highlight of my semester.",
    "The texts are all very engaging and produce a lot of critical thought. The syllabus fits well together. Prof. Khawaja is superb. Seminar meetings are fun and challenging. The biggest weakness I can think of is that some of the assigned readings are simply too long to get through. That's mostly the Kierkegaard and the Sartre, though. The second would be that the final third of the class (while definitely fitting into the work of the rest of the class) is not so clearly integrated in class discussions and such.",
    "Professor Khawaja is a very talented, eloquent, and sincere thinker who seems genuinely invested in both the texts and thinking with rather than for her students. The syllabus is interesting, very much grounded in 'classic' existentialist thinkers like Kierkegaard and Sartre, but also with the addition of more special additions like Heti in this semester, alongside Camus and Fanon. Prof Khawaja is very available and helpful one-on-one. The weakness of this course generally comes down to having too much to cover in one week of rather dense readings, and Professor Khawaja is generally quite reticent in leading the discussion too strongly and thus conversations can feel meandering rather than enlightening especially when students themselves are having a hard time sussing out what's going on. I do think that the course could be improved by reducing the number of thinkers on the syllabus and spending more time on individual texts, as well as if Professor Khawaja planned discussions in advance and had a more active role in guiding them.",
    "The readings for this class were immense, and extremely challenging, and I found it difficult to walk away from many of them with much of a coherent understanding. In particular, the Heideggar and the Sartre."

    "Enthusiastically, emphatically, yes!!! I don't think it's for everyone; you need patience for a LOT of abstraction and some really dense and at-times-impenetrable-seeming texts. But I think this class was unique in a few ways that made it consistently one of the best parts of my week:\r\n \r\na) It showed me what a SEMINAR could be -- sixteen students around a table, genuinely contributing to a genuine conversation, which, because P. Khawaja is a legend, actually felt like it was going somewhere. People would build on each other's ideas, and would collectively try to reach a sharper understanding of the concepts at play. And it worked. When I walked into class, my thoughts with regard to that week's readings were usually something along the lines of, \"huh?\", because gosh that stuff is opaque, but by the time I left I always felt like I had a real (though remarkably incomplete) grasp of what was going on. It made me want to go back and do the readings again after class-- and I even DID sometimes, which I don't think even the best of other classes have successfully motivated me to do. Also: a great group of students. No one was annoying, which is basically unheard of in a philosophy seminar. Everyone actually contributed very real yet very different things, and it really felt like we were doing something together. Unclear whether that was a fluke or whether P. Khawaja's weirdo class application is actually remarkably effective. \r\n\r\nb) The material is incredible, and other than the weirdness of Bataille (and maybe Lukacs) on the syllabus, which I still don't really understand, these texts felt relevant challenging and compelling in important ways, and the syllabus constituted a coherent narrative arc (which is not to say that the story of the history of the ideas was oversimplified at all -- just that you could feel the texts fit together, responding to each other, etc). \r\n\r\n c) P. Khawaja is that rare and utterly confusing combination of genuine brilliance, real investment in her students and deep kindness. She's SO, so good. It really feels like she's an expert not only in this material (that would make sense, because she wrote a book about it), but in so many other fields, on which she somehow manages to draw when thinking about the ideas at play. It feels like she's read everything -- and not only read, but READ. Which she will be quick to tell you are two different things. (On the first day, she said something along the lines of, \"Yeah, you'll have to do all the reading twice. Because if you don't, well, what's the point?\") Yet she's deeply humble about it-- not in any kind of pretended-modesty way, but in that she cares about sharing brilliant ideas not for the sake of her own ego, but for the sake of the ideas themselves, or really for the sake of her students. She also will give remarkably helpful feedback, and will out of the goodness of her heart spend absurd amounts of time thinking together with you in office hours about whatever random ideas you found interesting from that week's reading. She has high standards for clarity of thinking, and she wanted you to get that kind of clarity as well. She's also kind of a mess, which I could see potentially being frustrating in other contexts (maybe in a class whose syllabus was less naturally coherent? Or if you care about prompt return of papers?), but for us was really just humanizing. To be honest, it helped us bond more as a seminar. Anyway, I think the world of her and could not recommend this class more.",
    "Absolutely! Some of the most interesting and resonant philosophy. Professor Khawaja is brilliant and fun, and the seminar is a joy to be in.",
    "I loved this class. The readings were frequently challenging but the seminar was great and Professor Khawaja is terrific.",
    "If you can get in, definitely take this class, whether this is your 20th or 1st philosophy class. The readings and content were great, but honestly I would take any class if it was taught by Noreen Khawaja. She is the most energetic professor I have ever had, and always kept class discussion lively and engaging.",
    "Yes! Great survey of \"existentialism\" and Professor Khawaja is a really great discussion leader.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Its an amazing, immersive journey through existentialist intellectual tradition, and its a really engaging class where the students speak far more than the professor, who pulls together our ideas at the end.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Professor Khawaja is brilliant and does a good job of holding you into the difficult, mind-bending texts assigned. The final paper was also one of my favorite things I've done at Yale. The ideas we explore are everywhere, and the class does a great job excavating those personal connections.",
    "Hm... I think that this course is a valuable addition for anyone interested in exploring the major Existentialist thinkers. Professor Khawaja is clearly an expert and also very very helpful and available one-on-one. The experience each semester will probably depend greatly on the students who form the course as the discussions are almost entirely self-directed with Professor Khawaja chipping in now and then. Her choice to include Heti on the syllabus was great and I hope she does it again in subsequent semesters. The class might not be for everyone particularly if you're not comfortable with feeling lost in class discussions 80% of the time.",
    "I would highly recommend. Lots of challenge, high reward."
