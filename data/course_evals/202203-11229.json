Most of the problems could be solved by mostly just copy pasting code from previous sections/the examples in class, with slight tweaks. They served the purpose of forcing us to understand the instructors code, but they did not bring me all the way to the point of being able to code custom models from scratch for most of the techniques.",

                "All in all, this course is extremely solid. I feel like I learned a ton, and am very glad to have taken it. I will say that there was sometimes a bit of a discord between the advanced nature of some of the topics and the facile engagement with them that the problem sets required. For instance, often the assignments wouldn't actually probe an understanding of the concepts, but instead just give you lines of code to run. Also, I don't think that competency in python itself should be a subject of assessment on exams (for example, the \"fill in the code\" questions are annoying in my opinion); there's plenty of material to work with already. Bottom line, a very good class!",
                "Very conceptual and straight-forward definitions of basic concepts of machine learning. very helpful for someone who has no exposure to machine learning before.",
                "strengths. I feel like the homework is hands on and it gives you a good amount of examples and information that if you wanted to do something on your own after the course, you could do so. I also believe the TAs were really accessible for office hours. Lecture recorded really helps.\r\n\r\nweaknesses. look its a 9 am lecture with a million people in it. youre not gonna get the highest engagement in the world. also I feel like a lot of people take this with more than a basic background in coding or machine learning.",
                "The homework was of reasonable difficulty and had interesting problems. Office hours were very accessible and helpful.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, the quiz assignments seemed like an unnecessary burden on students, and the automatic grading was not helpful in actually getting feedback on what we know. The final exam was unreasonably difficult compared to other course material. Often the things emphasized on quizzes or exams were glossed over in class. The class claims to be accessible to those with minimal Python experience, but the handwritten coding sections of exams penalize students who are new to Python.",
                "I honestly don't see many ways this course could be improved. The format was great for learning and I thought the assessments were fair for the most part. The final exam was a little weird, as the phrasing of some questions lacked clarity and some seemed more geared at checking whether we remember a specific detail from lecture rather than our understanding of the concepts.",

                "Laffety is a great professor and lecturer. I think the psets are kind of pointless though in that they're too easy and can be completed without ever actually understanding the content contained in them. I was never really forced to meaningfully engage with the material in the class, which was disappointing, but also partially my own fault",
                "The lecture was very well paced and clear. Some topics were quite complex, but the way they were introduced made things quite manageable. The bi-weekly quizzes seemed tedious at first, but they're a great way to make sure you're not falling behind with any content. I especially enjoyed the way Dr. Lafferty constantly gave real world applications and tied the work we were doing to some creative examples. The TA review sessions were also certainly helpful before exams. Altogether a really solid class.",
                "Strengths - Wendy (one of the TA's)! I couldn't have gotten through this course without her. She made all the material make sense.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the lectures were really unintuitive, and some of the psets felt like we were just unnecessarily copy and pasting huge blocks of code.",
                "My only complaint is that the lecture recordings were withheld until the end of the week, so I would sometimes have to watch two lectures on Friday/Saturday so that I could be ready for the quizzes due Saturday morning.",

                "Quizzes are a great idea and I felt like they encouraged learning and less procrastinating. However, I think it would have felt better for more quizzes or questions that either count for a lesser portion of the grade or more opportunities to improve on what was learned/tested. As it was, they were a little too high-stakes in my opinion to feel entirely like a learning opportunity.\r\n\r\nI liked the psets and found them enjoyable! I also found most of the lectures interesting and felt that the policy of releasing recordings at the end of each week to encourage attendance while also providing opportunities for restudy was a great policy to adopt.",
                "Strengths: Structure of the course, course website, plenty of office hours, interesting topics\r\n\r\nWeakness: Curved grading. Curved grading is stupid and universities need to cut it out with that BS. Announce the grade cutoffs before students have to decide whether they want to take the course or not. Yale students are already neurotic about their grades. Stop making me compete with the guy I'm sitting next to.",
                "The topics were well selected and the lectures well structured but professor Lafferty did not always explain how he reached certain mathematical conclusions (e.g. would just say \"so as you can see\" after skimming over non-obvious math). By the end lectures felt more like a list of topics than having a clear direction",
                "The material in this course is very dense and not at all engaging.",
                "The strengths were definitely the professor and the TAs. I personally enjoyed lectures a lot, and the TAs (especially Wendy) were helpful. A weakness is that the class is pretty massive, and there is not too much of an opportunity to get individual attention. I think this class would greatly benefit from having sections or recitations.",
                "This was a great class for introducing students to principles of machine learning. I think that the assignments could be designed better so that students don't have to just fill in a few lines of a code, but really understand what is going on.",
                "Strengths: professor Lafferty and all of the tf's \r\nWeaknesses: although lectures helped you greatly with exams and quizzes, the lectures do not help you at all with the assignments so you basically have to rely on office hours for any help at all with the coding",
                "Strength of this course is Professor Lafferty's teaching. He was engaging, interesting, always responded well to questions, and of course knows the material through and through. I found the course to be well-paced, and appreciated how organized his course was, including his course policies of dropping the lowest quiz and assignment, which are easy for teachers to implement but make students' lives much better. No weaknesses to the course!",
                "Strengths: covers a lot of ground throughout the semester and introduces many machine learning techniques\r\nWeaknesses: the psets can be a bit lengthy",
                "A little too much homework",
                "Strengths: The professor tried to use simple words and different ways to help us understand complex concepts.\r\nWeakness: the homework was really challenging for students who didn't code much before.",
                "I've never taken a more organized, well-structured and painstakingly designed course where I struggled so much to learn the material. I'm not really sure what skills a student in this course is supposed to come out with. The lectures were very well done, but catered to those with a lot of statistics background (which much/most? of the class didn't have) and lacked much intuition or insight. The assignments were 60% \"run the starter code,\" 10% \"copy and paste the starter code and make changes,\" and 30% \"describe what you see, even though we never gave you much intuition for observation.\" There was not really room to actually learn how to code up machine learning models in the assignments; you either copy-and-pasted your code from the examples posted on the course website, or you just didn't know how to do it. Maybe that's how real machine learning engineers do things, but I found myself really longing for more attention given to the actual implementation of the models, rather than talking abstractly about their error rates or whatever. So if you're coming to this from a coding perspective, don't -- 2 hours of Googling each week will probably help you along more than this class. I guess this class is supposed to give the stats background for ML, but I've also seen 265 described by the S&DS DUS as \"for non-majors,\" when compared to 365. So again, I ask, what are we supposed to get out of the course? I loved Professor Lafferty, I thought the applications in the assignments were really cool and exciting, but I don't think I came out of the course knowing how to actually work with those models beyond copy-and-paste.",

                "It had many essential and beginning algorithms in machine learning area, which are very great, and the Ed discussion is very helpful for the assignments.",
                "Strength: Lectures were clear and helpful\r\nWeaknesses: Some simpler concepts like logistic regression were explained in an unnecessarily convoluted manner",
                "Strengths of this course were that many different machine learning concepts were covered throughout the semester, giving an introduction to machine learning. \r\nThe weaknesses of this course was that many of the concepts weren't explained very thoroughly and felt like they were glossed over. For instance, equations were shown on a slide without much explanation of what each term in the equation actually means. Also, the expectations of what we were supposed to understand and how we were supposed to apply concepts weren't made very clear at all times, making studying for quizzes and the final harder. This could be improved by providing more clear explanations to concepts without too many assumptions of prerequisite knowledge, and providing more clarity on quizzes and the final.",
                "Honestly a lab component would be nice. I didn't take much from the applied examples in lecture and it would have been nice to get to just try to apply myself in an environment with help readily available.",
                "Strengths: problem sets were interesting and helpful for digesting and processing the material from class. Lectures were very engaging, Professor Lafferty is fantastic and explains concepts clearly and thoroughly. Weaknesses: None.",
                "Already very good.",
                "Strength: accessible with minimal background in python programming, linear algebra, probability and statistics; no prior experience in ML required. Course is extremely well organized and I received a lot of support from Professor Lafferty and the TAs. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Being introductory, each topic is confined to the basics rather than including important cutting edge techniques e.g. for language models, transformers are only mentioned in passing. Coding tasks are also largely guided and would not prepare one well for an ML engineering path.",
                "The problem sets were good, and the overall course structure was well organized, however, individual lectures could have been more comprehensive in their coverage of topics. I sometimes found myself resorting to secondary sources for explanations of topics covered in class, as the course content sometimes seemed to assume prior knowledge of the material being covered.",
                "Interesting content, recorded lectures",
                "Wouldn't suggest any changes.",
                "I think this is a well-designed introductory course, and the only weakness I can pinpoint is that I often felt very unprepared for quizzes. While I think the course was taught/administered such that support was always available for homework assignments and exams, quizzes always felt challenging to study for and it wasn't always clear what would be tested on them.",
                "Class structure was very well organized, Professor Lafferty is very understanding and the assignments and exams are fair",
                "Well organized, good professor",
                "The pace of the course is fast",
                "I like it a lot",
                "TAs answer questions on discussion board very promptly; assignments are really good practices for coding\r\nno weaknesses",
                "I thought this was a pretty weak course. Lectures were not very closely related to material we were supposed to know on quizzez, exams, or problem sets. Additionally, we were overloaded with content in lecture to the point where it could not all be absorbed or written down in class.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think problem sets were pretty well designed to take you through the implementation of different methodologies, and to reinforce an intuition of the concepts.",
                "Strengths: John is a great instructor. I don't see any weaknesses. I hope this course can keeping doing video recording, even after the pandemic. That's very helpful for students to review the lessons.",
                "Strengths: The course is very organized, and Professor Lafferty is a great lecturer. Having the recordings was also great, and the review sessions before each exam were helpful. The exams were fair and never a big surprise in terms of content or format. Responses from teaching staff on Ed were always super prompt. Weaknesses: I think it would help to have the quiz and exam question formats be a little more similar.",
                "Overall I found this course to be a nice introduction to machine learning that gave a nice overview of many different topics.\r\nI thought that sometimes concepts were more difficult to understand the context and applications and would maybe find it helpful to go through more demos and examples in the lecture.\r\nI found the written exams to focus more on recalling definitions and terms than any real world contexts, and I think it may be beneficial for students to have to work on a larger scale project with real data and have to interpret and explain their results to get a real sense of the scale and context of these models rather than just playing with toy examples and true/false.",
                "It is quite useful and interesting.",
                "Course was well organized and the topics built off each other well. I liked that we had two weeks to work on each problem set since it made it a lot easier to make time for it and get help if needed. I felt like often the lectures didn't prepare me for the psets and the quizzes- the quizzes were overly tricky and the problem sets were a lot more coding focused than the lectures were. Also if you don't know Python already you will have to invest a lot of time into learning it.",
                "The course is intro level and easy to follow. On the other hand, the material is somewhat easy.",
                "Great course, learned a lot.",
                "strengths: gave me a comprehensive review of machine learning techniques"

                "Yes, especially for the S&DS Certificate.",
                "Not really unless they need it for the certificate. Even then I'd rather take another course. I think there was a big disconnect between the psets and class material and exams that made people feel despondent. I personally don't think it's a good idea to test on code samples.",
                "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class to anyone hoping to gain a broad understanding of the field of Machine Learning. I would encourage people to mostly ignore the prerequisites and join if they are interested.",
                "Yes!",
                "yes",
                "Yes definitely.",
                "Yes! Very helpful for someone with no knowledge on machine learning",
                "yeah this class is fine. I didn't wanna get too deep in the weeds while still learning about machine learning. this class does its job. didn't love it, but i got something out of it.",
                "If you need to take it for your major or to develop some specific skill, sure. But I don't know that I would take this course for fun.",
                "Yes. No matter what your background is, this course introduces machine learning in a way that you can understand and also think about how you want to apply it in whatever it is you do.",
                "Yes, this is an important course that will help you improve your knowledge on machine learning and it will provide you with a strong basis for your pursuit of other areas in machine learning.",
                "Yes, great overview of ML concepts",
                "Yes",
                "Certainly, even if statistics isn't your primary field of interest. The methods this class explores can be applied in all sorts of studies. The lectures are not very theory/proof heavy which I certainly enjoyed and makes the class far more welcoming. Since I had no python experience going in, I was a bit nervous for the homework assignments, but we're eased into it pretty easily. If you have coded in a different language, you'll be more than fine.",
                "Yes, material is great.",
                "Yes. I am not and S&DS major, and I have taken enough intro stats courses to keep up with this class. It was super interesting, and I want to take more ML classes now.",
                "yes\r\nreally a good course",
                "If you are interested in learning what machine learning is about, definitely take this class. It goes over so many cool topics without being too involved in the math. It definitely is an introductory stats class, and you don't need to have taken Probability or Statistics to understand what is going on, although it does help if you do so and you will gain a deeper understanding of the topics that are covered. The workload isn't too that much, and classes are well structured.",
                "Yep! I thought this was a nice relatively gentle introduction to machine learning. Be warned however that if you are looking to major in S&DS this class is discouraged by the DUS and likely won't count for the major unless your Section B slots are not already filled.",
                "WARNING: The class is curved and everyone gets perfect grades on homework and quizzes. Exams are \"40%\" but they will determine your entire grade",
                "Absolutely. The material was very interesting and the lectures well structured. Near the end, however, Prof. Lafferty breezed over a lot of important math without explaining it, which made it hard for me to understand the material",
                "Unless you have a strong background in Python and machine learning, I would not recommend this course. I felt very ill prepared going into this, but it's a requirement for the stats certificate.",
                "I would recommend this course. Anyone who wants to know about machine learning but doesn't necessarily feel like they have the coding/math background to take 365 first should take this class and see if they like the concepts and the way of thinking.",
                "Yes. Solid S&DS class that focuses on programming and coding. Assignments are difficult but the office hours are helpful. Exams are not too difficult if you review lecture material well and *go to review sessions*!!",
                "Yes I would recommend it",
                "Yes",
                "idk.. I definitely learned a lot in terms of introductory machine learning topics, but Professor Lafferty often presented the material in such a way that did not feel introductory (as in many \"intro\" yale courses). He would put up a lot of complicated math/formulas/symbols on the slides before solidifying the intuition first, not fully explain the formulas, and then expecting us to understand everything. The problem sets were definitely good to review the topics seen in lecture, but I don't really feel like I came out knowing any specific machine learning python packages that well (so if you want to learn tensorflow or something like that, you're probably better off somewhere else). Another thing that frustrated me were the grades. The averages were abnormally high, and I think it's because there were a lottt of grad students enrolled in the course. Another thing is that this class does not count towards the CS major. Only the advanced version (CPSC 365) does. Why? idk. Overall, I don't regret taking this course but it definitely could've been better.",
                "Yes, especially if you have some prior experience with data science and programming; the material can be tricky at first, but I think it's worth it to learn, and the course was enjoyable",
                "Absolutely! A great intro for any computer scientist or student who has a little Python experience + has the Stats pre-req. All the time my friends are asking me for an intro to ML, and I point them to this course.",
                "I would recommend it as a first class in machine learning",
                "No",
                "Yes, since you can harvest practical knowledge and skills",
                "Yes. One of the most excellent machine learning courses I have ever taken. I strongly recommend other students to take this course.",
                "Yes.",
                "Not really. If you're a stats major, you should probably take 365 instead (since for some reason they are both offered only in the fall this year?). If you're a CS major, stay away, this course is not for you, just use Google instead if you want to get into ML.",
                "Yes",
                "Yes. Professor Lafferty explains concepts well and the TA sessions arranged well and very helpful for doing the problem sets",

                "If you have strong python skills and a background in mathematics, then perhaps.",
                "Highly recommend! Very well put together. There are so many resources to learn coding and applied ML online so I like that this course taught both applied and conceptual but the lectures leaned towards the underpinning theory. Would love a lab component and would love more useful readings (found the ones we had too dense to be useful), but on the whole a really good course and a very good professor.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. Machine learning techniques are relevant and important in many different fields, and applicable to all kinds of topics. I also liked how we didn't just go over how to code up a random forest regressor or use a neural network  we also explored the statistical basis and theory behind each of the machine learning algorithms. It helped me gain a more robust understanding of machine learning.",
                "Yes for anyone with all backgrounds that want to get hands-on experiences of ML!",
                "If you are interested in learning about machine learning then yes. I will say that I was told going into the class that you could take it without much prior experience in python, which I'm not sure is really accurate. I don't think I'd recommend taking this class unless you feel relatively confident in your python abilities.",
                "If you are confident in your programming skills, you would learn a lot more about ML by taking S&DS 365 (intermediate ML) instead. Otherwise, I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants a technical introduction to machine learning with a fair amount of industry/social context!",
                "Yes, the course was well organized.",
                "Take at least one basic statistics and python coding course.",
                "The professor is not great at explaining mathematical concepts, but if you are good at self-studying you'll be fine. The 6 problem sets were pretty cool and not too time-consuming.",
                "Yes if interested in ML",
                "Yes - a great introduction",
                "Yes",
                "I would 100% recommend this class as an introduction to ML. Its not too heavy on the math and the psets are great opportunities to apply the skills you learned from lectures. Quizzes are frequent and fair to make sure people dont fall behind on lectures.",
                "Yes! As long as you pay attention in lecture (and do not fall behind in lectures), I think Prof. Lafferty does an amazing job of making very incredible but often difficult topics highly accessible to students of non-STEM majors.",
                "Yes, this course was an excellent overview of machine learning. I feel like I have a much stronger grasps of various topics to which I can then continue to explore.",
                "Definitely!",
                "Good course, good introduction to machine learning",
                "Yes because the content is useful",
                "Yes",
                "yes, it's a great introduction course in terms of knowledge and skills to anyone who's interested in machine learning",
                "Yes. I learn a lot from this class.",
                "I would not recommend this course to another student, especially if you are an S&DS major. Take 365 instead, and only 365.",
                "Yes, this course is excellent for beginners of ML.",
                "This is, as advertised, an introductory class, so if you're looking for something that teaches the math and code behind ML more in depth, then this maybe isn't for you. Otherwise, I thought this was a really good broad overview of different topics in machine learning and is challenging even if you already have some programming background. I didn't have as strong of a stats background coming in but the content isn't that out of reach.",
                "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in exploring machine learning.",
                "Yes, since it is quite useful for our future job.",
