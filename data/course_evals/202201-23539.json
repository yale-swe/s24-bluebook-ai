You learn how to write a policy memo and how to think about public policy formation. The readings in the class introduce you to a broad set of literature surrounding politics in the United States.",
                "You learn a lot about the literature regarding political science, a lot of academic articles about different policy ideas. There's a combination of ideas from economic, i.e. externalities, with political science concepts, like path dependency and policy drift, which are very integral to this course. Section features a lot of discussion about various policy ideas and the weekly readings. The paper assignments allow students the opportunity to develop policy ideas and proposals within the framework of this class.",

The topics covered in this course gave me new insights on the state of American policy and democracy, and yes, I'll admit it, learning about this might have made me less conservative\/more liberal on some issues.",

            "comments": [
                "Lectures were always interesting and the guest speakers were great. The class covered a variety of interesting topics. Policy memos were challenging but the professor and TFs were very accessible and always gave good feedback.",
                "The strength of this course was definitely section and my TF Jack who made everything we learned extra engaging. The weakness is probably that lecture could get a bit dry if you're not a big political science person but overall I learned a lot about American structures of politics.",
                "Strengths: Interesting material, great TA's, hybrid class that allows you to either go in-person or remote, whichever works best for you.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes content and lecture have a lot of technicalities, are hard to understand for those not advanced in political science literature. Although the class is about public policy, it is more so about the content and analysis of policy rather than arguing why X policy is better than Y.",
                "Strengths: A super comprehensive review of public policy, lots of in-depth and interesting readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot to take in at once! Some topics could definitely be broken down into several lectures. I honestly wish Yale offered more public policy courses to cover more of this. Hacker is very partisan so the course gets a good Democratic perspective but I feel like I don't have an accurate grasp of how Republicans approach policy yet. Also half of the readings are by Hacker or readings that cite Hacker or readings by Hacker that cite Hacker and I would've appreciated a bit more diversity in the readings.",
                "This class is very well developed and uses the most up to date information and examples, which is very nice. Professor Hacker puts together interesting lectures and engages in discussion as much as time allows. He also has a wonderful line up of guest lecturers that really add to the course experience.",
                "Strengths: organized lectures, extremely informative, covered a great variety of topics, amazing guest speakers\r\nWeakness: none",
                "Strengths: Jacob Hacker.  He's one of the best professors I've had at Yale.  May have some pretty bad jokes at times, but he was very engaging with the class during lecture.  He'll probably open up the semester talking about how a course review once said that it felt like forever when he talked, but I would strongly disagree with that.  Also, Professor Hacker loves to toot his own horn and goes out of his way to assign his own articles and books as readings, mention famous politicians talking about him or his ideas, and invite guest speakers that will also talk him up to us too.  The TAs would even poke fun at him for this in discussion section too when he wasn't around.  Some students may find this as a weakness, but I think it shows how much he cares about topics that he is an expert in.  It can also be very entertaining of course.  He's self-aware about this too.  If you ever go to his office hours, he is very helpful.  The topics covered in this course are incredibly relevant in today's society, and this class will give students a great overview of several key policy areas with opportunities to dive deeper into one of their choosing on the final paper.  Learning how to write a policy memo was incredibly valuable.  The TAs of this course are all very helpful and responsive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I really disliked how some classes were virtual even after the first two weeks...  Also, we were definitely not given enough time for our second policy memo.  Professor Hacker gave us the prompt for this assignment way too late but refused to change the due date or page minimum. \r\n He also skipped class a couple times to travel to other things even after he got mad at some students on Canvas at the beginning of the semester for not attending class in person.  Lastly, it felt like students not taking this for a WR credit had the same requirements as those who were but without the free points from first drafts.  Overall, this course was way too much writing for a non-WR credit section, so there should have been some sort of warning or different requirements.  Readings felt a bit much from time to time, and I might have stopped doing some of them after spring break because of that...",
                "I think the strengths were definitely the material was really interesting, but a weakness I think is that the lecture should have been an hour and 15 minute instead of just 50 minutes",
                "Great professor, stellar TAs; not super stressful \/ high workload; assignments felt somewhat detached from course syllabus",
                "Strengths: Professor Hacker is a great lecturer. Classes were engaging and given the varied topics, there was something for everyone. Policy memos were interesting and allowed students to really think like a lawmaker. The final paper was interesting given the liberty that students were afforded to pick a topic that interested them. Readings were dense, but the main points could be distilled rather easily.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only one I can think of is the timing of assignments in the latter half of the course. I believe that this was by Prof. Hacker's design given the constraints of the semester, but having a hefty assignment due weekly added a lot of stress at the end of the semester.",
                "Writing the policy memos was good practice and gives me a concrete skill that I'm sure will help me later on. I have already been able to use them as writing samples.\r\nMy frustration with this course was that the lecture and section material didn't line up with the assessments. I definitely learned some interesting things from the lectures and policy memos independently, but the vast majority of lecture and reading material was not relevant to the memos. We also didn't spend any time in lectures or sections talking about how to be a better writer or learning strategies to write policy memos effectively. I sometimes felt that I was taking multiple courses that were all independent of one another.",
                "There was a lot of assumed preknowledge in terms of vocab and concepts.",
                "The course is great, only improvement is giving essay prompts earlier, giving more time before the deadline.",
                "The class was at it best when talking about big picture changes in the American political culture, and the sections were very nicely organized. The policy memos created a great framework for thinking about policy. The class was not incredibly engaging in terms of class discussion, however.",
                "Strengths: the Professor is very rational which I prefer among among political scientists because he evaluates information and formulates opinions. I feel that I can understand his thinking.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think he tried to cover too many topics in a semester. I would have preferred to examine a few policy problems from multiple perspectives because, particularly with problems involving empirical data or economics, it can be difficult to reach a conclusive opinion.",
                "Strengths were a comprehensive overview and good feedback, weaknesses were a bit of an idealogical bias.",
                "Strength: This course was very comprehensive and interesting. Weakness: I sometimes wish we had more time for each topic, but that tends to be a problem in almost every Yale course.",
                "Sometimes the lectures can get a little dry, but section does a good job of making clear what content is important and what is not.",
                "I think that some of the readings were pretty dense and thus I wasn't sure exactly what was the main point of them. I think annotated readings for the students would be helpful in picking out the main points in longer and more dense readings. I think Professor Hacker was an engaging lecturer and it definitely helped that class was only 50 minutes compared to 1h15.",
                "Much more feedback would really help, but the content of the course was very interesting and engaging.",
                "Strengths: cover many different policy aspects \r\nWeaknesses: too many data that I can just search online and get, didn't get much insights from the prof"

                "I would recommend this course to any student that likes to write and is interested in U.S. politics or public policy. It offers a lot of background about these topics and allows you to speak with other students about these ideas. I think that if you are passionate about policy and would love to write about those ideas, and receive feedback from your TAs, this class is perfect for you.",
                "I would recommend this course because it was highly informative and helpful for students deciding to go into Political Science. I feel like I have drastically improved in writing policy papers.",
                "Yes! Super useful if you plan on going into public policy or politics in general.",
                "Only if they need a writing credit. The workload difference between the writing sections and the non-writing sections was exactly 0 pages. Both sections of the class were expected to write approximately 30 pages for the class and the toting sections received more support and more guidance for their writing assignments. The class was wonderfully structured and taught, but pretending that anyone who took it doesnt deserve a writing credit is absurd.",
                "Absolutely. This course is so relevant to every day life, which can be hard to find at Yale sometimes. It is well structured, has reasonable assignments, and is very interesting. No political science background is necessary to fully engage with the course or be successful in it.",
                "Yes, if you are at all interested in public policy this is definitely a useful and engaging course",
                "I would recommend this course to other students, but I would warn them that if left in its current state (2 7-9 page policy memos, 10-12 page final paper), it is a ton of writing for not getting a WR credit.  Therefore, students should take one of the WR sections because you basically get free points on first drafts, and you actually get a WR credit.  I didn't take one of the WR credits because I have all the ones I need to graduate, but I felt misled by the \"non-WR\" label because it ended up being the same amount of work as one of the WR sections anyway.  However, for students looking to learn a lot about American politics or want to learn how to write a policy memo, this is the class to take!\r\n\r\nJacob Hacker is definitely one of the coolest professors in the Yale Department of Political Science and has contributed a lot to the field of American politics (especially healthcare!) but can be a bit much for students who do not like those big personality types.  You will read a lot of his work in the course, so if you don't really like that, then oh well... I didn't find this a problem for me, but some of my classmates did mention it to me...",
                "Yes!",
                "Very much so. I think there was a lot of interesting things about political structures and behaviors.",
                "Yes, but if they're already into politics \/ policy, it might feel a little elementary",
                "I absolutely would. Even as someone without an extensive political science background, I was able to do well in this course thanks to Prof. Hacker and the rest of the teaching team. I would say that an interest in politics and legislation is important to really get the most out of this course (i.e. having at least a rough idea of policy and the recent history is helpful, but not required). The final paper was great because you got to explore any topic you wanted, from healthcare to labor to the judicial system.",
                "Yes and no. This class gives you a lot of breadth in talking about public policy but sometimes lacks depth.",
                "Yes! Learning how to write policy memos is really helpful! Although, I would strongly recommend that you take the Writing Intensive section. You do the same amount of work but get the chance to revise your essays! I really wish I had done that so that I would have grown even more in this very useful skill set.",
                "Absolutely, this course helps student gain a nuanced understanding of the United States and the institutions that shape the current political landscape.",
                "Absolutely. It is a great way to gain a better understanding of a very essential and consequential part of the American government.",
                "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone looking to gain a good level of understanding about most prevalent underlying causes behind the biggest political debates in the US today.",
                "Yes. If you already have a strong background in American Public Policy, you should be familiar with the topics discussed in the course and the various opinions on it because Professor Hacker will mostly only teach his own. This isnt bad, per se. I just think that this requires students to seek out other perspectives to avoid extreme bias.\r\n\r\nThat said, Professor Hacker is a very cool and intelligent Professor, so I would absolutely recommend learning from him and talking to him.",
                "Yes! For both those interested and not in public policy, this class gives a really good and comprehensive introduction to the subject that can help you understand issues with policies being discussed in modern times.",
                "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to know more about US policy.",
                "Absolutely! If you're at all interested in real-world issues and policymaking, this course is a nice break from more theoretical political science classes.",
                "This is a great writing credit for any political science major. Most of your time should be focused on prepping for the papers and written assignments, the lectures have very little impact on your final grade aside from providing background information and a few good sources.",
                "I would recommend this course only if the individual has an explicit interest in Political Science.",
