The syllabus was beautifully crafted with a ton of diversity in eras/style of writing as well as identities of writers. \r\nWeaknesses: wish this class had a stronger workshop component earlier on, I wish Id been able to work on one consistent project throughout rather than pivoting abruptly",

I will say you should be aware that much of this class feels more like a reading seminar and less like a workshop class, and also that the advice you get on writing isnt particularly formalized but rather more casual.",

This class is a joy for anyone who enjoys fiction writingI discovered some of my new favorite authors via the assigned stories; received kind, constructive, detailed feedback on my work; and had the immense pleasure of getting to know my fellow students as both writers and individuals as we exchanged pieces."
