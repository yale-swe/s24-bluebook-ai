                "I think every aspect of the class could be considered a strength, most notably, our learning as applied to a project written in the style of a real econometrics publication. One weakness I think was the inflexibility for late work. With all that happened this semester, plus religious holidays and unforeseen circumstances, I really think a deduction for late work would have been preferable to a complete ban. I understand that puts a burden on Daniel but perhaps a happy medium can be reached.",
                "Strengths: Zero\r\nWeaknesses: the professor",
                "Strengths: Prof Altonji is a kind and compelling lecturer. It was a pleasure to learn from him. Daniel, our TA, was also fantastic. No major weaknesses, I wholeheartedly recommend.",
                "Strengths: pretty interesting, DANIEL the best TA . Weaknesses: not a lot of practice exams for the midterm/final, psets are long",
                "Where do I begin. This was the most disorganized, chaotic class I have taken at Yale. The lectures were practically useless, but the slides were no help either because they were so confusing. Problem sets were so poorly formatted that it was not clear when a question was being asked. Never in this course did I have a clear idea of what we were doing or what was expected of me. Rather, I simply cobbled together a bunch of formulas before the midterm and final and relied on stats stuff I had learned in other classes. For someone approaching econometrics for the first time, I don't see how you could possibly make sense of a rather rewarding discipline when it is so horribly presented.",
                "The course is well organized.",
                "I thought that this was a pretty brutal class -- difficult material and lots of work. At the end of the class, however, I did feel much more confident in my ability to identify and execute particular econometric strategies applied to real-world problems. It's a good class to take if you want to write a senior thesis. Professor Altonji and Daniel (our TF) also offered great advice throughout the semester about studying economics and learning more about econometrics.\r\n\r\nProfessor Altonji also presented STATA code in the slides, but we used exclusively R in our problem sets and project. Therefore, the STATA code wasn't very useful to me (or to most of the class). I think that future classes should be either ALL in R or ALL in STATA (or give more STATA instruction, even if there is an emphasis on R).",
                "Weaknesses: the lectures were not recorded, material was extremely challenging, didn't always follow the textbook, extremely fast paced.",
                "As a whole, I felt like the course was very well designed. The sequence of topics was logical and well taught. Professor Altonji was very professional and clearly passionate about what he taught.",
                "A strength is that it definitely teaches you about econometrics. A weakness though is that the material is quite difficult and is not always communicated in the clearest manner. Sometimes, the problem sets did not seem immediately relevant to the material.",
                "The materials for the class were really well designed. I think it might be helpful to work more problems in the second half of the courseI think there is some material that we covered conceptually but didn't really get our hands dirty with.",
                "The course felt very disorganized. I think it could've been improved by more consistency in the format of the slides, less emphasis on examples and more emphasis on the theoretical concepts, and a slower pace. It often felt like material was being crammed in when I did not even have a firm grasp of the most basic concepts. More consistency with the due dates of the problem sets would have been better, also. Additionally, the final paper assignment maybe should have taken place over the semester, because it was essentially due the same week as the exam which made it difficult to focus enough on either assignment.",
                "It was hard for me to be engaged. I learned mostly in section not lecture that was more engaging.",
                "Strength: you learn a lot. \r\nWeakness: Oh my god this class was hard.",
                "Professor Altonji should write on the board  when he reads off the slide, the class becomes a memorization game. If he wrote on the board, and worked through each equation with us, we could see how we arrive at certain conclusions and internalize them better, rather than memorizing the order of words on a slide.",
                "Strengths: the professor's lectures are very concise and it is easy to review the content. The professor also sets the expectations clear, which is helpful when studying for exams. Moreover, I liked the fact that the professor introduced many empirical papers so that we know how each of the econometric methods are employed in practice. \r\nWeaknesses: None.",
                "Strengths are how comprehensive it is in covering regression (as far as one can go without linear algebra) and Professor is great.\r\n\r\nWeakness is that the course is a bit too theoretical and often hard to follow at some points with the different notation and concepts/proofs."

                "Absolutely.",
                "If you are not required to take it, I would strongly encourage you not to take the course. It felt very unorganized and I have left with a blob of knowledge rather than a clear systematic understanding of the material.\r\nAdditionally, the department's switch to R makes it more complicated because all our assignments were in R but our professor was totally unfamiliar with R and our teaching assistant was not very familiar with it either.",

                "Yes, I absolutely do! It is a very useful to have a second semester of econometrics. This class also gives you valuable exposure to real-world research and the methods and writing used in them.",
                "Yes and no. If you like this stats, by all means take it. Very interesting and incredibly useful. If you suck at stats like me, do not take this class. It is very hard and prepare to spend most of your time in OH and on PSETs. It is not a requirement of the major (unless you are econ-cs).",
                "If there is another course that offers a more practical education of multivariate regressions, take that course  this course is very theoretical, and will leave you feeling with a lot of knowledge on multivariate regressions but very little experience in applying them. If you do take this course, be prepared to learn from the textbook  you simply cannot learn from Professor Altonji alone.",
                "Yes, especially with professor Altonji. The course is crucial if you want to do empirical work.",
