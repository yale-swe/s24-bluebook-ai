    "a systems based approach to thinking about how to solve health issues in the developing world. It exposes you to R&D for health technologies designed for the developing world. You also get a sense of what the process of designing, testing, implementing and funding a project is like.",
    "I learned extensively about public health and health in the developing world",
    "I learned a significant amount about the necessary considerations for implementing biotechnology in the developing world.",
    "How to think about issues in the developing world and come up with feasible solutions + possible ways of implementing those solutions",

    "Strengths - guest lecturers\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the lectures didn't really correspond to what we were learning about week-to-week. The midterm project was feasible, but the final project was kind of a stretch, especially for people who don't have extensive BME\/engineering backgrounds.",
    "Some of the guest lectures were not very informative of engaging.",
    "The projects could have used more guidance. I wish wed spent more time discussing them in class and had even started working on them in class.",
    "Strengths: Projects were interesting and based on real-world applications, encouraged us to think about issues in the developing world by considering the points of view of the people who live there, rather than the Western world\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Guest speakers were often not very engaging, and there were too many of them. Picking random groups for the first project made it a lot more difficult than it should have been - some people worked a lot harder than others, and everyone lost points if one person messed up. Grading was unnecessarily harsh - points were taken off for things that weren't stated in the question, and a disproportionate amount of points were taken off for small errors.",
    "I liked the first few classes and the last classes. I felt as though some of the lectures were repetitive and very drawn out for specific topics. I thought the hands on heart monitors we made were very cool and I felt much more involved and I wished we could have done more of that throughout the course!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes I think for a premed student this course was important for rounding out ones medical education.",
    "This was an amazing class I would highly recommend. I dont have the strongest bio background but it was fascinating and I really feel like this was one of the classes I have learned the most in at Yale. Also super fun!",
    "Yes!",
    "This course had a lot of potential and I was very excited to take it, but it was a disappointment. I didn't learn much beyond the first couple of weeks, the grading was unnecessarily harsh, and many of the classes (especially guest speakers) were less engaging than they could have been. The projects were interesting, but we were put in random groups for the first project and that wasn't fun, to say the least. That being said, the workload is pretty light.",
    "Yes! I thought it was very cool and not a ton of hard work. It will be necessary to work in groups for this class so that is a skill that is essential."
