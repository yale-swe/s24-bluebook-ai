                "strengths: comfortable environment to make mistakes and receive helpful feedback, kind and receptive instructor. I also like when we watched videos, but I wish we could watch videos that do not have english subtitles. that way, we can figure out what is being said based on images and context without relying too much on the english subtitles.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: the language table requirement. since it met outside of scheduled class time, I usually had pre-scheduled commitments and couldn't make it. there was a makeup option at the end of the semester, but I wish I would have been able to go weekly. not sure what a solution would be to this if other people had the same issue.",

I would even recommend to people who don't come from Yoruba speaking families! prof is very understanding and flexible",
