                "This is a great and extremely well designed course, Ive been so impressed!! I have very few suggestions for improvement  the only minor points are:\r\n\r\n1. Sometimes the English language options in multiple choice questions are ambiguous, I think more could be taken in ensuring that these are clear. \r\n\r\n2. The workload could be lessened slightly without compromising learning  allowing English language prompts for presentations, not having to record presentations, fewer presentations in general etc.  \r\n\r\n3. Idont think the pre class quizzes add much value either  I completed many of them without actually learning the covered material, just finding the words and phrases I needed to in the textbook. I think getting rid of this would have 0 impact on how much people actually learn, while reducing the workload and number of assignments in a very assignment intensive course.",

                "Structure and contents very very very good. Sometimes, the course a little bit too fast-paced",
                "A strength of this course is definitely the organization of the course, so no assignments take you by surprise and you know when exams and assignments are coming up. Another strength of the course are the professors who are very kind, supportive, and invested in your learning."

Even though it is a lot of work and learning Chinese is challenging, the types of assignments are pretty straightforward, the professors are amazing, and if you keep up with the schedule the presentations/exams aren't the worst. This class certainly is not a \"gut\" by any means, but I never dreaded going to class, and since language classes meet every day, I feel that taking Chinese was well worth it."
