                "Strengths: the format is AMAZING! It really drills in you the important grammar, vocab, sentence structures, etc. It has a clear focus, and all the homework, classwork, assignments, are designed to lead you toward a particular goal. Some might think it's repetitive, but I think that's the purpose. When the oral homework are similar questions to the classroom practice questions, it naturally forces you to adopt the new vocab and grammar and sentence structures, and make them yours!",
                "Absolutely incredible teaching as usual in the Chinese department. Even on zoom, their creativity and hard work was astounding. Would highly recommend continuing through the Chinese sequence. No weaknesses.",
                "The strength of the course was that it truly challenged all aspects of the language - speaking, reading, writing. The assessments were very well-balanced and truly helped me improve as a student in a more well-rounded manner.",
                "It would be great to have more speaking time in class. Sometimes the material if quantity over quality and I would forget things from prior chapters because there is a lot of material and it doesn't always circle back. It would be great if we were told to focus on more particular lesson points and if lessons were more cumulative.  The class was very well organized and good study guides and materials were provided.",
                "I thought the class was extremely interesting, but it was hard to stay engaged online.",
                "It is hard to do online, but the department does a very good job and are accommodating of the adjustment to online."
