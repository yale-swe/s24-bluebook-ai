   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Knowledge: new conceptions of objectivity, accuracy, power-knowledge, spatial relationships, geography, the geographic consciousness of different peoples, hybridity and\/or counter-mapping, cartography and imperialism, propaganda, etc.\r\nSkills: new ideas relating to analysis, reading for argument, note-taking, asking questions, analysis of visual documents (esp. maps).\r\nInsights: the ways that ideas of space influence EVERY aspect of a society's organization, especially the state but also interpersonal relationships. Ideations of property that are more complex than private vs. shared, European vs. native, scientific vs. traditional. And so on.",
    "I learned a lot about mapping in general, and about the whole field of scholarship on cartography.",
    "I learned a huge amount about Cartography in this class, I also improved as a writer as well.",
    "This course is a great insight into the power that maps hold over ideas of nation, culture, and power. It really changed my perspective on both the objectivity and uses of maps, and I now examine maps in a totally different way than prior to taking this course. The course also challenged my perception of writing history papers and the role that primary source documents play.",
    "Besides teaching us all about mapping, spatial knowledge, and the roles these things play in cultural identity and power dynamics, this course was an excellent intro to historical methodology. Learning how to approach documents is surprisingly something that not many History courses at Yale touch upon, so it was incredibly beneficial to learn about how to actually do the work of a historian."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Readings were always great, so I wish we spent more time discussing them in detail in class.",
    "Overall, I can't really think of any ways to improve it! It was very well structured to facilitate learning and work on the projects.",
    "I think that the class is well organized but I think that a little more attention could be paid to connecting different units together. This is not to say that there is none of that but I think it could be improved on.",
    "This course was excellent. The discussions were almost always engaging, the readings were fascinating, and Professor Rankin was incredibly well informed.",
    "I really enjoyed the assignments we did for this class and also really appreciated how Prof Rankin took care to make sure we were not only thinking about just the content of the class but also thinking about our writing. Because the intersection between cartography and history is a fairly small field, we were also able to get a pretty good grasp of the key contributors and opinions within the field. However, I did feel that because of the presentations that we had nearly every week, we werent really able to get into the readings. If was frustrating to be assigned about 200-300 pages of reading each week and come out of most lessons feeling like we barely scratched the surface of what we'd read.",
    "Main strength: Bill Rankin is a fantastic professor\/person. See below for feedback.\r\n\r\nMain weakness: Some of the texts were esoteric, or just written badly.  It was really helpful to discuss the writing style of the authors rather than just the content, but it would also be nice to have more prose that is very clear and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nAlso, we spent a lot of class time on presentations that people didn't seem to always take super seriously.",
    "This course was nicely designed to approach cartography from as many different angles as possible, which prevented the subject from ever getting stale or boring. I also thought it was brilliant to have us analyze and critique a map, and then give us the task of redesigning the map with a different argument in mind. This helped give us perspective into the challenges the cartographer faces, and forced us to get closer in a sense to the documents and people we studied. I think that the course could perhaps benefit from having more field trips like the first day's trip to the Beinecke, as it would have been more engaging to put us face to face with tangible artifacts."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Thinking visually and spatially are not usually encouraged in the humanities outside of art history, but it is more important than typically given credit for. It was fun to study one specific field as a gateway to lots of interdisciplinary discussions.",
    "Yes! Definitely take if you have interest. The readings are challenging, but Professor Rankin is incredible and well worth it.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this course if you're interested in thinking critically about maps, geography, space, or history, or looking for a challenging course that will help you grow as a student and as a historian. Professor Rankin is incredible and he structured the course in a way that really helps you learn and to give you feedback on drafts of the projects.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Rankin leads great discussions about really tricky readings in a way that makes sure everyone really knows what's going on. The papers and map redesign project were so fun to research\/write\/create and I learned a ton while doing them.",
    "This class is by no means easy but it is worth it. You will put a lot of work into the class and readings and the class is definitely backloaded. A lot of the focus is on the final paper.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are at all interested in maps, nation building, territory, or culture. It is a lot of work if you want to get a lot out of it, but well worth the effort.",
    "Yes but primarily because I thought the assignments themselves were really interesting and engaging and because all interactions with professor rankin showed me how much he cared about his students as well as helped me rethink my writing. However I didn't find the classroom experience itself particularly illuminating. Definitely go to office hours with Prof Rankin.",
    "Yes!  Take the class to have Bill as a professor.  I stupidly didn't look that carefully at the syllabus, so I was expecting the seminar to be less theoretical than it was.  A lot of the texts were convoluted because the ideas were actually difficult and\/or the texts could have been written much better.  Bill was a great seminar leader (even though student participation was often lackluster) and made class time productive for deepening our understanding of the reading\/explaining what some of the readings were actually about.\r\n\r\nIt was really disorienting when some of the texts went over my head -- I had not been completely baffled by secondary historical texts before.  Bill helped us read for craft as well as content, which helped me both understand some of the more confusing texts and think about how I can write more purposefully.\r\n\r\nBasically, I was expecting to a learn a lot about maps and make some maps.  That was true (except we just \"redesigned\" a map -- we didn't make any from scratch), but the class was most helpful\/applicable in what I learned about reading and writing.  So even if you don't care about maps, you should take this class.  You'll probably end up caring about maps, but you'll definitely become a more critical reader and a clearer writer.",
    "Absolutely! Beyond getting the chance to learn more about the incredibly complex and volatile history of spaces, you get to take a class with Professor Rankin, who, beyond being one of the most intellectually engaging professors I've had at Yale, is also an approachable teacher concerned with your growth and participation. I feel so much more confident about my abilities as a historian now for having taken this class."
