                "STRENGTHS: interesting topics, very well-structured, discussions led by students kept things focused and engaging, students could choose when to write their discussion papers, Prof. Harms is really knowledgeable and has been teaching the class for a long time so it has a clear vision, smaller class size made discussions more personal and fruitful, a diverse range of countries/methods of production/imperial powers are discussed for each commodity so as to avoid an overgeneralized narrative.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: sometimes the readings were quite long (though very interesting), making it hard to complete them on time on top of other classwork. However, it wasn't too challenging to discuss them when paired with the student presenter's discussion points",
                "The course readings are very interesting and Professor Harms does a great job facilitating conversation! No weaknesses!",
                "I think that the biggest strength of the course is the open discussion format, which allows students to freely react to the course readings and develop a deep understanding of the course material.",
                "A strength of this class was the reading list. While we were often expected to read a large number of pages, the majority of the books assigned were worth the effort. Unfortunately, the discussion of these texts in seminar was often lacking. I wish Professor Harms took a more active role in class conversations, as it often felt that discussion fizzled out after a mere 30-45 minutes."

                "Yes! It is a great intro into African history around the colonial period and onward. You not only learn about the different commodities (which are oddly fascinating--I even found myself researching rubber for fun), but also the civil conflicts, global politics, and modern state of the countries. On top of that, there are many different countries covered, not just the ones that immediately spring to mind. The class (at least this year) was a very small group, so we all got to know each other and it felt very comfortable expressing our views. Professor Harms is so knowledgeable on the topic from many years of teaching, and his stories from time spent in Africa are fun to hear about. The assignments aren't too difficult and you get to pick the weeks that you write. Overall, a great class for history and non-history majors alike to take. (plus I learned that the Yale Library has the movie Blood Diamond for free? DiCaprio's accent is gold).",
                "Yes! Super interesting!",
                "Yes! Professors Harms is so knowledgeable about colonialism and African history in general, and you will walk away with a very nuanced understanding of the subject material.",
                "I would only recommend this class to someone who is already quite interested in either African history or economic history, as there is a lot to get out of the readings. Anyone else would likely be bored, as the course does not lend itself to engagement."
