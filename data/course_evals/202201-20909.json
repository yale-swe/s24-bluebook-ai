                "Something frustrating was that not only did the exams feature all Poli Sci and almost no CS (huge disadvantage for the CS students), half way through the semester the prof said the CS students were doing too well in the course (many students on track for an A) and Feigenbaum started making JUST the CS homeworks more difficult. For those of us who were not doing so well and were not in the A range, this seemed unfair.",
                "Very accommodating, and the TAs are really really great! I like switching between profs. Good, easy CS elective. Weaknesses are that the course feels sort of like an overview of everything and I didn't learn much in-depth. Felt like too much focus on readings",
                "Strengths: Great Course. Weaknesses: Problem sets did not have anything to do with lectures and students were expected to learn complex topics such as blockchain.",
                "Strengths of this class would be that I did get some experience in the coding psets to work with some beginner machine learning prompts which I thought was good experience. Weaknesses are that I felt separated from the material that we would cover in lecture while doing the psets, which really came to hurt when it came down to exams. Theres a very large disconnect between the coding side of the class and the topics we learn in lecture, which I didnt like.",
                "I enjoyed the variety of subjects covered in the lectures, the wide range of topics kept the course interesting and dynamic. In addition, discussion sections were a great place to discuss course material in a more in-depth way, and also were a good avenue to get pointers on problem sets.",
                "It could be improved with walkthroughs talking about the psets more, especially the final one. I felt that the last homework on blockchain was significantly more challenging than the first three. However, you were allowed to drop one of the homeworks which is very generous.",
                "Strengths: Broad overview of topics in CS and cool homework assignments that were simultaneously easy",
                "I thought the course had very interesting topics, but it didn't quite manage to elicit the expected engagement. The lectures were at best fairly shallow overviews of the different topics. I understand that it's very difficult to go in-depth about such a wide range of technology, but I was still disappointed. I thought the section made up for it, however; our discussions always reminded me of how interesting topics were. The psets got ridiculously difficult (especially the last one) after midway through the semester, when the professor decided that the curve was too favorable. That made things much more stressful than they needed to be, should the assignments have been more equal in difficulty.",
                "This was a great course that covered a wide range of very relevant topics. As a computer science student, I loved how everything connected to politics and international relations. The lectures and the homeworks (which included making a Twitter bot) were both interesting. The multiple-choice sections on the exams were pretty vague sometimes; I would recommend making the exam solely short-answer and essay questions, since a lot of these topics are open-ended. Other than that, this was a great course. Prof. Feigenbaum has a lot of experience on this stuff, and Prof. Acorn is a great lecturer and connects all the ideas to politics and IR very well!",

                "The course content was pretty good, and the guest lecturers were very interesting. My main criticism was that the homeworks were only tangentially related to the lecture material and had very minimal instructions. This made the homeworks very time consuming for someone without a lot of experience with working with python machine learning libraries, for example.",
                "Great lecturers and loved the guest speakers.",
                "The biggest strengths were the material and the engaging lectures. It was super cool to have both the technical and political perspectives on different topics, and Professor Feigenbaum and Professor Acorn did a great job integrating the two perspectives together. It was very cohesive. The PSETs are really interesting, and the exams are fair. The sections could be better managed and lacked structure sometimes.",
                "I thought lectures were good, psets could have been more engaging.",
                "There are no strengths to this class. There are too many weaknesses to include, but here are a few 1) the exams are insanely stupid and are not conducive to learning. The professor will pick a random sentence from the slides, change a few words, and make it into True/False. It ultimately comes down to memorizing the slides for the exam. This is the reason Yale CS gets a bad rep. From professor like Feigenbaum that do this. 2) the professor and TA's don't put in the time to the class. The Psets are incomplete and always have problems. The TA's don't know how to do the Psets and cannot help students at office hours (or they cancel office hours). THe professors don't know how to do the psets either. Psets are taken from previous years (created by past TA's) and no one knows how to do them. This is not good. The professor's should enforce that the TA's spend time reviewing the psets BEFORE office hours. This was probably the worst set of TA's of any CS class I have taken. 3) the psets were an insane waste of time. 3/4 were very easy. The last one was on crypto and even the TAs didn't know how to do it. They forgot to send out a crucial helper function and only sent it out 4 days before the deadline (when the pset was released for 2 weeks). This is not good. Don't waste your time on this horrific class.",
                "The class is an interesting overview, similar to Nathaniel Raymond's Data Governance. I particularly liked the guest lecturers (e.g. David Shor and a Microsoft researcher on elections). However, I do like the assessment structure of the course. We had 4 psets, the worst of which we would drop. The first two were very easy, the 3rd was made to be harder (and the grading was very nitpicky), the final problem set was even according to the ULAs practically undoable. Then the exams had very specific multiple-choice questions (e.g. what a particular author said in a reading) and not the most generous essay grading making it difficult to do well. Coupled with Feigenbaum's uncurved 95% A boundary, this class and your grade boils down to knowing specific facts, not emphasizing that we learn more general takeaways.",
                "strengths: the lectures were super interesting and well-presented, the guest speakers also did a great job, the TAs were very approachable and helpful during office hours, psets were relatively easy but interesting weaknesses: the exam essay grading was a bit subjective/hard to know what they were looking for, the grade cutoffs were a bit high (95 for an A)",
                "Strengths: The psets! very applicable, real-world projects that require real-word programming skills and that leave you with a sense of accomplishment once you finish them. Lectures were just awesome. Both professors Feigenbaum and Acorn are so knowledgeable and happy to take student questions, the course was organized into four conceptual parts (privacy, security, etc.) that helped us make sense of the breadth of the knowledge we learned. Exams were fun and fair. Great ULA's too. As I said, guest lecturers were wonderful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having a hard time thinking of any to be honest, I'll say the the psets can feel daunting (there's very little direction, for example the first one said little more than \"build a twitter bot\" and figuring out how to do that was up to you). That definitely worried me on the first pset, but OH were very helpful and the grading was fair. I'd say go to office hours early and ask lots of questions.",
                "Strength: very applicable topics, one of the few non-theoretical CS classes I have taken at Yale\r\nWeakness: some project are not well defined and refined since they are organized by the TAs",
                "The problem sets didn't align with the lecture material",
                "What the assignments tested were completely unrelated to the material taught. This just felt kind of dumb. The grading breakdown was by far my biggest problem with the class.\r\n\r\nThe assignments were 60% of the final grade, and as I said they were testing programming skills which were not taught. Additionally, the exams did a horrible job of testing knowledge of the material. 30 multiple choice questions were 20% of the final grade and they were very random. It would have made more sense to have short answers and test more expansive knowledge set -- the multiple choice were often arbitrary and highly specific questions that really did not test someone learned a lot.",
                "Strengths - very interesting content, guest speakers were very cool to hear from.\r\nWeaknesses - exams are mostly memorization of small details. Some concepts (e.g. crypto) could be explained better.",
                "THERE ARE WAY TOO FEW ULAs FOR THIS TYPE OF CLASS. For spring 2022, there were only four ULAs and each of the ULAs were assigned to create a problem set. This results in only one of the four ULAs having an idea of how the problem set should be done. This also makes it so that the professor is very much removed from what is being assigned to the students. The coding experience that is required ranges greatly from pset to pset and none of the code is actually taught in class. Thus, you must either have a good hold on coding already or go get help at the very limited office hours slots.",
                "Strengths - Cool class where you get more of a history and political view on computer science and its impact. Weaknesses - It is graded extremely harshly and not fair questions on exam.",
                "I thought the material and lectures for this course were really interesting and fun to learn, but I would say the psets, although very doable, could be better structured / written to make the requirements clear (e.g. I remember there was a good amount of confusion for wording of the second pset)"

                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Whether you're a computer science students, a political science student, or interested in both, this class is very relevant to our times. Professor Feigenbaum is great. She is funny and incredibly intelligent, doing research with Amazon's cryptography research group on her own time. The class will be connected to whatever is going on at the time which gives important context to concepts studied but also the world around us. For example, we looked at Russian interference in the US elections and also how technology has worked in the recent Ukraine-Russia war conflict. Plus, this class is pretty gutty. One of the only 4 homework assignments can be dropped (hint: the blockchain coding assignment, the last one, is the hardest one... though they did mention that some of the assignments will change in future iterations of the course so I cannot say this with full confidence).",

                "I would recommend this course. For non-CS majors, this is a great primer to see how technology affects many areas of daily life and the world at large. For CS majors, I think this class is a good way to step back from a more coding-focused course and see how modern technology has impact on areas not typically discussed in CS classes.",

                "Yes! This was one of my favorite CS electives and courses in general.",
                "yes, helps you think about cs from an ethics pov which is more important",
                "I know what you're thinking. I know you're craving a gut class to add as a CS elective with low workload. And to be honest, you're kind of right. But this class is like a slice of dining hall pizza that has been in your dorm for the past week. You might as well eat it but eventually you realize there's differently-flavored stuff inside that was not originally easy to see.\r\n\r\nSo why am I saying this? Here it goes:\r\n\r\n- The class consists of 4 PSETS + 2 exams. The PSET skills are completely unrelated to anything you do in class. In fact, classes are just slides on \"what's up with the world and tech and power\". So just text and text. But the PSET is like \"hey, here's some starter code. Implement the blockchain\". With very little help to the extent that even the ULAs can get confused. Now, this is the upper bound of how bad it can get. The PSET I mentioned (blockchain implementation) is known for being the worst - since some ULA made a very hard PSET once and this class has just inherited it over time. So, to sum it up: PSETs are doable, but unrelated to class skills. So the class assumes you know: Python (including OOP concepts if you choose not to drop the blockchain PSET), R at a very basic level, using code from GitHub to build something. \r\n\r\n- Halfway through the semester, the Prof said that everyone's getting As and everyone's smart. And that CS majors are getting 100s in the PSETs. So she decided to make the next PSETs harder to balance it out with the PLSC majors. You can feel that this is a tiny bit unfair if you care about arbitrary deductions of your grade with the EXPLICIT purpose of having CS majors get a lower grade. So, take into account that the Prof may 'feel like' changing policies halfway through the class to 'even out' the grades with the PLSC equivalent version of the class (which is taught concurrently with this class).\r\n\r\n- The two exams consist of half multiple choice and half an essay. The multiple choice can get quite detailed from class lectures. The essay grading is confusing: the ULAs say that you just need to \"build a coherent argument with examples from the class\". So you don't get a lot of guidance on that front; in fact, one ULA told students in their section that everyone gets pretty much full points in the essay. But then, perhaps due to the Gaussian randomness of the way the points are deducted in the essay, this did not turn out to be true for the students I know.\r\n\r\n- When it comes to help with PSETs, often ULAs referred me to another ULA who \"knew the PSET better\". And this ULA would in turn do the same. Also, very often (between every week or every other week) one or more ULAs shortened or moved their office hours to a different day with same-day notice. I'm not sure if Professors read these reviews, but if they do: Please oversee ULA work. ULAs are only undergraduates and have a lot on their plate, so I understand if they have a busy schedule. But never before had I been in a class where ULAs moved, cancelled, and cut short both sections and office hours so last minute. \r\n\r\n- This class was evidently the product of an attempt to combine the PLSC and CS department and have a \"look mom, Yale's CS department is becoming  interdisciplinary  and training the next generation of tech-savvy leaders \" feel to it. And it does fulfill that goal in terms of inviting cool speakers, introducing real problems, teaching CS and political science theory, etc. But when it comes to the course itself and the assessment structure, a student can clearly tell from the lack of an Ed/Piazza platform, from the recycling of past PSETs, and from the fact that the actual low-level management of a Yale course is left to UNDERGRADUATES, that the initial high-level idea of an interdisciplinary class was unfortunately limited by the disaffected class-structure decisions on what the course entails (assignments, grade distributions, etc). \r\n\r\n- Did I learn any actual CS skills? Nothing that I already did",
                "I would recommend if you're a computer science student looking for a more interdisciplinary class.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in getting an overview of knowledge about the political issues surrounding computer science.",
                "Yes if looking for a less technical, but still interesting, cs class.",
                "Yes, I think CS students should take this class. It covers extremely relevant topics to the field and demonstrates the impact of technology in the real world. It's a great elective with a reasonable workload.",
                "I would as a good fifth class.",
                "No. For the love of Yale, don't take this class. You are wasting your time, because this is a bad GUT. There are much better guts in Astro or history or psychology that will be much better for you. This class should never be taught again and would be a shame to the CS department to be taught again.",
                "I would not. While the workload is light, you must get 100% on the first three psets and will not be able to do the fourth, whose spec is underspecified. The exams do not do much to help us learn, rather making sure we combed through the slides and readings for facts. The assessment structure must be reformed. It's a shame as the course has some interesting content and, on paper, doing things like building a blockchain should be very cool.",
                "I'd recommend this course to students who 1) are willing to attend lecture 2) interested in the societal impacts of tech and 3) willing to put in effort to get a good grade. Work-wise, this definitely is a gut given that psets are nicely spaced out and not too much work (although they will apparently be harder in the future) and you can drop 1 out of 4 psets. However, grade-wise, the prof wants an even distribution of A's/A-'s/B's/etc. and because the TAs grade nicely on psets, it can be hard to earn a good grade -- you definitely have to study a lot for the exams. But the content matter is super interesting, the profs are great lecturers, and you'll get a lot out of it! Just don't believe the hype that this is a total gut",
                "100%, especially if you are a CS major. Very few other electives are this practical. Doing it all in python and building substantive projects (AI Twitter bot, ML model, wrangling polling data to forecast elections, etc.) was really really cool. I will say, this course requires writing and the exams (shared with the students taking cpsc 310 and the cross-listed poli version of the same class) are very much poli sci exams. If you aren't comfortable writing essays, steer away from this one. Otherwise, dive in.",
                "Yes! Overall, it is an easy course that you can balance with other more challenging courses while still learn a good amount of cocktail topics.",
                "Yes!",
                "This class had highly arbitrary grading. The assignments (60%) of the grade are unrelated to what you learn in class. Halfway through the course the professor claimed that she wanted people to do worse grade wise because people were doing to well, which led her to changing questions to have extremely arbitrary grading requirements that would be impossible to decipher what was actually wanted -- not a fan of the professor.\r\n\r\nSomewhat interesting material but professor made it a bad experience.",
                "Absolutely not. Nothing profound was taught and the grading system is messed up. Exams and homework were graded very arbitrarily.",
                "No I would not recommend this class to another student because there is very little support when it comes to completing assignments and there is a lack of structure that is very frustrating.",
                "If you want a cool CS class but don't expect an easy A",
                "Yes, I think this is a great applications course for CS students and the guest lecturers we had this year were pretty cool (David Shor was one of them). I personally found the material really interesting, but I also think the broader context taught by this course is important to consider for anyone who is going into a tech field."
