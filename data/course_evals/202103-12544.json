                "I feel like this course could be taught in a more organized manner. Sometimes we burned time trying to find and correct mistakes on the board, but it made the content a lot harder to understand and the psets a lot harder to do when we didn't get through all the content.",
                "Strengths: Prof Schoelkopf was great; I really enjoyed his teaching, and he was a really charismatic lecturer. The problem sets were also really useful and were of appropriate difficulty compared to the exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading was VERY slow, and I sometimes did not have feedback on a problem set before an exam. The grading and distribution of practice materials also felt a little disorganized closer to the end of term, so it was difficult to access appropriate study materials.",
                "Fairly well taught I would say. A bit disorganized - I think the professor could have communicated with the TFs a bit better. Overall good course though.",
                "A major strength of the course is the vast array of methods of solving differential equations it teaches you. I feel comfortable solving the equations that come up other classes (I'm a physics major) now that I've taken this course. A weakness, however, is that when learning about certain topics I felt like I wasn't sure why I was doing what I was doing (e.g. using power series, Laplace transforms or Fourier series to solve equations). I was able to get a feel for why these methods worked after a while, but it would've been better to have some clearer guidance on why these methods are used and how they work.",
                "The course was well taught and well organized for the most part. The professor was willing to answer any questions and office hours were very helpful. My only criticisms would be that the difficulty of the homework varied wildly from week to week, and it was pretty easy to get lost during lecture.",
                "I felt that there was a bit of disconnect between the lectures and homeworks. Assignments had wildly varying lengths, and sometimes covered material that would not be taught in class until the day it was due.",
                "The main strength of this class is that the difficulty of the exams was appropriately proportional to that of the problem sets. Beyond this, however, I regret to say that this may be the most poorly taught class I've taken thus far at Yale. Professor Schoelkopf's lectures were often hard to follow  it was unclear which components were discussions of general topics, which were examples, and which were tangents. It was also routine for an algebra mistake to bring lecture to a grinding halt for as long as ten minutes. Most of what I learned in this class I pieced together from the textbook, occasionally supplemented by my largely incoherent notes from lecture. It was clear from the beginning of the course that little thought had been put towards organizing it; each of the problem sets was written by a different member of the teaching staff, and the first three psets contained eight, three, and ten questions, respectively. This disorganization, while eventually resolved with regard to the pset length, lingered in lectures throughout the semester.",
                "I think a major weakness of the course is how obscure the final grading is. We knew the class was curved but not how. This incentivized students competing against each other. \r\n\r\nLectures are quite boring.",
                "One strength of this course is the organizational structure of the teaching. The building blocks are taught, and then the different methods you can use, and they are taught mostly in order of what you should try first.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that there were limited examples of applications of the material to engineering and science, which is disappointing, as it is supposed to be a ENAS class.",
                "I think this course does exactly what it's supposed to do, namely support engineers, physicists, etc by giving them a solid background in solving the differential equations they are likely to come across later in their studies. The lectures were very well given, and the study sessions and office hours were very helpful. I do wish there had been more time to study systems of differential equations, but that couldn't be helped at the end of the semester. The only other weakness I can think of is that sometimes I wish the math had been slightly more rigorous, or that we had spent a little more time working on understanding why our methods worked. This was especially true for laplace transforms and fourier series.",
                "Later lectures revolved around conceptual applications (namely physics) and not how to problem-solve.",
                "The course was a bit disorganized and the lectures weren't always very clear in explaining the concepts",
                "Strengths: The class felt relatively well-organized, and I liked that we derived all the strategies we used. I found the lectures not too difficult to follow, and Prof. Schoelkopf was good about stopping to ask for questions.\r\nWeaknesses: At the beginning of the semester, the problem sets varied a lot in terms of length and difficulty. Also, some questions on early problem sets and the first exam seemed to be testing our calculus and algebra skills more than our differential equation skills (not that those two are completely separable).",
                "Strengths: Rob as a lecturer. He does his best to stay on track with the material every class. Reading the Boyce & Diprima book certainly helps connect the dots. Exams are pretty doable if you study the book, previous psets, and review material. Weaknesses: Organization of the class. TAs would rotate weekly to make psets, so difficulty would be unpredictable. It was pretty clear that Rob, the TAs, and us students were never on the same page. Improvements: I think the class would greatly benefit from two or more feedback forms to help everyone get on track with each other.",
                "Weaknesses: somewhat disorganized. Sometimes the homework and what was covered in lecture did not match up, which was frustrating when trying to figure out how to solve the problems on the PSET.",
                "The course's main strength is the problem sets; these do a great job preparing us and helping ensure the concepts have stuck.",
                "The work given is reasonable, but sometimes Rob would work a little too quickly especially on new concepts, forcing me to review and learn some concepts on my own. Slowing down and working through some easier examples step by step would help a lot. Sometimes problems wouldn't be worked out fully and steps would be skipped making it confusing and this is done to get to harder examples, which don't help when you don't understand the basics.",
                "Professor Schoelkopf's lectures were hard to follow and didn't really match up with the problem sets. Neel the TA was super helpful. There were a good amount of TA office hours but I would've appreciated more office hours led by Prof Schoelkopf. The course wasn't very organized.",
                "Very unenthusiastic prof, never went to lecture after the first week. Just spend time doing problems from the chapters and you will be fine.",
                "I think the teaching of the course could have been more organized. I felt sort of lost because we spent most of lecture going through proofs of the various techniques, but I struggled when it came to using the techniques on the p-sets. I think it would have helped my understanding to spend more time in lecture on examples. I do think that having textbook problems on the p-sets helped me to eventually learn the material.",
                "This course has the best TA which is Neel. Definitely without Neel I would not learn as much in this course. Professor Schoelkopf is great at trying to motivate us and at trying to get us to look ahead in our engineering and physics studies.",
                "Strengths: The professor went over applications for each type of diff eq, which was good. It really helped me in my physics class, because we were using diff eqs in that class, but I didn't understand how to use them until we went over the same example in this class. Weaknesses: The professor's lesson path is a little hard to follow, and he often makes tiny mistakes that can make it even harder to follow. Also, the grading on the exams was odd.",
                "There were many available resources to study the material, but the class was a bit disorganized.",
                "Strengths: Professor Schoelkopf was a good lecturer. He explained things clearly/(intuitively when possible) and gave specific real world examples for each type of differential equation he taught us about. The psets were a good length. Workload was low.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes there was a disconnect between what was in the psets and taught in the lectures.",
                "The strength was that half of the problem sets were very reasonable and helpful. The class had many weaknesses: there were often inconsistencies over what we were expected to know; for example, the professor promised there would be no difficult algebra on the midterm yet there was a problem that was 100% just excessive algebra. Additionally, there seemed to be a double standard in expectations--the professor would constantly make algebra errors in class that took a lot of time to correct, yet expected us to perform unnecessary algebra on problem sets and exams. As the course went on, lectures would often be rushed and confusing, leaving us to have to figure out concepts on our own--we didn't even finish all the material we needed to know for the final problem set at the end of the last class."

If you take it with Professor Schoelkopf, expect to learn the content and have pretty easy exams. The class is a little disorganized, but reading the textbook ahead of class makes everything so much clearer.",
                "Yes, the material is interesting and fun to learn because its straight forward (if that makes sense)",
                "If you need it for your major, or if you're interested in learning how to solve differential equations for whatever reason, then take it. If you're interested in learning more about why we solve differential equations in the ways we do, or how differential equations model systems, perhaps the version of this course offered through the math department is a better choice.",
                "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about differential equations without spending time on proofs. It is a tough course, but that has to be expected from the course material.",
                "I think this course is very useful, since differential equations is applied to physics and engineering. I also liked that proofs were not required here, and that the course focused more on the application of tools to solve differential equations. This course was required for me, but I still think I would have taken it if given the choice.",
                "I think if you need this course, you would be better off taking it with Professor Bennett or Professor Smooke. Professor Schoelkopf's lectures are difficult to follow, and I think this class could have caused me a lot less headache with a different instructor.",
                "Yes. Probably better than PHYS 301.",
                "I would recommend this course. It has already been very helpful to me in understanding my physics classes, which often don't explain the math to a level that I find satisfying. I think the psets and exams were quite fair in terms of time commitment and difficulty. I do think that this course is definitely aimed at physicists and engineers, even if it's not explicitly so. I think people who don't care about physics run the risk of the application examples being irrelevant to them.",

                "It's an interesting subject with many applications and uses for engineering and certain science majors but I would only take the course if you want to pursue some of those subjects in future semesters.",
                "Yes. Differential equations come up a lot, so it's very important to know how to solve them. I learned a lot of strategies in this class, which I'm sure I will make use of in the future. If you have to take both Differential Equations and Linear Algebra, I would recommend taking Linear Algebra first, because we used some linear algebra at the end of this Differential Equations, and I was glad I had seen it before, since we covered it very quickly.",
                "If Rob is teaching it, then yes just to get it done. It's not the best class, but it's manageable enough that it won't ruin your semester. You will most likely benefit from ENAS 194 if you are taking a class that needs Diff EQ (like an advanced physics or engineering class). I would suggest looking over the Boyce & DiPrima book and Khan Academy videos on Diff EQ if you feel lost. Also; unless Rob makes a calculation error during class, please save your questions for the end, otherwise the lectures will drag.",
                "I would, though it is not in any way theoretical and at times (particularly late in the course) the concepts were a bit rushed. Nevertheless, the class is a great intro to differential equations!",
                "Most people who take this course need it to fulfill a requirement. The workload is fine but since the course is not organized the course is more confusing than it needs to be.",
                "Absolutely do not take this class unless you have to or if Beth is teaching it. Terribly organized, TAs make problem sets and professors make our exams. Workload depends on the topic and at times, homework and assignments can be unexpectedly hard and faster-paced for no reason.",
                "I would probably not recommend this class unless you have to take it -- I don't feel like I gained the understanding I wanted to of the applications of differential equations and how to approach them when I encounter them. It was more about memorizing and following the set steps to solving them as opposed to developing my instincts and a deeper understanding of why we took certain approaches to different equations.",
                "I would take this if Neel is being the TA. Otherwise, I would not take it. If you have to take for your major, then there is no choice but to take.",
