                "I think that this course went in depth without being too much work compared to my other engineering classes.",
                "Strengths - The professor and TAs were great. There were many opportunities to ask questions, and lectures were clear and easy to follow. I also loved that Professor Hu met with us individually throughout the semester to discuss our progress. You could tell he really cared a lot about our learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Sometimes, it was unclear how much we were supposed to know, and we did end up with some surprising concepts on exams, which was frustrating.",

                "sometimes the explanations were a little confusing and sometimes I felt the exam content wasnt really covered in class",
                "This was the best course I have taken in the chemical engineering department so far! Homework assignments were very fair and provided a good recap of course material (plus, there were only 6 psets so the workload was very manageable). The pre-recorded lectures and readings were a solid background to in-class content. One weakness was that the pre-recorded lecture plus in-class lecture meant we spent a lot of time in class, which I didn't think was necessary. Also, the final was much more difficult than the midterms and problem sets, which caught us by surprise. I strongly recommend that recitation remain virtual, even once classes are in person, as being able to attend from my room and rewatch the recording was incredibly helpful."
