                "I think that this course went in depth without being too much work compared to my other engineering classes.",
                "Strengths - The professor and TAs were great. There were many opportunities to ask questions, and lectures were clear and easy to follow. I also loved that Professor Hu met with us individually throughout the semester to discuss our progress. You could tell he really cared a lot about our learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Sometimes, it was unclear how much we were supposed to know, and we did end up with some surprising concepts on exams, which was frustrating.",
                "The recording prior to lecture were very helpful in grasping some of the material. Lectures were great for asking questions. It could be improved if more example problems were done during lecture.",
                "Pre-lecture videos on top of full virtual lectures was several hours of course material per week.",
                "not a fan of the flipped classroom system; would be more helpful to do the lectures during class instead of pre-recording them",
                "sometimes the explanations were a little confusing and sometimes I felt the exam content wasnt really covered in class",
                "This was the best course I have taken in the chemical engineering department so far! Homework assignments were very fair and provided a good recap of course material (plus, there were only 6 psets so the workload was very manageable). The pre-recorded lectures and readings were a solid background to in-class content. One weakness was that the pre-recorded lecture plus in-class lecture meant we spent a lot of time in class, which I didn't think was necessary. Also, the final was much more difficult than the midterms and problem sets, which caught us by surprise. I strongly recommend that recitation remain virtual, even once classes are in person, as being able to attend from my room and rewatch the recording was incredibly helpful."

Furthermore, the professor and TA were both very willing to meet with students on Zoom, which was great given that COVID-19 has eliminated in-person office hours. Providing more detailed lecture notes and example problems could be helpful, as without in-person learning, it is sometimes harder to understand material and to go over problems.",
