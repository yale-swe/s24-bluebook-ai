   "comments": [
    "In this class I developed a deep appreciation for the Middle Ages! Before this course, they were nothing but a mysterious blot in history, but through the texts assigned in this course, I know understand this human age of history infinitely more than before.",
    "This class is a good introduction to the literature and female authors of the period. Christiana is a kind, knowledgeable, and very engaging professor.",
    "Through this course, I got to think about a completely new topic: women in the Middle Ages. Its a course topic that remains interesting throughout, and Christiana provides so many different sources\/ viewpoints for the readings that it is never dry. Our class discussions were engaging, and challenged so many assumptions that we had before the course. Christiana provides great feedback on writing, and this helped with my overall writing abilities.",
    "I gained a knowledge of many writings and works of authors from before and during the middle ages. Before this class, I would have questioned the importance of and presence of women in the middle ages, but I learned so much about their influence and the influence of the church during this period. Christiana made the class what it was, and I enjoyed every single meeting.",
    "I improved my reading\/writing skills in Italian. I learned about Medieval theology, medicine, and history.",
    "Overview of many of the most important texts from classical antiquity to the middle ages, lots of thoughts about their treatment of women!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe this course was all strengths! Having contextual lectures before every discussion really provided the seminar students with the background they needed to make an interesting claims or questions needed for generating interesting and compelling discussions. The short presentation methods was also a wonderful interactive way for students to be held accountable for at least a few things in the course.",
    "This course is well-structured; Christiana's lectures are engaging and helpful; and the readings are genuinely interesting. It's worth noting that the syllabus is very Italy-centric. This makes sense because this is the area Christiana knows best, but I would have enjoyed a wider scope of literature.",
    "This course covers a great deal of material and topics, therefore, you should be prepared to read quite a bit at times. However, the reading is never dry and Christiana always has interesting insights into the text that are unique to her areas of study as a professor. I do wish there was feedback on our weekly presentations, but Christiana is very supportive and kind regarding all of our work.",
    "High student engagement, lots of reading (but it was well worth it), great relationships formed both with the professor and other students",
    "The readings are topical and interesting. We covered a wide range of materials, but stayed within a highly organized progression from antiquity to early renaissance. Discussion was lively and engaging.",
    "Incredible, insightful conversations, and best of all: Christiana! She is an absolute gem, and makes any class you take into a community. She presented lots of fascinating readings of the texts that really drove class discussions. The only weakness is that sometimes, I think she is a bit too insistent on making her own argument for a seminar-style class, in which I'd like to come away with more ambiguity as to which is the \"right\" reading."

    "I would be surprised if someone had not already heard me talk about this course. We talk about issues of authorship, gender, and religion while also tackling philosophical questions of dualism and trans-humanism. Believing this to be one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, I wouldn't bat an eye before recommending Women in the Middle Ages with Christiana Purdy-Moudarres.",
    "Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course completely! This is the best course I have taken at Yale so far, and it exposed me to so much material I never would have had the chance to see otherwise. In such a unique area of study, it can be difficult to feel comfortable with background knowledge, but Christiana makes sure we have a strong understanding of the backgrounds to the texts before class discussions begin. The class was engaged with each other and with the material, and everyone had the opportunity to give their own perspectives on the work. This course was a great example of everything Yales courses should be.",
    "Yes! Christiana is the best professor I have had at Yale, and despite the fact that the material was entirely unrelated to my major, I am so glad I took this class and so thankful for what I learned.",
    "Yes. This was a great introduction to Medieval literature. It is an interesting angle, to look at women, especially female authors. We discussed what feminism means with regards to historical texts, which is an interesting and important exercise.",
    "I would recommend this class in a heartbeat. Christiana is a shining star at Yale, and seeing her and spending time learning all about women in the medieval period - ranging from a Salerno born-and-bred gynecologist to the first female pope - was truly the highlight of my week. Please, please take this class - you will not regret it.",
    "YES! take it! Even if you aren't interested in women OR the middle ages, there is something in this course for everyone."
