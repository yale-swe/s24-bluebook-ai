I learned to analyze and debate debates over the nature and definition of science and tradition, as well as the relationship between scientific representations and local culture.",
                "The feedback Professor Quarshie provided, as well as the in depth analysis required of the readings made me a better scholar as a whole.",
                "I developed my writing skills, I was pushed to write about really complex topics in a concise way. I learned how to sucessfully manage a heavy reading load and how to participate in discussions even when I feel intimidated by the material or my classmates. I also learned a lot about african philosophy in general, I've never learned about African in an academic setting and I am really glad I was exposed to new scholars/authors and ways of thinking.",
                "I really developed and tightened my writing skills, particularly in terms of establishing the stakes of an essay at the beginning and writing a concise thesis statement.",
                "Definitely improved my writing. I haven't been in an actual seminar-style class in a long time, so I also had to brush off some skills re: group discussion",
                "My writing skills were challenged to advance rapidly in this course. Each essay had clearer sentence structure, less unnecessary quotation, and more interwoven source material than the previous thanks to the instruction/feedback of Prof. Quarshie. Furthermore, my participation and listening skills in seminars have improved as I learned to attend to the flow of discussions more closely without sacrificing all/most of the pertinent comments that came to mind. In terms of knowledge, the texts we read in and of themselves introduced entirely new themes in academic writing to me on how health and embodiment relate to religion, social structures, colonialism, science, philosophy, and more in Africa/with Black people around the world. I had not seriously studied or critiqued ethnographic writing/studies before taking this course, but openers to discussions by students and the professor prepared me to delve into key aspects of each text."

                "Strengths: Professor Quarshie. He is a genius and makes everyone feel comfortable in his class. He pushed us to interrogate our understandings and to challenge preconceived notions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: we only wrote 11 total pages for this course, which is supposed to be a writing credit. I felt like one more essay would have made the grade distribution less stressful.",
                "The readings could be shortened for concision, as it would make them easier to discuss",
                "The strengths of this class are that students are exposed to new perspectives and are forced to think hard about their own world view in order to understand the material. Additionally, having challenging paper topics with relatively low page limits  pushes students to say what they really mean faster and more clearly. The only weakness is that the class had an extremely heavy reading load, this could be improved by swapping out some of the readings for podcasts or videos that discuss the same topic.",
                "The seminar-style discussions were very engaging and a major strength of the course. I found that sometimes the readings were a little long and it seemed many students werent able to get through them, so that may have affected our ability to discuss those readings.",
                "Strength  organization. The most important thing for a course to have is a defined structure, set deadlines, and clear expectations.  Nothing else really matters because if you have those things from the start, anyone who chooses to take the course is agreeing to whatever expectations were set.  This course had a lot of reading but I don't feel it was excessive, even coming from a background where many of my classes actually have zero reading.\r\nWeakness n/a? If you don't like reading or want a course where you can get away with not doing the reading, don't take this class probably, but I wouldn't call that a weakness of the class.",
                "Strengths: 1 meeting per week for a longer time, plenty of time in between meetings for completing the required readings; each student has an opportunity to lead the discussion week of their choice, allowing them to bring personal enthusiasm to the topic for that week\r\n\r\nWeakness: allowing students to lead discussions sometimes leads to long stretches of silence at the beginning of class which might be avoided/shortened by asking discussion leaders to pick out specific sections of the text that broadly interest them, not just specific (sometimes leading and complex) questions."

The course provides insights into the cultural dimensions of science and the ways in which shifting conceptions of value and capital can impact scientific and medical authority. Overall, this course offers a unique and informative perspective on the complex relationships between science, culture, and power.",
                "Yes! This was a great course for my writing development, and the material discussed was uniquely put together",
                "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Learning about African systems of thought has impacted the way I think about other subjects. I now have a much broader view of the world and analyze problems with a much more informed perspective.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wished to improve their writing and engage in deep discussions of various perceptions of African thought.",
                "Absolutely would recommend this course.  I think the structure of the course (students preparing and leading discussion, short reflection-ish papers + long(er) final paper) was really conducive to my learning and challenged me to engage with the texts beyond just reading/commenting on them.  Both the professor and my classmates pushed me to be more concise, specific, and thoughtful in my comments in class and in my writing.  I think the subject material is really important and I definitely learned a lot.\r\nI heard one of my classmates say there's a lot of reading; I would say there's about as much reading as I expected there to be. You're definitely expected to actually read, but I would hope that's true in all seminar classes.  We only had to write 3 (short!) papers, so it would be at best dramatic to portray this class as having a high workload.",
                "I'd readily recommend this course to another student with an interest in history, public health, global health, African studies, or AfAm studies, while reminding them that completing the readings is necessary to enjoy it."
