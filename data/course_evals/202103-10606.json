                "Practice singing",
                "I worked on my technical ability, focusing on left hand clarity and the mechanics of my right hand. I worked on several movements of Bachs D Minor Partita, as well as the first movement of the Wieniawski concerto. As this was my first semester of lessons, some of the time was spent simply relearning techniques in different ways (due to having a new teacher).",
                "I had a fun time learning new pieces and repertoire by taking this course.",
                "I developed strategies regarding how to better use my air, voice my notes better through higher tongue position, reduce tension, and become a more musical clarinetist.",
                "I was able to further my flute playing skills, both technically and musically. I learned new strategies for achieving better quality of sound, was prompted to make and justify musical decisions about repertoire I was learning, and was given suggestions for how to better execute musical phrases based on time period and style.",
                "Violin performance skills!",
                "I've been playing Double Bass for around seven years, but I haven't been taking lessons for almost four years, so I really wanted to pick back up and focus on my technique. I think I really learned a lot this semester and filled in a lot of gaps in my technique that had formed after many years without lessons. I think it also really helped me to form better practice habits especially while in college.",

There is so much more to singing than just the way that you position your sound, and that became a huge source of insight for me. Keeping my body in prime condition also helps my vocal performance technique.",

                "Strengths: you get to study for free (not really free, but you know) with amazing faculty; you get access to good practice facilities, and having credit lessons helps keep you accountable and gives motivation to set aside time for practice; not inherently stressful since its pass/fail\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: depending on the instrument, it can be very difficult to get into a studio; not that many built-in performance opportunities (but that could be good for personal flexibility, depending on what you want); music theory co-requisite is kind of annoying; can be intense depending on the professor and your own expectations/outlook",
                "I wish we could meet more often!",
                "Great course to take if you want to improve your singing",
                "The course makes a lot of sense, and it was exactly what I expected. Providing more opportunities for performance would have been nice, though.",
                "While it was nice to have a general overview of many pieces, I think it would be helpful to concentrate on one or two pieces in greater detail during our classes.",
                "Strengths: instructor was adaptable to my needs and wishes; quality of instruction was high. \r\n\r\nI can't think of any significant weaknesses.",
                "This course is just private music lessons, so I don't think there's much to improve here. I'm very glad this is an option for undergrads at Yale.",
                "More consistent lessons, with a stricter schedule. If one of us has to cancel, would prefer to do it more in advance.",
                "I think the greatest challenge of this course is that it is entirely dependent on the amount of effort that the student puts in. This isn't a weakness of the course, but something that makes it, or can make it, uniquely difficult. I think the biggest strength of this course is the ability to learn one on one from an extremely skilled and knowledgeable teacher.",
                "Strengths: I love voice lessons for credit. I am enrolled again second semester, and I really appreciate the my instructor. He is very knowledgable, talented, and so lenient with scheduling.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly don't have any once I received my assigned voice teacher. Any personal weaknesses from the course came from my own attempt at creating practice structure and committing to working on my own! \r\n\r\nThe only structural weakness, for me, would be how long it took to be assigned my voice teacher. When I was trying to navigate shopping period and I did not know if I was enrolled in MUSI 345 until the final days before schedules were due, that did add some stress. I also know this time was extremely unprecedented, especially in navigating the arts and COVID-19 regulations.",
                "strengths:\r\nJanna is the greatest, and I feel so much more confident in my technique since I started working with her. \r\nReally fun exercises and warmups!\r\nDiverse range of music\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nnone that I can really think of -- it's never been boring!",
                "Strengths: flexible, super kind professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: if you dont have a super solid idea of what you want from your lessons it can be hard to make progress and find motivation"

You will have to take a musicianship course on the side, which is something that (as of currently) you can't test out of, so if that's something you're also okay with doing, then I'd recommend this course.",
                "yes, if you are looking to take lessons for free of charge, I would certainly recommend this course. The required time commitment is relatively low and you can basically get as much or as little out of the course as you put into it.",

The ability to take lessons for credit free of charge was something that intrigued me even during the process of applying to Yale. Having the YSM so closely intertwined with the undergraduate experience at Yale is such a unique opportunity that I think everyone should take advantage of.",

Janna is incredible and kind, and the atmosphere she brings to her lessons is never stiff or demanding. Even while I'm reaching for new heights in my voice, I never dislike where I'm at because she never places moral judgment on improvement.",
