                "Strengths - almost everything! Bete is an excellent instructor and knows how to keep students engaged during 3-hour classes with a variety of different activities. Homeworks occasionally felt long, but it's true that the course is intensive and the work always felt useful. The classroom environment is very supportive. You are expected to make mistakes and then learn from them! Bete is also great at pacing the course so that there is flexibility and time built into the schedule while in Brazil to allow students to explore and take advantage. \r\nWeaknesses - a slightly more formal introduction of some grammar elements might have been helpful, but this is very minor",
                "Strength-The size of the class was ideal.\r\nWeakness-Homework was posted too late in the day.",
                "The course is overall extremely strong, with great elements of interactivity. Language is best learned through not just a textbook, but also movies, music, games, and more. However, I would recommend including a spoken portion of the homework. Sometimes it felt like I knew what I wanted to say, but I had trouble practicing pronunciation on my own without guidance.",
                "The class is extremely well structured and it was very clear what I was meant to learn from day to day.",
                "I loved everything about this course.  The course was structured in such a way that allowed the greatest learning experience for students.",

                "Of course! It is a phenomenal way to learn a new language if you're willing to fully commit yourself to the process. These first four weeks, mostly spent in New Haven, were definitely challenging for me. But toward the end, I felt prepared to begin learning even more Portuguese in Brazil.",
                "I would highly recommend this course, especially for those are speak another Romance language!",

                "For sure! Learning Portuguese before coming to Brazil and then also learning while in Brazil was super helpful and conducive to this experience. Super well-organized to promote learning, as well as clear and helpful feedback. Also, there was use of a lot of different things to help learn Portuguese (songs, books, poems, etc)."

I am really looking forward to reading some Portuguese literature, maybe first in translation and then in the target language.

It's also opened the doors to other cultures and experiences, making it really interesting and cool to check out things like different songs."
