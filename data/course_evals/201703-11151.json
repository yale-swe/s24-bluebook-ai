    "I don't think I learned anything knew. It was more practice of what we did in FRE 140.\r\n\r\nI didn't get a chance to speak as much during class as I would have liked...and we had a very small class.",
    "Excellent understanding of the French language and French culture, as well as how to further develop analytical reading skills in general",
    "I learned new French vocabulary, improved my speaking and listening comprehension skills vastly, learned a great deal of French grammar, and became better at discussing and analyzing French literature.",
    "In this class, we not only greatly improved our abilities in French grammar and vocabulary, we learned valuable skills in speaking the language. We also began to learn how to read French literature, which was new to many of us."

   "comments": [
    "The Tyco packet goes through a lot of grammar that we simply did not go through in class. We were forced to watch movies (that take a tremendous amount of hours away from my work week!) only to talk about them as an afterthought during the last minute in class. If you make us watch these films i would appreciate if we could spend substantial time going through them. Too often we digressed into random tings going on in France...which would be great if this was a culturally focused course...which it's not. i did not appreciate doing a lot, a lot of work in the packet by myself at home only to never talk about it in class.",
    "This course definitely does a great job of improving students' French abilities-- it is a good combination of grammar, vocabulary, listening, speaking, and reading, and the small class size helped facilitate learning. Many of the activities we did were fun, like putting on a miniature play and going to the Yale Art Gallery, and I think it was great we got to learn about French culture and history in addition to grammar and vocabulary through the films and books we studied. The workload is overwhelming at some times, and so it becomes difficult to commit fully to any one task (some days we'd have to watch a full-length film, complete several separate grammar exercises, study vocabulary, and answer comprehension questions or write a short essay).",
    "Everything about this course is good, although I think subtitles are necessary for the movies at our level of French.\r\nI also think that the syllabus should clarify the extent to which we can get help with the readings and movies, because I never knew if using wordreference.com was allowed or not."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to continue practicing French i guess this is still a good way to do so.",
    "Absolutely! If you're looking to improve your French and understanding of the French culture, this class will for sure do that.",
    "If you have to take French L5, or want to take it to improve your French, I would strongly recommend taking it with Professor Bdoui, who is amazing. This class is a lot of work-- don't be overwhelmed at first--but the grading is not as tough as you might think, and I got a lot out of the class. My French skills have improved tremendously; I think they've improved more in this one semester class than they did combined in my previous four years of high school French.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is truly dedicated to learning French, because I think it would be overwhelming for someone who only wanted to take the class to fill the language requirement. \r\nFor someone who was invested in French and enjoyed it, this class is perfect. The work is engaging and entertaining, and the instruction is very informative. Also, the many writing assignments greatly improve the students' writing skills as well as French skills."
