One weakness is that the course is designed to prioritize \"quantity over quality\" (at times there was so much material covered in such a short amount of time that retention became difficult later on in the course)."

                "I'd recommend Italian at Yale to students who are looking for a fun, low-stress way to fulfill the language requirement! Costanza creates a very easygoing, laidback class environment which makes learning Italian enjoyable. The courseload also is very manageable -- you'll just have to read 1-2 pages in the textbook every day and complete a few exercises. Costanza also makes an effort to introduce students to Italian culture by having students present Italian songs, assigning Italian movies to watch, and reading Italian literature in class.",
