One weakness is that the course is designed to prioritize \"quantity over quality\" (at times there was so much material covered in such a short amount of time that retention became difficult later on in the course)."

                "Yes! Italian is fun and the instructors are nice. The daily workload is not very much.",
                "I'd recommend Italian at Yale to students who are looking for a fun, low-stress way to fulfill the language requirement! Costanza creates a very easygoing, laidback class environment which makes learning Italian enjoyable. The courseload also is very manageable -- you'll just have to read 1-2 pages in the textbook every day and complete a few exercises. Costanza also makes an effort to introduce students to Italian culture by having students present Italian songs, assigning Italian movies to watch, and reading Italian literature in class.",
