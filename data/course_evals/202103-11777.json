My ability to read more poetry in-depth and prepare to discuss it was the single greatest skill I improved. I also wrote better, and more. This course provides everything an English student could really want.",
                "Developed poetry analysis skills in a meaningful way.",
                "I learned how to critically and closely engage with works of poetry, how to parse each line, phrase, and sometimes a singular word in a poem. I was able to further my understanding of poetry as well as develop more robust writing skills.",

                "This course is well structured with a great balance of discussion time and student involvement.",
                "1. The strengths of the course mostly related to Professor Eccles. Everything from her readings on the syllabus, to her informal assignments and essay prep, to her incorporation of midterm feedback (the only professor I have ever seen actually incorporate midterm feedback, in real-time), to her incredible feedback and support in office hours and in grading, and her facilitation of discussions.\r\n\r\n2. My first suggestion is that Professor Eccles should teach more. Follow or even replace the debrief with your own context, expertise, etc. My only real complaint about this course was that I felt there was too much discussion. Sometimes I was itching to hear Professor Eccles own take or contribution to a topic, only to have to listen to another student talk for 2-3 minutes and not provide much substantial material to the discussion. I understand and appreciate the need to engage more students in discussion, but let students hear you, professor!\r\n\r\n3. My second suggestion is that the grading scale be adjusted. The idea of grades being distributed evenly across 10 percentage points doesn't quite sit right with me. If 10 future Nobel Laureates in literature take this class and perform accordingly, all of them should be able to earn an A. A curved grading scale doesn't allow for this and may leave students feeling like their hard work and results are not accurately reflected. I personally felt my grading was accurate enough, but I can easily see how others can suffer (or unfairly gain) from it.",
                "Well organized, receptive and thoughtful Professor, overall an awesome course! Definitely worth taking 126 with prof Eccles. It was incidental, but occasionally the poet pairings were hard to connect to each other.",
                "I thought the syllabus was very well crafted, and the informal assignments we had every couple of weeks were incredibly useful for writing papers. I felt like I came out of this course with a new appreciation for the amount of time it can sometimes take to understand a poem, and I look forward to exploring the poets we read more in the future.",
                "Professor Eccles was great! The course material was incredibly interesting and engaging. It was always a wonderful intellectual challenge to engage with the poems.",
                "Strengths: Professor Eccles is truly wonderful. She's a strong discussion leader and is very receptive to student feedback on what is and isn't working. We had informal assignments which were so helpful for noticing new things about the poems, coming up with paper ideas, etc.",
                "I think the course has a bit of odd pacing, especially compared with other sections of 126. We spent a lot of time on Wordsworth and Pope, two authors that other sections moved through quite quickly. I also would have appreciated more time spent on fundamentals of analysis before jumping into specific authors; it felt like, on some occasions, everyone in the class was working with a different vocabulary. While that is somewhat inevitable, it can be helped to a degree. I did enjoy the discussions I had in the course, though. They were quite productive, as were the smaller assignments leading up to larger papers."

But we read a lot of poetry, but weren't able to discuss the majority of it. A lot of the poets in the first half felt very similar, and it was difficult to feel very engaged in the texts.",
                "Without a shadow of a doubt. Of course, someone averse to English, especially poetry, would not enjoy the high-level discussions and writing papers. But anybody else should enjoy this course. Everyone else will benefit tremendously, mainly from Professor Eccles' personal passion for English and extremely constructive and helpful feedback on writing. The course can get bogged down sometimes with a bit too much discussion, but other than this is a must-take if you've ever read even one poem and enjoyed it.",
                "Absolutely! Eccles is amazing.",
                "Yes, especially if you are a prospective English major. As a foundational course for the major, ENGL 126 is a great class to help get you into reading and writing about poetry. The types of readings are varied and interesting, and the papers are very open-ended.",
                "Absolutely, although more for English majors as poetry is sometimes difficult to parse and if you are not a lover of poetry it can be somewhat pedantic and boring.",
                "Yes! I was hesistant about this class at first just because I wasn't too excited to read some of the poets on the syllabus, but I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I feel differently now. Professor Eccles helped me realize that there is a lot of value in reading work by poets you don't particularly love. And if you prefer contemporary poetry (as was my case), there's so much you can learn about it by reading many of the poets taught in this class. The informal assignments also gave me new ways to think about poetry.",
                "If you need to take it for the major, then it's fine enough, but there are probably more targeted poetry courses at Yale that I would recommend over this one."
