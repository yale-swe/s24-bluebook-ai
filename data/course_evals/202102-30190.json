                "This course was incredible. I came in knowing very minimal R, and now I feel confident in my abilities to code and analyze data. The modules are so organized and easy to follow. The professor is quite funny and grabs your attention throughout the entire lecture, no small feat considering that the entire class is asynchronous. Speaking of which, the asynchronous lectures were a great format. I could get ahead in some days and have a more flexible schedule. Problem sets also reinforced learning a lot.",
                "good TAs,\r\n\r\nwished there were more spread out OH\r\n\r\nsometime points taken off on homework were odd though (e.g. having graph title cut off bc knitting didnt work)",
                "There were no weaknesses of the course. All the lectures were clear and easy to understand.",
                "Very nicely paced course with well written homework; Great support and availability of TAs in office hours",
                "Asynchronous, could watch lectures and do psets at my own pace; improvement would be if we had more time, but YSS doesn't really allow for that",
                "The skills you gain are useful and applicable, and the professor is outstanding. The only complaint I have is that it often took longer than promised to get questions answered on Ed Discussion, and sometimes the learning assistants weren't able to properly answer my questions without referring me to the professor.",
                "Strengths: very organized. Weaknesses: very light on theory",
                "The class had a lot of office hours, and the lectures spoke to the psets very well. The class was extremely fast paced and left very little time to absorb the material before we moved onto the next",
                "It was a fully virtual pre-recorded class this year. It flowed logically and professor JDRS was very helpful during office hours.",

                "Good that we always had resources and help available to us.",
                "Strengths: A lot of hands-on practices with the software R, which could be quite useful if one is to purse social science research. Weakness: the level of engagement is low and the Canvas page is not properly updated in some instances.",
                "Given the constraints of a remote summer class, this course was designed as entertainingly and as packed with content as possible.",
                "Since it was a summer course, it goes without saying that the course felt very rushed. Since we moved so fast, there was little time to work with the concepts we discussed before moving on to the next topic. Yet, this model allowed for a vast amount of information to be covered in that short time period so, while not ideal, the current pacing of the class is necessary. I did find it odd how web scraping was saved until the very end of the course, since those who might want to use it for their project might need those skills before this was taught. I also did enjoy that the lectures were available before the scheduled day to watch them, as this made time management far easier.",
                "Strengths: one of the most organized classes I've taken, materials and support by JDRS and TF\/ULA's readily available, topic is pretty interesting at times, workload is not light but not too hard and easy to plan around since it's consistent.",
                "Strengths--kind and helpful professor, awesome and caring TAs\/peer tutors, homework assignments\/exams\/project followed very intuitively from the class notes, we were really assessed on our understanding of the statistics and ability to get the job done in R (there weren't really any rules about sentence length or specific programming techniques we had to follow--if we found a way to get the problem done and answered the statistical interpretation questions, we were awarded credit). This really helped minimize my stress since I already felt a little behind after not taking statistics for many years, so I could just focus on the material and get back into it easily. \r\nWeaknesses--I can't think of a specific weakness of the course that made me not enjoy it as much.",
                "fantastic professor\r\nreasonable problem sets and exams\r\ndirectly applicable skills",
                "I thought the course was very good in that everything was well organized. I think there should be less fixation on small details in psets",
                "Strengths: short video lectures are great, office hours are plentiful, course content is useful\r\nWeaknesses: Responses on Ed discussion were often absent before a homework was due or multiple days late. Also, this is not a collaborative class - it is very competitive because grading is harsh. The TFs can be very nitpicky on homework assignments and before taking it you should know that the professor uses the final project as a way to scale people down so that if you do everything assigned you'll only get a 90, which will most likely lower your grade since the average on most assignments was around a 96 (indicating ~50% of the class would get an A (96+ in the spring semester) if he did not intentionally grade people down on the final project). You must go \"above and beyond\" to get an A on the final project - and even then the average was a 90 and the highest grade was a 98 - so still nobody got a 100. It's a highly competitive class and every point matters when the scaling is this cutthroat so double check the points you get off on homework assignments, go to office hours at least once to double check your answers (some questions - particularly the short answer ones - are ambiguous) for every homework assignment, and put in the hours to do as much extra work as you can on the final project and you'll be fine. If he didn't intentionally scale down on the final project, the cutoffs would probably be 98+ for an A so try to go into the final project with a grade around there and you should be ok. I personally don't approve of scaling people down to the point where people with 96's going into the final project came out with an A- (in the spring - he has not yet released summer grades (as of 8\/30) which may be intentional so as to avoid the course evaluation deadline to limit negative reviews associated with his unexpectedly cutthroat grading - many students were angry with their grades last spring). IMO the material is easy and if everyone masters it then everyone should get an A, but JDRS definitely does not agree so be careful.",
                "Strengths: JDRS is a legend, lots of support opportunities\r\nWeaknesses: Over the summer the class goes really fast, grading can be very harsh sometimes"

                "As an econ student, it was really helpful to actually be able to conduct analysis. THis is a skillset that I will be able to use in research in the future.",
                "Yes. It is a good practical (rather than theoretical) statistics course. It focuses on programming in R, and R is pretty fun. As a computer science rather than statistics-oriented person, the coding was fun; some of the more theoretical statistics concepts went over my head, but it did not matter for my performance on assignments.",

                "I would recommend this course to another student if their goal is to learn to use R. This course is particularly suitable for those who would like to conduct quantitative research in the social sciences and\/or other disciplines. For students who prefer a more theoretical treatment of statistical concepts, I would not recommend this course.",
                "Absolutely. I feel seriously equipped to analyze data and write up my analysis. If for nothing else, take it for JDRS.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course. You leave with a great deal of proficiency when it comes to organizing and analyzing data in R which will be extremely helpful in future research. With 3 psets a week, the pacing is quite intense but, with good time management, completing all of the work with a bit of spare time is doable.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course, but NOT  the summer version! It moved way too fast, there were fewer opportunities to get help, and I didn't really absorb anything. That being said, if you want to learn some R, take this course (during the school year)",
                "Yes. This is one of the most organized classes I've taken so far, and it felt good to have a course where I knew how long things would take and could finish the work without ever feeling terribly stuck or confused about what I was supposed to do. JDRS and the TA\/ULA's provided excellent support in office hours. I think the workload was more long than difficult, but the class was so organized and materials\/lectures readily available that you can plan out your work well. Keeping up with lectures is key!\r\n\r\nI would just keep in mind that this course is mostly about applying statistical methods and not fully understanding thema lot of equations are shown briefly, proofs gone over quickly, or full explanations given by a link that leads to further reading. I left still feeling vaguely confused about motivations for some tests and how they were created and related to each other. However, that might be more a symptom of the subject or the pace of a compressed summer course rather than the class itself.",
                "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they took intro stats at some point in the past (even years before) and want to refresh their memory of a few key ideas\/methods in a slightly different context (applying ideas to programming in R). After AP Stats over 4 years ago, this was a nice reminder of a few ideas and gave me a chance to feel more \"productive\" since I was mainly focused on programming, reading about the math behind the methods whenever I was curious\/forgot about the theory. Also for the lecture videos, I really enjoyed the little jokes JDRS included throughout the course to keep it fun and interesting (and even in some specific videos, like the freestyle music bit).",
                "Yes! JDRS is a great professor and the course will help you become well acquainted with R, which is very useful in a variety of fields.",
                "Yes I would. It is a great class and many applicable skills.",
                "Yes, but if you want a good grade you need to be extra attentive to every point on every assignment (and do as much work as possible for the final project) because the scaling will be harsh and will likely seem unfair.",
                "Yeah, go for it. S&DS 230 is a perfect summer class because it's entirely asynchronous. As long as you keep up with the class, you can watch the lectures and do the homework whenever is most convenient for you. JDRS is an absolute legend - his humor was a welcome addition to the lectures, and he really knows his stuff. The one thing I thought could've been better was when he had slides showing, he sped through them really fast without really giving us a chance to write down what was important (but since it was an asynchronous class it was easy to pause). R has a bit of a learning curve but it's a very cool (and important!) programming language to learn. The homeworks individually aren't bad (they're just R markdown notebooks where you're following very detailed instructions), but since the class is so condensed they come fast and furious and it's hard to keep the pace. My one gripe was the strictness of the grading, where they'd take points off for not mentioning a specific statistic for like the 15th time in the HW for example, but honestly it was a very enjoyable class. Would definitely recommend to anyone whether or not they plan to be an S&DS or related major."
