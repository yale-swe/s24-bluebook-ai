            "comments": [
                "This course was tackling a interesting, groundbreaking, and radical subject matter. It often floated between studying art that qualifies as \"sensory\" in a very traditional way and studying the approach of thinking about\/making art in a nontraditional or more sensory way. However, the Professor allowed us great latitude in the direction we took our projects and reading responses, allowing students to decide for themselves how traditional their approach to studying the senses would be, which I appreciated. Furthermore, the class took us out of our assigned classroom for all but one meeting this semester, which allowed us to explore the artwork experientially in a truly unique way.",
                "Strengths: I enjoy object-centered art history classes, as to me that is what art history is about. It was collections based which meant we spent a lot of time in Yales collections (Beinecke, Medical Library, YUAG etc) and we met a couple curators and grad students in the department as well. Kristina also worked hard to decenter visual analysis and we examined objects that would fall more under material culture, which is important to do when studying art history and to consider the biases rooted in visual\/fine art oriented analysis. The course had a very relaxed atmosphere, which I also liked  it meant that I could talk more freely and that I did not fear being wrong, which for me helps facilitate learning. I tend to not be as engaged in courses where I am scared of consequences for an incorrect answer.\r\n (A Sort-of) Weakness: The course was not as heavily structured as other art history courses I have taken and Kristina built her classes around our (the students) commentary. To some extent, I think that was a double edged sword  while that meant we had a lot of say in what we learned and the classes were built to our and her interests, I occasionally wished we had more structure.",
                "The strength of this class was definitely the number of objects we were able to interact with in person, especially after a year of virtual teaching. There was very minimal work required outside of class, so you could really focus on whatever collection we were looking at that week.",
                "Really liked the different settings for each class (different libraries) and the variety of objects that we got to look at. It was also great to have Professor Potuckova picking objects for us to look at, because I think a lot of the difficulty with navigating the collections is just not knowing what we have. Also premise of the class is very cool - sensory experience of art- and so maybe a few more explicit discussions of sense in class would be helpful. Readings were also interesting, but a bit dense at times. My favorite classes were the perfume \/ embroidery ones!"

                "Yes! If you really want to explore the vast array of collections available to Yale students (from the Beinecke to the YUAG to the Wurtele Center) this is a great class. We also took a field trip to the Met Cloisters, which was also really illuminating. It's an excellent immersion into the world of medieval art.",
                "Yes! I adore Kristina  she is so kind and caring towards her students and I think everyone should have the chance to study in the collections.",
                "Yes! I didn't have any kind of background knowledge on Medieval European art before this class, but I found it approachable and engaging.",
                "Yes- really cool to look at objects in Yale's collection and to go to different library spaces every week. I also had never had any experience with medieval art, so it was great to get hands on experience with that. Overall the class is a nice compromise between history of art and interacting with objects directly."
