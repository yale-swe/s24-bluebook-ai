I also gained an understanding of the sonic and visual qualities associated with the various subgenres of British New Wave, including second-wave ska, British glam rock, British punk rock, and British Wave postpunk. I also developed an understanding of the origins of both British New Wave and K-Pop, as well as the racial and political elements associated with both genres. I learned about the transnational nature of music and about how music is negotiated across borders. I also learned about the role of technological advancement in the development of both genres. With regards to British New Wave specifically, I learned about the effects of the democratization of music and the rise of the synthesizer on the music industry in the time of British New Wave, and using British New Wave as a case study, I was able to develop an understanding of the inner workings and operations of the music industry. With regards to K-Pop specifically, I learned about the rise of modern K-Pop in light of the previous era of Korean music, and I learned extensively about the development of the idol systems, the current generational system of K-Pop music, and the role of fandoms in music. I was also able to learn about the use of K-Pop as soft power by the South Korean government, and using K-Pop as a case study, we were able to explore definitions of masculinity in both American and Korean society."

                "Strengths: the assigned readings and guest lecturers were interesting, got to hear a lot of good music, the playlist assignments were fun, Prof. Kao and Jacob Derechin (the TF) are super knowledgeable about music.\r\nWeaknesses: While readings were assigned every week, we rarely discussed them in class. I think that the class could have been structured more like a seminar, with background information being presented in readings and class consisting mostly of discussion, rather than having so much information be presented in class.",
                "Theres really no way to improve this course its really good",
                "Would have liked to dive deeper into the readings, sometimes we didn't really discuss them in class (this class might work better in a lecture format)\r\nVery interesting to learn about the idol process + music development\r\nWould have appreciated unpacking anti-Blackness and Third World Movements in music more\r\nThe professor and assistant were very understanding of challenges during COVID, and created very engaging events for after class (ie. our assistant did a DJ tutorial)",
                "Strengths: The course is very conducive to learning for someone who doesn't know a lot about British New Wave music or K-Pop, as there are plenty of opportunities to learn about the good and the bad of both genres through the readings, genres, and lectures given on the topics by the instructor. The assignments in the class are relatively fun and enjoyable (commenting on playlists of music, collaborating with classmates to create playlists centralized around a specific theme), and the writing requirements for the class were are very reasonable and a good way to get students to engage with the readings of the course. The speakers incorporated into the class sessions were among the highlights of this class. Speakers such as Dave Wakeling and Thomas Dolby that are very relevant to the content of the course were fun to listen and ask questions to, and such speakers were able to provide insights into the musical scene and industry of their times.\r\nWeaknesses: The course can probably get a bit boring at some points for those knowledgeable on either genre of music, particularly K-Pop and with those knowledgeable about the idol system. The two parts of the course also felt distinct and not very well connected by the end of the course, and there seems to be enough material present in each part of the class for each part to perhaps warrant its own course. While the writing requirement was reasonable, there was not that much feedback on the writing assignments incorporated throughout the course, other than a few comments. There were also a few points throughout the class in which I personally felt that I was learning a lot from my more knowledgeable classmates, but at the same time I felt that I was not able to (or had the authority to) contribute on my own in classroom discussion."

                "I would recommend this course to students like myself, who are not knowledgeable about music or popular culture but are looking to more, generally speaking, about the music industry and contemporary popular culture. The overarching direction this course takes allows students to essentially use British New Wave and K-Pop, as a past and a modern example respectively, as relevant case studies into how the global music industry operates on a macro and micro level. I would also recommend this course to anyone who is already knowledgeable about this subjects but is looking for a relaxed medium in which to express their thoughts about both genres or is willing to hear different perspectives about the subject matters pertaining to this class."
