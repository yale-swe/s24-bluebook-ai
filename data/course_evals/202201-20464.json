(Not that the class suffered because of it, but just as something to keep in mind)",
                "I think fewer readings would help",
                "I think the course's mixture of instructional texts, research examples, and in-class projects did a good job at making a large amount of material digestible and engaging. Course assignments were well-structured and organized, and class discussions helped tie together the many sources of information used. I do think that the course could benefit from being more streamlined, however, and taking a more formal approach to the methods discussed. In particular,  think that a more unit-based structure that leaned more heavily on instructive texts would help students gain a firmer understanding of the different methods and topics to be covered.",
                "This is probably a hot take but I think there could have been a bit more in-class activities throughout the semester to get everyone engaged with the material. Seemed a bit easy for some students to coast through."

The methods learned, and the logic behind them, is valuable to the study of society from a variety of angles. I think even students with no plans t pursue social research would benefit from the insights gained by the course, because the knowledge that these methods generate (or claim to) is all around us.
