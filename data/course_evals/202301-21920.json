                "By far the most memorable class I've had at Yale!  Seminar discussions are so rich and deep I wish they could have lasted longer every time.  Everyone came to class with powerful readings that we shared with each other to puzzle out the meaning to an incredible selection of texts.  Class always broke me down and pieced me back together in a way I had never been before.  You really do come out changed after each week, and for the better.",
                "Good readings, rich discussion",
                "The strengths of this course: \r\nThe expectations were incredibly clear: read the material and be willing to discuss only the text we have at hand. Because of this, there was very little conversation that was not absolutely relevant to every student, and the conversations built upon each other week to week. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course: \r\nThe professors did not work well together. In fact, it was a pretty awkward situation watching them pretty actively critique and try to share the classroom. Also some people talked far too much and others far too little.",
                "Strengths: Suuuper interesting and engaging material. The readings are just great reads in general. There's a wide range of genres and topics and styles, so there's something for everyone.\r\n \/ \r\nWeaknesses: Didn't perceive any weaknesses in particular. I suppose experiences can vary depending on the specific composition of the class since it's a seminar, but the profs lead the discussion very well.",
                "strengths: syllabus, professors, assignments, class discussions. \r\n\r\nAm I leaving anything out?",
                "Strengths are the professors. Levene and Wood are thoughtful, precise, challenging, and kind professors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that at times it can be hard to synthesize what you are learning. The discussion in class is unstructured. You are responsible for attending to what you want to take away from the class.",
                "The strength of this course was the passion for seminar discussion, and how willing the group was to learn. This was a self-selecting group of students who are not afraid to speak up in class, be creative and be wrong. Regarding weaknesses, the seminar was once a week but quite long, and could drag on.",
                "I think that Professor Levene and Professor Wood did a good job facilitating discussions, and I enjoyed how they often referenced texts that we had previously read when discussing new works it gave a nice sense of continuity. However, I think that at times it felt like the discussions lacked focus. I realize that the professors wanted the class to go in whatever direction they wanted, but I think it might have been helpful\/more satisfying if we set a few specific topics of discussion each class and pursued them with more focus\/depth.",
                "Strengths: quality of texts, quality of class discussion (higher than any I've taken at Yale), insight\/skill in leading discussion of professors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: looseness of topic\/theme, breadth of texts (though this was also a strength), control of discussion by some and lack of engagement by others (presumably because there was no participation grade)"

            "comments": [
                "Definitely!  This is a class about life, words, God, and--even then--so much more.  I never knew reading 11 pages would take me an hour, but I learned to break down every sentence in a work and truly appreciate it for all its beauty and insight.  I came to the course with some reservations because I had read many of the works on the syllabus, but the class never left me with a moment of boredom--it challenged me to re-approach every work in such a fresh light.  I wrote, read, talked, and--above all--lived.",
                "Yes",
                "Personally, I would not take this course again, but if a student is very interested in deep dives of texts and only the texts at hand, this course would be nice.",
                "Absolutely. Trust. It's an amazing course and I'd recommend it to literally anyone. Really gets you thinking about a lot of things and provides you with a sweet, wide breadth of philosophical knowledge.\r\nI was at first hesitant about taking it, as it is listed under Religious Studies and I'm not religious. But I didn't find any problem in engaging with the material, because a lot of the readings are either nonreligious or so much more than just religious. In fact, it was really fun to study things from an atheist's POV. Workload is not terrible - two four-page essays and one eight-page essay double spaced, for a philosophy course?? :0\r\nProfessors are also very much willing to accommodate for extenuating circumstances.",
                "Would definitely recommend but it is unlike other classes I would say. This seminar is an experience. The texts are at the forefront of what living means, if it does mean anything, and the class is lead by these texts.",
                "I would not recommend this course to everyone, because I do not think every student learns in the way the seminar\/course was structured. I would encourage students to take a look at the syllabus beforehand and determine if the texts are works they would be excited to engage with. The syllabus really runs the gamut in a very interesting way, which is a highlight of the course.",
                "Yes, if that person was interested in religious studies. This ended up being a much more religion-focused class than I had expected, which I didn't mind, but I think it could be a turn-off for some people, since it wasn't necessarily the main focus of the course description.",
                "Absolutely. For someone who is interested in exploring life's big questions, whether after DS or within the Humanities major or just as a supplement to their studies in STEM or other fields, this course is an invaluable training in close reading, writing, and thinking. Never before have I come out of a class so consistently grateful and full of wonder."
