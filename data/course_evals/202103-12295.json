I also learned more about Chinese culture through the class readings and outside texts and poems. I have learned that Chinese is a very aesthetic language and I look forward to next semester CHNS 163.",

                "I learned Chinese vocabulary and improved my speaking and writing skills. Professor Su also taught phrases with literary significance and Chinese history in class, although these were not in the curriculum and not tested. We also learned a bit of Traditional Chinese.",

Every other week you are essentially asked to write an essay -- you alternate between essay writing and presenting every week. You get to hear Su laoshi's great stories (a plus for the course)!",

            "comments": [
                "This class was very interesting and informative, and I definitely learned a lot about Chinese culture/history outside of the textbook material. I just wish all the assignments for each lesson weren't due on the same day because it could be a little overwhelming at times, but Professor Su was always very lenient with deadlines.",
                "I think the strengths were Su Laoshi's enthusiasm in introducing external ideas, stories, and concepts as supplements to the textbook content. I do think the timing of assignment deadlines could have been better  instead of having essays/presentations, quiz, and homework due on one day, it would be nice to spread those three out across the week.",
                "Strengths:\r\nSu Laoshi is probably one of the best professors you'll ever have. He's warm, kind, and knows the language and Chinese culture inside out. Even if your Chinese is already at a very high level, you'll still learn so much from the class and him. I highly recommend all students engage with Su Laoshi one-on-one, either through office hours or lunch, to learn more about his fascinating life. All of the course materials were pretty on point as well, but I think the best resource you can take advantage of is Su Laoshi.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI think some of the teaching materials are a bit outdated, but that doesn't affect learning.",
                "The class was really engaging and pushed us to learn new vocabulary, culture, and writing skills. The class had a presentation or essay every 2 class periods but that allowed students to really improve their Chinese communication skills. As for weaknesses for the class, a more clearer grading on the overall course would be nice but other than that I really enjoyed the class.",
                "I thought Su Laoshi was a great and very dedicated teacher who was also willing to share very interesting personal stories. A weakness of the course was the heavy workload. It also would have helped if we had teaching fellows to provide feedback on our work and for our listening exercises.",
                "This course has no weaknesses and there are many strengths (improving Chinese writing ability).",
                "I think there is too little speaking practice in this class. I wouldve liked to practice more conversation or application of material in real life",
                "For me, this course felt like a high input with not as much output kind of course. There was about 7 hours of work per week-- 2 hours on homework, 3-4 hours spent on essays, and 1-2 hours spent practicing for dictations. This amount of homework was about equal to the rest of my courses combined. However, I felt like since I was scrambling to cover so much content, I didn't have time to learn it well. Therefore, I think a large weak point of this course is that it moves too quickly. There's too much content for students to truly absorb the material. Moreover, we did a lot of repeating the material and learning about extraneous extra information during class--not enough time was spent on allowing students to practice using vocabulary and sentence structures out loud.",
                "This course requires a bit of self learning, especially for learning Chinese writing. During classes, Professor Su runs through textbook exercises, but doesn't delve too deep into that material or practice writing Chinese. Much of class time is spent learning extraneous material related to culture and history. Exams and quizzes also often have material not covered in class. However, Professor Su is a wonderful teacher, and the material about culture and history is very useful. The Chinese learned in class is also useful for more advanced writing and speaking. The class just requires you to learn some things, like Chinese writing, on your own time. Grading is also fair and you will never be penalized hard for anything. The textbook is a bit old and some of the things it mentions are a bit outdated, but it's written well and the vocabulary and exercises are structured to help you learn the material during class.",
                "You learn A LOT of content, but keep in mind, it is also a good amount of work. If you've taken 152/153, there is overlap with the material, but your vocabulary expands, the essays are longer, you learn traditional characters (which is useful but you do have to know these for exams).",
                "Since this is a heritage course, people in the class came from varying degrees of fluency, and overall it felt as though the class could have provided more support for those who had less confidence in exercising the language than others."

This Chinese class is different in that is taught in a way that is to elevates the sophistication of a student's Chinese writing and speaking abilities in aspects outside of a typical conversation.",

                "I would only recommend this course to students with high Chinese language ability who are looking to spent a lot of time learning more vocab and writing. There is an essay or presentation assigned every week (on top of homework and dictation), so students should be prepared for that kind of workload. Moreover, if students are looking to practice their speaking skills or improve their conversational fluency, this is not the class for them. This class is not super interactive in terms of discussion.",
                "I think this depends on your workload, if you have knowledge from CHNS 152/153, this is a class structured quite differently (it's more work). The basic expectations for this course is that you have time to write an 1000+ character essay every 4 class days, though Su laoshi is lenient and understanding, these are still things to be done and can be time consuming. However, aside from this, you learn a lot from the class -- su laoshi's stories are almost the absolute reason why you should take it.",
