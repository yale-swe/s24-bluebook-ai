You will not learn about actual ancient economies and how they functioned, which is why I was interested in the course. Instead you will read contemporary economic historians posit theories on how best to study and interpret ancient evidence. \r\n\r\nTruth be told, I think that is a type of class for an audience different from what an audience interested in learning about the actual history of ancient economies.

                "This course was frustrating because it's called Ancient Economy, but one of the main questions throughout the entire course is whether there actually WAS an ancient economy or not. It all felt very abstract for a history course, but then again it is ancient history. The material was interesting, but only if ancient history is your jam.",
                "The main strength of the course is the professors, great deal of passion for the subject, as well as his direct involvement in much of the cutting edge research related to the field. The main weakness of the course is that the syllabus feels somewhat unfocused in terms of order. Simply rearranging and re-organizing the topics covered would add a lot of cohesion to the course.",
                "Strengths: Prof Manning and Joe Morgan as TA are a killer duo. Both are absolutely brilliant, kind lecturers. Go to office hours and engage with them on the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The absolute biggest weakness of this course is the fact that it is not taught as a seminar. That sounds minor, but I cant emphasize to you how much I feel that the course format hindered my learning in this class. Its difficult to explain, but the material in the lecture was basically designed for a smaller seminar type course or to be discussed in sections. The only problem is that this course is a huge lecture and has no sections, so the material was incredibly abstract and difficult to engage with.",
                "The course covers a great deal of interesting topics, but it could be organized in a way that improves engagement.",
                "The strength of the course to some extent is the material, if you enjoy history then you'll enjoy taking the course and learning more about it. The weakness was that at times the level of engagement with the course was low for most students as it felt like you didn't need to follow along, and could just do the readings before each paper and get a decent grade.",
                "The course covered very unique content which was very interesting",
                "Professor Manning's lectures are engaging and interesting. The readings are generally rather doable each week, and the majority of them are quite interesting. There is not a great workload in this course, but you are still able to take out a great deal if you put in the necessary time. The professor and teaching fellow are also major strengths. Both of them were always available to meet to discuss readings, lectures, and essays and offered great insights and advice.",
                "more engaging",
                "I really liked lecture and the professor was great, however didn't receive as much feedback on my papers as I would have liked.",
                "The course should be made less repetitive and the lectures should be far more focused on an individual point. Professor Manning is clearly an expert, but he tends to ramble in lecture and finds it difficult to actually deliver important learning points to the class. There were almost 100 students taking this course, but it is a damning indictment of the class that only 25 or so would regularly come to lecture. The grading is also very harsh, so be warned - this is in no way a gut. Professor Manning will take off a lot of marks on papers for the most simple mistakes in formatting or bibliographies. The readings are also not always explained well and seem somewhat arbitrary. I find it hard to think of a strength, but I suppose that, if you can keep on top of all the information, you do learn a lot about the ancient mindset, which is intriguing.",

                "I think that the course material has the potential to be very interesting. However, rather than focusing on different characteristics of the ancient economy around the world, we focused more on the definition of the ancient economy, which at times felt repetitive.",
                "Very poor organization. No clear syllabus posted with helpful information. Slides and class resources were not aesthetically sound nor engaging with the class. But the workload and the nature of the assignments were helpful in synthesizing what I was learning in class.",

                "Strengths: Offers various approaches and sources that students can use to study economics. \r\nWeaknesses: requires some moderate knowledge of ancient history, so students unfamiliar with it may find some difficulty. Some readings were quite confusing too.",
                "Strengths: Manning is an excellent professor whose passion for the topic really shines through and makes lectures more interesting. The guest lecturers are also a fun breath of different air, and I thought they added a fair amount of new perspectives to the class. The class is also not especially demanding, which makes it a relatively easy, fun ride and therefore a better course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the essay-only assessment style is difficult with a course as large as it was this past year (roughly 80-100?). I would have preferred some exams to break up the writing monotony, and feel like it was hard to get very detailed feedback from the professor - which is only to be expected when he is grading so many pages. I also think the endless focus on the historiography, and a lack of providing background on the ancient societies themselves, really holds the course back. While the class has no prerequisites, it is really hard to look at the intellectual history of a topic without knowing any of the actual history yourself! I know this made me uncomfortable as a writer and student trying to do the essays, and wish the class did some quick priming lessons on the absolute basics of Rome, Greece, Egypt economies and THEN went into the historiography of it all.",
                "This course was very interesting and the assignments were well spaced out.",
                "The course lacks direction mostly. There isnt really an organization to be seen; the professor just comes in and talks about something related to the topic. I also felt there was too much emphasis on the historians without delving into the history itself its like a physics class that talks more about Newton than Newtons laws",
                "Lectures are good, Professor Manning is a very interesting person, his office hours are very helpful",
                "I think it is a really interesting class but it doesnt quite match the course description - it was a lot more just a discussion of how to analyze the ancient economy than a class on what happened in the ancient economy.",
                "Strengths: professor is a great lecturer \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class is not well organized and there is barely any feedback on assignments",
                "The strength was the free flow of lecture and the instructor. The content is also very interesting.",

                "Good lectures",
                "Overall, the course was well structured but the lectures were not well designed and did not align with the readings for the most part. Additionally, the final paper was assigned a week before the reading period which made things stressful."

That type of person will be highly disappointed in the material which is entirely focused on discussing the historiography behind ancient economies.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are interested in discussing the theory on how to approach ancient economies, without actually studying ancient economies, then you will enjoy this course. If you are unsure of what this means, I recommend reading some works by Moses Finley, Karl Polanyi, etc and seeing if you enjoy it  because the entirety of the class is spent discussing those two guys.",

Essays are graded fairly, and you are given ample time to complete them. Professor Manning and Joe Morgan are also two of the best instructors at Yale which elevates this course.

The material is uninteresting, the readings difficult to understand (but you still have to do them to write your papers), the grading unsympathetic, and the feedback unstructured.

Also, frankly, if you don't find the topic interesting, I would imagine this course would be just a complete slog.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you do find this topic interesting, the course would be fantastic.
