                "This course was very fun. We studied Japanese through various types of media- mainly written short stories but also Japanese television programs, videos and other audio/visual content. We spent a lot of time talking with other students in class, so I was able to practice my spoken Japanese a lot. Outside/before class there was a lot of homework to be done- it wasn't difficult for the most part, but it was just a lot of writing/grammar practice. Occasionally we also had short essay assignments. I really appreciated all these aspects of the class, because I felt like I was able to practice new grammar fairly efficiently.",
                "I definitely improved my Japanese skills and my knowledge on Japanese history and culture. Learning new topics through Japanese is a great way to improve your vocabularly. If you want to hone your skills on dynamic ways to use Japanese, this is a pretty strong class."

                "The strengths of the course is that we were able to have a lot of conversation practice in class, and that we learned a lot of grammar, read a lot, and engaged with various types of Japanese media(movies, videos, conversation audio).  \r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is really dependent on the student, but I would say it's kanji and vocab memorization. I liked that we didn't have in class kanji quizzes, or vocab quizzes, but I think that as a result it's easy to neglect practicing and memorizing them. I would recommend students study and review kanji and vocab steadily throughout the semester, or the midterm and final writing sections will be difficult. \r\n\r\nIn general, a lot of the work of learning new Japanese will be practicing and reviewing outside of what is expected in class/ for homework, so I think you have to be willing to do that to see exceptional improvement in your Japanese- especially in your writing."

                "Yes! It's a great class, and the Japanese department at Yale is filled with wonderful teachers. If you're considering taking this class, and have placed into it, you shouldn't be worried that the material will be too difficult to engage with. There will definitely be difficult concepts and readings, but you will be able to practice and improve your Japanese a lot.",
                "Yes. The course definitely offered me the continuous exposure to Japanese, which was crucial for me to sustain my language skills. The class wasn't too demanding, and I was able to manage my own pace depending on whether I have an easy or hard week with my other commitments. But whenever I put in more effort, the course material offered me room to improve, and Nishimura sensei was there to help me. Besides, Nishimura sensei conducted a really fun class. We laughed a lot and learned a lot."
