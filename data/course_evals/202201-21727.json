                "Strengths: this is a really good introduction to how to use R for linguistic research. I feel like I got a pretty good sense of how to analyze data using statistical tests, which (I hope) will prove useful when I do more linguistics research in the future. Weaknesses: this class really needs to have pre-recs. I had literally zero stats background when I took this course, and I died. I had no idea what I was doing with most of the p-sets. Sure, I could pretty easily figure out what commands to use to create a given model, but on questions where I was asked to analyze what the model was saying, I just felt like I was writing randomness. I think this could've been avoided had I taken any stats prior to this course. Also I was the only first-year in the class, so I didn't feel all that comfortable asking the upperclassmen for help. Luckily, Professor Sanker is very friendly and quite willing to answer questionsI scheduled meetings with her on multiple occasions to go over problems. That said, I didn't really like her lectures all that much. It often felt like she was just reading off the slides, and I kind of think the course could've benefited from a more Socratic-seminar-discussion-situation. I feel like that would've improved my own comprehension of the material, because trying to absorb the descriptions of statistical tests just made my eyes cross. Although that may have been more of a function of my lack of experience with stats than anything else. Lastly, I think there could've been more assistance on the final project, which involved creating your own linguistic research project and analyzing it in R. Having been introduced to regression and mixed-effects models only a month prior, I had next to no idea how to construct a research paper outlining a project of this sort.",
                "the in class exercises help you learn the content of the class without needing to review everything afterwards (as happens with many data analysis courses)",
                "Strength: Expectations are very clear and you learn specific skills to analyze linguistic data.\r\nWeakness: The instruction can be a bit dry for people who don't have linguistic background."

                "Take this course if: you like linguistics; you've taken a linguistics class before (this may not be necessary, but I found it quite helpful); you understand basic stats; and you're not afraid of math. Definitely don't bother otherwise. I found it waaaaay more challenging than it rightly should've been, and I very much think that that clouded my enjoyment of it. With any prior stats experience, I think I would've felt a lot more comfortable with the material.",
                "Not particularly challenging; not a substantial dive into linguistics, more of a YDatao-style course with linguistics theme. Somewhat tedious psets",
