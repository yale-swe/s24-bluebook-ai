                "Strengths: lots of individual time with the prof and teaching fellow to discuss your work. You really get to flesh out the storytelling\/conceptual goals of each project.  Weakness: I don't think my technical abilities improved at all during this course, the things we were prompted to think about had a lot more to do with conceptual derivations. Most of the class is not comprised of serious art majors, but I believe it could stand to benefit from a basic introduction to the principles of drawing.",
                "There was less formal drawing practice and teaching than I would have liked. Did not teach perspective.",
                "strengths: engaging, interesting\r\nweaknesses: requires lots of time and could do with more guidance",
                "it was a good course but i would add another drawing assignemnt to the course - it did not seem like enough",
                "There weren't too many assignments, which was perfect. I was able to commit time into my work to create something I was satisfied with. The freedom with the final project was also very nice. I had a great time working on the final project knowing that I had free rein over my approaches and final outcome.",
                "The main strength is how much fun it is to have a chance to draw and make art for a class. The assignments are interesting and have a lot of room for personalization. I think the only weakness is the virtual format, which is necessitated by the pandemic. But it honestly was not that bad -- there was still a vibe of collaboration even though we were never in the same room.",
                "Strength - attentive nature of prof & TA, really wanted to make sure every individual in the class was improving and succeeding\r\n\r\nWeakness - the crits felt pretty long over zoom, and I can think they are much more bearable in person. Also they rarely stuck to the time allotted for each student and often strung the conversation out longer than I felt it need to.",
                "More concrete feedback would be helpful. Otherwise, great class!",
                "The class was really special and especially because we had a phenomenal group of people who were engaged with the material and excited to contribute to each other's pieces. I thought this class did a really good job of turning an in-person studio into a virtual classroom. The only part I found kind of difficult was our method of sharing our work with each other. Although this has a lot to do with simply being virtual, I wonder if there's some other way to be able to see people's work easier while in progress, like scanning regardless of what stage we're in, or doing more virtual art.",
                "More class\/guidance! I loved this course so much. I wish that we were able to recieve more assignments or ways to continue drawing beyond the actual course. The assignment prompts force you to work on certain techniques that otherwise you may ignore. I wish I could continue that beyond the scope of the class.",

I also really appreciated the option to get supplies through the class (either by pickup on campus or through shipping for remote students). I already purchased supplies before the class art kits were bought, so I was able to receive a reimbursement.",
                "Showing art work through zoom worked best through screen share instead of occasionally holding up work to camera.",
                "I think the method of critiques where everyone took pictures of their work and screenshared it during their turn worked as well as it could for a virtual class. Not being in a physical studio is a drawback, but I think the format used in this class is just about as good as it could be without a real physical space.",
                "Since this was an art class I feel like there were more challenges because of the pandemic, but overall the class flowed as smoothly as it could. People would share images of their artwork and then the class would talk about the work over Zoom. Given the constraints of being at home, some assignments had to be changed from their original forms, like the self-portraits we did at home in lieu of a shared model in an art class. However, Professor Keegan encouraged us to use our limitation to our benefit, and our final projects were more diverse than what would have happened in a normal setting.",

If you've never taken an art class before and want to try something new, I would definitely recommend this course.",
