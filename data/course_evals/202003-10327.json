                "This was a great class and Marijeta put a lot of thought into crafting it to be engaging in an online setting. I really enjoyed her lecture style. I also appreciated that she mixed it up by bringing in guest speakers and encouraging students to speak in lectures. The reading was engaging and the assignments were creative. I liked that she didn't make us write cut and dry essays for every assignment, but instead played with the parameters of the internet and encouraged us to go out and explore.",
                "Great course, great instructors. No suggestions here",
                "The organization of this course is great in my opinion, spanning from history to networks to practices I feel that I have gained a very well rounded understanding of the topic. The professor and teaching fellows are incredible lecturers and instructors and have elevated the subject beyond the texts and their engagement with the students kept the course evolving.",
                "Strengths: has a lot of opportunities for student input and change in direction based on student interests\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of student-to-student back-and-forth interaction because of the online nature of the course",
                "Strengths, the course was very low workload. Only two writing assignments and the final paper. All of the assignments were really interesting and didn't feel like work. The topics we discuss in class are very current and intriguing. Weaknesses, a lot of the readings are dense but you can make do by skimming through them.",
                "Profoundly interesting ideas and concepts were brought up in the readings and developed further in the discussion sections, and the teaching staff made efforts to mention current events related to our readings to keep the material fresh and relevant. Some readings could have been left out, and sometimes the class was too ambitious in covering many sorts of topics.",

                "This was definitely the best class I had in a virtual setting. The 50 minute lectures twice a week were a good call - much better than 1h15 or 2 hours like other professors. Marijeta was also understanding and empathetic to the unique challenges students may be facing during this time. The professor also made some lectures specifically about this moment in time, which I appreciated, since we can't pretend this is a normal semester.",
                "The use of Zoom, its break out rooms and its chat was very successful as the professor and students were very engaging. The use of slack was extremely successful since the students, professor and teaching fellows could keep in contact very fluidly and continue to share resources and information beyond the class.",
                "The use of a slack channel to facilitate announcements, sharing of information\/pictures\/articles, and sharing of writing process and general thoughts allowed the class to feel active. It was super interesting and felt \"meta\" to use online means to talk about online cultures.",
                "Literally the perfect course to be taught and to take during the pandemic",
                "Virtual lectures were recorded to accommodate for asynchronous learners, and teaching staff were understanding of students' situations, especially given that this is a course related to the Internet. Lectures were sometimes a bit dull, especially over Zoom, since the professor just presented with PowerPoint slides."

                "Yes, definitely. It's one of the top classes I'd recommend anybody, regardless of major, take at Yale, and is particularly apt for COVID times. I'm so glad I took it this semester.",
                "This class is well-structured, engaging, and can easily be added into any course schedule. If you enjoy Black Mirror, take this class. If you enjoy surfing the internet, take this class. If you enjoy memes, take this class. The writing assignments were fun to complete and featured a lot of creativity. The final paper was 10 pages, so budget time appropriately, but you get to select the topic (and you can substitute in a project of your choosing in lieu of writing it). The weekly workload consists of giving one\/two paragraph responses to some very engaging texts. This course covers the unbelievable impact of the digital revolution in our 21st century lives and there is something of interest for everyone.",
                "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. As I mentioned before, the course itself is rich with knowledge and teaches you not only of that knowledge but how to analyze well and be critical.",
                "Yes, it was a simple and straightforward enough course. The professor and TF's were kind and the subjects were interesting.",
                "Yes, yes, yes! It is the most thought-provoking and intriguing class I've taken at Yale so far that makes you question the (online) world around you. It also helps you better understand how the history of tech & the internet interacted with the shift towards tech dependency during the COVID-19 pandemic and give you base knowledge and skills to analyze the changing world around you.",

                "Yes!",
