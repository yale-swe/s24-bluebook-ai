                "The course is strongest when it sticks to its guiding questions: To whom or what are we responsible for living our lives a certain way? What is a human being and what is their place in the world? What does it mean for life: to feel good? (And does it matter? Might the life worth living be miserable?) to go well? What is important in terms of lifes circumstances? to be led well? What do we need to do in order to lead a life worth living? What is the role of suffering in a good life? How should we respond to the suffering we experience, and others experience? What should we do when we fail to live a good life? \r\n\r\nThe mere act of being asked these questions was enough to spark introspection and deep thought about myself. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses came from parts of the syllabus. It felt incoherent to me for the course to cover traditions in a diversity of depths. For example, taking the deep dive into Christianity (naturally, because my TF was a Christian theologist) made the following week's \"Indigenous Nature Traditions\" feel even more shallow.",
                "I think that instead of just reading long papers and primary sources to understand the traditions, maybe we could have some pre-recorded classes about the fundamentals of each tradition to watch before class. In class, we could do a deep dive into the traditions and discuss what is a life worth living according to their views, and think about how that could be translated into our own life.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course. While parts of the syllabus are genuinely hit or miss, the essence of the course (the questions: To whom or what are we responsible for living our lives a certain way? What is a human being and what is their place in the world? What does it mean for life: to feel good? (And does it matter? Might the life worth living be miserable?) to go well? What is important in terms of lifes circumstances? to be led well? What do we need to do in order to lead a life worth living? What is the role of suffering in a good life? How should we respond to the suffering we experience, and others experience? What should we do when we fail to live a good life?) are enough to spark a newfound interest in looking within.\r\n\r\nThe three essays build upon each other and by the end of the semester, you are somewhat ready to tackle the big \"What is your life worth living?\" question. I recommend this course to anyone that wants to be more introspective and study themselves but have never been given the time to do so. This class was my opportunity to do so. I especially recommend taking the class with Justin Hawkins, if possible. He made the experience amazing.",
                "Yes",
                "TL;DR: If you want a mediocre class with interesting classmates and a shitty grad student on a power trip posing as a professor, take Life Worth Living but if you actually want to learn something and conceive a life outlook, this is not the class for you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy entire time at Yale I have found something to value and learn from each of my professors. Unfortunately, that was not the case for Justin Hawkins. A chronically late, barely does the readings professor who added little to discussion and detracted from interesting input from students. \r\n\r\nThe consistency of the class was nonexistent. Some days we would focus heavily on the readings, some we would focus on pre-made discussion questions and some we would all complain about how useless and boring the class was. Exactly none of the classes were devoted to thinking about how to live a meaningful life for yourself or how to construct a life worth living WHICH WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE CLASS. The lack of consistency made it hard to prepare and made the class feel discontinuous. I wish he stuck to one class format the entire semester. \r\n\r\nIn addition to managing class time poorly, he did a horrible job mediating discussion. He often let one person run on forever and never brought in new voices.  A few students I only heard speak once or twice during the semester. Some students consistently took the conversation away from the questions or readings and he made no effort to redirect the class. \r\n\r\nThe comments he added to discussion were heavily impacted by his own life outlook and not related to the readings or discussion questions. He seemed more concerned with how Christianity related to each of the traditions instead of just viewing the traditions independently. This was not a comparative religions class but he definitely made it feel like it was. \r\n\r\nMoreover, I was disappointed with his lack of knowledge of all of the visions of a life worth living (except for Christianity) and narrow minded approach to discussions on the readings. When asked questions about indigenous ecological visions, Buddhism, or even the secular author Hgglund, he stumbled and said he wasnt an expert. It was so clear he didnt do the readings it was embarrassing. \r\n\r\nHis essay comments were insightful on how to write a good essay (structure, thesis, examples etc). Unfortuantely, his comments about essay content in no way related to the paper descriptions or questions. He seemed obsessed with coming up with counter examples to the papers when most of them were  <1000 words. \r\n\r\nThe whole point of this class was to come up with your own vision of a life worth living, not determine some ultimate vision. Every vision we looked at contained elements of hypocrisy or points to criticize, but he couldnt accept that those existing in our own visions. \r\n\r\nHe reliably misinterpreted readings and presented arguments with no real basis. While he was open to responses and challenges from students, I feel he is under qualified for his current position. I really dreaded coming to each seminar with him and know it would have been better run by a compassionate undergrad. \r\n\r\nIf you want a mediocre class with interesting classmates and a shitty grad student on a power trip posing as a professor, take Life Worth Living but if you actually want to learn something and conceive a life outlook, this is not the class for you. \r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me directly for any more information.",
                "For sure if you want to have good discussion",
                "I would recommend this course as it really gets you to think about many different faiths/approaches towards life. This would then get you to think about your own life and reflect on it. Very interesting and great food for thought."
