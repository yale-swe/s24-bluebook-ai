    "One of my favorite classes of the semester. Was exposed to economic thinking from all sorts of places that I would not have encountered in other econ classes. I have a more nuanced view on, as the class title says, Market Liberalism, Socialism, and Development. Truly one of the classes I looked forward to.",
    "Understanding of development economics across time",
    "I gained a broader, more comprehensive view of all aspects of development.",
    "A pretty deep understanding of the tension between capitalism and socialism pre-dating Smith and Marx, as well as a more nuanced understanding of the way the topics interact, rather than just as isolated phenomena.",
    "This class provides an overview of the history of development theory.",
    "History of development economics, various theories and applications of development economics",
    "I learned some of the main fads in development and how they came about, and how to analyze their effectivensss.",
    "This course provides a historical and contemporary look into development theory and debates in economic planning. We covered major socialist planning projects including the Soviet Union, as well as major schools of economic thought and development. We read both historical accounts of economic histories and white papers analyzing various development projects. You will come away with an understanding of the history of development planning and how socialist versus capitalist frameworks play a role in development projects.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of international development politics, the progression and constraints of socialism, and political thinkers who theorized on the relationship between the government and economics. The course helped me be able to parse through economic theory and be able to point out limitations and biases within the material, especially in terms of what exceptions to the theory that the writer would ignore.",
    "An interesting and relaticely chill introduction to political economy, with attention given to socialism as much as liberal capitalism",
    "We learned about theories of socialism and capitalism, particularly as they pertain to development. Each week centered around a different economist, and we really went into the weeds of different development theories and metrics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great readings, and never too long that I wouldnt do them. Brilliant for Prof Nattrass to assign her notes with quotes for us to read, made the content so much more approachable. People in the class were generally engaged and always enjoyed hearing peoples opinions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have loved to talk about Amartya Sen, who was on the syllabus but we never got to. I also think the class might be better if everyone was fully engaged, some people rarely spoke or were on their laptops most class.",
    "Strengths -- Professor Nattrass is an incredible teacher, and she really kept the class exciting and interesting.\r\nWeaknesses -- I would have liked more continuity between weeks. Sometimes felt as though we were jumping around a lot.",
    "The course is really great in terms of how well it manages to cover each topic, considering how many topics it covers. I would ask for more emphasis on the events that perhaps defined both phenomena and less from Ricardo and Malthus.",
    "I felt that this course was overall very good and well-designed for student learning. One way I think it could be improved is by allocating more time for student discussion rather than relying more on Professor Nattrass recapping some of the readings and presenting the information in a lecture format. Because it is a seminar, there were certain times when we would enter into debates during discussion at the end of class but would not have enough time to go deeper into the subject and would have to cut conversations short. Allocating more time for discussion would be a great way to improve this class.",
    "The course is strong in that it is so interdisciplinary, and that Prof. Nattrass is such a great Professor. However, I think it could be greatly improved with changes to the assignments. We wrote 6 1000 word essays on very broad topics, and did not have a final paper. I think it would be better to have a shorter weekly response (400 words or less) to make sure people are doing the reading, and then have more intentional assignments where we can delve into the material. I also think being graded on participation would help with this.",
    "I think sometimes we didnt have an opportunity to discuss all the readings and topics in depth. I enjoyed the structure of the course otherwise",
    "The course material is fascinating and unique at Yale, and Professor Nattrass is incredibly knowledgeable. The readings for the course were well curated and Professor Nattrass' prepared notes for the course were extremely helpful at synthesizing the major texts. Class discussions were lively, and we frequently connected the economic debates we read about to modern movements on Yale's campus and beyond. I would've liked to discuss colonialism and how it played into these movements more, particularly examples of socialist decolonization in Africa. I also felt that I did not come away with a cohesive understanding of how the three themes of the course related to one another.",
    "Professor Nattrass is an incredibly adept and knowledgeable teacher, and I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class with her. Her strengths include her extensive background in the subject, having worked on post-Apartheid economics herself, and her general encouragement within the class to share thoughts and ideas. I found her incredibly approachable. The weaknesses of this class surround the fact that frankly, Prof. Nattrass almost went too easy on us. Because of this, kids eventually began to prioritize the class less as the semester went on.",
    "This course was fun, and Prof. Nattrass' notes really helped ground the theoretical work in understandable language. The frequent essays were always reasonable and reasonably graded, but I think they sometimes didn't leave enough room for our own comments and critiques, instead asking us to regurgitate information. One thing that would have helped is a clearer rubric that describes the grading rubric\/breakdown. All in all, though, the class was engaging, and I felt like I got a lot out of it. The lecture section of the course was definitely stronger than the second half of each class, which was more class discussion, and which often felt like people trying to get in their hot takes about the world."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! If Prof. Nattrass comes back to Yale for sure, I want to take more with her!",
    "Yes, I think I got a comprehensive understanding of different traditions of development economics throughout time. Professor Nattrass is excellent, and I loved hearing about her experiences as a practitioner in the field. The essay topics always left room for creativity and her feedback was consistently fair and very helpful.",
    "Absolutely! If you have a chance to take any class with Professor Nattrass, I would jump on the opportunity.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is incredibly well taught by a professor who has substantial experience in both academia and real world politics. The course title shouldn't put off students who consider themselves \"fiscally conservative\" as the course puts as much emphasis on the market side of the curriculum and helps one understand the connected existence of both phenomena beyond political parties that consider themselves \"socialist\" and considers the phenomena within modern society.",
    "Its a pretty straightforward class: the whole of the grade is comprised of six essays, written every other week.",
    "Yes! This class is great for anyone interested in development economics, politics (especially outside of the U.S.) and socialism.",
    "Yes--very well curated reading list, and Professor Nattrass is extremely good and genuinely interested in hearing student thoughts and opinions",
    "If you are really interested and want to do the readings, yes. But beware  you may get bogged down by EP&E section you know whats.",
    "Yes! This is a rare opportunity to rigorously examine socialism and capitalism using economic, sociological, and historical methods. Professor Nattrass has a wealth of knowledge on the subject and you will come away with an understanding of why so many development projects have failed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Nattrass is a gem of a visiting professor, and I found almost every single reading to be incredibly interesting and worthwhile. Definitely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, Nattrass is an incredible professor.",
    "Yes, though if you're not an EP&E\/PoliSci major there's a bit of a learning curve in navigating discussions",
    "Yes! Not too much work, but intellectually rewarding, this class is for students who want to really understand development economics and contemporary controversies within the field. I would just advise you to keep your essays simple -- longer, more drawn-out arguments are helpful for thinking critically, but you simply won't have the word count necessary to fully flesh out each idea."
