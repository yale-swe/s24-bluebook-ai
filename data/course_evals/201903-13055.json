    "This course did a great job of exposing me to a breadth of media theory. I feel like the course was so wide reaching that I know now the basic thought schools of media theory and the main philosophers, but don't particularly know that much about each text.",
    "I learned more about the subconscious. Many of the readings were very confusing and the explanations in class didn't really offer much more clarity.",
    "Learned how to think about inner and outer connection with the world. learned how to define media and write critically",
    "how media is defined in the past and real world.",
    "How media shapes and influences our behavior",
    "Maybe some philosophical notions on the conceptions and effects of media and technology. I guess the way I understand our relationship to media is much deeper than before.",
    "I learned a lot of media (in all its forms) and read a lot of interesting philosophical works. I also learned a good amount about film theory as it relates to media theory.",
    "You learn a lot about memory, technology, and other things you really never would've thought of before",
    "An introduction of media theory",
    "Overview of media theory from many perspectives - but really mostly from a philosophical perspective.",
    "None really. We just read random books and papers on technology and media.",
    "This class taught me to think about media in a different and exhaustive way through historical texts to modern technology.",
    "I learned about the concept of media and how we interact with it. The course tackled some really hard topics, and I think it was hard to get to them all in depth, so I dont know how well it all wrapped up, but the concepts were very interesting to think about.",
    "Learned about media, as in medium. Definitely a philosophy class.",
    "I learned about concepts in Media, and how different types of media (film, text, art), intersected to form effective or ineffective communication. It also provided insight into the study of media theory.",
    "We learned a lot about Media Theory and the concepts of externalization and internalization that I had not yet had an opportunity to learn about.",
    "A different view on media.",
    "Learned about media and how it interacts with the rest of the world.",
    "It teaches you how to think about certain things in our common lives from different perspectives, which I think was super helpful.",
    "Media",
    "The monstrous concept of media, broken down in the myriad of ways it possibly could be. Looked at through the lens of philosophy, history, literature, film, and more.",
    "I learned lots about media that I didn't know before, like the role memory, tools, etc. play.",
    "How to read and respond to writings in media theory, an overview of significant debates in history of media (e.g. being in the world, cybernetics, cyborgs, memory and technology, film and cinema, etc.).",
    "Learned about theories, various philosophers, and concepts related to media and film theory.",
    "By taking this course, I developed my knowledge of the complex definition of \"media,\" and its impressive impact on society throughout history and today. By analyzing different forms of media technologies and their effects on memory, communication, and interactions, I now have a greater appreciation for media, as well as a greater respect for its power over humanity.",
    "This course redefined my perception of media in unpredictable ways. It forced us to face many of the uncomfortable truths in everyday life. The concepts we learned in the class questioned and challenged the system that we live in. Being aware of this can help us be more cautious of the way we allow media to influence us and thus live life more deliberately.",
    "This course focused on finding the definition of media through many platforms and points of view. Analyzing multiple materials, we discussed memory as writing and reproduction and the mind, the words as a form of memory and expression, and computers as a computational machine that allows for communication and new systems to form.",
    "This course is whack, but its really not that hard. It just throws a bunch of random philosophical ideas at you about media and you can do whatever you want with it. Theres a few nuggets that you can take away about dolphins, sleep deprivation tanks, and Hollywood and laugh about the randomness with your friends.",
    "We learned about Memory&Tools, Word& Image, and machine&system. \r\nThis course is a decent intro philosophy course.",
    "Learned about the values in technology and media.",
    "I learned to look at different forms of media in new ways.",
    "Knowledge about the role of media",
    "The only real thing I gained in this course were how to discuss and debate philosophy. That was only during section as well.",
    "I learnt how to take a philosophical and different perspective of media and to think more critically about different technologies. I also improved my writing through this course.",
    "Understanding the relationship to the human mind of media",
    "Lots of good readings and interesting material about different types of media and their relevance in our everyday lives",
    "How to piece through complex readings and apply them to our wider set of material. Also, understanding these prevalent philosophers is valuable skill.",
    "I gained a broad survey of media texts and philosophy over time.",
    "A much better understanding of media studies. A good philosophical foundation of what is a medium.",
    "I learned about various schools of film and media and got exposed to a lot of very interesting writers.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot about what media studies is and how it's related to different fields. I feel like this is the most important course I've taken at Yale thus far because it intersects with all my other courses--I think about it all the time and how it applies to other things I've studied. The readings also introduced me to totally new concepts, but more importantly, Prof. Williams and my fantastic TA, Lizzie, made those concepts approachable to me."

   "question_id": "YC403-YCWR",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course might be too expansive and spend too little time diving into the texts read. But its very interesting!",
    "Some of the readings should have been cut (Heidegger) because they weren't necessarily introduction level material. I think that the lectures on the readings should have focused solely on the readings. Supplemental information was only helpful at some times, but it became the primary focus of the lectures.",
    "strengths are TA engagement. no weaknesses",
    "The class is boring and has no real substance.",
    "Strengths: well structured, clear syllabus, interesting and diverse readings\r\nWeaknesses: readings were sometimes too vague, especially since there were no guiding questions",
    "Strengths: The lectures are short and interesting, and Professor Williams was always discussing something interesting and out of the box in class. I read pieces that I never thought I would read before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The amount of readings felt very disproportionate to the laid back atmosphere of the class. Sometimes we would be assigned 50-100 pages of extremely dense, convoluted philosophical writing when in actuality we were expected to know a main idea or two from that reading. In the end I just stopped doing them because it got to be too much.",
    "Strengths: the lectures are super interesting, and you get a lot out of the course relative to the workload",
    "Lectures are interesting but they're kind of drawn-out sometimes",
    "Strengths: lectures go by super quickly and are actually quite fun and interesting, the material is very diverse, the expectations are clear and attainable, the workload is manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a big lecture so you really don't get to interact in lecture - you do get to interact in section but only with your TA and not with the professor, the class was a bit too philosophical, the class spent too much time on old philosophers - I would have preferred to have a more contemporary overview of media",
    "This course does not have a lot of work. You just need to read some stuff. That's good. Your grade depends on two essays and two tests. \r\nClass was a little boring every once in a while.",
    "I think this class has the potential to be really great. There is a lot of interesting material, but parts of the curriculum can run dry.",
    "I think that this class would be better off as a section rather than a lecture.",
    "The class was good, I honestly really enjoyed the lectures because they were kind of like somebody who did a reading and wanted to turn it into a conspiracy theory youtube video.",
    "The strengths of the course includes how interesting and topical the material is -- often the course covered on topics of media propaganda, how information that we perceive influences our behavior, emotions, and memory, and how philosophy of all periods thought about the topic. One of the most exciting aspects of the course was how broad the material was, and how it touches every aspect of our lives. One of the weaknesses of the course was how the material worked together -- sometimes it was difficult to see a broader narrative in the selection of course materials, and one week would differ in material drastically than the other. This made it difficult to follow (although the material itself stayed interesting).",
    "Can't say there were any major weakness. Great teacher and very interesting material.",
    "Extremely well taught - Prof Williams is an absolute gem and guides you through the syllabus extremely well. He's the kind of professor who makes you passionate about a subject you never knew you would love.\r\nA lot of fun - many quirky pop culture and literature movements are incorporated into the course that are both educative and a good laugh.\r\nWork is very manageable - 2 weekly readings which tend to be quite short but are always well chosen and provided essential insights into the themes of the course. If you go to every lecture, the midterms should be no problem.\r\nCourse content is fascinating and relevant - media studies revealed itself to be an absolutely essential subject. There were several \"mind blown\" moments in every lecture (often at the end, so you leave questioning your reality). \r\nThere's something for everyone - you really cover the history of media studies, and you'll look at philosophers, film theorists, artists, mathematicians, archaeologists, dolphins, and Keanu Reeves, among others. It's all made very accessible, no matter what subjects you're interested in.\r\nIt's also a writing credit - there were two five-page essays to fulfil the WR, and the topics were able to be interpreted in many ways and were generously marked. \r\nTAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Strenghts: Classes are very laid-back and interesting. I would go to this class to unwind from other classes. Readings were interesting but some of the, a bit long. Moreover the professor would post his lecture slides on Canvas which was great. You do not need to take notes and can just engage in the class.\r\nWeaknesses: At times it was hard to see how the new concept the professor mentioned, is related to media.",
    "pretty chill class. only 2 lectures a week with a section that required no work. Writing credit which is great because only two essays. Can't complain.",
    "More clarifications pertaining to the readings should be carried out on the professor's part in order to improve the engagement level in the class. Rather than reading full passages during lecture, the key points of the readings should be explained in the professor's own words and each reading should be connected to the broader theme of media that it pertains to.",
    "Right off the bat it started off super theoretical, so it was tough coming from a non-philosophical or psychological background to have to think about things from those perspectives immediately.",
    "Media",
    "Strengths: Professor Williams really created an exciting course, organized in a really cool way. I felt that things connected well across the course, and as difficult as some of the concepts were, I did in fact come to understand them. A truly multi-faceted course, but beautifully orchestrated.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Spent a lot of time on some tough texts made for a few frustrating days. I wish that these texts weren't drawn out as much In my opinion, it would have probably been better to focus on smaller portions of it instead, and summarize points from the other sections that were not close-read. This could have helped maintain class engagement on those days.",
    "Strengths of the course are that some of the content was very interesting. Weaknesses are that with a lot of the content, I struggled to see a connection back to media. It felt like we learned a lot, but it wasn't very linear as to how it pertained to learning about media. Also, lots of the readings were confusing.",
    "this class was very good and well structured, but maybe could've gotten more feedback on grades earlier.",
    "Strengths - pretty engaging, definitely interesting, all material (readings, slides) are provided on canvas, easy to communicate with professor and TFs for assistance \r\nWeaknesses - lots of assigned reading weekly, sometimes difficult to keep up with",
    "Two of the greatest strengths of the course include the discussion section that led to indescribably insightful conversations as well as the course's unexpected approach to media. \r\n\r\nTwo weaknesses of the course include the sheer amount of reading that is required each week as well as the amount of topics that are covered. Because this is an intro-level class, we couldn't get very deep into any one specific topic (which makes sense). Instead, it provides a more general overview of different topics in media.",
    "This class is amazing, everything about it. The lectures, sections, exams, papers, everything.",
    "Lectures were always engaging as well as the reading materials. The assignments were always fun to write and think about especially with the help of my TF.",
    "Its just so random. Professor Williams was great.",
    "Sometimes it felt as if the course material was connected by very loose strings. Some of the readings seemed unrelated to the course. This course was a writing credit, but we didnt spend much time talking about writing techniques.",
    "Understanding the material because it was hard",
    "The course can be surprisingly abstract and sometimes its hard to know what you were supposed to learn from a lecture. However, it is very interesting and is often similar to a philosophy class.",
    "Great course. The second half was a bit abstract and hard to understand the relevance.",
    "Strengths: Interesting course layout. The content wraps back to the start of the class very nicely. \r\nWeaknesses: Way too many readings and there should be absolutely no exams (at least like we had). The exams are memory based and have nothing to do with our learning this semester.",
    "Strengths of the course are the use of different media analyzed was very interesting and the lectures were always engaging. Some weaknesses of the course are that sometimes the connections between lectures was confusing.",
    "The readings sometimes were too undirected, it would be more helpful if we had a guide of things to look for",
    "The lectures were interesting but readings could be heavy and lecture slides werent always helpful when studying",
    "Strengths: it does a great job of taking things slow and not rushing so that the students can really understand the material. In addition,  the movie clips and pop culture references keep the whole lecture engaged and make it really enjoyable.",
    "I think the syllabus was a bit discombobulated. There was no overarching hypothesis that tied the course together, no progression that made the students feel invested.",
    "I think the readings for the class are great and are paced really well. I loved that because I was able to really understand what we were supposed to read and never felt like it was too much to handle. This is really different than a lot of lecture classes I've had, which feel like they pile on the reading to introduce as much as possible to you. However, in this class, I feel like I could actually refer to the writers in conversation or cite them in future papers because I was given time to actually understand and discuss their writing. This is the most educated I've felt after finishing a Yale course."

   "comments": [
    "Course is good both for people who just want to get an idea of media theory, as well as people that are really passionate about media theory and will be self-motivated to read and interpret the texts.",
    "no.",
    "i took it for a writing credit but it was boring.",
    "If you like dissecting and interpreting readings, this is your class. If you like more applied stuff, don't",
    "I mean if you want to major in film you have to. If you like philosophy leaning texts that solely regard media and technology then its cool. Otherwise... y would u take this? Don't do that to yourself.",
    "As a prereq for the Film major, obviously you would have to take this. I suppose the other incentive would be if you are interested in media philosophy or if you are trying to take an easy WR credit. This class would make a good fifth class (if you don't factor in the readings).",
    "Yes because it was very interesting and due to the less heavy workload I enjoyed coming to it more.",
    "Yes, it's a great WR\/HU class that'll make you think without demanding too much time",
    "For a writing credit yes. I'm not a film person so I honestly don't really know how this stacks up in terms of teaching media theory though. If you're taking this thinking you're going to learn about TVs and stuff you're going to be disappointed to find out that the texts are mainly the likes of Heidegger and Plato. Overall it was pretty interesting to learn though.",
    "This class is a great writing credit: fun, interesting, and not too hard. The writing assignments are not too long. The exams are pleasant to study for.\r\n\r\nThe main reason I liked this class is because of how different it was from any class I have taken at Yale. We were jumping around from topic to topic, watching excerpts from movies, learning the weirdest most random historical facts. For a STEM major who is used to taking boring notes during all lectures, this was a nice change of pace.",
    "The class itself makes no sense. It's like one of those \"Person is Illuminati confirmed\" videos on YouTube. The professor finds different small details in movies and articles and then connects them like someone would connect a triangle in a picture to the Illuminati. Many \"coincidence? I think not\" moments.  This is a good class for people who want to learn how to make conspiracy theories in the future. I recommend for gut not for fun. Only if you need a writing credit or its required for their major, or you are taking 5 classes and need a relatively easy one. I would not recommend the class for fun. Its pretty easy to pass the class, but its hard to get an A. You'll probably end with an A- , B+, or B if you somewhat do the work. There are two tests which are pretty easy, they are just passages that we read and you need to explain who wrote them and the significance. There are also two essays. The first one doesn't have much guidance so that's a problem but the second one is easier and you have the notes from the first paper. It is a media class in the sense of what medium is information passed through not media like news stations. But this is not a film class. More like a philosophy class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student seeking an easy fifth credit\/writing or humanities credit. The workload is pretty low (two papers, a midterm, and a final) and the material is not super difficult to grasp.",
    "Yes-pretty easy, interesting, and cool for a WR.",
    "If you are interested in a humanities or writing credit, or otherwise are interested in media theory and how different philosophies inform theory, this course is for you.",
    "Yes. The material can at time be quite abstract but it is nevertheless very interesting. Definitely expanded my academic horizons.",
    "This course should be a distributional requirement because every student at Yale needs to take it. It's that good. I was sad when it ended.",
    "Yes! The class is very chill and interesting. It does not have hard and long papers. The professor is great.",
    "Yes I would, if you need a writing credit and are even tangentially interested in this topic, just take it and try it out.",
    "No. I lacked engagement in the lectures and discussions because the reading were challenging and clarification was poor.",
    "yes",
    "Media",
    "Yes! Super fun way to look at things a very important topic in our day in age.",
    "Yes, a great gut to take. Make sure to get a lot of early advice and critques on your essay so you can get an A on them!",
    "If they wanted to learn about media, yes. But, it was kind of a confusing course where I was confused about how what I was learning connected to media a lot of the time.",
    "Would recommend if you want to learn to think about how modern day digital technologies came to be and their impact on our psychologies, learn about interesting alternate perspectives and how to improve reading \/ analytic skills.",
    "YES this class was incredible. One of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it was intellectually stimulating and insightful. This course allowed for further conversation to take place outside of the classroom by really opening our eyes to something that affects each and every one of us today - media.",
    "This class explored media in very fun, unexpected ways. It was truly an indescribable experience, so I would highly encourage other students to take this course.",
    "I would recommend everyone to take this class. Professor Williams is amazing, and the material is extremely relevant today. Not only that, but the papers are legitimately fun to write.",
    "I would recommend this course if you like the movie \"The Matrix\" this course makes you question films and ideas.",
    "Yes!! Great course",
    "I would take it only if they need a writing credit. There is only a 3 page paper and a 5 page paper. \r\n\r\nThis course is whack, but its really not that hard. It just throws a bunch of random philosophical ideas at you about media and you can do whatever you want with it. Theres a few nuggets that you can take away about dolphins, sleep deprivation tanks, and Hollywood and laugh about the randomness with your friends.\r\n\r\nIt also all depends on your TA.",
    "Yes I would. Professor Williams lectures are very accessible and engaging",
    "If you need a low workload writing class, I recommend this course. Its not easy to be engaged with this class if you are not interested in philosophy. But if you are, you will enjoy it!",
    "Yes because it was very fun and I learned a lot",
    "Yes, definitely! This class was very interesting because it is very different from any other class Ive taken, but still very interesting. You can get by without fully doing all the readings, especially if they are more difficult, because Professor Williams does a great job covering key concepts. The two exams where just like a midterm 1 and midterm 2 (not cumulative) and if you went to class, paid attention, and put in some effort to study, you do very well! Overall, great class and fair grading that rewards people for paying attention and attending class.",
    "Yea totally. Learned a lot and not too much work",
    "If they are in need of a writing credit.",
    "Yes I would since it is very interesting and encourages you to be a more critical thinker.",
    "yes! Amazing professor and very fun class",
    "If you need a writing credit this is the one. You have to write 2 short essays and take 2 exams (just ID). Low workload and a lot of room to improve your grade if you don't do well on something, even though the grading is pretty fair.",
    "Yes if you enjoy reading and applying concepts to more abstract things",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The lectures are really interesting and I feel I truly learned a lot. I am leaving the course will a new vocabulary and strong understanding of many prevalent thinkers.",
    "I would, if this student was interested in media studies and would like to pursue this study further by taking seminars down the road.",
    "Unless you're a film major or need an easy class for credit, I wouldn't take this class. The course is pretty easy, I'll give it that. All you need to do to succeed is study lecture slides before an exam and write two five page papers, so not bad. However, there's probably only 4 readings\/films that I find interesting, everything else is confusing or boring. The whole syllabus isn't very cohesive, so more often than not you'll be wondering why on earth you have to read what you have to read.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I didn't hate the class. I liked having to think a different way and learn about things I'd never been exposed to before. I became a better writer and more well read.",
    "Yup!",
    "I 100% would. A lot of people see this class as a gut writing credit, but really it's what you make of it. I learned so much in this class about such a wide variety of things, and I learned a lot about how to think about things in a lot of different fields. It's like, more than a class, it can be an overhaul of how you think about everything you come into contact with. I took this class out of desperation after a bad shopping period where I didn't get any seminar spots, but I am so glad I took it an recommend it to everyone."
