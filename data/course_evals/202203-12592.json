                "Weekly quizzes are ridiculous. The average is like 50/60 and super niche answers. Homweorks are awful. Super technical from like real physics textbooks and requires skills that are not taught at all in class. Disconnect with difficulty of homeworks and the rest of the class."

It teaches basic physics which is rare for a survey course so I was applying lots of my engineering knowledge in interesting ways",
                "Know what you are getting into; weekly mechanical engineering psets (where the physics and science on the pset are not taught in class but must be read from an energy physics textbook), bi-weekly quizzes (on the slides of the past two weeks and semi-random specific things within them), and a Tues-Thurs 9:00 am. If you love renewable energy, want to work in the industry, are comfortable with really quantitative stuff, and ok with a course that will be frustrating and hard at points but that is on an essential topic, go for it.",
