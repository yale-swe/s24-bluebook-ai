The specific articles chosen and the unit analyzing art both improved my ability to evaluate a topic or issue from several point of views, displaying the multitude of argument points thats could be taken regarding various art forms.",

A weakness was that during class discussions, there were oftentimes where a question would be asked, and the class was silent with no one answering until a new question was asked.",

Definitely take this class with Daniel Swain if possible (and if he continues teaching 114 in the following years). Great instructor, very chill and cooperative when it came to deadlines - also extremely knowledgeable and helpful as a mentor",

                "Yes, the structure made the class easy to learn and understandable. The readings were interesting and relevant to what we were supposed to be writing. The overall discussion that the instructor facilitated was lively and exciting.",
                "Yes, I would. I think that this course gave me a new perspective on the nature of work and labor which I will carry with me and I would recommend anyone who is interested in this."
