Now that we're (mostly) back in person, language classes can really emphasize off-the-cuff speaking rather than the pauses and delays that often happen over Zoom which give you some time to prepare. I learned to express nuanced thoughts about literature, art, and politics in Spanish and reach for other words when I couldn't remember a particular word in Spanish. I also grew as a writer and reader as we read a novel called Las Batallas."

But it was still manageable in the end.",
                "This is a great course with not many weaknesses. The only one I can think of is the amount of projects we were asked to do outside of class time. They became tedious at times due to the frequency with which we completed them.",
                "This class is interesting and we covered a lot of different grammar and vocabulary throughout the semester. The projects were interactive and engaging, but the course was very fast-paced and assignments were very long.",
                "This course is generally strong. It is really difficult but you get as much out of it as you put in and if you do all those assignments you will get a lot better at Spanish. Its biggest weakness is what the projects/homework emphasizes. I appreciate that daily homework ensures we practice daily and it was instrumental to improving as much as I did in Spanish. But, on more than one occasion, I had to redo an assignment because I hadn't fully understood the assignment. This felt unnecessary because I had learned Spanish in the earlier version of the assignment; I had worked on a new concept and learned new vocabulary and practiced different tenses. So then I was just spending hours of time because I wrote about \"xy\" rather than \"yx\" (obviously not real content). I think homework could focus more on the Spanish learned rather than the content discussed"
