AC\/DC circuits, Thevenin equivalents, RLC circuits, node\/loop analysis, impedance, op-amps, high\/low pass filters, transistors, diodes...\r\nThe lab that went along with this course also provided a place to learn how to build simple circuits and experience the different devices to learn how to analyze them in real life.",
    "I learned a lot of theoretical content about electrical engineering - I don't feel like I learned a lot of practical knowledge that is applicable to my major (ABET MechE), as we barely covered digital electronics. I also used how to use a breadboard. If you are interested in the theory behind a lot of electrical components, its a really useful class, but if you are more interested in the applications of EE in a more mechanical context, I wouldnt recommend taking this class (although honestly most probably wouldnt be taking this class if it wasnt required for a major).",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "By having the lectures before the labs, by not rushing through the lecture material, and by making the lab worksheets more understandable. The lack of clear instructions was particularly difficulty.",
    "The strength of this course is how well organized and structured it is.  I don't think there are any glaring weaknesses",
    "This course is comprehensive, and from the ground up, and continues through topics at a rather steady pace. This means that at the start it will be easy because the topics are often taught in high school and are relatively easy to understand. But as the course progresses, one covers the same amount of topics in the same time, though the topics may require significantly more thought to understand. Thus, it gets significantly harder as the course progresses, and may be improved by going more quickly at the start to have more time at the end.",
    "The strengths were that it had a good workload and the PSETS were very helpful. The peer tutors were incredible and extremely helpful. I enjoyed the professor a lot. The labs, however, were often confusing and I wish I had understood the concepts more before doing the lab.",
    "There probably could have been more guidance on labs 1,3 and 5.  Enjoyed the actual labs themselves though, just not the writeups",
    "Strengths of this course is that it will teach you everything you need to know about circuits and the introductions to electrical engineering.\r\n\r\nThe course is difficult. While Mark Reed is an adequate teacher, he somehow does not make the class as engaging as it should be. Additionally, he makes the midterm and final difficult in such a way that he tries to get a certain percentage of students to get A's, B's, and C's. I think that's messed up; the difficulty of the exams should be set at a reasonable level and if all students do very well, then so be it.",
    "Strengths - the labs give you some guidance with applications, the professor is reasonably excited about the class and will give you a lot of time\/help if you need it.\r\nWeaknesses - I feel like this wasnt focused enough on applications, sometimes the lectures would be too theoretical without enough examples which made weekly homework difficult, sometimes the labs were an excessive amount of work",
    "While the lectures of the class could be a little better and more engaging, ultimately I think that the rest of the course, (labs, study sessions) made up for this lack of engagingness during lectures.",
    "The course was difficult. There was also a fair amount of work with the labs on top of homework assignments.",
    "Gain a very strong understanding of founding electrical engineering principles.",
    "I'm not sure whether this is just a fault of the instructor, but I feel like what we learned in class was never applicable to the psets and I always found myself trying to learn from the textbook while doing my homework, or just find the most nearly-cheating formulas in it to plug in and get answers without learning. The tests were also weirdly calibrated, and neither produced a bell curve of scores; the first was too hard and the second was too easy (which I think is worse). Finally, the link between labs and class was not strong enough, either. And yes, another weakness of this class is that there are too many elements to fit into a single credit. Lectures, labs, psets, and exams, even though all were abbreviated, is still a bit too much stress. Expectations for lab reports seemed to be \"as long as possible\" and the best way to do them was just to plagiarize material from the textbook. (Proof: I did this for the last couple and got nearly perfect scores.) Lab handouts were written poorly and confusingly, sometimes had bad diagrams, and did not set clear expectations for lab reports, all of which put quite the burden on the TFs. Furthermore, it was perfectly OK in the fantasy-land of EE 200 to request students to revise and resubmit lab reports lest they risk getting points deducted for small mistakes that cascaded into larger issues. If you want to perpetuate grade inflation, just give overly generous partial credit!",
    "The material is interesting but I wished there were more office hours because sometimes the peer tutors did not explain material well",
    "Overall, the course was great. My only complaint is concerning the lab associated with the course. I was in the Monday lab section and if often turned out that we learned material for the lab that week after I already did the lab, making the lab very confusing because I had not learned the necessary material for it yet.",
    "This course was difficult but hard work definitely pays off.",
    "Lectures moved quickly but he is a good professor. I think he puts enough interactive questions and discussion in the lecture to make sure you grasp the concept. Lab wasn't helpful for the course necessarily, but it was helpful in general.",
    "This class is run incredibly well, with a great number of mentors and TAs to provide help, a great balance between psets and labs, and well written exams. This class doesn't need to change",
    "Strengths: classes very interesting and the professor is very knowledgeable. Very fair exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: its hard to learn a lot in 50 minutes. We are given basic examples and then the homeworks can have much harder ones. Apart from the course and psets, the labs were stupid hard. Not the actual lab but the lab reports. We were asked to do stuff we never did in class. I would spend so much time on them, neglecting other courses.",
    "This was a very good introductory course. The material covered in the labs matched really well with material covered in lecture, and also explored topics that built on material from lecture. The class slides were very useful as well, and the ability to access them online to study definitely helped. The only weakness for me was the fact that \"larger scale\" parts of electrical engineering like transformers, large scale power production and distribution, and similar topics weren't covered in as much depth as transistors and other small scale electrical components.",
    "The lab write ups are long and tedious and not very clear. The tests are pretty fair and if you understand the material youll be fine. A bit more outside material could help but over all well structured and straight forward.",
    "Strength: very good teaching, labs are usually enjoyable. Weaknesses: textbook is hard to find for cheap, and feedback for previous lab reports was delivered very late in the process therefore we could not use those when writing the next lab report.",
    "The lectures werent very descriptive and I didnt think the exams were fair for the amount of work that we did in the class. The labs were interesting and the TAs were nice.",
    "Strengths: Phenomenal lecturer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures are short and exams are more difficult than equivalent classes.",
    "Lectures are overly summarized sometimes.",
    "The labs were interesting and the material was relevant. I wish the exams would be longer since we would not be so rushed to finish them in the class time slot.",
    "I thought the lectures were really well done, but many of the labs were unclear. It was especially confusing because I attended the Monday lab, so I often did not understand anything that was happening because we had yet to learn about it in lecture.",
    "The class went by too fast, and the purpose of the labs wasn't appropriately explained by the TAs. The class should either cover less content or the classes should be longer to avoid having to cram so much information into such little time.",
    "Curriculum is very relevant and sells electrical engineering well as a field of study. Labs are tedious and don't always seem to add to classroom knowledge. Could be improved by adding more lecture time\/lessening lab time, and maybe trying harder to avoid rushing through content during short (50 min) lectures.",
    "I think the lectures arent taught well enough. I find myself having to relearn it while Im doing the homework. I also think that the labs have many problems with things being more difficult than they should be because of either wrong or subpar instructions.",
    "Strengths: great professor who teaches very clearly, flexible lab sessions that aren't too much strain on your schedule, great curves on the tests.\r\nWeaknesses: plan and simple this is a hard course, homework takes time, labs take time, there were two pop quizzes.",
    "The course could be improved by making the labs more interesting, consider ideas such as adding projects such as building a speaker to explain amplifiers.",
    "Labs in this course were pretty bad. They could have been very interesting and engaging but were often unclear and sometimes faulty. Especially lab 5 me and friends stayed up the whole night working on this lab report and the day it was due Prof Reed sent out some clarifications about this really complex derivation that we had to somehow do ourselves and then extended the deadline. We were very much just left on our own for the lab reports with no indication as to what steps to take for the derivations and how to approach them. It could also be good if the TA's were made to give a quick overview explaining the lab before we started it, so that we would understand what exactly we were trying to do beyond just the lab instructions. \r\n\r\nCourse could also focus a lot more on practical circuit building and standard circuits that one would use in electronic applications. Especially because this course is required for MechE majors, I think it would be in everyone's best interest to make it more practical and less involved with the finer points of EE theory. For example the chapter on digital logic and binary was super interesting but was literally covered in the last class and we had one problem on one pset in the entire course on this topic.",
    "The professor and the content are very engaging but the class is too heavily reliant on math and very long and convoluted derivations.",
    "Although I understand that there is a limited amount of time for in-class exams, I feel that almost all my classmates agreed that there should be more problems on each exam.",
    "I think the midterm and final exams are too short, and only 3 questions for a 50 minute exam makes it very easy to lose a lot of points if you get even one thing wrong.",
    "Problem sets that are more creative and like problems we would find at a job or in the world. Probelms that are also less dependent on mathematics or complex algebra and more focused on an understanding of the concepts."

   "comments": [
    "It is a major requirement for a lot of degrees. Also, the material covered is pretty cool.",
    "Yes for sure.  I took this class because I wanted to understand the basics of electronics for fun, and that is exactly what it provided.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to know more about circuits beyond what you learn in phys 181. The course is very challenging though for someone who doesn't have a natural intuition for this stuff.",
    "Yep, it's a good theoretical and practical introduction to EE. If you're and EE or ME major, it's required but I think it's good because electronics are so fundamental to engineering these days.",
    "Yes, if you want to be an engineer you have to take it!",
    "Yes, it is challenging but enjoyable.  Lecture was at some points hard to comprehend but for the most part very interesting.  Labs were enjoyable and actually did teach quite a bit as we problem solved on the fly.",
    "I would recommend class to any student who wants to learn more about circuits. While the class could be better structured to facilitate student learning, it is the only classes that teaches students about electrical engineering.",
    "If you are interested in a lot of theory about various electrical components\/basics of the theory behind electrical engineering (or if youre EE\/EECS\/ABET MechE), this class is for you! If none of these apply, its not an interesting enough class to be work the workload associated with it. There are weekly problem sets, and about five labs throughout the semester. Labs three and five last year were terrible and took somewhere around twenty hours to do. Mark Reed is an okay instructor, but I feel like he doesn't focus nearly enough on applications\/examples in his lecturing, which makes doing homework much more difficult.",
    "Yes, as this is a fundamental class to take when considering the basics of circuitry and electronics.",
    "Not unless it's required.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "Would only take this class if I had to, or if I were genuinely interested in basic electrical engineering, I would go in knowing that this is not an easy course.",
    "If you require it for the major, yes. But I don't know if its the best elective if you don't need it. It does take some time and you have to attend lecture.",
    "This course was fantastic, but I don't know if I would recommend it to anyone who won't need to take it for their major. An electricity and magnetism physics course is a better introduction to this material probably",
    "Yes, definitely. For an engineer, knowing how to do circuit analysis is very important. Also Mark Reed is an awesome instructor.",
    "I would recommend this class, it is a very approachable introduction, but there is enough material and it moves fast enough to keep the class interesting and fresh throughout the whole semester. The labs are neat.",
    "Yes! I am a mechanical engineering student with no specific interest in circuits and electronics and I found it very enjoyable and useful. Basic understanding of circuits is important in a lot of engineering applications and laboratory equipment etc. So if you are an engineer or scientist, it is likely that you will have to deal with electronics at some point in your academic life. Take this class, it is taught well and the material is interesting enough. Also it is required for ABET Mech Engineering.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone extremely interested in circuits and willing to do some work on their own to solidify their knowledge of the material.",
    "If students want to know anything about electronics, this class is a must.",
    "Yes. It teaches the fundamentals needed to understand electrical systems.",
    "I would recommend this class because it teaches a lot of very important concepts about electronics that are especially applicable given todays world.",
    "If they were very interested in the material.",
    "Yes, I found it very interesting and engaging. However, I probably wouldnt recommend it unless it was required because the lab is extremely time consuming.",
    "I wouldn't simply because it was one of my more stressful classes, and I didn't start to enjoy it until the end when the concepts started making more sense.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in potentially studying electrical engineering this course does a great job of giving a taste of the subject. If you are interested in other types of STEM and simply want to broaden your horizons this course is also very fitting.",
    "I would, only if they were prepared for the workload.",
    "I'm a unique case. I'm a senior who's not majoring in electrical engineering, and I took this course just because of academic interest. For those in a similar situation, evaluate whether or not you have the capacity to add this course into your semester schedule. It will take time and the concepts\/calculations taught in this course aren't always the easiest. It's definitely manageable as a non-EE major, but make sure you'll have enough time in your semester schedule to fit in the time this course will take. Other than that, this was a great introduction to EE. The professor was especially great since class always makes the material very understandable.",
    "Only if you are highly interested in circuits or if it is required for your major.",
    "Unless you are determined to pursue electrical engineering, this course will discourage you, but I believe EE is a lot more fun than what this course portrays.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student in the electrical engineering major.",
    "It's probably required for your major, but if it's not then I don't think the course as it currently stands is worth it. You won't learn about practical electronics and making circuits \/ programming microcontrollers or things for projects. Take it if you're interested in electrical engineering and are considering EE as a potential major.",
    "Yes it was very fun, but I would warn them of the workload and heavy mathematical analysis.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes if they have a love of electronics and would like to spend time building circuits."
