                "This class taught me a lot of radio history, from the beginnings of the medium to the golden age to the modern versions of pirate and community radio. Included in those histories are ways of being critical of historical and modern capitalism and of analyzing the power of a specific medium (media studies, in this case radio and sound studies). There are so many ways that radio as a medium can be and have been used to amplify and manifest democracy, and that's a powerful message to learn about in a modern context.",

I gained an appreciation for the medium of radio from many different and often unexpected angles: technological, aesthetic, sonic, political, racial, gender, rural vs. urban, class, etc. And I learned about marginalized aspects of American history where radio pioneers and political rebels used radio for political ends, such as black civil rights activist Robert F. William, who blasted radio messages of self-defense and liberation from Cuba to the U.S. after being hunted by the CIA.",
                "I learned a lot about radio history and specifically intersections in media and gender, race, social situation, technology, art/culture. I also learned more about how to research and how to incorporate my own voice and opinion into writing."

                "Strengths: Incredibly engaging content! All of the Stuff we learned about was so so fascinating, and even though a lot of it is pretty niche, it has a lot of relevant applications to thinking about the current media landscape. The assignments are flexible and interesting and draw on rich, quirky archives. \r\nWeakness: The seminar style of this class largely depended on whether the class was chatty/did the reading that week. Prof. Kane is super flexible and chill and is willing to cater the class to students' interests, but in weeks when we weren't On It, the discussion stalled a bit. But even when he just lectured at us, the content was still really interesting.",

                "The course offers a reasonable level of freedom and flexibility in what you write about and focus on, based on a high amount of trust in students to engage actively and bring in their own interests and curiosity, and I think the model really works well for the material.",
                "It was more people than I think for a seminar and I think it was more presented as a lecture so I engaged less than I thought I would because I thought it would be more discussion driven. I think also sometimes it was a bit too much reading and sometimes I couldn't finish the books or we did not really discuss in depth about readings which I would have liked. I did like the content and the lay out of the different topics. I also liked bringing things on and I loved the final project as we got to engage in real time with radio. I also liked the openness of the paper topics. I also liked when the doc speaker was brought in."

My favorite part about the class was really the \"fringe\" part of this course; we incorporated a lot of topics of women and people of color (the presence and more often lack thereof), community radio, pirate radio, practices by internationals (border blasters). We also get to create a radio show at the end of the course; and overall, this course was a blast!",

Or, the Negotiation of Masculinity via Wilderness Radio in the 1920s.\" ADDITIONALLY, MY GROUP AND I CREATED AN ORIGINAL PIECE OF RADIO PROGRAMMING FOR THE CLASS. \r\n\r\nWhat more is to be said?\r\n\r\nTHIS CLASS IS A GIFT UPON GOD'S GREEN EARTH, A REMEDY FOR HUMAN IMMORALITIES, A (NON-FDA-APPROVED) CURE FOR MOST ILLNESSES (goat doctors). I HAD SO MUCH FUN AND YOU WILL TOO (if this class is taught again... sniffle...).",
