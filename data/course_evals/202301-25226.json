They are incredibly good at guiding conversations and putting forward relavant insightful observations as well as asking questions. Heidegger says in the beginning of \"The Questioning Concerning Technology\" that \"Questioning builds a way. We would be advised, therefore, above all to pay heed to the way, and not to fix our attention on isolated sentences and topics. The way is a way of thinking. All ways of thinking, more or less perceptibly, lead through language in a manner that is extraordinary.\" I feel this accurately describes their philosophy of asking questions (in seminars).",
