                "This course was great, all of the code needed to complete homeworks and the midterm were provided in lecture, and each problem set was helpful in facilitating the learning of the course while giving students the ability to attempt coding without being directly walked through it.",
                "While the lecture only meets once a week, it is a very engaging and interactive few hours of class. It is evident that Professor Meyers put in quite a bit of work to make sure that our virtual classes were still classes that one could look forward to on a weekly basis. In terms of weakness, I personally believe that it would be beneficial if more of the course focused on predictive models and even some Machine Learning. However, I do understand that this course is intended to be introductory so the pace of the class was understandable.",
                "It was a super interesting class. Tackled a lot of fun baseball questions. It does skew towards people who love baseball, and you talk a lot about the sport. But it's accessible to all.",
                "Labs well structured and clear, although the coding practice in class could've been organized better.",
                "I think this course was structured very well. Each week coincided with a chapter of the required reading, and each week flowed well from one to the next.",

Additionally, Professor Meyers was incredibly accommodating and allows students to perform problem sets in either the Datascience or Pandas package. Overall, if you are someone who wants a more python focused data science class with a very thoughtful, committed professor, this is a great course for you to take.",
