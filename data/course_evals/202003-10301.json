We did so by considering questions of 'publicness,' audience, and voice. By reading and critically responding to a variety of texts, you learn what the architecture of public-facing work is and what tools writers employ to reach that design. Collaborations with the Yale Prison Education Initiative were eye-opening and a fantastic addition to this course. Through that opportunity and with the midterm paper assignment, this course provides you with an understanding on how to bring yourself to the page. A useful experience for cultivating shared forms of knowledge production, the final project allowed us to explore topics of our interest and to collaboratively make a zine!",

                "Strengths: Guest speakers, YPEI collaborations, class blog, & Professor Mirakhor's syllabus, insights, and voice. Prof Mirakhor enriches seminar discussion in insightful ways and *actually* reads student discussion posts! Weaknesses: n\/a",
                "strengths: The readings on the syllabus were amazing and thought-provoking; they come from a range of perspectives and genres. Professor Mirakhor is incredible, and she really pushes her students to think deeper and more critically about the material, the purposes of public writing, the relationship between writing, organizing, and activism, and what we intend to do with our Yale education\/ the ethics of being a part of this institution. Although I really wished I could have experienced this class in person, the small seminar format allowed for individualized learning, and was an enriching part of my semester. The benefit of zoom was that we could engage with different guest speakers and have joint classes with Professor HoSang's Community Organizing class. In light of the pandemic, Mirakhor demonstrated a sincere care for our well-being, and was flexible and gracious. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: zoom fatigue of course",
                "A strength of this course was that it allowed for in depth evaluations of the readings, and the times we got to speak with the authors were especially illuminating. A weakness might have been an overall lack of engagement with the course likely largely due to the online format and difficulty of small seminars over zoom",
                "The readings are incredibly interesting and Professor Mirakhor does a great job of encouraging the students to try and think deeper about what author's are trying to convey and how they do so."
