                "I took this class as a pianist, and learned and accompanied 37 - thirty seven! - songs over the course of the semester with various singers in the class.",

                "Strength: feedback is immediate and understandable. There are lots of opportunities to improve, and lots of outside help (Prof. Lallis office hours and coaching with Sarah). \r\n\r\nWeakness: the communication could be improved in this class. Sometimes, it wasnt clear which songs we were supposed to be singing in class, or in the concerts.",
                "This course is the perfect course for people looking to improve solo voice performance. The strengths were the fact that you are just constantly learning and expanding your rep. The weakness was probably the occasional busy work we had. It wasn't that big of a deal ever but felt occasionally pointless.",
                "I liked that the emphasis was really on learning repertoire, while other aspects of the course were supplementary.  I enjoyed the drop-the-needle quizzes  it was a good way for me to get familiar with a lot of art songs other than the ones I had chosen to learn.  I also liked that most of the classes were run studio-class-style, with each student performing the song they had learned that week and then getting comments on it.  I sometimes felt like I didn't gain a whole lot from the comments that were given to me or to other people.  Sometimes they were helpful, but sometimes I felt like the things that I was actually struggling with in the piece were ignored in favor of other less important details.  I would've generally liked to have been held to a higher standard  I really wanted to take this class as an opportunity to improve as a vocalist, but instead it felt a bit like all I was doing was learning repertoire.",
                "It could do with more even distribution of concerts across the semester so as to alleviate some accelerated stress.",
                "The strength of the class is simply to learn a ton of rep, which I think is super helpful for the development of young singers/pianists.",
                "Strengths: this course is a joy to attend and is effective in achieving the student's goals. \r\nWeaknesses: Nothing comes to mind, so why make something up?"
