                "I learned how to apply economic concepts on a larger scale, modeling economic growth in both the long-run (Solow Model) and short-run. This course teaches both the principles of macroeconomics as well as more modern issues, like the government budget and the implications of cryptocurrency, while still being an engaging, well-paced course. We cover some more quantitative theories, but this course overall stresses an understanding of broad concepts over specific equations.",
                "I was surprised by how much I loved this class, and its 100% a testament to Professor Amand. I feel like I gained a strong foundational understanding of macroeconomics, the macroeconomic concepts I read about in the news, the financial crisis, the idea of central banks, etc. However, I also gained a really strong interest in macroeconomics, which is just something I have not ever been interested in (and for which I have never had any kind of talent). This class really did feel like a history or global affairs social science class, but I walked away feeling like I had a strong grasp of the basics of macro, grounded not in memorization or formulas, but in logic and history.",
                "Learned about banking inflation and how financial crises happen",

                "I developed a really well rounded but also detailed understanding about Macroeconomics.",
                "Cool oversight over macro economics. Its stuff like banking, recessions, etc. that everyone should know to be informed about society.",
                "Very strong foundation of macroeconomics and economic theory, with Central Banking and Monetary Policy being some of the more prominent themes in the course.",
                "I developed skills in macroeconomic analysis. Some of the work we did involve quantitative analysis, but the majority of our work was qualitative. I definitely think this course is applicable to the real world and gave me new perspectives and context in analyzing the world around me.",
                "How macroeconomic trends operate, a basic understanding of the banking system, and how to have informed discussions about topics like GDP",
                "Learned a great deal about the macroeconomy. Banks, recessions booms. Really useful class",

                "The lecture slides could be put up sooner.",
                "Professor Amand's lecture style is engaging and fun, and I was excited for lecture every week. He consistently had issues with technology, which was mildly distracting at worst, but could easily be improved.",
                "Strengths: Professor Amand is great; he's a very engaging lecturer, always taking questions and keeping everyone interested. The structure of the course (one Pset per week) allows you to balance the workload. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much feedback on the Psets, although the solutions were always posted, which was great. The quizzes on Canvas assess your understanding of the textbook, but I felt there was a bit of a disconnect between the quizzes and lectures. Also, the course only has one midterm, so I found the lack of opportunities for feedback a bit difficult at times. \r\n\r\nThe course is great as is, but adding more opportunities for feedback would be helpful, especially studying for the final.",
                "I can honestly think of zero weaknesses. This class is excellent. I was not fantastic at it by any meansI am very much not an econ brobut Prof. Amand makes everything so logical and contextualizes everything. Also, I personally struggle to pay attention and learn in lecture courses, and I really, really did not like the Intro Micro lecture I took first year. This small seminar\/lecture format was perfect because I actually felt comfortable asking questions! I dont think I asked a single question in either of my lecture courses this semester, and I certainly wouldnt have asked any in a macro lecture. But even though we had some econ bros in class, I still felt totally comfortable raising my hand to ask a question if I was confused or curious, and more importantly, to try answering a question even if I thought I may be wrong. Also, the psets being for completion meant that I felt I engaged a lot more with the ideas than if I was just stressed out about always getting the exact right answer. A friend of mine and I would work on them together, and neither of us are gifted at this, so we would really just sit there and bounce ideas off each other, so I felt we arrived at the concepts in a more helpful and logical way.",
                "Strengths - really have to work out the psets yourself \/ with friends and not at office hours, so you really end up learning the material well",
                "I don't like blindly following the textbook, so the readings did help me stay engaged. They also help you dive deeper. Taking the seminar version of intro macro is better because you get to ask more questions, know the professor, receive more feedback. This is not a \"discussion\" class -- you don't sit at a round table and talk. It is virtually the same as the lecture version. I personally wouldn't have wanted to \"discuss\" the whole time. At least for an intro macro class, it is better to sit and learn and ask questions and read and ask more questions.",
                "the strength was the professor, Professor Amand is an incredible professor that is so intriguing and knowledgable about the subject.",
                "Seminar much better than lecture from what Ive heard! Prof Amand was also very good, and the course was well organized.",
                "The application of macroeconomic concepts to real world events kept me engaged and helped me to better understand the concepts.",
                "Excellent job in using real world examples as opposed to hypotheticals to allow for students to better relate to or understand the concepts. No real criticisms, in all honesty.",
                "This course is well-structured. Lectures are organized and it's easy to stay on track in the course if you go to class. The workload is not anything out of the ordinary and problem sets are especially helpful in learning course concepts. There is a curve as with the other courses in the econ department, which can create a more stressful and competitive learning environment.",
                "The biggest strength of this class is undoubtedly the \"leminar\" format. This made the class enjoyable and deeply engaging. It was also helpful in holding me accountable  it's super easy to zone out in a massive lecture, but you have to be on your game in a smaller class setting. Professor Amand is also by far the best econ professor I've had at Yale. He's deeply knowledgable and willing to go on tangents to entertain student questions, but prevents the class from going off track too much.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I could think of is that it was sometimes difficult to participate, since there were some people who would respond to just about every question. Professor Amand is great at recognizing this and calling on new people whenever possible, though, so this shouldn't be too much of a problem as long as you aren't deterred from raising your hand.",
                "I loved every aspect of this class. TAKE THE SEMINAR! It is taught really well. The only weakness is that our psets are not graded for correctness but completion. This is fine, but towards the end of the semester, the student graders stopped telling us if the answer was right or wrong. Because some of the topics are fairly qualitative, that would have been useful to know",
                "Strength of the class is the professor! Marnix is such a great prof and super willing to help, esp if you go to his office hours. Also, the problem sets are super important as they are literally made up of old exam questions so make sure to actually spend time on them, it will pay off on the exams. Weakness is there are no TAs\/section so not that much outside help. But like I mentioned, Marnix is very helpful during his OH and will answer all questions. The canvas quizzes sometimes asked questions that were beyond what we were taught in the classroom (came from the textbook, I believe) which was frustrating sometimes because they were tough!",

It's a great introduction, not too heavy but also touching on important subjects, such as central bank digital currencies and the financial crisis of 2008. It's a really solid introduction and fascinating course overall.",
                "Definitely, Marnix Amand is a great professor and taught the material very well. He taught the course in a way that you could simply pay attention in class and be able to understand all the necessary material which I really appreciate.",
                "Yes! Take! This! Course! If you need to\/want to take Intro Macro or just want to get a better sense of what youre reading in the newspaper, I cant imagine doing better than Prof. Amand. Especially if youre like me and dont thrive in a lecture format, this class is perfect. Prof. Amand makes it feel like a super relevant course in history or international relations.",
                "Yes much better than the lecture",

                "Yes! Stuff everyone at Yale should learn, and to me much more fun than micro. Taking the seminar version is definitely the move.",

                "Yes, I would recommend this course if you are interested in economic principles, especially macroeconomics. The workload is not too bad and it counts as a social science credit. You need micro as a prereq, so you may only be taking this course if you test out of intro micro, or if you're an econ major.",
                "Yes -- especially if you need to take macro, this class is the way to go rather than the lecture. Even if you don't need the credit, though, this class will deepen your understanding of just about every political issue, so I would still recommend taking it.",
                "Yes! AMAZING course. And take the seminar.",
                "Yes I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to learn about the basics of macroeconomics!",
