However, the content of readings and class discussions were very low-level and uninteresting (even for those with only a basic knowledge of UN\/humanitarian\/dev topics)",
                "A basic understanding of the operating bodies of the UN",
                "I learnt about the structure of the UN as well as the UNs implementation of projects on the ground. It was insightful learning about the lesser-known, developmental aspects and work of the UN beyond just the UNSC and UNGA.",

                "The course was useful in providing insights to the inner workings of the UN. In the future, I hope the professor provides a clearer rubric for what she wants for each assignment. The assignment expectations were often unclear so students do not do well on them. Since the class is a seminar I wish there was also more discussion amongst the students. The class felt like a lecture most of the time.",
                "The professor is an admirable person who can provide interesting behind the scenes stories. I do think the lecture itself could have been more interesting, but I'm sure it will improve over time."
