The second half, however, I thought was a little slow. Assessments were also too infrequent to keep me accountable for staying sharp on the grammar and vocab.",

                "Love the content hate the format",
                "I really appreciated the second half of the semester and all the work we did with actual translationsit really helped solidify the main concepts",
                "The lectures and practice with grammar was great. The translation work on Shipwrecked Sailor was enjoyable although the group work was sometimes unnecessary since usually many people hadn't done the homework. The emphasis on parsing and understanding verbal forms was very useful for Egyptian. I think it would have been useful to have more structure to learning vocabulary. I think by the end of the class, vocabulary was definitely the main obstacle for translation. The Met trip was certainly worth it because it was great to see the hard work of the semester pay off by being able to translate a specific object, and to some extent to sight read, especially the htp-dj-nswt formulas, and also to see the language more in its historical context and how that changed over time. The class as a whole was very well organized in Canvas. It was always easy to see what the topics would be or what the homework is.",
                "This course was great. It was organized in a way that made learning this very difficult ancient language largely approachable and it was always a fairly interesting course. All the assessments were fair and were as expected. It was really cool to learn how to decode ancient texts and artifacts. I don't really think there were any real weaknesses."
