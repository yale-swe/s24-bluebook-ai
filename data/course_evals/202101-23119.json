By this semester, you learn pretty much all you need to actually start reading texts and it's so much fun. The language is very interesting and the translation assignments felt more like solving puzzles sometimes than school work."

Professor Chantrain is very accommodating and wants her students to learn. Weakness: The difficulty level of texts that we read was high especially coming out of a break. I wish we would have started off with easier texts before moving on to more difficult ones.",

Her dedication to our learning was forefront and you could feel how much she cares about her students and loves the subject. The focus of the class on the application of the grammar to reading various texts really helped me practice and feel confident in my translation skills. I especially liked following along with Sinuhe and the discussions we had about its larger themes.\r\n\r\nI do not see much that can be improved. This class was exceptional.",

Being able to then return to the main session to go over what we worked on was a useful exercise."

Additionally, there are many interesting discussions that evolve from these longer pieces that give insight into Middle Egyptian culture. It was super fun and rewarding. Professor Chantrain was also the best! She brightened up the early mornings and was extremely passionate about Egyptian. I thoroughly enjoyed the extra nuances she would address and attention to which we gave each particular construction. This class is awesome!",
