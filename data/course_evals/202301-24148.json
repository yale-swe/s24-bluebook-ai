                "I think this course covers very interesting subject matter, and I like the different lenses that are used to look at the study of anthropology in Africa and how it can be alienating to African peoples. The structure of this course was challenging for facilitating student learning because the readings, and how we were prompted to engage with them, did not facilitate much seminar-like discussion. Additionally, while the classes where we had a sort of hybrid lecture seminar format improved upon this, the lectures did not go very far beyond the readings. I think if maybe there were broad overarching questions that guided discussion and\/or class discussion was intermixed with lecture (pausing to discuss in small groups or as a class within the lecture) that might better serve this course.",

                "I would not recommend this course as it is currently structured. Unfortunately, I think that the format of this course left most students disengaged with the work and information. I also think that, while the readings were very interesting and the subject matter important for both anthropology and African studies, the class itself did little to engage us beyond these readings. The course as a whole felt disjointed and unorganized in a way that left me wondering what I had learned.",
